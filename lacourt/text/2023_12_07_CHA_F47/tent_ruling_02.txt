SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises from a traffic collision that occurred
on 3/18/22 at approximately 12:20 p.m. on Roscoe Blvd. in Northridge,
California.  It appears that Plaintiffs Yevgeniya
Vanyan, Gohar Mkrtchyan, and Sanasar Grbashyan (Plaintiffs) allege the accident
occurred because Defendant August Roa made an unsafe lane change.  
 
On 7/24/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendants August Roa (Roa) and Noellie Ledesma Fields (Fields) for: (1) Motor
Vehicle Negligence; (2)   General
Negligence; (3) Negligence Per Se (Vehicle Code 22107, 22350, 20001); (4)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (Violation of Vehicle Code 20001 –
Hit-and-Run); and (5) Malice and Oppression. 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues Roa had with
the complaint, on 10/2/23, Roa filed and served the instant demurrer to the 3rd,
4th and 5th causes of action and motion to strike certain
portions of Plaintiffs’ complaint regarding punitive damages and the 3rd,
4th and 5th causes of action.  (See Nelson Decl.).  Plaintiffs have filed a combined opposition
to the demurrer and motion to strike and Roa has filed a reply to the
opposition.  
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
In the opposition, Plaintiffs concede that that their 3rd
and 5th causes of action should be stricken and otherwise oppose the
demurrer and motion to strike as to the 4th cause of action and
claim for punitive damages.  (See
Opposition, p.1:24-28, p.2:21-25).  
 
The elements of a cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotion distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the
defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the
probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering
severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of
the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct.  See Potter (1993) 6 C4th 965,
1001.  For conduct to be considered outrageous
it must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a
civilized community and the defendant must have engaged in conduct intended to
inflict injury or engaged in conduct with the realization that injury will
result.  Id.; Berkley
(2007) 152 CA4th 518, 533-534; Chang (2009) 172 CA4th 67, 86.
 
Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to
support a finding that Roa’s conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed
all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community and/or that Roa
intended to inflict injury or engaged in conduct with the realization that
injury would result.  Plaintiffs merely
allege that Roa made an unsafe lane change and failed to immediately stop his
vehicle after the collision as required by law. 
Additionally, Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to show
that they suffered the type of severe or extreme emotional distress necessary
to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.    
 
Similarly, Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient
facts to establish that Roa is guilty of fraud, oppression or malice in order
to state a claim for punitive damages.  See
Civil Code 3294; G.D. Searle & Company (1977) 49 CA3d 22; Dawes
(1980) 111 CA3d 82; Brousseau (1977) 73 CA3d 864, 872.
 
Given the liberal policy of allowing leave to amend and
since this is only the original complaint, the Court finds that Plaintiffs
should have the opportunity to try to cure these defects in their pleading. 
 
Roa includes paragraphs 37 and 39 in his motion to
strike.  The Court finds those paragraphs
do not include any improper allegations relating to intentional infliction of
emotional distress or punitive damages.  
 
The Court notes that the end of the memorandum of points
and authorities for the demurrer argue that all of Plaintiffs’ causes of action
are inadequate as to Defendant Noellie Ledesma Fields.  (See Demurrer, p.8:3-11).  However, neither the notice of demurrer nor
notice of motion to strike indicate that they are being made on behalf of this
defendant.  (See Demurrer, p.1:27;
Motion to Strike, p.1:27).  Further, the
demurrer only addresses the 3rd, 4th and 5th
causes of action as to Defendant August Roa. 
(See Demurrer, p.3:1-22). 
The reply also indicates that it is made on behalf of Roa.  Therefore, neither the demurrer nor the
motion to strike was properly made on behalf of Defendant Noellie Ledesma
Fields and the ruling does not apply to that defendant.   
   
CONCLUSION
 
Based on Plaintiffs’ concession that the Court strike the
3rd and 5th causes of action, the demurrer by Defendant
August Roa to those causes of action is sustained without leave to amend.  The demurrer by Defendant August Roa to the 4th
cause of action is sustained with 30 days leave to amend.  To the extent the motion to strike is not
rendered moot by the ruling on the demurrer, it is denied as to paragraphs 37
and 39 and otherwise granted with 30 days leave to amend.
