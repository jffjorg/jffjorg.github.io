And here is the English summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant August Roa. The case arises from a traffic collision on March 18, 2022, involving Defendant Roa and Plaintiffs Yevgeniya Vanyan, Gohar Mkrtchyan, and Sanasar Grbashyan. The Plaintiffs alleged that Defendant Roa made an unsafe lane change and failed to immediately stop his vehicle after the collision, causing emotional distress.

The Judge sustained the demurrer to the 3rd and 5th causes of action without leave to amend, and sustained the demurrer to the 4th cause of action with 30 days leave to amend. The Judge also granted the motion to strike certain portions of the Plaintiffs' complaint regarding punitive damages, but denied the motion to strike paragraphs 37 and 39. The Judge found that the Plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and punitive damages. The Plaintiffs are given the opportunity to try to cure these defects in their pleading.
