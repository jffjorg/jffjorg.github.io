  Case Number:  22CHCV00583    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  F47 Dept. F47
Date: 12/7/23                                               TRIAL
DATE: 4/22/24
Case #22CHCV00583
 
MOTION TO
CONTINUE TRIAL
 
Motion filed on 11/13/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Robert E. Thomas, Jr. dba Bob
Thomas Insurance Agency
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff William Hewitt dba Hewitt
Construction
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order: (1) continuing the
4/22/24 trial date and all related deadlines, including discovery and
dispositive motion deadlines to 10/21/24, or to a date thereafter commensurate
with the availability of the Court; (2) continuing the Final Status Conference
to 10/11/24 (or to a date satisfactory to the Court close to the requested
date); (3) deeming the continued trial date to be the “initial trial date” for
purposes of establishing discovery and expert-related cutoffs such that all
discovery and expert-related cutoffs would occur in the context of the
continued trial date; and (4) continuing the Mandatory Settlement Conference to
a date after 9/19/24.
 
RULING: The motion is granted.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 8/1/22, Plaintiff William Hewitt dba William
Construction  (Plaintiff) filed this
action against various defendants, including Defendant Robert E. Thomas, Jr.
dba Bob Thomas Insurance Agency (Thomas), a now-retired insurance broker, asserting
negligent and intentional conduct that allegedly left Plaintiff without
necessary insurance coverage for a construction project-related lawsuit.
 
During the 7/27/23 status conference, this Court
scheduled the Mandatory Settlement Conference for 2/26/24, the Final Status
Conference for 4/12/24 and the Jury Trial for 4/22/24.  (See 7/27/23 Minute Order).  Soon thereafter, Thomas’ counsel learned that
before this action was filed Thomas had scheduled a global voyage with his wife
from December 2023 to mid-September 2024. 
(See Dunkerly Decl.; Thomas Decl.).  On 8/10/24, Thomas’ counsel began attempts to
obtain a stipulation to continue the trial date; however, Plaintiff’s counsel
has refused to agree to continue the trial until October 2024.  (Dunkerly Decl.; Fierman-Cribbs Decl.).
 
Therefore, on 11/13/23, Thomas filed and electronically served
the instant motion seeking an order: (1) continuing the 4/22/24 trial date and
all related deadlines, including discovery and dispositive motion deadlines to
10/21/24, or to a date thereafter commensurate with the availability of the
Court; (2) continuing the Final Status Conference to 10/11/24 (or to a date
satisfactory to the Court close to the requested date); (3) deeming the
continued trial date to be the “initial trial date” for purposes of
establishing discovery and expert-related cutoffs such that all discovery and
expert-related cutoffs would occur in the context of the continued trial date;
and (4) continuing the Mandatory Settlement Conference to a date after 9/19/24.  Plaintiff has opposed the motion.  Thomas has filed a reply to the opposition. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court has the authority and discretion to continue
the trial date upon a showing of good cause. 
See CCP 128(a)(8); CRC 3.1332(c); Foster (1973) 142 CA3d
444, 448.  Good cause includes the
unavailability of a party because of excusable circumstances.  CRC 3.1332(c)(2).  Other factors to consider in determining
whether to grant a trial continuance include: (1) The proximity of the trial
date; (2) Whether there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or
delay of trial due to any party; (3) The length of the continuance requested;
(4) The availability of alternative means to address the
problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a continuance; (5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for
that status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid
delay; (7) The court's calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on
other pending trials; (8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9)
Whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance;
(10) Whether the interests of justice are best served by
a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions on the
continuance; and (11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair
determination of the motion or application. 
CRC 3.1332(d).
 
Here, Thomas will not be available for trial due to his
travel plans which were made before this action was filed.  (See Thomas Decl.).  Thomas has shown that his presence at trial
is essential to his defense.  (See
Dunkerly Decl. ¶26).  Many of the factors
set forth in CRC 3.1332(d) also weigh in favor of granting the requested
continuance.  
 
The current trial date is just over four months
away.  There have been no previous trial
continuances.  Thomas requests an
approximate six-month continuance.  The
only alternative to address the problem would be to force Thomas to cancel a
costly, once in a lifetime vacation which was planned before this action was
filed.  Thomas will suffer significant
prejudice if the relief is not granted – he will either not be present for
trial or have to cancel his vacation.  As
set forth below, Plaintiff’s claim that he will suffer extreme prejudice if the
relief is granted is not adequately supported. 
Similarly, it seems that the interests of justice will be served by the
continuance.  
 
Plaintiff’s prejudice argument is confusing.  Plaintiff’s counsel states that discovery has
commenced; however, there are issues to be worked out regarding a Stipulation
and Protective Order and no depositions have been taken.  (Fierman-Cribbs Decl. ¶7).  Plaintiff’s counsel also notes that a motion
for summary judgment, by other defendants, is set for hearing on 1/3/24 and
claims that his ability to conduct discovery to oppose that motion will somehow
be impeded if this motion is granted.  (Id.
¶¶7-8).  Plaintiff’s opposition to the
1/3/24 motion for summary judgment is due on or before 12/20/23.  CCP 437c(b)(2).  Plaintiff fails to explain what discovery
will be or will not be able to be completed by 12/19/23, if this motion is
granted on 12/7/23.  Further, Plaintiff’s
counsel fails to explain why/how the entire action will be stalled if the
motion is granted.  (See
Fierman-Cribbs Decl. ¶¶8-9).  
 
 
Finally, if it was not for the mistake, inadvertence and
excusable neglect of Thomas and/or his counsel in failing to raise the issue of
his unavailability at the 7/27/23 Case Management Conference, the Court would
have set the trial date to accommodate Thomas’ vacation plans at that time.
 
Plaintiff’s request to continue the summary judgment
scheduled for 1/3/24, if this motion is granted, is denied without
prejudice.  As noted above, Plaintiff has
failed to show how granting this motion will impede his ability to oppose that
motion.  If Plaintiff wishes to seek a
continuance of the 1/3/24 motion, he may do so by a proper application under
CCP 437c(h).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
