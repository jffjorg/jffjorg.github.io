And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling grants Tesla, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration. The motion was made in response to Charles George's lawsuit alleging violations of the Song Beverly Act. Tesla argued that the parties entered into a valid arbitration agreement through the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (MVOA) and the Lease Agreement. The Court found that the arbitration clauses in both agreements clearly apply to Plaintiff's claims under Song Beverly. As Plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, the Court granted Tesla's motion to compel arbitration. The Court also issued a stay on the case pending arbitration and scheduled a status conference for January 28, 2025.
