ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Erika
Gomez Sandoval (Sandoval) and Francisco Salazar (Salazar) (collectively
Plaintiffs) bring this action against American Honda Motor Company, Inc.
(Honda). Plaintiffs allege that Honda sold them a defective 2019 Honda Odyssey
(Subject Vehicle) and thereafter refused to repurchase the vehicle in violation
of the Song-Beverly Act. 
 
Before
the Court is a motion to compel further responses Plaintiffs’ Request for the
Production of Documents (RFPD) Set Two. Honda opposes the motion. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A motion
to compel further responses to RFPD may be brought based on: (1) incomplete
statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or incomplete claims of
inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(C.C.P. § 2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion
to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See C.C.P. §
2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing that there
“a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the discovery sought
will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence
that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.”  
 
If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) 
 
“The
court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden,
expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood
that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”
(C.C.P. § 2017.020(a).) Generally, objections on the ground of burden require
the objecting party to produce evidence of (a) the propounding party’s
subjective intent to create burden or (b) the amount of time and effort it
would take to respond. (See West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v.
Superior Court In and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.)
However, no such evidence is necessary where discovery is obviously overbroad
on its face. (See Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424,
431.)  
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Plaintiffs’ Request 
 
Plaintiffs seek further
production regarding their RFPD Nos. 10, 14, 23, 24, 33, 37, 46, 47, 56, 60,
69, 70, 79, 83, 92, 93, 102, 106, 115 and 116. The content of these RFPD are as
follows: 
 
RFPD Nos. 10, 14, 23, 24, and 33 ask for all documents related to
Suspension Defects in vehicles of the same Make, model, and year as the Subject
Vehicle.
 
RFPD Nos. 33, 37, 46, and 47 ask for all documents related to
Engine Defects in vehicles of the same Make, model, and year as the Subject
Vehicle.
 
RFPD Nos. 56, 60, 69, and 70 ask for all documents related to
Transmission Defects in vehicles of the same Make, model, and year as the Subject
Vehicle.
 
RFPD Nos. 79, 83, 92, and 93 ask for all documents related to
Electrical Defects in vehicles of the same Make, model, and year as the Subject
Vehicle.
 
RFPD nos. 102, 106, 115 and 116 ask for all documents related to
Structural Defects in vehicles of the same Make, model, and year as the Subject
Vehicle. 
 
Honda objects to each of
these RFPD on identical grounds, albeit with reference to the particular defect
requested in each. Honda objects (1) that information pertaining to other
vehicles is not discoverable as it is irrelevant to this litigation, and (2)
that the various phrases used to describe the defects are vague and overly
broad. 
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Upon
review, the Court finds the meet and confer efforts sufficient. (Grigoryan
Decl. ¶¶ 20-24, Exhs. 5-8.)
Good Cause 
 
To determine whether responses
can be compelled the Court must first determine if Plaintiffs have shown good
cause. Plaintiffs submit the declaration of their counsel, Chris Grigoryan,
which attaches the Vehicle Repair History for the Subject Vehicle and a
Technical Service Bulletin (“TSB”) issued by Honda. (Grigoryan Decl. Exhs. 1
& 2.) 
 
A review of the Vehicle
Repair History shows Plaintiffs’ vehicle presented with a variety of issues
including: (1) shifting irregularly, (2) issues with the braking pedals, (3)
issues with the car autonomously braking, (4) random jerking on acceleration.
(Grigoryan Decl. Exh. 1.) Plaintiffs also state the attached TSB is issued by
Honda and acknowledges the existence of cylinder misfire defect in vehicles
like the Subject Vehicles. (Grigoryan Decl. ¶ 14, Exh. 2.) 
 
The Court finds the above
demonstrates good cause for further production. The Vehicle Repair History
demonstrates Plaintiffs’ vehicle suffered from a litany of issues which could
logically be related to a defect in the suspension, engine, transmission,
electrical, or structural systems of the vehicle.  Further, the TSB in relation to the Subject
Vehicle relates directly to Honda’s investigation, analysis, and communications
regarding the same defects or same parts as the Subject Vehicle. The good cause
showing is not stringent and is adequately made here. 
 
If good cause is shown by
the moving party, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify any
objections made to disclosure of the documents. Honda objects to each RFPD on
the same grounds. The Court will address them in turn. 
 
Irrelevant 
 
Honda objects on the
grounds of relevance, arguing that information pertaining to other vehicles is
irrelevant to the discovery of whether Plaintiffs’ vehicle suffered from an
individual defect. 
 
In the discovery context,
information is relevant “if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating
its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a settlement. [citations
omitted] Admissibility is not the test and information, unless privileged, is discoverable
if it might reasonably lead to admissible evidence.” (Lipton v. Superior
Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612.) It must be noted
that discovery rules are to be applied liberally “and (contrary to popular
belief), fishing expeditions are permissible in some cases.” (Cruz v.
Superior Court (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 646, 653-654.) 
 
In fact, evidence regarding
other vehicles with similar defects as Plaintiffs’ could potentially be
admissible at trial in a lemon law action. (Donlen v. Ford
Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 154; see also Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 971.) Honda argues Donlen
is irrelevant to the issue of discoverability. (Oppo. pg. 11.) The Court
disagrees. While Donlen does not specifically address the scope of
discovery requests, it does concern the admissibility of evidence of defects in
similar vehicles. It follows that if evidence of a type is admissible then it
must also be discoverable. 
 
Vague and Ambiguous 
 
Honda also objects to Plaintiffs’
requests on grounds that the following terms are vague and ambiguous: (1) “field
technical reports”, (2) “common parts failures”, (3) “commonly observed
problems”, and (4) “repeat repair failures”. Honda does not explain why it
believes these terms are vague or they are unable to be ascribed their common
meaning. From the Court’s reading these terms appear self-descriptive. For
example, the term “common parts failures”, which appears to request documents
relating to parts that commonly fail on vehicles of the same make, model, and
year as the Subject Vehicle.  Without
further explanation from Honda, the Court does not see how these terms are so
vague that they cannot be responded to. 
 
Honda’s argument that the
requests are not reasonably particularized is similarly unpersuasive. Honda
argues that the requests are in violation of the reasonably particular
requirement imposed by C.C.P. § 2031.030(c)(1). (Oppo. p. 4.) Honda does not
endeavor to explain why Plaintiffs’ limiting the requests to vehicles of the
same make, year, and model is not sufficiently particular. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court finds Plaintiffs
have demonstrated good cause for further production as concerns each of the
dispute discovery requests. The Court further finds that Honda’s objections to
production are without merit. Accordingly, the motion to compel further responses
to RFPD Nos. 10, 14, 23, 24, 33, 37, 46, 47, 56, 60, 69, 70, 79, 83, 92, 93,
102, 106, 115 and 116 is GRANTED.
