And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a motion to compel arbitration brought by Javier Montoya. The motion was filed in response to a complaint filed by Salvador Rios Guzman, who alleges that Montoya and Sergio Ugalde Hernandez improperly used funds loaned by Guzman and failed to accurately report business earnings. Guzman also alleges that his access to the business and its accounts were frozen after his equity buyout request and the return of the money he loaned.

The Court finds that Montoya has demonstrated the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The agreement, known as the Shareholder Agreement, was signed by the shareholders of Granada Restaurant Employee, Inc., including Guzman and Montoya. The agreement requires the arbitration of disputes between the parties.

The Court grants Montoya's motion to compel arbitration, and issues a stay on the case for arbitration. The Court also sets a status conference for January 26, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. Unless all parties waive notice, Montoya is to give notice.
