The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting American Express National Bank's application for default judgment against Idris Clark.

Despite being served with substitute service on December 20, 2023, Clark failed to timely file an answer, leading to default judgment being entered against him on May 30, 2024. American Express is seeking default judgment in the total amount of $364,503.96, including damages and costs. The Judge has found that American Express has submitted sufficient evidence to support its application, and therefore grants the request for default judgment.
