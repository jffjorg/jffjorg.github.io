  Case Number:  23PSCV03750    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff American Express National Bank’s Application
for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff American Express National Bank’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action arising from a credit card agreement. Within the last
four years, Plaintiff American Express National Bank (American Express)
extended credit through a credit card account to Defendant Idris Clark.
Subsequently, American Express alleges Clark became indebted in the amount of $386,303.46.
On December
5, 2023, American Express filed a complaint against Clark and Does 1-10,
alleging a sole cause of action for common counts. On December 20, 2023, American
Express’s process server served Clark with substitute service in Claremont.
On May 30,
2024, the Court entered default against Clark after Clark failed to timely file
an answer. On the same day, American Express submitted the present
application for default judgment.
A case management conference
is set for August 9, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
American
Express seeks default judgment against Clark in the total amount of $364,503.96,
including $363,988.96 in damages and $515.00 in costs. Because the Court finds
American Express has submitted sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS their
application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, American
Express’s application for default judgment is GRANTED.
