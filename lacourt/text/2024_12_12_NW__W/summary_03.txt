Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, which sought to impose monetary and non-monetary sanctions on the plaintiff for allegedly filing a frivolous complaint. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's pleadings were brought for an improper purpose because they did not allege that the defendant provided notice of the plaintiff's migraines and because the plaintiff was paid her regular pay along with bonuses prior to her termination. The judge disagreed, finding that the pleadings were non-frivolous under the circumstances and that the defendant was attempting to argue the merits of the case. The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00 against the defendant for bringing a frivolous motion.
