And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury action where the plaintiff, Carlos Arita, alleges that he was "beat up" by the defendants, Suresh Kumar Luthra, Saroj Luthra, and S and R Luthra Inc., while in a 7-Eleven store in Van Nuys, California. The defendants demurred to the fourth amended complaint, arguing that the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action and that the claims are uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible. The court overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations are sufficient to withstand a demurrer.

The court also denied the defendants' motion to strike portions of the fourth amended complaint, including punitive damages allegations. The court found that the allegations supporting a request for punitive damages are sufficient, as the plaintiff alleges two intentional torts - assault/battery and false imprisonment - and claims that these actions were done with malicious and conscious disregard for his health and safety.

Finally, the court granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain exhibits and denied the defendants' request for judicial notice of other exhibits.
