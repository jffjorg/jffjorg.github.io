BACKGROUND
 
On May

Office of Michael Poole PAC for several Labor Code violations, violation of
Business and Professions Code 17200, and FEHA violations. 
 
[Tentative]
Ruling
 
Defendant Law Office of Michael Poole’s Motion
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 is DENIED. 
 
discusion
 
Defendant Law Office of Michael Poole move this
court, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, to impose monetary
and non-monetary sanctions, including striking the complaint and dismissing the
action as well as reasonable attorney fees, on the ground that Plaintiff and
her attorneys presented pleadings for an improper purpose. 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, “[a]
party seeking sanctions must follow a two-step procedure. First, the moving
party must serve on the offending party a motion for sanctions.” (Malovec v.
Hamrell (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 434, 440.) Specifically, Section 128.7
provides for a 21-day period during which a party may avoid sanctions by
withdrawing the offending pleading or other document. After expiration of the
safe harbor period, a court may impose sanctions if it concludes a pleading was
filed for an improper purpose, frivolous, or was indisputably without merit,
either legally or factually. (CCP §128.7(b).) 
 
Plaintiff takes no issue with Defendant’s compliance
of the Safe Harbor provision. Defendant served Plaintiff the motion on
September 26, 2024 and the motion was not filed with the court until November
4, 2024, 39 days later. Accordingly, the court finds the motion complies with
the safe harbor provision. 
 
Next, “[u]nder section 128.7, a court may impose
sanctions if it concludes a pleading was filed for an improper purpose or was
indisputably without merit, either legally or factually. [Citation.]” (Bucur
v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189.) “A claim is factually frivolous
if it is ‘not well grounded in fact’ and is legally frivolous if it is ‘not
warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension,
modification, or reversal of existing law.’ [Citation.] In either case, to
obtain sanctions, the moving party must show the party's conduct in asserting
the claim was objectively unreasonable. [Citation.] A claim is objectively
unreasonable if ‘any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is totally and
completely without merit.’ [Citations.]” (Id.) No showing of bad faith is
required. (In re Marriage of Reese & Guy (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1214,
1221.)  
 
Defendant argues the pleadings against it were
brought for an improper purpose because Defendant has presented to Plaintiff’s
counsel evidence that they did not employ five or more employees and that she
was paid her regular pay along with bonuses prior to her termination. Moreover,
Defendant contends Plaintiff failed to allege that they provided Defendant with
any notice with respect to Plaintiff’s migraines. 
 
The court disagrees. “‘A bad faith action or tactic
is considered ‘frivolous’ if it is ‘totally and completely without merit’ or
instituted ‘for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing party.’’”  (In
re Marriage of Sahafzadeh-Taeb & Taeb (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 124, 135
(quoting Levy v. Blum (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 625, 635).)  “‘Whether
an action is frivolous is governed by an objective standard:  any
reasonable attorney would agree it is totally and completely without
merit.’”  (Id. (quoting Levy, supra, 92 Cal.App.4th
at 635).) 
 
Here, any reasonable attorney would find the
pleadings nonfrivolous under circumstances. Plaintiff has alleged she notified
Defendant of her migraines and was thereafter shortly terminated. She also
alleged she worked in excess of eight hours and regularly worked in excess for
40 hours per week. Even if FEHA does not apply, Plaintiff has brought other
causes of action. Accordingly, nothing before the court indicates the complaint
was filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably without merit. Defendant
is attempting to argue the merits of the case. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for sanctions
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 is DENIED. 
 
The court notes Plaintiff seeks their own 128.7
sanctions against Defendant on the grounds the 128.7 motion was brought for the
purpose of harassing and intimidating Plaintiff. Plaintiff seeks $7,500.00 in
sanctions. 
 
A motion for sanctions under section 128.7 that is
brought primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary
delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation, is itself subject to a
motion for sanctions. (CCP § 128.7(h).) 
 
As noted by Plaintiff, this motion was brought at an
early stage of litigation even prior to discovery being conducted. The court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00.
