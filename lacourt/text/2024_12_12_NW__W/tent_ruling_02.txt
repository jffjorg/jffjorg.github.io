[Tentative]
Ruling
 
Defendant Meredith Joan Kurz, Trustee
of The Meredith Joan Kurz Living Trust UTD Dated 06/03/2009’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Defendant
Kurz moves this court for summary judgment on the grounds Defendant Kurz did
not create the defect in the public sidewalk that allegedly caused Plaintiff’s
fall and Defendant Kurz did not own, maintain, or control the public sidewalk
adjacent to their residential property and had no duty to repair any defect
existing on the sidewalk. 
 
A
party may move for summary judgment “if it is contended that the action has no
merit or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding.”  (CCP §
437c(a).) “[I]f all the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence,
show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law,” the moving party will be entitled to summary judgment.  (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) A motion for
summary adjudication may be made by itself or as an alternative to a motion for
summary judgment and shall proceed in all procedural respects as a motion for
summary judgment. (CCP § 437c(f)(2).)    
 
The moving party bears an initial
burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any
triable issue of material fact, and if the party does so, the burden shifts to
the opposing party to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable
issue of material fact.  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)
25 Cal.4th 826, 850; accord CCP § 437c(p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary
judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Med. Ctr.
(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary
judgment, the court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers
(except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all
reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most
favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi, supra, 0159
Cal.App.4th at p. 467; see also CCP § 437c(c).)
 
Defendant Kurz argues that the causes
of action for negligence and premises liability have no merit because Defendant
Kurz did not own, maintain or control the public sidewalk where Plaintiff fell
or create the alleged dangerous condition. Therefore, Defendant did not owe a duty
to Plaintiff. 
 
“In order to establish liability on a
negligence theory, a plaintiff must prove duty, breach, causation and damages.”
(Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205.) “The elements of a
negligence and a premises liability claim are the same.” (Kesner v. Superior
Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1133, 1158.) “The owner of property, in so far as an
invitee is concerned, is not an insurer of safety but must use reasonable care
to keep his premises in a reasonably safe condition and give warning of latent
or concealed perils.” (Blodgett v. B.H. Dyas Co. (1935) 4 Cal.2d 511,
512.)
 
Here, Defendant has presented the
following undisputed material facts: This action arises out of a trip and fall
that occurred on June 18, 2022, on a public sidewalk, located in front of 7801
Louise Avenue, Northridge, CA 91325 (the “property”). (UMF 1.) Defendant owns
the property. (UMF 4.) The roots from a tree in the parkway fronting the neighbors’
property at 7801 Louise Ave, Northridge, CA 91325 caused the vertical uplift of
the sidewalk where Plaintiff allegedly tripped and fell. (UMF 2.) Defendant did
not have any plants in the vicinity of the uplifted sidewalk capable of
displacing the sidewalk. (UMF 3.) Moreover, the location of the incident lies
within the right-of-way of the City of Los Angeles. (UMF 5.) Defendant did not
install, build, or construct the sidewalk or parkway adjacent to the property
and Defendant did not plant the trees on the parkway. (UMF 6, 7.) Defendant
also did not control, maintain, or repair any part of the sidewalk, parkway or
tress in the parkway. (UMF 8.) 
 
Defendant has met their burden in
showing that they did not breach a duty to Plaintiff. Defendant has presented
evidence that Defendant did not have any plants in the vicinity that would have
uplifted the sidewalk as Plaintiff complains thereof and that where the alleged
incident occurred lies within the right-of-way of the City of Los Angeles and
not Defendant’s property. (See Green Decl.; See Mekhaiel Decl.) As such, no
duty of care exists. 
 
Given that the motion is unopposed,
Plaintiff has not met their burden in showing a triable issue of a material
fact. Thus, as a matter of law, the court finds that Defendant did not owe a
duty and Plaintiff’s causes of action for negligence and premises liability
cannot be established. (CCP §437c(o).)   
 
Accordingly, Defendant Meredith Joan
Kurz, Trustee of The Meredith Joan Kurz Living Trust UTD Dated 06/03/2009’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
