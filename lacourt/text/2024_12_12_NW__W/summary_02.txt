And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this case. The case arises from a trip and fall on a public sidewalk in front of a property owned by the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant was liable for the accident because they had a duty to maintain the sidewalk. However, the defendant presented evidence that they did not own, maintain, or control the sidewalk, and that the roots of a tree in the parkway caused the vertical uplift of the sidewalk. The defendant argued that they did not owe a duty to the plaintiff because they did not create the defect in the public sidewalk. The judge found that the defendant met their burden in showing that they did not owe a duty to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff failed to present evidence that would show a triable issue of material fact. Therefore, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiff's claims for negligence and premises liability.
