Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion by Full-Fill Industries, LLC to quash service of summons due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The court has concluded that the plaintiff failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that personal jurisdiction exists over Full-Fill. The court has found that Full-Fill does not have any physical location, assets, or operations in California, and that it does not have any contacts with the forum. The court has also considered the plaintiff's argument that ConAgra, which purchased Full-Fill, is registered to do business in California and has submitted to the court's jurisdiction, but has found that this is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over Full-Fill. The court has granted the motion to quash service of summons.
