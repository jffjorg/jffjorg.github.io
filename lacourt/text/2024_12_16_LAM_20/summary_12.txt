And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has made a preliminary decision in an employment case involving Selim Hoxha, who is suing his former employer, the University of California. Hoxha is seeking more documents from the university in response to his discovery requests. The university had agreed to provide some documents, but limited them to documents related to specific supervisors and only those created before October 6, 2022. Hoxha argues that these limitations are too narrow. The judge disagrees and finds that the university's responses are sufficient. The judge also finds that the university's timeframe is reasonable, given that Hoxha was only employed by the university for a few months. As a result, the judge is denying Hoxha's motion to compel further responses to his discovery requests. The judge is also not awarding sanctions to either party.
