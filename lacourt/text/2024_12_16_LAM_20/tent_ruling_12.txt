This is an employment matter.  Plaintiff Selim Hoxha seeks to compel further responses to his requests for production, set one, nos. 54-56 propounded on Defendant The Regents of the University of California.  Previously, an IDC was held with respect to this discovery.These requests seek all documents relating to (a) complaints, (b) discipline, and (c) investigations as to misconduct by Plaintiff's supervisors.  Essentially, Defendant agreed to provide documents but limited the supervisors to “the operations managers, senior operations managers, or director of operations of the Catering Department”.  Also, Defendant would not produce documents beyond October 6, 2022.  Plaintiff takes issue with these limitations.The Court finds that the responses are sufficient.  Plaintiff should have narrowed the requests to supervisors that actually relate to his adverse employment actions.  To the extent he cannot identify any other supervisors, he is not entitled to further discovery.  The Court also finds the timeframe through October 2022 to be reasonable to the extent Plaintiff was hired in March 2022 and was terminated in June 2022.In sum, the Motion is denied.  The Court declines to award sanctions.Moving party to give notice.
