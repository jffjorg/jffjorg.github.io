And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that both demurrers filed by the defendants are sustained, which means that the complaint filed by the plaintiffs does not state a cause of action. The judge has given the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint. The demurrers were filed in response to the plaintiffs' claims of negligent misrepresentation and negligence. The judge found that the complaint did not adequately plead the necessary facts to support these claims, including who made the alleged misrepresentations, how the plaintiffs relied on them, and whether the defendants owed a duty to the plaintiffs. The judge also found that the complaint did not adequately plead the necessary elements of a negligence claim, including a duty on the part of the defendants, breach of that duty, causation, and harm to the plaintiffs. The judge's ruling is tentative, meaning it is subject to change after further briefing and argument.
