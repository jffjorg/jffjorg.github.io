And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The motion was filed by the Defendants, Grand Harbor Property Management, Inc., et al., and argues that the Plaintiff, Janelle Ralla, has not sufficiently pled facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants had actual knowledge of the defective condition, acted with full knowledge of the consequences, and their conduct was willful, oppressive, and malicious.

The Court has reviewed the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and has found that the Plaintiff has sufficiently pled facts to warrant punitive damages. The Court has denied the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and has ordered the moving party to give notice.

The Court's decision is based on the facts that the Plaintiff notified the Defendants of the water intrusion and mold, and they failed to repair the issues. The Court has also considered the cases of Hilliard v. A.H. Robins Co. and Stoiber v. Honeychuck, which support the Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages.
