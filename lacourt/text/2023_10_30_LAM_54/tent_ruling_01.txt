day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
A. Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
 
Under CCP § 1021.5, attorneys’ fees may
be awarded (1) “to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in
any action which” (2) “has resulted in the enforcement of an important right
affecting the public interest if” (3) “a significant benefit, whether pecuniary
or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of
persons,” (4) “the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement . . .
are such as to make the award appropriate, and” (5) “such fees should not in
the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any.” (CCP § 1021.5.) 
 
Petitioner moves for an award of
attorney fees per CCP § 1021.5. Petitioner argues that it is the prevailing
party because the action resulted in invalidation of the project approval.
Specifically, the Court ordered the City to “set aside its Tower 3
Transit Oriented Communities (“TOC”) approval in City of Los Angeles Planning
Department Case No. DRI-2020–2067-TOC.” Petitioner asserts it achieved its
objective of upholding the City’s zoning regulations and invalidating the Tier
3 determination and incentives granted to Respondent/Real Party.
 
Petitioner argues that it is entitled
to fees under section 1021.5 because the petition has enforced important public
rights, mainly zoning requirements, and has resulted in significant benefit to
the public by requiring the City to strictly follow zoning regulations and
Measure JJJ, which authorized the City’s Transit Oriented Communities
Affordable Housing Incentive Program. Petitioner represents that the action was
prosecuted at great financial risk to Petitioner and Petitioners’ counsel. Additionally, there is no monetary
recovery to cover attorney’s fees.
 
The Court finds that Petitioner is the
prevailing party in this action and is entitled to fees under CCP § 1021.5.
Petitioner has achieved a main litigation objective, conferring a significant
benefit on the public. The necessity and financial burden of private
enforcement make a fee award appropriate.
 
B. Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees
 
Petitioner asserts that Channel Law
Group incurred $129,210.00 in fees to prosecute this action. In reply, Petitioner also requests $26,265.00 in fees to bring and defend this
motion.
 
Petitioner’s counsel charges between $150.00
and $675.00 per hour and spent 233.10 hours on this case over approximately two
years. Respondent argues that counsel’s fees are unreasonable and inefficient, and
fees should be reduced for unsuccessful claims. The Court does not find
counsel’s billing entries excessive. This action lasted two years, included
motion work, and resulted in a favorable outcome for Petitioners. Work on the
unsuccessful claims overlaps with work on the successful claims. The Court
finds that counsel’s fees are reasonable.
 
Petitioner’s motion for attorney’s fees
is GRANTED in the amount of $155,475. ($129,210.00 + $26,265.00).
