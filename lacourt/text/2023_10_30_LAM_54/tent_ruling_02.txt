BACKGROUND
 
On November 24, 2021, Plaintiffs Joel
Bernknopf and John Lamorte sued Defendants Brian M. Cronin, Natalie Gonzalez
Cronin, ARC-IV, LLC, ARC-V, Inc., and Orthopros, asserting causes of action for
(1) securities fraud; (2) fraud by concealment; (3) intentional
misrepresentation; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) breach of buyer note;
(6) breach of debt assumption agreement; (7) breach of employment agreement;
and (8) financial elder abuse. 
 
Plaintiffs founded Orthopros, an
orthotics and prosthetics company in 1982. Plaintiffs allege they sold
Orthopros to Defendants via a stock purchase agreement in 2020 for $1,193,756.
Joel and John each received a Buyer Note from Orthopros for $471,886. Additionally,
ARC-IV agreed to assume certain “contingent liabilities” that Orthopros owed to
Joel and John in an amount not to exceed $249,984 and in accordance with the
terms of a debt assumption agreement. Plaintiffs continued to work for
Orthopros until November 2021. Plaintiff alleges Orthopros defaulted on the
buyer notes by obtaining a $500,000.00 small business loan.
 
On February 28, 2022, Brian M. Cronin,
Natalie Gonzalez Cronin, ARC-IV, LLC, ARC-V, Inc., and Orthopros filed a
cross-complaint against Joel Bernknopf and John Lamorte, asserting causes of
action for (1) breach of employment agreement; (2) breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) fraud – concealment; and (4) fraud
– intentional misrepresentation.
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court may allow, in furtherance of
justice, and “upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or
proceeding in other particulars….”  (CCP
§ 473(a)(1).)  A motion to amend a
pleading before trial must be accompanied by a separate declaration that
specifies (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary
and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.  (CRC Rule 3.1324(b).)
It is not an abuse of discretion of the court
to grant the motion unless there is a “showing that actual unfairness or
obvious prejudice has resulted from the allowance of such an amendment”.  (Posz v. Burchell (1962) 209
Cal.App.2d 324, 334.)  “Counsel on the
firing line in an actual trial must be prepared for surprises, including
requests for amendments of pleading.”  (Ibid.)  Absent a showing of prejudice, delay alone is
insufficient grounds for denial.  (See
Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d 558, 564–65.)
Plaintiffs move for leave to file a first
amended complaint. The proposed FAC removes the causes of action for securities
fraud, elder abuse and breach of debt assumption agreement and adds causes of
action for recission, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, specific performance, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, fraudulent
transfer, accounting, and constructive trust.
Plaintiffs assert the FAC more clearly
alleges the causes of action for breach of contract and fraud and contains
allegations of Defendants’ continued wrongdoing since this action was filed.
Plaintiffs represent that they learned of the new facts between June 2023 and
September 2023, partly through the individual Defendants’ family law
proceedings.
In opposition, Defendants argue the motion
should be denied because Plaintiffs have delayed in seeking amendment and are
only seeking amendment to escape Defendant Gonzalez-Cronin's motion for summary
adjudication. Defendants also assert Plaintiffs have failed to comply with CRC Rule
3.1324.
The Court will allow amendment. Plaintiffs
have sought amendment diligently after learning of the new facts. Defendants
have not shown they will be prejudiced if this motion is granted. Plaintiff
complies with CRC Rule 3.1324 in reply; the failure to do so in the moving
papers is excused by the Court’s order treating the ex parte application
to advance the hearing as the moving papers for the motion.
Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED.

Motion for Summary Adjudication
Moving Party: Defendant Natalie Gonzalez Cronin

Lamorte
 
T/R:     DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY
ADJUDICATION IS DENIED AS MOOT.
 
DEFENDANT TO
NOTICE.

BACKGROUND
 
On November 24, 2021, Plaintiffs Joel
Bernknopf and John Lamorte sued Defendants Brian M. Cronin, Natalie Gonzalez
Cronin, ARC-IV, LLC, ARC-V, Inc., and Orthopros, asserting causes of action for
(1) securities fraud; (2) fraud by concealment; (3) intentional
misrepresentation; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) breach of buyer note;
(6) breach of debt assumption agreement; (7) breach of employment agreement;
and (8) financial elder abuse. 
 
Plaintiffs founded Orthopros, an
orthotics and prosthetics company in 1982. Plaintiffs allege they sold
Orthopros to Defendants through a stock purchase agreement in 2020 for
$1,193,756. Joel and John each received a Buyer Note from Orthopros for
$471,886. ARC-IV agreed to assume certain “contingent liabilities” that
Orthopros owed to Joel and John in an amount not to exceed $249,984 and in
accordance with the terms of a debt assumption agreement. Plaintiffs continued
to work for Orthopros until November 2021. Plaintiff alleges Orthopros
defaulted on the buyer notes by obtaining a $500,000.00 small business loan.
 
On February 28, 2022, Brian M. Cronin,
ARC-IV, LLC, ARC-V, Inc., and Orthopros filed a cross-complaint against Joel
Bernknopf and John Lamorte, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of
employment agreement; (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing; (3) fraud – concealment; and (4) fraud – intentional
misrepresentation.
 
Defendant Gonzalez Cronin moves for
summary adjudication of Plaintiffs’ first through eighth causes of action. While
this motion was pending, Plaintiff moved to amend the complaint. As discussed
in a separate opinion, the Court will grant that motion. The proposed amended
complaint no longer asserts against Defendant Gonzalez Cronin any of the causes
of action at issue in this motion for summary adjudication. It deletes
entirely the causes of action for securities
fraud, elder abuse, and breach
of debt assumption. It removes Defendant Gonzalez Cronin from the causes of
action for fraud, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of
good faith. 
 
Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication is DENIED as MOOT.
