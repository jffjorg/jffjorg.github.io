CROSS-DEFENDANT WENDY LIN’S DEMURRER TO BO SUN’S VERIFIED
FIRST AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT is OVERRULED because the action is not
time-barred. 
 
Background
 
This is a
quiet title action stemming from a 2007 arbitration agreement in cases
BC330493 and BC335624. 
 
On June 14,
2022, Plaintiff Wendy Lin (“Lin” or “Plaintiff”) filed the complaint against BO
SUN, an individual (“Sun” or “Defendant”); ALL PERSONS UNKNOWN, Claiming Any
Legal or Equitable Right, Title, Estate, Lien, or Interest in the Property
Described in this Complaint Adverse to Plaintiff’s title, or any Cloud upon
Plaintiff’s Title Thereto; and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive for: 1.     Breach of Fiduciary 2.     Conversion 3.     Fraud 4.     Quiet Title 5.     Common County—Money Lent
 
On July 12,
2022, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Lis Pendens. 
 
On August 24,
2022, Defendant filed a Demurrer, which on October 4, 2022 the court sustained
with leave to amend. 
 
On December
5, 2022, Plaintiff filed a FAC for 1. Breach Of Fiduciary Duty 2. Quiet Title
3. Fraud 4. Declaratory Relief 5. Injunctive Relief 6. Unjust Enrichment/
Constructive Trust 7. Quantum Meruit. 
 
On January
12, 2023 Defendant filed its demurrer to the FAC, which on 2/28/23 the court
sustained with leave to amend as to the fraud and quiet title causes of action,
and overruled as to the others. 
 
On March 10,
2023, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (SAC). 
 
On June 14,
2023, the parties filed a stipulation for leave for Plaintiff to file a
proposed third amended complaint (TAC). That same day, Plaintiff filed a TAC,
alleging the following COAs: 1.     Breach of Fiduciary Duty 2.     Quiet Title 3.     Fraud and Concealment [the third COA
is categorized into two counts]. 4.     Declaratory Relief 5.     Injunctive Relief 6.     Unjust Enrichment/Constructive Trust
 
On August 3,
2023, Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike (MTS) to the TAC, which
the court (on 9/20/23) sustained in its entirety without leave to amend,
meaning that the 2nd and 3rd COAs were stricken.
According to the minute order, Defendant was given until October 20, 2023 to
file a responsive pleading.
 
On October
11, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to expunge lis pendens. 
 
On October
24, 2023, Defendant filed his answer along with a cross-complaint (CC) against
Plaintiff Wendy[1]
for: 
 
1.     Declaratory
relief
2.     Quiet
title and
3.     Partition
 
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a demurrer to the CC,
which on 1/9/24, the court sustained with leave to amend. 
 
On January 29, 2024, Defendant filed his first amended CC. 
 
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant demurrer.
 
On March 12, 2024, Defendant filed his opposition. 
 
On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed her reply. 
 
On March 28, 2024, the court asked for supplemental briefing
as to the statute of limitations issue. (Thus, Plaintiff’s attempt to
re-address other arguments will not be addressed in the ruling.) 
The parties have filed their respective supplemental briefs.
Portions of the demurrer will remain the same as to the posted tentative.
 
Discussion
 
At the outset, it appears that only the 16482
Monte Cristo property is at issue in this CC. (See CC p. 4:7-14.) 
 
The CC alleges that Plaintiff transferred her interest in
the 16485 Monte Cristo property to Defendant and that the 12368 Valley property
was sold, and Plaintiff’s share of net proceeds was directly paid to Defendant.
That leaves the 16482 Monte Cristo property at issue wherein Defendant
alleges that despite the court determining that both have a 50% ownership
interest in the property, “Plaintiff never transferred the 50% ownership
interest in 16482 Monte Cristo to [Defendant]” (CC ¶14) and based thereon an
actual controversy exists as to the “legal title of 16482 Monte Cristo.” (¶16;
see also 3rd COA for partition focuses on the 16482 Monte Cristo
property.) Thus, it is
unclear why the demurrer references the 16485 Monte Cristo property.
(See demurrer p. 4:5-6; p. 7:3-5.) 
 
The court now turns to the merits of the demurrer.
 
It appears that the demurrer raises three arguments:
 
1.    
Defendant did not file a petition to confirm the
arbitration award within 4 years after the award was entered (Demurrer p.
4:7-10; p. 6:25-26)[2]
2.    
The CC is barred by the statute of limitations (SOL)
because he failed to file this action more than 16 years after the 2007
arbitration judgment, and he has failed to allege any facts to demonstrate his
inability to use due diligence and to claim ownership of the 16482 Property
(Demurrer p. 6:21-27; Reply pp. 2-6.) 
3.    
The partition COA fails to state all the elements.[3]
 
1.    
Confirming Arbitration[4] 
 
To enforce an arbitral award under the CAA, a petition to
confirm must be filed no earlier than ten days after, but not later than four
years from, the date of service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner
(Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 1288, 1288.4).
 
In Opposition, Defendant maintains that as alleged in
paragraph 5 in the complaint, on April 17, 2007, a judgment confirming an
arbitration award was entered by a Los Angeles County Court in the case
entitled Lin v. Sun, et al., case number BC330493, together with a consolidated
case number BC335624. 
 
Indeed, according to Ex. 1 found in the request for judicial
notice (RJN), the arbitration award was issued on 2/23/2007 and confirmed by
the court on 4/27/2007. The Reply is silent as this argument. 
 
Therefore, the court OVERRULES the demurrer as it relates to
the first argument. 
 
2.    
SOL 
 
In the court’s posted tentative, the court noted that it was
somewhat persuaded that the basis of the CC may be time barred. Specifically,
the court stated the following:
 
In fact, it appears Defendant concedes
that he knows he’s been an equitable title holder since the 2007
arbitration judgment. For example, Defendant avers that “[t]here is no [SOL]
problem here because [Defendant] had an equitable claim on 16482 Monte Cristo
dating back to April 27, 2007” (Opp. p. 3:27-28, italics added) or that
he “never had reason to believe that he had a title problem…because it had been
awarded to him in the arbitration award” (Opp. p. 3:23-25, italics
added.). To the extent
that Defendant is arguing that Plaintiff has been obstructing Defendant’s
efforts from obtaining legal title from the get-go (Opp. p. 4:1-3)
because Plaintiff “never placed [Defendant’s] name on the title” (Opp. p.
3:20-21), then Defendant has, contrary to his assertion, been aware
of the problem since 2007.[5]

 
In his supplemental opposition, Defendant argues that the
“event triggering the time for the [SOL] to start to run is the time that Wendy
Lin began to make a claim to 100% of 16482 Monte Cristo” (Supp. Opp. p.
1:27-28)—which is when Defendant filed his CC for partition on 10/24/2023—NOT the
2007 arbitration judgment that Plaintiff focuses on. “BO SUN had no idea that
WENDY LIN was claiming to be 100% owner of 16482 Monte Cristo until the
cross-complaint was filed.” (Opp. 3:11-12.)[6]
 
Indeed, a review of Plaintiff’s TAC indicates that the 16482
property was not subject to dispute as the TAC focuses on the 16485
Monte Cristo property (TAC ¶12), suggesting that the dispute as to 16482
Monte Cristo is new as of 11/21/23 when Plaintiff filed the instant
demurrer to Defendant’s CC.[7] And
the court is unaware of authority that requires a party to “change” his
equitable title to legal title. The Reply does not address this argument. 
 
Therefore, as the 2007 judgment created no dispute that both
had 50% interest in the 16482 Monte Cristo property such that any dispute is the
court OVERULESS the demurrer on the grounds that it is barred by the SOL. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the entirety of the demurrer to the
CC is OVERRULED.
