And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the cross-defendant's demurrer to the third amended cross-complaint is overruled. The dispute centers around the 16482 Monte Cristo property, which was the subject of a 2007 arbitration agreement. The Plaintiff seeks to establish quiet title to the property, while the Defendant seeks to establish partition of the property. The Judge finds that the Defendant's claim is not time-barred, as the statute of limitations did not start running until the Defendant filed his cross-complaint in 2023. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's claim for partition is not barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge overrules the demurrer and allows the Defendant's cross-complaint to proceed.
