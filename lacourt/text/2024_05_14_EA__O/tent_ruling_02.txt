[1] Though by the cross-complaint the plaintiff is also
deemed a cross-defendant, for clarity purposes, the court will continue to
refer to Wendy as Plaintiff. 


[2] The majority of the demurrer is as to this issue and
then the Reply pivots to focus more on the SOL issue. 
 


[3] Plaintiff conclusively sets forth this argument thus
it is unclear what element Defendant hasn’t pled. Therefore, the court
OVERRULES the demurrer as to this argument. In any event, the partition COA is
derivative of the quiet title COA. 
 


[4] This argument is also unclear in that Plaintiff’s own
complaint is based upon the same arbitration award. Thus, for Plaintiff to
argue that a petition to confirm the arbitration award was not filed
would, presumably, render her own claims meritless.  


[5] In its supplemental opposition, Defendant appears to
clarify his statement by saying such obstruction was in reference to lawsuits
and frivolous motions filed after the first complaint was filed
on 6/14/22; not in reference to the 2007 arbitration agreement. (Supp. Opp. p.
2:21-22.) 
 


[6] Defendant’s argument is somewhat unclear. On the one
hand, he argues that the SOL began when the CC was filed on 10/24/23 but on the
other hand argues that the dispute started on 6/14/22. (See Supp. Opp. p.
2:22-23 [“[F]rom 2007 to June 14, 2022, BO SUN and WENDY LIN both knew that BO
SUN had 50% of 16482 Monte Cristo.”].) But the 6/14/22 filing of Plaintiff’s
complaint does take issue with the 16482 Monte Cristo property; thus, it is
unclear how that 6/14/22 filing bears relevance to Defendant’s argument. 
 


[7] Though Plaintiff’s demurrer and papers are not
arguing that Defendant does not necessarily hold an interest in the property
but moreso focusing on technicalities with the CC’s COAs, she is not disputing
Defendant’s contention that Plaintiff disputes that Defendant is entitled to
50% interest in the 16482 Monte Cristo property, suggesting her demurrer is disputing
his interest in the 16482 Monte Cristo property.
