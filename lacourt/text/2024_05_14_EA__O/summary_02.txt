And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a case involving Wendy (Plaintiff) and BO SUN (Defendant) regarding the 16482 Monte Cristo property. The Plaintiff had filed a complaint on 6/14/22, and the Defendant had filed a Certificate of Completion (CC) on 10/24/23. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's demurrer to the Defendant's claims was unclear and overruled it. The Judge also noted that the Defendant's argument regarding the statute of limitations (SOL) was unclear and seemed to rely on multiple dates, including 6/14/22 and 10/24/23. The Judge concluded that the Plaintiff's demurrer was disputing the Defendant's claim to a 50% interest in the 16482 Monte Cristo property.
