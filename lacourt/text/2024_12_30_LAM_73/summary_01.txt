Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendants, Darrell Weaver and Shaun Williams. The plaintiff's action is based on a breach of lease and unlawful detainer. The defendants failed to pay rent, continued to occupy the premises, and forfeited the lease. The plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment was incomplete because it failed to include a declaration of non-military status for the defendants, as required by law. The Court finds that default judgment cannot be entered without this declaration. The ruling is made without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may refile the request for entry of default judgment with the necessary documentation.
