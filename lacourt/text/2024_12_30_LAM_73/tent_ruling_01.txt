REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT AGAINST
DEFENDANTS (filed 11/14/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for
entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On January
12, 2024, Plaintiffs Northland Thea LLC; Northland Thea Portfolio LLC;
Northland Thea Portfolio II LLC; Northland Thea Portfolio III LLC; and
Northland Thea Portfolio IV LLC filed the instant action against Defendants Darrell
Weaver and Shaun Williams.
 
The Complaint
alleges a cause of action for Breach of Lease. 
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. Plaintiffs own an apartment complex located at
1000 W. 8th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90017. Defendants
entered into a 12-month lease for Unit 3302. Plaintiffs allege that after
entering the Lease, Defendants stopped paying rent, but continued to occupy the
Premises. On or about July 26, 2023, after Defendants did not pay rent or quit
within the three day notice period, Plaintiffs brought an unlawful detainer
action against Defendants seeking, inter alia, forfeiture of the Lease,
possession of the Premises, and past-due rent due from April 2023, onward (the
“Unlawful Detainer Action”). In the
Unlawful Detainer Action, the parties agreed to and entered an Unlawful
Detainer Stipulated Judgment for possession of the Premises only (the
“Stipulated Judgment”), wherein Defendants agreed that, inter alia, (i) the
Lease was forfeited and (ii) Defendants were to return the Premises to
Plaintiffs. The
Stipulated Judgment expressly provided that the parties did not waive their
right to seek to recover money damages later. Defendants are liable for the full amount of Plaintiffs’ damages
accrued through September 15, 2023, including at least $134,000.00 in past-due
rent
 
On November 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
request for entry of default judgment against Defendants.

JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court
judgment. On November 14, 2024, Plaintiffs submitted its JC Form CIV-100. However, Plaintiffs
failed to sufficiently fill out item number eight of the form pertaining to the
declaration of non-military status. 
 
A
declaration of non-military status is required to obtain a judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(5);
Interinsurance Exchange v. Collins (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1445, 1447.) The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil
Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. Appen. §§ 501–591) requires: “In any action or
proceeding commenced in any court, if there shall be a default of any
appearance by the defendant, the plaintiff, before entering judgment shall
file in the court an affidavit setting forth facts showing that the defendant
is not in military service.... If an affidavit is not filed showing that the
defendant is not in the military service, no judgment shall be entered without
first securing an order of court directing such entry.... Whenever ... facts
may be ... established ... by ... declaration, ... the filing of such ...
declaration ... shall satisfy the requirement ... that facts be established by
affidavit.” (50 U.S.C. Appen. § 520(1).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs checked subsection (f) of item number eight
of the form, stating “We do not know defendant Darrell Weaver’s birthday or defendant
Shaun Williams’ birthday, which is required to run a search at:
https://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/. We were therefore unable to confirm if Defendants
Weaver and Williams are not in the U.S. military service.” (Plaintiff’s Request
for Entry of Default, p. 3.) 
 
Thus,
Plaintiffs have not sufficiently filled out item number eight because
Plaintiffs do not state that Defendants are not in the U.S. military service. Since
Defendants’ military status is unknown, the Court finds default judgment cannot
be entered. 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for entry of default judgment is DENIED
without prejudice.
