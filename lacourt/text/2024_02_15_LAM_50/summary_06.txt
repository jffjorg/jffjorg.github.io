Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge continues the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication brought by Cross-Defendants CBRE, Inc. and Dennis Zhang due to the numerous evidentiary objections (over 40) interposed by Cross-Complainants. The parties are ordered to meet and confer by telephone or in person in a serious and good faith effort to resolve and eliminate the objections. The parties must file a joint statement with the remaining objections and present their respective positions regarding the material issues. A hearing will be held to review the remaining objections, and the date for the hearing on the motion will be set at that time.
