[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 



 
Law
Office of Ball & Yorke, Brett Yorke, and Joseph Jones (collectively, “Counsel”)
move to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Leslie Chavarria, Juan Pina
Gonzalez aka Manual Padilla Gonzalez, and Josue Alvarado Perez. 
While Counsel has provided sufficient
reason for withdrawal, Items 3, 5, and 6 of the 
proposed
order (Form MC-053) are blank. In addition, Item 7(a) of the proposed order
incorrectly states that the Final Status Conference is set for February 15,
2024. The Final Status Conference is set for May 3, 2024. 
            Further, Item 9(b) of the proposed
order incorrectly states that trial will take place in “Dept. 15.” Items 4(b) and 6(b) of Counsel’s declaration (Form MC-052) also
incorrectly reference Department 15.  
Lastly, the proofs of
service attached to the moving papers reference, inter alia, “Juan Pena
Gonzalez.” (Emphasis added.) However, one of the Plaintiffs named in the
Complaint is Juan Pina Gonzalez. (Emphasis added.) 
Because of the issues
identified above, the motion is denied without prejudice.

Counsel
is ordered to give notice of this order.¿
