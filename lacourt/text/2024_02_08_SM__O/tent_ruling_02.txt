LAW P.C., et al. vs GERALD I. GILLOCK, et al
Case
No. 23SMCV02764 
HEARING DATE: 2-8-2024
SUBJECT: Plaintiff Aaron G. Filler’s
Motion for Reconsideration
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Filler’s Motion For Reconsideration is DENIED.  Plaintiff did not
file his motion with an affidavit required by
CCP § 1008. "The party making the application shall state by affidavit
what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or
decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are
claimed to be shown." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd., (a).)  Filler filed his sworn
declaration on 1-24-24 to correct his original
filing on 11-13-23.  Filler cannot cure
an incorrect filing for a motion for reconsideration by filing the supporting
affidavit at a later time.  (See Branner v. Regents of Univ. of California (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 1043, 1048 [motion for reconsideration that was filed without a
supporting affidavit was invalid, and movant’s subsequent late filing of an
affidavit did not convert the motion “from invalid to valid”].) 
Moreover, a party seeking reconsideration must provide a satisfactory
explanation for failing to present the information at the first hearing; i.e.,
a showing of reasonable diligence. [Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
CA4th 674, 690;  California Correctional Peace Officers Ass'n v. Virga
(2010) 181 CA4th 30, 47, fn.15.  Tensor’s late filed declaration fails to
show why his claimed new argument was not addressed at the first hearing.
 In fact, it was.   Reconsideration cannot be granted
based on claims the court misinterpreted the law in its initial ruling
(as opposed to a change in the law in the interim). That is not a “new”
or “different” matter. [Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494,
1500.] Similarly, ignorance
of the law is not a proper basis for reconsideration. [Pazderka v.
Caballeros Dimas Alang, Inc. (1998) 62 CA4th 658, 670.]  Simply put, there are no new facts, circumstances, or law identified in
the Motion or affidavit as required by CCP
1008(a).  
The Clerk is to give notice.
