And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Aaron G. Filler's Motion for Reconsideration. The motion was filed without an affidavit, as required by CCP § 1008, which states that the party making the application must state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. The Plaintiff attempted to correct his original filing with a sworn declaration on January 24, 2024, but this does not convert the motion from invalid to valid. Additionally, the Plaintiff failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for not presenting the information at the first hearing, and the court's initial ruling cannot be reconsidered based on claims that the court misinterpreted the law. The Judge cites several cases to support this decision, including Branner v. Regents of Univ. of California, Garcia v. Hejmadi, California Correctional Peace Officers Ass'n v. Virga, Gilberd v. AC Transit, and Pazderka v. Caballeros Dimas Alang, Inc.
