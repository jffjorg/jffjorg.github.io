And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for final approval of the class action settlement and provisional certification of the class. The settlement provides for a $24 million payment to participating class members. The court has considered the notice to class members of the final approval hearing and the objections to the settlement. The court has also reviewed the attorneys' fees and costs requested by counsel.

The court finds that the notice to class members was sufficient and that the objections to the settlement were procedurally invalid. The court also finds that the settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.

The court awards attorneys' fees in the amount of $8,000,000, which is one-third of the total settlement. The court also awards costs in the amount of $32,500 for claims administration.

The court continues the motion for final approval of the class action settlement and provisional certification for counsel to address the issues noted above regarding costs. The named plaintiffs are to provide supplemental declarations regarding their incentive awards.

The court orders that the motion be continued and that the named plaintiffs provide supplemental declarations regarding their incentive awards.
