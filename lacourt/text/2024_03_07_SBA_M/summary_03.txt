And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Del Amo Hospital, Inc. and others. The plaintiff, Damian Eduardo Sarabia, alleges that he was a minor patient at Del Amo Hospital when he was assaulted and sexually battered by another patient. The defendant argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that it is not liable for the alleged acts because it is not a "person" and did not engage in any wrongful conduct.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the first through third and eighth causes of action with 20 days leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff must refile the complaint and address the deficiencies in the pleadings. The judge also grants the motion to strike certain allegations in the complaint.

The judge notes that the plaintiff alleges he was an adult at the time of the filing of the complaint, but his date of birth is listed as April 10, 2014, making him a minor at the time of the alleged incidents. The judge rules that if the plaintiff is a minor, any amended complaint must be presented by a guardian ad litem.

Finally, the judge orders an OSC re: Striking the Complaint due to lack of capacity of the minor plaintiff to proceed with this action. This means that the court will set a date for a hearing to determine whether the complaint should be stricken due to the plaintiff's lack of capacity to sue.
