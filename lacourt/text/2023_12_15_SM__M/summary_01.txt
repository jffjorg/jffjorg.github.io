And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses Defendant Michael Levine's motion to quash four deposition subpoenas issued by Plaintiff Tom Yang. The subpoenas request financial documents from two financial institutions, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Levine argues that the subpoenas invade his privacy rights, inadequately describe the documents requested, and are overly broad and unduly burdensome. The court disagrees with Levine's arguments and denies the motion to quash. The court finds that the subpoenas are reasonable and necessary to determine the truth of the alter ego allegations and that the financial documents requested are critical to the case. The court also declines to impose sanctions on either party.
