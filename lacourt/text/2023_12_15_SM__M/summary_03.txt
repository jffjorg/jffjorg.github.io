```

Summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer with leave to amend the complaint. The court finds that the complaint does not adequately allege a custodial relationship between the defendants and the plaintiff, which is required for a claim of elder abuse and neglect. The court also finds that the allegations regarding a managing agent are conclusory and do not provide sufficient facts to support the claim. The motion to strike the prayer for attorney's fees, enhanced remedies, and punitive damages is moot given the court's decision to grant leave to amend.
