And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant in a wrongful termination lawsuit brought by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to follow the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) grievance procedure and that the termination was not justified. The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to file a code compliant response to the defendant's separate statement and did not offer evidence to dispute the defendant's claims.

The judge finds that the defendant followed the CBA grievance procedure and that the plaintiff's conduct was egregious, warranting termination. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's arguments are attempts to persuade the court to disagree with the Accident Review Board's termination decision, but the court will only consider genuine material factual disputes and will not weigh evidence credibility or make determinations on the Accident Review Board hearings.

The judge dismisses the plaintiff's claims for lack of evidence and finds that the defendant is entitled to summary judgment. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's supplemental opposition raises new claims that are not clearly part of the operative pleading and that the court has already sustained demurrers on these claims.
