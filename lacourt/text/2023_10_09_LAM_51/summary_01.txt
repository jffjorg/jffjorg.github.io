Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, LAC Metro, has filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss the plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination in violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The plaintiff, Chris Cowart, alleges that he was wrongfully terminated by the defendant on July 7, 2020, after an incident with a pedestrian on May 27, 2020. The defendant argues that Cowart failed to exhaust the internal grievance procedures provided by the CBA and that the union, SMART-TD, did not act in bad faith.

The judge, Upinder S. Kalra, has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that Cowart failed to provide evidence of a material factual dispute as to whether he exhausted the internal grievance procedures. The judge has also found that the union's decision not to pursue arbitration of Cowart's grievance was not arbitrary or in bad faith. Therefore, the plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination in violation of the CBA is dismissed as a matter of law.
