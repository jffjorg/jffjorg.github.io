Kalra, Department 51 HEARING DATE:   October 9, 2023                                              CASE NAME:           Chris Cowart v. LAC Metro CASE NO.:                21STCV30997 MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY: Defendant County of Los Angeles RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Chris Cowart REQUESTED RELIEF: 1.      Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint: One Cause of Action for Wrongful Termination in Violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.TENTATIVE RULING: 1.      Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: Plaintiff Chris Cowart (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint on August 23, 2021. He filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on January 20, 2022. He filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) on June 2, 2022. The SAC has one cause of action for: Wrongful Termination in Violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Article 27 Section 19, or the current Collective Bargaining Agreement, which is July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2022. Defendant LAC Metro (Defendant) filed an Answer to the SAC on July 6, 2022. Plaintiff alleges he was employed by Defendant from February 25, 2008 to July 7, 2020. Plaintiff alleges that after an incident with a pedestrian on May 27, 2020, Defendant placed him on paid administrative leave and then terminated his employment in violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between Defendant and SMART-TD (his union). Plaintiff alleges he attended two days of driving classes, did not attend a first formal hearing, attended a second level appeal on August 27, 2020, is unsure if a third level appeal occurred, and that no arbitration occurred. Plaintiff claims Defendant violated the CBA by (1) not conducting a brake test pursuant to Article 27, section 19, and (2) not following the progressive discipline steps set out in Article 27, section 17(a).[1] Plaintiff claims he exhausted his internal grievance processes. Defendant filed this Motion for Summary Judgment on June 23, 2023, for hearing on October 9, 2023. Defendant timely filed and served the motion on Plaintiff pursuant to CCP § 437c(a)(2). Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 8, 2023, without proof of service attached. Defendant states Plaintiff served the opposition on September 8, 2023. (Decl. of Calvin House In Support of Ex Parte Application to Continue Trial.) Plaintiff filed a supplemental opposition on September 29, 2023 and served it on Defendant via U.S. Mail on September 28, 2023. The supplemental opposition is untimely. Defendant filed a reply to Plaintiff’s supplemental opposition on October 4, 2023.[2] LEGAL STANDARD: The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 (Aguilar).) In analyzing such motions, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294). Thus, summary judgment or summary adjudication is granted when, after the Court’s consideration of the evidence set forth in the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (CCP § 437c(c); Villa v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741.) A triable issue of material fact exists where “the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.” (Aguilar, supra, at p. 850.) As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the party moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element. (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) A motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication must be denied where the moving party's evidence does not prove all material facts, even in the absence of any opposition or where the opposition is weak. (See Leyva v. Superior Court (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 462, 475; Salesguevara v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 379, 384, 387.)    Once the moving party has met the burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to show via specific facts that a triable issue of material facts exists as to a cause of action or a defense thereto. (CCP § 437c(o)(2).)  When a party cannot establish an essential element or defense, a court must grant a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. (CCP § 437c(o)(1)-(2).)  ANALYSIS: Grievance Process Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot seek judicial relief for wrongful termination because (1) he failed to exhaust the internal grievance process and (2) Defendant did not violate the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) because Plaintiff had a full grievance process.[3] Plaintiff argues that the grievance process was not complete because he did not get an arbitration hearing.[4] A party to a collective bargaining agreement that “provides grievance and arbitration machinery for the settlement of disputes” must exhaust these internal procedures before proceeding to court. (Terrell v. Local Lodge 758, Intern. Ass’n of Machinists (1956) 141 Cal.App.2d 17, 21 (Terrell).) A party may nonetheless proceed to court if there are “facts which would excuse him from pursuing such [internal] remedies” first. (Ibid.) While unions have discretion in determining which grievances to arbitrate, a union may not arbitrarily ignore a meritorious grievance or process. (Jones v. Omnitrans (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 273, 281-82; Gutierrez v. Gaffers & Sattler Corp. (1974) 4 Cal.App.3d 731, 737 (Gutierrez) [requiring “fraud, misrepresentation, bad faith, dishonesty of purpose or such gross mistake or inaction as to imply bad faith” by the union.]) Without such facts, a union’s decision not to pursue arbitration does not excuse an employee from exhausting the internal grievance procedures. (Gutierrez, supra, at p. 737.) Here, Defendant met its burden to establish that Plaintiff failed to exhaust the CBA’s internal grievance procedures. Specifically, Defendant provided the following evidence: It entered into a CBA with Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, Transportation, Transportation Division (SMART-TD), a union, concerning the rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and working conditions, for all its operations employees, including bus operators, effective July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2022. (Defendant’s Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (UMF) No. 6.) Under the CBA, SMART-TD is the exclusive representative of all Defendant’s operations employees, including bus drivers. (UMF No. 7.) Under Article 27 of the CBA, Defendant must provide a first level hearing at which an employee may present their case before termination. (UMF Nos. 8-9) SMART-TD may appeal two more times and finally submit the matter to arbitration if the dispute is not satisfactorily adjusted on the employee’s behalf. (UMF Nos. 10-12.) The Accident Review Board upheld Plaintiff’s termination at the first level hearing on June 18, 2020. (UMF Nos. 13-5.) On October 9, 2020, Defendant held a second level hearing and a third level hearing for Plaintiff. (UMF Nos. 16, 17, 19, and 20.) SMART-TD determined not to seek arbitration of Plaintiff’s claim for lack of merit. (UMF No. 21.)[5] Accordingly, Defendant established that Plaintiff failed to exhaust the CBA’s internal grievance procedures. As such, the burden shifts to the Plaintiff. Plaintiff did not meet his burden to provide evidence sufficient to show that there is a genuinely disputed material fact as to exhausting the CBA’s internal grievance procedures. First, Plaintiff does not dispute Defendant’s separate statement.[6] Second, Plaintiff’s conclusory allegations of breach of duty by SMART-TD is not evidence that SMART-TD acted “arbitrarily” when it declined to pursue arbitration of Plaintiff’s grievance.[7] (Gutierrez, supra, at p. 737.) In fact, Plaintiff’s own evidence shows that SMART-TD voted on whether to pursue arbitration for his claim.[8] (Plaintiff’s Ex. 10.) Third, Plaintiff did not provide evidence that Robert Chavez committed perjury in his declaration.[9] (Ayon v. Esquire Deposition Solutions, Inc. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 487, 496 [“merely offering reasons why a witness might have an incentive to lie, without offering any evidence . . . is not enough to create a disputed issue of material fact.”]).) In sum, Plaintiff’s argument that the union acted in bad faith is not supported by evidence. Understandably Plaintiff disagrees with the ultimate conclusion of the hearing board and disappointed by his union’s failure to arbitrate. Nonetheles, taken together, Plaintiff has not provided evidence of a material factual dispute as to failure to exhaust the CBA’s internal grievance procedures.[10] Accordingly, Defendant established that Plaintiff’s claim for wrongful termination in violation of the collective bargaining agreement fails as a matter of law. CONCLUSION:             For the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. Moving party is to give notice. IT IS SO ORDERED. Dated:             October 6, 2023                      __________________________________                                                                                                                Upinder S.
