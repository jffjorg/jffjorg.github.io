 Case Number:  20STCV38710    Hearing Date:   June 3, 2024    Dept:  27 Hon. Lee S. Arian, Dept 27
 
MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
Hearing Date: 6/3/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 20STCV38710 CONCEPION VALADEZ
vs NEWHOPE PINES APARTMENTS
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED
 
On April 30, 2024, the
court granted Defendants' ex parte motion to continue trial and set the new
trial date for July 2, 2024. Plaintiff now moves the court to continue the
trial date for 48 days, arguing that Plaintiff’s counsel has a prepaid vacation
from July 2 to July 25, and has another trial set for July 30, 2024.
The court is not
persuaded by Plaintiff's assertion that he was not given an opportunity to be
heard when the Court, on April 30, 2024, granted Defendants' ex parte
motion to continue the trial and that the Court unilaterally set the current
trial date for July 2, 2024. As noted in the Court's May 9, 2024, minute order,
the Court as a matter of course will, if requested, hear from the opposing
party when it grants an ex parte. Plaintiff made no such request.
However, in
light of Plaintiff’s counsel’s prepaid vacation from July 2, 2024, to July 25,
2024, need to attend another trial nearing its five-year deadline on July 30,
2024, coupled with the lack of opposition and the relatively short extension of
only 48 days, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for a continuance. No further
continuances will be granted.  
 
The new trial date will be August _____,
2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference is continued to _______, at
10:00 a.m. All pretrial dates will not follow the new trial
date, as Plaintiff did not discuss the various factors to extend or reopen
discovery.
