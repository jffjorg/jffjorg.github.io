And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Vanessa Ramos, an individual, vs. Costco. The court has continued the motions to compel further discovery responses to requests for production and special interrogatories, as the parties have failed to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). The IDC is now scheduled for July 19, 2024. The court has continued the motions to compel further, and they will be heard at a later date. The parties are required to submit their intentions regarding the tentative ruling by email to the court, and failure to do so may result in the court adopting the tentative ruling as the final order.
