And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to continue the trial date. The motion was filed on May 7, 2024, and the court reviewed a stipulation by the parties to continue the trial date, setting a new date for October 22, 2024. Since the motion predates the court's order, it is considered moot and denied. The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by emailing the court, and if they do not, they should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
