MOTION TO DISMISS
Hearing Date: 6/3/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 20STCV08781 FRED WAI HUNG YUE
vs. PC PALACES INC
Moving Party: Defendant Always Private
Security Services
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO DISMISS IS GRANTED 
 
On July 19, 2022, Plaintiff
Tzu-Fei Chu filed his First Amended Complaint (FAC) against multiple
defendants, including Defendant Always Private Security Services. On January 23, 2024, Defendant
Always filed a Demurrer to Plaintiff Chu's causes of action for General
Negligence and Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention, and False
Imprisonment. On March 7,
2024, the Court sustained Defendant Always' Demurrer to the
Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention cause of action, with leave to
amend. Later that same day, after the hearing, on March 7, 2024, Defendant
Always filed and served Plaintiff Chu the Notice of Ruling regarding Defendant
Always' Demurrer.  The deadline for
Plaintiff Chu to amend his complaint has since expired. Plaintiff Chu has not
filed an amended complaint nor, at any time since, requested an extension of
time from the Court to do so. Defendant Always now moves the court to dismiss
Chu’s Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention cause of action against Defendant
Always.
CCP section 581
provides that a court may dismiss the complaint as to that defendant when,
after a demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend
the complaint within the time allowed by the court and either party moves for
dismissal. (Code Civ. Proc., § 581(f).) While dismissal
under CCP § 581(f) is
discretionary, any such dismissal must be with prejudice. (Cano v. Glover
(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 326, 330.)
“No cases have held that a dismissal pursuant to section 581, subdivision
(f)(2) may be without prejudice. The right to dismiss without prejudice is
expressly permitted by other subdivisions of section 581 but section 581,
subdivision (f)(2) does not so provide.” (Id. at 229.)
Pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1320, following
a ruling on a demurrer, unless otherwise ordered, leave to answer or amend
within 10 days is deemed granted.
On March 7, 2024,
Plaintiff Chu’s cause of action for Negligent Hiring, Supervision against
Defendant Always was sustained with leave to amend, and Defendant Always filed
and served a notice of that ruling on that same day. Plaintiff did not amend
his complaint within the statutory time period and did not seek an extension
before Defendant filed the present motion on April 15, 2024. Plaintiff also did
not file an opposition to the present motion. Such failure can be construed as
a presumption that Plaintiff has no meritorious argument(s). (See Southern
California Gas Co. v. Flannery (2016), 5 Cal. App. 5th 476, 483, fn.7 (lack
of opposition waives arguments); Sexton v. Superior Court (1997), 58
Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.) Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion, and
Plaintiff Chu’s causes of action for Negligent Hiring, Supervision against
Defendant Always is dismissed with prejudice.
