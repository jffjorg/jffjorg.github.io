And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The motion, filed by the Plaintiff, seeks to compel the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to produce their file on the underlying shooting investigation. The Judge has denied the motion without prejudice, citing a lack of proof of service showing the Sheriff's Department was given notice of the continued hearing date. The Judge notes that the law requires a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena to be personally served on the non-party whose compliance is sought, and that the Sheriff's Department was not given notice of the continued hearing date.
