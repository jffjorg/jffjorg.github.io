Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant Peter Waldstein's motion for summary judgment. The defendant presented evidence that he did not own the subject dog and had never seen it or known of its existence prior to this lawsuit. The judge found that the defendant had met his initial burden to show that there are no triable issues of material fact as to the plaintiff's cause of action for strict liability against him. The burden then shifted to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff failed to file an opposition and therefore failed to meet his burden. The judge also found that the defendant had presented evidence sufficient to show that there are no triable issues of fact as to whether he had any duty to the plaintiff as he did not rent, maintain, live in, control, manage, supervise, or exercise control over a room at The Charlie Hotel, and that he did not own or know of the dog prior to this lawsuit. As a result, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment.
