And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's motion to compel compliance with a subpoena for Plaintiff's imaging records is denied without prejudice. The Defendant must personally serve Keck Medicine USC with the motion, rather than serving by mail, in order to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346. The Judge found that the Defendant's attempt to serve USC by mail was not sufficient, and therefore the motion is denied. The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that a court can compel compliance with a subpoena on terms and conditions that protect parties or witnesses from unreasonable demands, and that personal service is required for a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena.
