And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively decided to take off calendar the defendant's motion to dismiss the case. The motion was filed by the defendant's attorney, Bradley D. Salter, on November 11, 2024. However, since the defendant, Andre Sengul, is self-represented and has not filed a substitution form indicating that Mr. Salter has substituted himself into the case, nor has Mr. Salter filed a notice of limited scope representation, the motion is not being heard. The judge is following California Rules of Court, Rule 3.36, in making this decision.
