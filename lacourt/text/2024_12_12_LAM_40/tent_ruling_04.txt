[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT AND MOTION TO STRIKE AND ORDER TO
SHOW CAUSE RE: STRIKING THE COMPLAINT
 
       Plaintiff,
Brett S. Stettner, a self-represented litigant, filed this action for
declaratory and injunctive relief and for wrongful death on behalf of the
Estate of Suzi G. Stettner and Estate of Tiffany N. Stettner in his capacity as
executor and administrator of these respective estates. 
       The
complaint does not indicate that Mr. Stettner is an active licensee of the
California State Bar, and therefore, cannot represent the Estate Plaintiffs in
this action as doing so would constitute the unauthorized practice of law
without a license. (Estate
of Sanchez (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 331, 339; Hansen
v. Hansen (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 618, 619 ["a conservator,
executor, or personal representative of a decedent's estate who is unlicensed
to practice law cannot appear in propria persona on behalf of the estate in
matters outside the probate proceedings. When such a nonlawyer brings a nonprobate
action in propria persona on behalf of the estate, the proper appellate remedy
is to reverse with directions for the trial court to strike the
complaint."].)
       Therefore,
the Court sets an Order to Show Cause re: Striking the Complaint (see Cal. Code
of Civ., Pro., § 436.) Plaintiff is  HEREBY ORDERED to appear before the
above-entitled court in Department 40, located at 111 N. Hill St., Los Angeles,
California, on March 13, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  Plaintiff is ordered to respond to the OSC
in writing, five [5] calendar days before the hearing. The
hearing on demurrer and motion to strike are continued to the same date.
