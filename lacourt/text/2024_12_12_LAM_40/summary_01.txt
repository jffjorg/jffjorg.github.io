The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant's petition to vacate the arbitration award and granting Plaintiff's motion to confirm the arbitration award and enter judgment.

The case involves a dispute between Xtractor Depot, LLC (Plaintiff) and Usama Tohid (Defendant) over Defendant's alleged misappropriation of funds and breach of contract. The arbitrator issued a final award on August 8, 2024, awarding Plaintiff damages and fees.

Defendant argues that the arbitrator exceeded his powers and that the award is contrary to public policy, citing the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and theArmendariz decision. However, the arbitrator rejected these arguments, finding that Defendant's claims were groundless and that the award of fees was permissible under FEHA.

The Judge has determined that there is no basis to vacate the award and has granted Plaintiff's motion to confirm the arbitration award. The Judge has also ordered Plaintiff to submit a proposed judgment.

In summary, the tentative ruling denies Defendant's petition to vacate the arbitration award and grants Plaintiff's motion to confirm the arbitration award, finding that the arbitrator's award is not contrary to public policy and that the award of fees is permissible under FEHA.
