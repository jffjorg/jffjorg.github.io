TENTATIVE ORDER TAKING
 OFF CALENDAR DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
 
       On
November 11, 2024, the Law Office of Bradley D. Salter filed this motion to dismiss
Defendant, Andre Sengul dba Greenleaf Diamonds from this action. The court’s
file reflects that on August 29, 2024, Defendant’s then counsel, David S. Lin,
substituted out of the case, leaving Defendant Sengul dba Greenleaf as a
self-represented litigant. Defendant has not filed a substitution form indicating
that Mr. Salter has substituted himself into this case in place of Defendant.
Nor has Mr. Salter filed a notice of limited scope representation (Judicial
Council Form CIV-150). (CA
Rules of Court, Rule 3.36.)
       Accordingly,
the motion is taken off calendar.
