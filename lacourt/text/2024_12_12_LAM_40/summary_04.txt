And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff, Brett S. Stettner, must appear in court to show cause why the complaint should not be struck due to his unauthorized practice of law. As a self-represented litigant, Mr. Stettner is not licensed to practice law in California and therefore cannot represent the estates of his late family members in this action. The judge has set a hearing date for March 13, 2024, at which time Mr. Stettner must respond to the order to show cause in writing and appear in court. The hearing on the demurrer to complaint and motion to strike is also continued to the same date.
