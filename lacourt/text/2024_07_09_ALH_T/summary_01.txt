And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's Motion to Change Venue. The Plaintiff, Mariana Acosta, filed a Complaint alleging a motor vehicle accident against the Defendant, Hector Galbusera, and seeks to transfer the action to a trial department in Downtown Los Angeles. The Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient statutory authority to support the motion.

The Judge disagrees with the Defendant's argument, stating that the motion is not a motion for forum non-convenes, but rather a motion to change venue under Code of Civil Procedure Sections 395(a) and 397(c). However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not carried her burden in showing that a change in venue is justifiable. The Judge notes that the standard is not about convenience, but rather about the inconvenience of the venue for the action, and finds that the level of inconvenience is not substantial.

The Judge also rejects the Plaintiff's argument that she would be prejudiced by a trial continuance, stating that it is unlikely that the case would be set any earlier in a downtown courthouse. Therefore, the Judge denies the motion to change venue, protecting the Plaintiff from the perceived prejudice resulting from a trial continuance.
