And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a preliminary injunction in the case of Regina Fair v. Glenis Cardona. The Court granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause on March 5, 2024, ordering defendant to appear and show cause why they should not be prohibited from transferring funds to anyone other than IPX 1031. The Court also entered a temporary restraining order to enjoin the same conduct pending the hearing.

The Court has denied plaintiff's request for relief beyond what was granted in the Order to Show Cause, including plaintiff's request that the Court require defendant to transfer certain funds or direct a non-party (Bank of America) to act.

Plaintiff filed a "Motion for Preliminary Injunction" on March 8, 2024, which the Court disregards because it is non-responsive to the Court's Order to Show Cause.

The Court will issue a preliminary injunction as set forth in the Court's Order to Show Cause, which is not opposed. Plaintiff is directed to submit a Proposed Order in accordance with the Court's ruling and provide Notice.

The temporary restraining order, used on March 5, 2024, dissolves at the conclusion of today's hearing per its terms.
