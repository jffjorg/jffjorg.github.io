## English Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment filed by defendants, W.I. Simonson et al., in the case of Catalan Don v. W.I. Simonson et al.  Plaintiff Don alleges that a mechanic at defendants' repair shop stole the radar sensor and grille from his truck during a service visit.

Defendants argue that the theft never occurred and the parts were never removed. They presented expert testimony from Timothy Saurwein, an automotive forensic expert, who inspected the vehicle and concluded the original parts were present.  Plaintiff Don countered with expert testimony from Thomas Lepper, who opined that the grille was different and that marks near the radar sensor suggested it had been replaced.

The judge finds that the expert testimony creates a conflict regarding whether the parts were removed and replaced, raising a genuine triable issue of fact.  Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Catalan Don v. W.I. Simonson et al. The defendants, Sonic et al., have moved for summary judgment, arguing that the alleged theft of a radar sensor and grille from the plaintiff's truck never occurred. The judge has reviewed the evidence presented by both sides, including expert testimony from Timothy Saurwein and Thomas Lepper.

The judge has determined that the expert testimony is in conflict, with Saurwein concluding that the original parts were present and had never been removed, and Lepper opining that the grille and sensor had been replaced. This conflict raises a question of material fact, which means that the case cannot be resolved through summary judgment.

Accordingly, the judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, allowing the case to proceed to trial.

---

The Judge, in a tentative ruling for the case Catalan Don v. W.I. Simonson et al., case number 22SMCV00785, has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment regarding the removal and replacement of a radar sensor and grille from the plaintiff's truck during a service visit. The Judge applied a three-step process in determining the summary judgment, which includes identifying the issues, determining whether the moving party made an adequate showing that negates the opponent's claim, and determining whether the opposing party raised a triable issue of fact.

The defense presented an expert, Timothy Saurwein, who concluded that the original grille and radar sensor were present and had never been removed. However, the plaintiff's expert, Thomas Lepper, stated that the grille is different from the one present before the car was left with the defendants, and there are small marks or scratches near the radar sensor, suggesting the unit had been replaced and changed.

The Judge has found that the expert testimony is in conflict as to whether the parts were removed and replaced, raising a question of material fact, and has therefore denied the motion for summary judgment.
