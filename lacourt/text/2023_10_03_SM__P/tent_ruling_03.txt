 Case Number:  23SMCV01639    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling 
Freeman et al. v.
Williams et al., Case No. 23SMCV01639
Hearing Date October
3, 2023   
Defendant Williams
as Trustee Demurrer’s to First Amended Complaint 
 
On September 13,
2023 the court ruled on the demurrer Williams filed in his individual capacity,
but did not rule on the demurrer filed in his capacity as trustee. As trustee,
Williams demurs only to the tenth cause of action for breach of promissory note.

 
A cause of action
for breach of a written contract is subject to a four-year statute of
limitations. Cochran v. Cochran (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1115, 1120. The
delayed discovery rule generally does not apply to breach of contract causes of
action, unless the breaches are committed in secret and where the harm flowing
from those breaches will not be reasonably discoverable by plaintiffs until a
future time. April Enterprises, Inc. v. KTTV (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 805,
832. 
 
Williams argues
Freeman’s tenth cause of action for breach of contract is barred by the statute
of limitations, citing the promissory note, which states full payment is due by
January 11, 2007, so the statute of limitations expired January 11, 2011. FAC
exhibit 2 ¶4. 
 
The FAC alleges
delayed discovery, that Freeman as trustee was not aware of the note until
recently. FAC at ¶130. The FAC does not specifically allege the breach was
“committed in secret,” or that Freeman’s alleged breach was not “reasonably
discoverable” by plaintiff. FAC ¶130. Freeman failed to allege this is the type
of contract action where the delayed discovery rule applies. SUSTAINED with ten
days leave to amend.
