The court has ruled that this cause of action is subject to a four-year statute of limitations, and since the promissory note was due by January 11, 2007, the statute of limitations expired on January 11, 2011. The plaintiff, Freeman, has alleged delayed discovery of the promissory note, but failed to specifically allege that the breach was "committed in secret" or that the harm was not "reasonably discoverable" by plaintiff. Therefore, the court has sustained the demurrer with ten days' leave to amend.

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Williams as Trustee to the first amended complaint (FAC) alleging breach of contract. The court has sustained the demurrer with ten days' leave to amend. The court found that the FAC does not specifically allege that the breach was committed in secret or that the harm was not reasonably discoverable by the plaintiff, and therefore the delayed discovery rule does not apply. The court also noted that the statute of limitations for breach of a written contract is four years, and since the promissory note states full payment is due by January 11, 2007, the statute of limitations expired on January 11, 2011. The court is giving Freeman an opportunity to amend the complaint to correct these defects.

English summary:
The case summary is for Freeman et al. v. Williams et al., case number 23SMCV01639, with a hearing date of October 3, 2023. The defendant, Williams as trustee, filed a demurrer for the tenth cause of action for breach of a promissory note. The court previously ruled on the demurrer filed in Williams' individual capacity but did not rule on the demurrer filed as trustee.

The statute of limitations for breach of a written contract is four years. However, the delayed discovery rule does not apply to breach of contract causes of action unless the breaches are committed in secret and the harm flowing from those breaches will not be reasonably discoverable by plaintiffs until a future time.

Williams argues that Freeman's cause of action for breach of contract is barred by the statute of limitations, citing the promissory note, which states full payment is due by January 11, 2007. Therefore, the statute of limitations expired on January 11, 2011.

However, the FAC alleges delayed discovery, stating that Freeman as trustee was not aware of the note until recently. The FAC does not specifically allege that the breach was committed in secret or that Freeman's alleged breach was not reasonably discoverable. Freeman failed to allege that this is the type of contract action where the delayed discovery rule applies.

Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer with ten days leave to amend.
