And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Freeman et al. v. Williams et al. The defendant, Williams, filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint (FAC) in his capacity as trustee, specifically challenging the tenth cause of action for breach of promissory note. The court has ruled that this cause of action is subject to a four-year statute of limitations, and since the promissory note was due by January 11, 2007, the statute of limitations expired on January 11, 2011. The plaintiff, Freeman, has alleged delayed discovery of the promissory note, but failed to specifically allege that the breach was "committed in secret" or that the harm was not "reasonably discoverable" by plaintiff. Therefore, the court has sustained the demurrer with ten days' leave to amend.
