Judge's Tentative Ruling

Case No. 22SMCV02594

Counsel Santo Riccobono has moved to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Ramona Hashemy Rad, citing a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The motion includes all required judicial council forms and was served on opposing counsel and the client. The breakdown of the relationship makes it impossible for counsel to effectively represent the client, which is a valid basis for withdrawal. Since the trial is more than six months away, there is sufficient time to secure replacement counsel without suffering undue prejudice. The motion is granted, and Counsel Riccobono is relieved as counsel for plaintiff Rad.
