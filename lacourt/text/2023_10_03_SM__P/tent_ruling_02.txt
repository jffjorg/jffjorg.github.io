Rad v. Mirama
Enterprises, Case No. 22SMCV02594
Hearing Date
October 3, 2023 
Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Ramona Hashemy Rad (UNOPPOSED)
 
Counsel Santo
Riccobono moves to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Rad. The motion
includes all three required judicial council forms (MC-051-MC-053) and was
served on opposing counsel and on the client, whose address was confirmed by
telephone. 
 
Riccobono states
“there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship precluding
counsel’s ability to effectively represent the client in this matter.” This is
a valid basis for withdrawal. Trial is more than six months away, scheduled for
April 29, 2024. There are no other substantive motions calendared. There is
sufficient time to secure replacement counsel without suffering undue
prejudice. GRANTED.
