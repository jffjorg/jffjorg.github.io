  Case Number:  23STCP01368    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Plaintiff to Confirm Arbitration
Award and to Enter Judgment in Conformity Therewith.
 
The unopposed motion is granted.
The Court finds that a notice of continuance was filed
on 1/17/24.  
The Court confirms the award as made.
 
On 4/27/23, MEXFUSION FZ, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition
to Confirm Arbitration against KEVURU GAMES, LTD (“Respondent”).  On 5/30/23, Petitioner filed a motion
requesting the Court to confirm an arbitration award as a judgment. The motion has
been continued twice and Petitioner gave notice to Respondent of the current
hearing date.   
Grounds for the motion now before the Court include
(1) the award follows a contested AAA arbitration between the parties regarding
Respondent’s breach of a “Game Productions Services Agreement” due to failing
to provide video game producing services, (2) the 1/6/23 AAA arbitration award
is in the amount of $793,644.00 (which includes attorney’s fees, costs, and
interest) against Respondent (Decl. Litwak, ¶7, Ex. 4), and (3) Respondent did
nothing to seek vacatur or correction of the award within the deadline.
Unless a petition or response seeking to correct or
vacate an arbitration award was filed properly based upon valid grounds, or the
proceeding is dismissed, courts are required to enter judgment in conformity
with the award. Valsan Partners Ltd. Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818. A court’s judgment may not go beyond
the boundaries of an arbitration award, but instead the judgment must be
inconformity with the award.  Ibid. at
819. “‘[T]he court shall confirm the award as made …, unless in accordance with
this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the
award or dismisses the proceeding.’”  Law
Offices of David S. Karton v. Segreto (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1, 8.  
Petitioner attached a copy of the arbitration award to
the motion, which reflects that the final arbitration award is $793,644.00 in
favor of Petitioner. (Decl. Litwak, Ex. 4.) Respondent did not seek to vacate
or modify the award. Therefore, the motion is granted.
