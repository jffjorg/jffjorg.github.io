And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from prosecuting evictions against the plaintiff related to a property at 4757 S. Mansfield, Los Angeles, CA. The defendants, including Mural Media, LLC 401k Plan, argue that the plaintiff cannot show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims because she executed five agreements to "release" all potential claims against the defendants. The court agrees that the existence of these release agreements militates against the plaintiff's claims, and that the plaintiff's failure to tender the debt on the property also weighs against her claims. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to support her contention that Mural Media does not have standing to originate the loan for the property or foreclose on the property. Therefore, the motion is denied.
