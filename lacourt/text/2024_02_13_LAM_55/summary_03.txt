The motion was filed on January 9, 2024, and is set for hearing on February 13, 2024. However, on January 25, 2024, counsel for the parties informed the Court that the case had settled and they were working on finalizing the settlement. Despite this, no request for dismissal has been filed and the Court has not received any request from Defendant Shangri-La to remove the motion from the calendar. The Court finds that the moving counsel has provided sufficient grounds for withdrawal, as stated in the Rules of Professional Conduct and the State Bar Act. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the Court will sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
