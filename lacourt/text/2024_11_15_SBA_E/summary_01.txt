(Civil Code § 3294 subd. (a))

Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Demurrer to the third cause of action and Motion to Strike punitive damages with leave to amend. The Court finds that the Complaint fails to adequately plead a cause of action for intentional tort and premises liability. Specifically, the Complaint lacks specific facts showing that the Defendant authorized or knew of the alleged malicious acts taken by its employees. The Court also finds that the Complaint fails to plead facts showing that the Defendant engaged in "despicable conduct" with a willful disregard for others' rights or safety, which is required to support a claim for punitive damages.

The Court further finds that the Plaintiff's claims do not meet the standard for punitive damages, as mere negligence does not justify such an award. The Court also notes that the Complaint relies on conclusory statements about the employees' actions being malicious and oppressive, rather than providing specific facts to support such claims.

The Judge's ruling is based on the following legal authorities:

* Civil Code section 3294, which governs punitive damages
* Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.10, 430.41, 435, 436, and 452, which govern demurrers and motions to strike
* Various California appellate court decisions, including Blank v. Kirwan, C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist., Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist., Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp., Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc., Haworth v. Elliott, Yamaguchi v. Harnsmut, Clauson v. Superior Court, College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court, Pfeifer v. John Crane, Inc., and Taylor v. Superior Court.
