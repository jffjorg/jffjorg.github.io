And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The plaintiffs, Randy Bronson, Ricky Bronson, Robby Bronson, and Joy Bronson, filed a lawsuit against CalPortland Company, alleging that Ronald Bronson developed mesothelioma from exposure to the company's asbestos-containing products. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in the alternative, arguing that the plaintiffs cannot establish exposure to its products.

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to shift the burden to the defendant to demonstrate the existence of disputed facts. The defendant's reliance on the deposition testimony of the plaintiffs' brothers, Randy and Ricky Bronson, was insufficient to conclusively negate the necessary element of exposure to the defendant's products.

However, the judge has granted the motion for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim, finding that the plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence to show that the defendant engaged in despicable conduct and conscious disregard for the safety of others. The plaintiffs' response to the defendant's special interrogatory and request for production was conclusory and did not cite facts showing that the defendant had information at the management level about the dangers of asbestos in its products and made a willful and conscious decision to disregard the safety of others.
