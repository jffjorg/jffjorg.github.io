And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case. The defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has moved to compel the plaintiff, Mishaun Dillon, to respond to two requests: a request for a statement of damages and a list of all parties. The plaintiff has failed to respond to both requests. The court grants the defendant's motion to compel a response to the request for a statement of damages, ordering the plaintiff to serve a statement of damages within 20 days. However, the court denies the defendant's motion to compel a response to the request for a list of all parties, as the defendant did not provide a statutory basis for ordering the plaintiff to respond. The court also declines to award sanctions to the defendant, as the defendant only sought sanctions under the Code of Civil Procedure and did not seek sanctions under the California Rules of Court.
