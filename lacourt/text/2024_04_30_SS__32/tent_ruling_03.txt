participant and an owner/operator still owe certain duties of care. Such duties
vary according to the role played by a particular defendant involved in the
activity. [Citation.] For example, a batter, i.e., a participant in a baseball
game, has no duty to avoid carelessly throwing a bat after hitting a ball—such
conduct being an inherent risk of the sport. However, the ballpark owner,
because of his or her different relationship to the sport, may have a duty to
take reasonable measures to protect spectators from carelessly thrown bats. [Citation.]”
