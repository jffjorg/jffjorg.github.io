```
And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court grants Defendant Southern California Edison Company's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court finds that the primary assumption of the risk doctrine applies to the case, meaning that the Defendant did not owe a duty of care to the Plaintiff's decedent, Jonathyn Bradford, as the risk of drowning was inherent in the activity of swimming in an outdoor lake. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress fail as the Defendant did not breach a duty of care to the Plaintiff.

The Court concludes that the Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted and that the case will proceed no further. The Defendant shall serve and file a proposed judgment within 10 days.
