And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Elina Shakhbazyan, counsel for plaintiff Kecia Covington. The motion is filed due to a breakdown in communication between the plaintiff and counsel, with counsel unable to confirm the plaintiff's current address despite mailing motion papers to the plaintiff's last known address and calling the plaintiff's last known telephone numbers. The court finds this to be a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the court orders counsel to file an amended proposed order within 5 calendar days of the hearing, including information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by any party. Counsel must also serve the signed order within 10 days of the date of the order and file a proof of service. The court conditionally grants the motion pending counsel's filing and service of the updated proposed order.
