And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the petition to approve the compromise of the disputed claim of minor A.L. (age 5) is continued for 60 days due to several issues. The court finds the settlement to be reasonable, but the petition lacks a proposed order and order to deposit into a blocked account. Additionally, the defendants have not been served with the petition. The court orders counsel to file the necessary orders and serve the defendants. The moving party is also ordered to give notice of the continuance. The Judge excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call.
