And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the motions filed by Defendant Edgar Munoz to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production, as well as his request for sanctions. The Defendant served the Plaintiff, Jing Ying Huang, with the discovery requests on September 1, 2023, but the Plaintiff failed to provide responses. The Defendant subsequently served verified responses on January 12, 2024. The Court finds that the motions to compel responses are moot because the Plaintiff has already provided responses. As for the request for sanctions, the Court denies it because the Plaintiff has provided substantial justification for the failure to serve timely responses, and the opposition was not unsuccessfully made.
