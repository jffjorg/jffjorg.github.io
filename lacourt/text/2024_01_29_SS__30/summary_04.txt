And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff has moved to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most qualified (PMQs) and to compel the production of documents. The defendant has objected to the deposition notice on the grounds that the date was set unilaterally by the plaintiff's counsel and that the categories for the PMQs were not specified with reasonable particularity. The court finds that the defendant's objections are improper and that the deposition notice is sufficient.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the PMQs and orders the defendant to produce the PMQs within 20 days. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions and orders the City of Redondo Beach to pay $1,691.25 in sanctions to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days.

The court denies the defendant's request for sanctions and finds that the defendant did not act with substantial justification in failing to meet and confer over the document requests and Strickfaden's deposition. The court concludes that the defendant's failure to produce the PMQs and failing to meet and confer over the document requests and Strickfaden's deposition justify the award of sanctions.
