And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling is related to an unlawful detainer matter. On March 16, 2023, the Court issued a minute order that stated Happy Sky Inc. is the owner of the property and is deemed in possession of it. The matter was stayed for Novelette D. Woods and was referred to the United States Attorney's Office. A new eviction case was filed and proceeded to trial, with a finding for Woods on a motion for nonsuit based on the previous ruling. Happy Sky Inc. is now seeking clarification on who has the right to possession of the premises. The Court is unclear on what ambiguity exists and what effect it has. The matter will be discussed further at the motion hearing.
