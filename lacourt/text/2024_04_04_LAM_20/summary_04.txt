And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court granted Plaintiff Shahla Melamed's motion to compel further responses from Defendant Vasel Malota. Since Malota failed to comply with the Court's November 20, 2023, ruling, Melamed seeks terminating sanctions against him. California discovery law authorizes a range of penalties for conduct amounting to "misuse of the discovery process." The Court finds that Malota's failure to comply with discovery orders constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. The Court grants the motion for terminating sanctions and strikes Malota's Answer, entering a default against him.
