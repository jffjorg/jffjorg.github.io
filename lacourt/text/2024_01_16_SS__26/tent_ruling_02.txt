Discussion
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code section 798.61, Petitioner
seeks a court order deeming the mobilehome (“the Mobilehome”), located at 2451
W. Soledad Canyon Road, Space No. 9, Acton, California (“the Space”), to be
abandoned, and awarding Petitioner rent due on the Mobilehome site from June 1,
2021 to the present, accruing at $561.00 per month, plus other applicable
charges, costs, and attorney’s fees. (Pet., ¶¶6, 17.) 
 
A.         Determination of “Abandoned
Mobilehome”—Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1), an “abandoned mobilehome” means
a mobilehome about which all of the following are true:
 
(A) It is located in a
mobilehome park on a site for which no rent has been paid to the management for
the preceding 60 days.
 
(B)
It is unoccupied.
 
(C)
A reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned.
 
(D)
It is not permanently affixed to the land.
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (a)(1).) The verified Petition and
supporting declaration attest that Respondent is the owner of the Mobilehome
that occupies the Space. (Pet., ¶6 and Exh. A at pp. 15-16; Supp. Schell Decl.,
¶4.) In 2015, Respondent entered into a lease agreement with Petitioner for the
Space on which the Mobilehome is located. (Pet., Exh. A; Supp. Schell Decl.,
Exh. A.) A Notice of Belief of Abandonment on the Mobilehome was posted on August
31, 2022. (Id. at Exh. 2.) The Notice of Belief of Abandonment was
posted on and mailed by certified mail with return receipt requested to the
Mobilehome but no response has been made. (Id. at Exhs. B-C.) This
evidence demonstrates that the Mobilehome is unoccupied and a reasonable person
would believe the Mobilehome to be abandoned. Therefore, Petitioner has
demonstrated that the Mobilehome is abandoned within the meaning of Civil Code
section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1).
 
B.         Notice of Belief of Abandonment—Civ.
Code § 798.61(b)
 
Civil Code, section
798.61, subdivision (b) requires: 
 
“After determining a mobilehome
in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome, the management shall post a
notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome for not less than 30 days,
and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known address and to any known
registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and to any known holder of a
security interest in the abandoned mobilehome. This notice shall be mailed by
registered or certified mail with a return receipt requested.”


(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (b).) Petitioner attached a
Notice of the Belief of Abandonment to the Petition and demonstrates that it
was served on Respondents by posting and certified mail. (Pet., Exhs. B-C.)
This satisfies the requirements of Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (b).
 
C.        Petition for Judicial Declaration—Civ.
Code § 798.61(c)
 
Civ. Code § 798.61(c)(1) states:
 
“Thirty or more days following posting
pursuant to subdivision (b), the management may file a petition in the superior
court in the county in which the mobilehome park is located, for a judicial
declaration of abandonment of the mobilehome. A proceeding under this
subdivision is a limited civil case.  Copies
of the petition shall be served upon the homeowner, any known registered owner,
and any known person having a lien or security interest of record in the
mobilehome by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing copies to those
persons at their last known addresses by registered or certified mail with a
return receipt requested in the United States mail, postage prepaid.”  (Emphasis added.)
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (c)(1).) Acton is located within
the County of Los Angeles, which is within this Court’s jurisdiction. The Court
further determines that the Petition was filed more than 30 days after the
Notice of Belief of Abandonment was posted. Additionally, the Petition and
Notice of Hearing were served on Respondents on August 24, 2023 by posting and
certified mail with return receipt requested. (Proofs of Service by Posting,
filed 09/06/23.) 
 
D.        Charges, Attorneys’ Fees, and Costs
 
“If, at the hearing, the petitioner shows by a preponderance
of the evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has been
satisfied and no party establishes an interest therein at the hearing and
tenders all past due rent and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment
of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to which the petitioner is
entitled, and award attorney's fees and costs to the petitioner.” (Civ. Code, §
798.61, subd. (d)(2).) Petitioner asks for accrued rent/storage fees on the
Space in the amount of $14,869.44 for rental/storage charges accruing from June
1, 2021, through October 12, 2023, attorney’s fees of $836.08, and costs of
$564.57.

Petitioner Gemstone, LLC’s Petition to Declare Mobilehome
Abandoned is GRANTED. JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN PETITIONER’S FAVOR IN THE
AMOUNT OF $14,869.44 PRINCIPAL, $836.08 ATTORNEY’S FEES, AND $564.57 COSTS.
