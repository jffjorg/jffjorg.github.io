ANALYSIS:
 
On August 24, 2023, Plaintiffs Joseph L. Brzuska and Virgil
L. Severns (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant 
action for violation
of Consumer Legal Remedies Act, violation of Business & Professions Code
section 17200, et seq., and claim against surety against Defendants MIG
Motor Cars, Inc. dba M. Motorsport (“Defendant MIG”) and Hudson Insurance
Company (“Defendant Hudson”). The action arises out of Plaintiff’s purchase of
a motor vehicle regarding which certain facts were not disclosed. (Compl.,
filed 08/24/23, ¶¶14-37.) Defendants MIG filed an answer on October 4, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration
against Defendant MIG on October 27,
2023. Defendant MIG filed an opposition on December 4, 2023 and an
amended opposition on December 19, 2023. Plaintiff replied on January 9, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
The Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281, et seq., which provides in relevant part: 
 
On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists, unless it determines that:
 
(a) The right to compel arbitration has
been waived by the petitioner; or 
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of
the agreement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subds. (a)-(b).) Plaintiffs
provide evidence of the existence of the arbitration agreement in the Retail
Installment Sales Contract (“RISC”). (Motion, Heydari Decl., Exh. 2, p. 6; Exh.
3.) On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff requested that Defendant MIG agree to arbitrate
the parties’ dispute. (Id. at Heydari Decl., ¶¶3-4 and Exh. 1.) Defendant
MIG has not agreed to arbitration. (Ibid.) Therefore, Plaintiffs have
demonstrated that they are entitled to an order compelling Defendant MIG to
arbitration pursuant to the terms of the arbitration agreement. 
 
In opposition, Defendant MIG argues that there are
insufficient allegations of an “arbitrable controversy” because Plaintiff
signed numerous disclosures regarding the condition of the subject motor
vehicle. (Opp., Mahmoudi Decl., ¶2 and Exhs. A-D.) The opposition argument that
these exhibits overcome the allegations in the Complaint, however, is itself
proof of the existence of an arbitrable controversy regarding the merits of
each party’s position. Defendant MIG then argues that Plaintiff has not
attached or cited the arbitration provision on the grounds that the RISC cited
above is not properly authenticated. This objection is overruled as it does not
address Plaintiffs’ affidavit attesting that the attached RISC is the one they
signed. (Motion, Exh. 3.)
 
Finally, Defendant MIG argues that Plaintiffs have waived
the right to arbitration by responding the discovery propounded by Defendant
MIG and propounding a deposition subpoena to a third party. (Opp., Anaya Decl.,
¶¶2-3; Supp. Opp., p. 2:1-13.) Regarding waiver, 
 
State law, like the FAA, reflects a
strong policy favoring arbitration agreements and requires close judicial
scrutiny of waiver claims. (Christensen v. Dewor Developments (1983) 33 Cal.3d
778, 782, 191 Cal.Rptr. 8, 661 P.2d 1088.) Although a court may deny a petition
to compel arbitration on the ground of waiver (§ 1281.2, subd. (a)), waivers
are not to be lightly inferred and the party seeking to establish a waiver
bears a heavy burden of proof. [Citations omitted.]
 
In Sobremonte v. Superior Court (1998)
61 Cal.App.4th 980, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 43, the Court of Appeal referred to the
following factors: “In determining waiver, a court can consider ‘(1) whether
the party's actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate; (2) whether
“the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked” and the parties “were
well into preparation of a lawsuit” before the party notified the opposing
party of an intent to arbitrate; (3) whether a party either requested
arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period
before seeking a stay; (4) whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a
counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings; (5) “whether
important intervening steps [e.g., taking advantage of judicial discovery
procedures not available in arbitration] had taken place”; and (6) whether the
delay “affected, misled, or prejudiced” the opposing party.’ ”
 
(St. Agnes Medical Center v. PacifiCare of California
(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1187, 1195-1196.) Defendant MIG has not met this “heavy
burden of proof.” The action was filed in August 2023 and the instant Motion
was brought two months later with only minimal discovery participation. The
litigation machinery has not been substantially invoked, nor did Plaintiff
bring this Motion close to the trial date or after substantial delay. 
 
Therefore, Defendant MIG has not demonstrated grounds to
deny the instant Motion. In light of the Motion to Compel Arbitration being
granted, a stay of the action is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.4.

Plaintiffs Joseph L. Brzuska and Virgil L. Severns’ Motion to
Compel Arbitration is GRANTED. THE ACTION IS STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION.
