And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Ron L. Martinez's motion to vacate an involuntary lien. The motion was filed on September 20, 2023, after the plaintiff, Eric B. Dees, filed an action against the defendant on February 27, 2023, and default judgment was entered on May 24, 2023. The defendant failed to provide a memorandum of points and authorities, as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113, and the court agrees with the plaintiff's opposition that the defendant's response still does not contain such a memorandum. Therefore, the motion is denied.
