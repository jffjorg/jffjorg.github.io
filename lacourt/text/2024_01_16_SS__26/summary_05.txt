And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that, if the bankruptcy stay is lifted, the judgment creditor's motion for an assignment order, restraining order, and accounting will be granted. The judgment creditor is seeking to obtain payments from the judgment debtor's customers, including PH Construction, Inc., NHA Construction, Inc., and others. The judgment creditor has reason to believe that the judgment debtor is receiving payments from these customers. The judge will grant the motion if the bankruptcy stay is lifted, but will continue the matter if the stay is not lifted.
