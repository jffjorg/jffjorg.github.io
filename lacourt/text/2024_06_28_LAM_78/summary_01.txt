And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff Juliana Payne's motion for reconsideration of the court's July 31, 2023 order granting defendant Ryan Charles's motions to set aside default and quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court previously found that Charles is a resident of Maryland and that plaintiff failed to meet her burden of demonstrating jurisdiction. In support of her motion, plaintiff argues that Charles voluntarily participated as a streamer on Twitch, a California company, and that he streamed to a global audience, including to users in California. However, the court finds that plaintiff fails to show diligence in this matter and fails to explain how these are new matters that the court did not consider previously. The court also finds that plaintiff's evidence is insufficient to support her claims. Therefore, the court denies plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
