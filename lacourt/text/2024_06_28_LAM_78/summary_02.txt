And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendants Daniel Lamotte and Paul Stewart is granted. The case is stayed pending arbitration, and a status conference is set for January 30, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.

The Judge found that an arbitration agreement exists and that the Plaintiff's signature is authentic. The scope of the agreement covers the Plaintiff's claims against the Movants, and the Movants are third-party beneficiaries of the agreement.

The Judge also analyzed the delegation clause of the agreement, which states that issues of enforceability are to be determined by the arbitrator. The Judge found that the language of the delegation clause is clear and unmistakable and that the parties intended to delegate the issue to the arbitrator. The Judge also found that the delegation clause is not unconscionable and that there are no other reasons why it would be revocable under state contract defenses.

Therefore, the Judge ruled that the delegation clause is enforceable, and issues of enforceability must go to the arbitrator.
