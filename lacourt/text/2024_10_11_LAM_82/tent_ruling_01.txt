Order Granting Petition for Relief from
Government Claims Requirement
 
 
INTRODUCTION
 
            Petitioner
Trenice Shanae Smith (“Petitioner”) petitions for an order relieving Petitioner
from the claim presentation requirement of Government Code section 945.4 with
respect to her claim for damages against Respondent City of Los Angeles
(“Respondent” or the “City”).  The City
opposes the petition, which is granted.  
 
BACKGROUND
 
             On April 17, 2023, Petitioner was involved in
an “automobile v. automobile … accident … [with] Carlos Luis Acosta, a City of
Los Angeles employee with the Los Angeles Police Department.”  (Petition (“Pet.”) ¶ 3.)  “A comprehensive traffic collision report was
conducted and prepared by the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles Police Department.”  (Id. ¶ 4; see also Hayes Decl. ¶ 2
& Exh. A.)  The traffic report states
that, after the accident, Petitioner complained of “pain to lower
abdomen.”  (Hayes Decl. Exh. A at 3 of
12.)  The report also states that Acosta
“was the cause of this traffic crash by making an unsafe lane change.”  (Id. at 11 of 12.)
 
            Petitioner
retained counsel before the deadline to file a government claim but counsel’s
staff inputted the wrong “date of loss” into the case management system.  (Galajian Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  Counsel discovered the error and attempted to
reach Petitioner before the deadline but was unable to do so.  (Id. ¶ 5.) 
Petitioner was hospitalized on October 16, 2023, due to complications
from her pregnancy.  (Smith Decl. ¶
4.)  On October 17, 2023, Petitioner was
induced to give birth.  (Id. ¶ 5.)  On October 19, 2023, Petitioner underwent “an
emergency cesarean section procedure.” 
(Id. ¶ 6.)  Petitioner was
hospitalized for approximately five days following the birth of her child and
was “limited in [her] ability to use and access [her] cellular device and/or
other devices.”  (Id. ¶ 7.)
 
On October 19, 2023, Mgdesyan Law
Firm presented a claim for damages to City. 
(Pet. ¶ 6.)  The City denied the
claim on the grounds it was untimely in a letter dated October 31, 2023.  (Ibid.; Hayes Decl. Exh. C.)  Petitioner’s counsel submitted an application
for leave to present a late claim.  (Hayes
Decl. ¶ 2 & Exh. D.)  The cover
letter is dated March 4, 2024; the letter is post-marked March 6, 2024; and the
City received the application on March 8, 2024. 
(Hayes Decl. ¶ 2 & Exh. D.) 
The City denied the application on April 2, 2024.  (Id. Exh. E.)  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Government Code
section 911.2(a) states that “a claim relating to a cause of action for death
or for injury to person or to personal property . . . shall be presented . . .
not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  If a claimant fails to make a claim within
six months pursuant to Government Code section 911.2, the claimant may make a
written application to the board of the public entity for permission to present
a late claim within a reasonable time but not to exceed one year from the
accrual of the cause of action.  (Gov.
Code § 911.4(a)-(b).)  If, pursuant to
the provisions of Government Code section 911.6, the board denies the
application to present a late claim, the claimant may petition the Court for
relief from the requirements of Government Code section 945.4.  (Gov. Code § 946.6(a).)
 
Government Code
section 946.6(b) requires that the petition to the court must show each of the
following: (1) that the late claim application made to the board was denied or
deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to present the claim within six
months of the accrual of the cause of action; and (3) the contents of the claim
as required by Government Code section 910. 
The petition must be filed within six months after the application to
present a late claim to the board was denied or deemed to be denied.  (Ibid.) 

 
The petitioner
bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the
late-claim application was made within a reasonable time and that one of the
statutory requirements under Government Code section 946.6(c) was met.  (Drummond
v. County of Fresno (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1406, 1410.)  Under section 946.4(e), the trial court must
make its determination upon the petition, “relying upon any affidavits in
support of, or in opposition to, the petition and any additional evidence
received at hearing on the petition.”  (Ebersol v. Cowan (1983) 35 Cal.3d 427,
431.)  
 
“Section 946.6 is
a remedial statue intended to provide relief from technical rules which
otherwise provide a trap for the unwary claimant.”  (Id. at 435.)  “[D]oubts will be resolved in favor of the
party attempting to get to trial to the end that wherever possible, cases may
be heard on their merits.”  (Kaslavage
v. West Kern County Water Dist. (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 529, 537.)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Petitioner’s claim for damages arose on April 17, 2023, which is the
date of the accident.  Petitioner filed
her government claim on October 19, 2023, two days after the six-month
limitations period expired.  Accordingly,
City denied the claim as untimely. 
(Hayes Decl. Exhs. B & C.)  Petitioner
the submitted a written application to City for leave to present a late claim
on or about March 8, 2024, within one year of accrual of Petitioner’s
claim.  (Id. Exh. D.)  The court finds that the late-claim
application was made within a “reasonable time.”  (See Gov. Code 
§ 911.4(a)-(b).)  Petitioner establishes sufficient good
cause.  The failure to present a timely
government claim was largely due to the error of counsel, and the court finds
counsel’s staff’s typographical error to be excusable neglect.  After discovering the error, counsel was
unable to file a government claim in the days before the deadline due to
Plaintiff’s hospitalization.  This
constitutes good cause.      
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The petition
for relief from the government claims requirement under Government Code section
945.5 is granted.
 
            2.         The
parties shall meet-and-confer and lodge a proposed judgment if necessary.
 
            3.         Petitioner’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED
