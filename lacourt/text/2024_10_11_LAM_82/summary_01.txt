Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Petitioner's petition for relief from the government claims requirement under Government Code section 945.5. The Petitioner, Trenice Shanae Smith, was involved in an automobile accident on April 17, 2023, and filed a government claim on October 19, 2023, two days after the six-month limitations period expired. The City denied the claim as untimely. The Petitioner then submitted a written application to the City for leave to present a late claim on or about March 8, 2024, within one year of accrual of the claim. The Judge finds that the late-claim application was made within a "reasonable time" and that the Petitioner establishes sufficient good cause for the late filing. The failure to present a timely government claim was largely due to the error of counsel, and the Judge finds counsel's staff's typographical error to be excusable neglect. After discovering the error, counsel was unable to file a government claim in the days before the deadline due to the Petitioner's hospitalization. This constitutes good cause. The Judge orders that the petition for relief from the government claims requirement is granted, and the parties shall meet and confer and lodge a proposed judgment if necessary.
