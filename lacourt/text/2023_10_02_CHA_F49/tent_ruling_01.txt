SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant, Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial
Hospital
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff, Ronald Nevarez, et al.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion for Summary Judgment on the First Amended
Complaint for Wrongful Death and Negligence
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On December 26, 2018, 68 year-old Sylvia Nevarez
presented to the emergency room at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital with
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Sylvia also indicated “chest discomfort” three
weeks earlier. After an examination and tests, Hospital offered admission, but
Sylvia elected to leave and return home. 

 
Sometime after discharge, the cardiology tests were
apparently reviewed. Sylvia was apparently still on the premises however, and
placed in the “cardiac catheritization lab” by cardiologist James Lee. Sylvia
subsequently became unresponsive, and was not successful resuscitated that
evening. Plaintiffs contend the death was the result of the delayed diagnosis
and treatment.
 
On May 10, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for
Negligence. On March 2, 2022, Plaintiffs dismissed James Lee, M.D. On October
3, 2022, the parties stipulated to the filing of a first amended complaint. On
October 31, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint for Wrongful
Death and Negligence. On February 28, 2022, the court overruled the demurrer of
Darrin Privett, M.D. 
 
On April 7, 2023, the case was transferred from
Department 27 (Personal Injury) to Department 49. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (Hospital)
moves for summary judgment on grounds that the complaint is barred by the
statute of limitations, the care and treatment rendered by Hospital staff complied
with the standard of care at all times, and that no act or omission by staff
caused or contributed to the wrongful death of Sylvia. Plaintiffs in opposition
challenges any bar under the statute of limitations, and presents counter
expert testimony regarding the standard of care and causation. Hospital in
reply reiterates the bar under the statute of limitations. Hospital also denies
any challenge of ostensible agency. Finally, Plaintiff contends the deposition
testimony of Dr. Eckstein is inadmissible on the issue of emergency room care.
 
The pleadings
frame the issues for motions, “since it is those allegations to which
the motion must respond. (Citation.)” 
(Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37
Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)  
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.” (Lyons v.
Security Pacific National Bank (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation
omitted).)
 
Statute of Limitations
Hospital contends the complaint is barred by the one-year statute of
limitations. Sylvia passed away on December 26, 2018, and the complaint was not
filed until May 10, 2021. Hospital relies on the deposition testimony from
widower, Ronald Nevarez, about admitted suspicion in January 2019. Plaintiffs
in opposition contend that the admission of suspicion insufficiently
constitutes a basis for awareness, and because three different doctors were
involved, Plaintiffs were entitled to 270 days of statutory extension (90 days
per notice with staggered dates of 12-17-20, 9-9-21, 2-22-22). 
 
Generally, a statute of limitations begins to run “when the cause of
action is complete with all of its elements”—namely, wrongdoing, causation, and
resulting harm.  (Norgart v. Upjohn Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397; Pooshs v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2011)
51 Cal.4th 788, 797 [“A cause of action accrues ‘when [it] is complete with all
of its elements’—those elements being wrongdoing, harm, and causation”].) An
exception to the general rule on accrual is identified as the “discovery rule.”
(Norgart v. Upjohn Co., supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 397; Pooshs v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 797.) “Under the discovery rule, the statute of
limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that
her injury was caused by wrongdoing, that someone has done something wrong to
her [him].” (Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co. (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1110 (“Jolly”).)
 
Plaintiffs
maintain the “confusion” in the medical records, whereby the treating
physicians were improperly documented, thereby leading to a dismissal of one
physician and the designation of different physicians. Plaintiffs also
emphasize reliance on the report of physician, Marc Eckstein. Dr. Eckstein reviewed
the January 17, 2019, autopsy report on December 12, 2020, and concluded the
delayed diagnosis and treatment caused the death. [First Amend. Comp., ¶ 15.] The
court assumes the subject allegation effectively constitutes the pled accrual
date for realization of medical malpractice, with Code of Civil Procedure
section 364 notice served on Hospital five days later on December 17, 2020.
[First Amend. Comp., ¶ 18.] The complaint was filed 143 days later on May 10,
2021. Dr. James Lee was the next served physician with a 90 day notice
occurring on September 9, 2021—122 days after the filing of the complaint.
 
The court
considers the challenged factual basis of accrual presented as either around the
January 17, 2019, autopsy report, which overlaps with the January 2019 time period
presented in the deposition of Ronald Nevarez, or the moment of the second
review and report completed by Dr. Eckstein in December 2020. “Possession of ‘presumptive’
as well as ‘actual’ knowledge will commence the running of the statute. The
applicable principle has been expressed as follows: ‘when the plaintiff has
notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry, or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his investigation . . . the statute
commences to run.’ (Citation.) This “inquiry” rule has been previously applied
in the area of medical malpractice. (Citations.)” (Sanchez v. South Hoover
Hospital (1976) 18 Cal.3d 93, 101; see Gutierrez
v. Mofid (1985) 39 Cal.3d 896-899.) The Jolly case clarified the standard
as a matter of factual suspicion triggering the requirement to proceed with
investigation, rather than wait for conclusive facts to appear. (Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co., supra, 44 Cal.3d
at pp. 1110-1111; Kleefeld v. Superior Court (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1683-1684.) “[I]t is the
discovery of facts, not their legal significance, that starts the statute.” (Jolly, supra, 44 Cal.3d at p. 1113.)
 
The
standard specifically rejects categorical certainty as a basis of accrual.
Plaintiffs argument in opposition regarding Plaintiffs’ lack of exact
understanding of the cause of Sylvias death due to the lack of timely treatment
in the emergency room implicitly until the Dr. Eckstein report in no way
establishes a delayed accrual of the statute of limitations. The standard of
medically verified understanding was specifically overruled. (Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co., supra, 44 Cal.3d at p.
1110-1111; Knowles v. Superior Court (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1300.)
 
A more
recent case relied upon by Plaintiff further clarifies the distinctions
triggering suspicion based on the definition of “injury” in Code of Civil
Procedure section 340.5. “In an action for injury or death against a health
care provider based upon such person's alleged professional negligence, the
time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of
injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of
reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs
first.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.5.) “The word ‘injury’ for purposes of section
340.5 is a term of art that “refer[s] to the damaging effect of the alleged
wrongful act and not to the act itself.” (Brewer
v. Remington (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 14, 24.)
The death of Sylvia constituted injury itself. The death occurred while at the
hospital, and therefore any claimed manifestation of harm was concurrent. (Id.
at pp. 28-31.) 


In deposition,
Ronald Nevarez admits to requesting medical records in January 2019, and
disappointment with the quality of care the date after Christmas. [Declaration
Gregory Werre, Ex. A: Deposition of Ronald Nevarez, 29:3-6, 29:17-30:5.] Ronald
admitted that upon learning of Sylvia’s death, to suspecting wrongdoing. Ronald
ordered the autopsy upon the advice of others, who also told him to consult a
lawyer. The time frame was within a one-and-one half month time frame from the
date of death. [Id., 30:6-24, 31:3-32:18.] Ronald also testifies to the
opinions of his children regarding noted deficiencies upon reviewing the
medical records. [38:2-40:25.] Plaintiff subsequently contacted a lawyer in
March 2019. [41:9-23.] The children confirm this account, including review of
records, recommendation for an attorney consultation, and the autopsy. [Werre
Decl., Ex. B:  Deposition of Tricia
Nevarez, 20:7-17, 21:1-22:2, 22:9-23:15; Ex. C: Deposition of Ronnie Nevarez,
12:10-12:25.]
 
“While
resolution of the statute of limitations issue is normally a question of fact,
where the uncontradicted facts established through discovery are susceptible of
only one legitimate inference, summary judgment is proper.” (Jolly, supra, 44 Cal.3d at p. 1112.) The time frame of the review of the
medical records, ordered autopsy, and consultation with counsel occurred no
later than March 2019. The section 364 letter to Hospital went out on December
17, 2020, well after a year from March 2019. [Werre Decl., Ex. D.] The
complaint was filed 143 days later on May 10, 2021, which even with the 90-day
extension in no way renders the complaint timely filed. 
 
The
argument regarding the cumulative continuance of the statute of limitations due
to service of multiple doctors lacks both legal and factual support. Again, the
statute lapsed prior to the service of the notice, and the second notice was
served after the filing of the complaint either way. 
 
(a) No
action based upon the health care provider's professional negligence may be
commenced unless the defendant has been given at least 90 days' prior notice of the
intention to commence the action. (b) No particular form of notice is
required, but it shall notify the defendant of the legal basis of the claim and
the type of loss sustained, including with specificity the nature of the
injuries suffered. … (d) If the notice is served within 90 days of the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the time for the
commencement of the action shall be extended 90 days from the service of the notice.
(e) The
provisions of this section shall not be applicable with respect to any
defendant whose name is unknown to the plaintiff at the time of filing the
complaint and who is identified therein by a fictitious name, as provided in
Section 474. (Code Civ. Proc., § 364.)
 
“Section
364 does not suggest that successive 90–day notices are proper where different
or further injuries are subsequently discovered, and duplicative notices do not
serve the legislative purpose of encouraging settlement.” (Bennett v. Shahhal (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th
384, 391.) Other than confusion over the treating physicians the core basis for
the malpractice remains the same, and the identity of Hospital remains
undisputed for purposes of the subject motion. Godwin v. City of Bellflower
(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1625, 1632 [“a plaintiff has actual knowledge of the
identities of the treating physicians whom he intends to sue, section 364(a)
notice on the hospital, without naming the physicians, is insufficient notice
to them to extend the statute of limitations under section 364(d)”]
 
Standard of Care
The court declines to consider the standard of care declarations given
the statute of limitations bar. Even assuming the action is not barred by the
statute of limitations, and the court considered the subject matter, the court
finds no triable issues of material fact.
 
The standard of care against which the acts of health care
providers are to be measured is a matter within the knowledge of experts. (Elcome v. Chin (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th
310, 317.)  Unless the conduct required
by the particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layman,
the standard of care in a malpractice action can only be proved by an expert’s
testimony.  (Id.)  If the “common
knowledge” exception does not apply to a medical malpractice action, expert
evidence is conclusive and cannot be disregarded.  (Id.)  
 
Whether the standard of care in the community has been
breached presents the basic issue in a malpractice action and can only be
proved by opinion testimony unless the medical question is within the common
knowledge of laypersons.  (See Jambazian v. Borden (1994) 25 Cal.App4th
836, 844.)  “‘When a defendant moves for
summary judgment and supports his motion with expert declarations that his
conduct fell within the community standard of care, he is entitled to summary judgment
unless the plaintiff comes forward with conflicting expert evidence.’” (Munro v. Regents of University of California
(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 984-985.)
 
Hospital presents the expert declaration of Janet Geier, R.N.
in support of his motion for summary judgment. Nurse Geier sets forth expert
qualifications, indicates review Plaintiff’s medical records, details the care
and treatment of Sylvia by nursing staff, and concludes that both the care and
treatment complied with the applicable standard of care and that no act or
omission by nursing staff caused or contributed to the death of Sylvia.
 
Plaintiffs in opposition submits the declaration of Marc
Eckstein. Dr. Eckstein also establishes the basis for the declaration and
concludes Sylvia’s presentation to the emergency room with the subject symptoms
required a different course of diagnosis and treatment. Nothing in the
declaration actually addresses the standard of care for nursing staff, or the
conduct nursing staff were responsible for given the diagnosis and course and treatment
was at the direction of the treating physicians.  
 
The motion is granted.
 
Next motion for summary judgment
scheduled for November 15, 2023.
 
Hospital to give notice.
