And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion of the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, to compel responses to the request for production of documents (set one) from the plaintiff, Evelyn Gallegos. The defendant served the request on March 17, 2023, and no responses were received as of the filing of the motion. The court assumes that the former counsel for the plaintiff forwarded the file to the former clients, and therefore finds service valid. The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to the request without objections within ten days. The court refrains from imposing sanctions due to the plaintiff being a minor and the guardian parent possibly being unhoused. The final status conference and trial are set for February 15 and February 26, 2024, respectively.
