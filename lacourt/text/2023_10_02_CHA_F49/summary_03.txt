The notice seeks information regarding claims of negligence, contribution, and excessive medical treatment, as well as preexisting injuries, witness statements, and information regarding the accident. The judge found that the deposition notice is unnecessary and harassing, and that the only issue remaining is the determination of the amount of damages. The court noted that State Farm has accepted 100% fault for purposes of determining resolution of the policy claim, and that all information regarding the vehicle collision has been provided by the claimant. The judge ruled that the deposition notice is barred and granted the motion for protective order, finding that no deposition of the Person Most Qualified (PMQ) need go forward.
