**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for a protective order filed by State Farm Mutual Insurance Co. in response to a deposition subpoena issued by petitioner Agnes Lemons. 

Lemons filed a petition for uninsured motorist arbitration against State Farm.  State Farm argues that the deposition of their claim adjuster, who would be the Person Most Qualified (PMQ), is unnecessary and harassing because the only remaining issue in the case is the amount of damages.  State Farm asserts that the petitioner is attempting to use the deposition to investigate potential bad faith claims, which are not relevant to the arbitration.

The judge agrees with State Farm, finding that the deposition is unnecessary and harassing.  The judge grants the motion for protective order, preventing the deposition from proceeding.

The judge noted that State Farm had accepted 100% fault for the policy claim and had provided all relevant information regarding the vehicle collision. The judge also found that State Farm had made a reasonable and good faith attempt at informal resolution of the dispute, as required by law.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted State Farm Mutual Insurance Co.'s motion for a protective order, which seeks to limit the discovery process in a petition for uninsured motorist arbitration filed by Agnes Lemons. The court found that the deposition notice served by Agnes Lemons was overly broad and unnecessary, as the only issue remaining in the case is the determination of the amount of damages. State Farm had already accepted fault for the accident and provided all relevant information regarding the collision. The court determined that the deposition of the person most qualified (PMQ) was not required to determine the amount of damages and that the motion for protective order was granted. As a result, no deposition of the PMQ will go forward, and Agnes Lemons has waived any future effort to enforce the subpoena.
