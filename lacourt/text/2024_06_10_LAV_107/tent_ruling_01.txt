COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RMotion TO DISMISS
  PLAINTIFF’S SECOND  AMENDED COMPLAINT WITH PREJUDICE
 
 
 
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises
from the alleged breach of an employment contract and other wrongful actions
taken against Plaintiff JW Seals Jr. (“Plaintiff”) during his employment with
Defendant Reel Security California, Inc. (“Defendant”). 
 
On July 28, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant alleging causes of action for:
(1) Breach of Contract; (2) Violation of Labor Laws; (3) False Representation;
(4) Negligence; (5) Failure to Respond to Emergencies; and (6) Whistleblowing
and Retaliation Protections. 
 
On November 7, 2023,
Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike, to which Plaintiff opposed and
Defendant filed respective reply briefs. 
 
On January 2, 2024,
after hearing, the Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend and granted
the motion to strike. (01/02/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On January 3, 2024, Defendant
filed and served a Notice of Ruling as to the Court’s January 2, 2024 order. 
 
On February 14, 2024,
the Court denied Defendant’s ex parte application to dismiss the
Complaint with prejudice. (02/14/24 Minute Order.) The Court ordered Plaintiff
to file and serve his pleading no later than February 26, 2024. (02/14/24
Minute Order.) 
 
On February 23, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant alleging
causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Violation of Labor Laws; (3)
False Representation; (4) Negligence; (5) Failure to Respond to Emergencies; (6)
Whistleblowing and Retaliation Protections; and (7) Documentation and Reporting
Violations.
 
Thereafter, on March
26, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike as to the FAC. 
 
On April 29, 2024,
after hearing, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC with leave
to amend and granted Defendant’s motion to strike. (04/29/24 Minute Oder at p.
11.) The Court ordered Plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint within the
statutory time period. (04/29/24 Minute Order at p. 11.) The Clerk mailed
notice of the Court’s April 29, 2024 order to all parties on such date.
(04/29/24 Certificate of Mailing.) 
 
On May 29, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging causes
of action against Defendant for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Failure to Provide
Meal Periods; (3) Negligence; (4) Whistleblowing and Retaliation Protections;
and (5) No Compliance with the Required Postings of Labor Laws. 
 
On June 3, 2024,
Defendant filed and served the instant ex parte application to dismiss
the FAC with prejudice (the “Application”). Defendant contends that Plaintiff
“has not filed his Second Amended Complaint within the time granted to do so.”
(Application at p. 3:23.) 
 
On June 4, 2024,
after hearing, the Court continued the hearing on the Application to June 10, 2024,
and ordered that the opposition to the Application be filed by the close of
business on June 7, 2024. (06/04/24 Minute Order.) The Court ordered Defendant
to give notice. (06/04/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On June 5, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that he served the SAC on
Defendant via mail on June 4, 2024.
 
The Court notes that
there is no proof of service showing that Defendant gave notice to Plaintiff of
the Court’s June 4, 2024 minute order as ordered by the Court.
 
On  June 7, 2024, the Plaintiff filed an opposition
to the Application. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s Ex Parte Application to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Second
Amended Complaint (the “Application”).  
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“A motion to dismiss the entire action and for entry
of judgment after expiration of the time to amend following the sustaining of a
demurrer may be made by ex parte application to the court under Code of Civil
Procedure section 581(f)(2).” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule. 3.1320(h).)
“Following a ruling on a demurrer, unless otherwise ordered, leave to answer or
amend within 10 days is deemed granted, except for actions in forcible entry,
forcible detainer, or unlawful detainer in which case 5 calendar days is deemed
granted.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1320(g).) 
 
A court may dismiss a complaint as to a defendant where “after a demurrer
to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend
it within the time allowed by the court and either party moves for dismissal.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 581, subd. (f)(2).) The court may also dismiss a complaint
where “[a]fter a motion to strike the whole of a complaint or a portion thereof
is granted with leave to amend the plaintiff fails to amend it within the time
allowed by the court and either party moves for dismissal.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
581, subd. (f)(4).) “Section 581, subdivision (f)(2) . . . gives the defendant
the right to obtain a court order dismissing the action with prejudice once the
court sustains a demurrer with leave to amend and the plaintiff has not amended
within the time given.” (Cano v. Glover (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 326,
330.) 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
In support of the Application,
Defendant’s counsel, Peter H. Crossin (“Crossin”), provides a declaration. Mr.
Crossin states the following: on April 29, 2024, the Court sustained
Defendant’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, granted Defendant’s motion
to strike, and ordered Plaintiff to  file
a Second Amended Complaint within the statutory time period. (Crossin Decl., ¶
2.) On April 29, 2024, the Court Clerk served the minute order on both counsel
for Defendant as well as Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 3; Exh. A.) Plaintiff has
not sought or obtained a stipulation with Defendant to extend the statutory
deadline date nor has Plaintiff obtained a court order to do so. (Id., ¶
3.) 
The clock began
running on the time in which Plaintiff was granted leave to amend on April 29,
2024. (Id., ¶ 4.) Adding two days for e-mail service of the Court’s
minute order would render the due date for serving and filing the Second
Amended Complaint to May 15, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4.) Counsel’s office
originally gave notice to go into Court with the Application on May 28, 2024
for a hearing date of May 29, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5.) Upon giving notice,
Plaintiff responded by email stating that he could not attend the May 29, 2024
hearing because of his mother’s medical emergency. (Id., ¶ 5; Exh. B.) Understandably,
Defendant advised Plaintiff that that it was taking the May 29, 2024 hearing
off calendar and would re-notice for a new date, which was done solely in
consideration of Plaintiff’s representation of his mother’s emergency. (Id.,
¶ 5.) 
 
Mr. Crossin declares
that such an emergency was not emergent enough to prevent Plaintiff from
preparing and filing his Second Amended Complaint on May 29, 2024, and he also
filed a motion to compel further responses to written discovery on May 29, 2024
as well. (Id., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff did not serve Defendant with the Second
Amended Complaint and Defendant only discovered such filing when it was
discovered on the Court’s docket. (Id.) Mr. Crossin states that
Defendant now brings the ex parte to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint as it
still not filed by the statutory deadline of May 15, 2024, as ordered by the
Court. (Id., ¶ 7.) Counsel states that on June 3, 2024, at approximately
9:04 AM, he gave notice to Plaintiff via e-mail with an attempt to leave a
voicemail message without success. (Id., ¶ 8; Exh. C.) 
 
Initially, the Court
notes that in the notice of the Application, Defendant indicates that it is
seeking dismissal of the First Amended Complaint. (Notice of Application at p.
1:25-28.) However, based on the memorandum of points and authorities in support
of the Application, it is apparent that Defendant is seeking dismissal of the Second
Amended Complaint. (Memorandum of Points and Authorities at p. 5:18-20.) 
 
The Court finds that
the Notice of Application is procedurally defective. Defendant incorrectly
indicated that it is seeking a dismissal of the First Amended Complaint and not
the Second Amended Complaint. “[D]ue process requires a party to be fully
advised of the issues to be addressed and be given adequate notice of what
facts it must rebut in order to prevail.” (Fenn v. Sherriff (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 1466, 1481.) The Court also notes that Defendant’s notice to
Plaintiff concerning the instant ex parte application referenced dismissal of
the First Amended Complaint and not that Defendant is seeking dismissal of the operative
Second Amended Complaint. (Crossin Decl., Exh. C.) Plaintiff was entitled to
proper notice of the relief that Defendant is now seeking. 
 
Furthermore, even if
the Application were procedurally proper, the Court would deny the Application.
The Court acknowledges that Plaintiff did not timely file the Second Amended Complaint;
however, Defendant does not state that it incurred any prejudice due to the
belated filing of the Second Amened Complaint. 
 
The Court recognizes
that this is not the first instance of Plaintiff untimely filing a pleading in
this action. While Plaintiff is representing himself in pro per, the
Court reminds Plaintiff that pro per “litigants are held to the same
standards as attorneys.” (Kobayashi v. Superior Court (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 536, 543.) Plaintiff is admonished to comply with the California
Rules of Court and Code of Civil Procedure. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the Application is therefore DENIED. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
