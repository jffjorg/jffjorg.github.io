And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied Petitioner's petition to compel binding arbitration. The Petitioner, Jamra, Jamra & Hanasab, L.L.P, seeks to compel Respondent, Jeffrey S. Graup, to arbitrate a fee dispute arising from a marriage dissolution case. The Petitioner alleges that the parties entered into an agreement to arbitrate fee disputes, but the Respondent has not filed an opposition or supporting documents. The judge notes that the Petitioner failed to file proof of service of the petition and that the Respondent failed to file an opposition or supporting documents. As a result, the judge denies the Petitioner's petition to compel binding arbitration without prejudice.
