And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied defendants' motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The defendants had argued that they were entitled to summary judgment or summary adjudication of all causes of action against the plaintiff, but the court found that the plaintiff had established a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants' security cameras were pointed at the plaintiff's property. The court also found that the defendants had failed to carry their burden of production to show that the plaintiff could not prevail on their claims. The case will proceed to trial.
