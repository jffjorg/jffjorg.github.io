And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for leave to amend their answer to assert the affirmative defense of plaintiff's failure to mitigate damages. The judge found that the motion did not comply with the requirements of California Rule of Court 3.1324, specifically that the proposed amendment be set forth by page, paragraph, and line number. Even if the motion had been procedurally compliant, the judge found that the proposed amendment would be facially prejudicial to the plaintiff, as it would be insufficiently pled and would deprive the plaintiff of a fair opportunity to pursue discovery on the issue. The judge also found that the defendants had been dilatory in raising the issue of failure to mitigate damages and had failed to provide sufficient discovery on the subject.
