  - "It is not proper for the jury to interpret most contracts."
  - "Where a contract is unambiguous and there is no parol evidence suggesting a latent or patent ambiguity, then the contract's interpretation is solely for the court and it must be based on the contract's words alone."
  - "It is the jury's job to say what the facts are; it is not for the court to do that."

And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has written a tentative ruling regarding the upcoming court hearing. The main issue is the interpretation of the License Agreements and the Non-Compete Agreement. The defense argues that Triurol, Inc. is the only entity that can sue for breach of the License Agreements, while the individual plaintiffs can sue for breach of the Non-Compete Agreement. The Judge agrees that contract interpretation is generally a question for the court, but notes that where there is a latent or patent ambiguity, parol evidence may be introduced to interpret or resolve the ambiguity. The Judge finds that the contracts are ambiguous and notes that the parties' intent is not clear from the contracts. The Judge believes that the defense has the better of it, arguing that the License Agreements are between entities alone and the Non-Compete Agreement is between individuals. However, the Judge also notes that it is not clear to the court that the damages for the breach of one would not encompass the damages for the breach of the other. The Judge believes that the question of who is liable for breach of contract should be left to the jury to decide.
