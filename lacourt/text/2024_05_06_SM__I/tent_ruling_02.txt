 Case Number:  22SMCV01594    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  The court gave the final status conference
order on May 10, 2023.  On Friday, the
parties filed some untimely materials.  Specifically,
the court received plaintiff’s witness list, with 5 witnesses and 7 hours of
direct examination.  The court also
received an exhibit list of four exhibits. 
There is no short statement of the case, no jury instructions, no
verdict form, no good faith estimate of total trial time.  The court does not know why there are no
joint papers at all.  In short, the case
is NOT READY FOR TRIAL.  The court
therefore VACATES THE TRIAL DATE and will set an OSC re: Sanctions not to
exceed $5000 against both parties for failure to prepare for the FSC pursuant
to the court’s instructions given a year ago and also a determination of a new
trial date, which will be at the court’s convenience some time between July
2024 and December 2025.
