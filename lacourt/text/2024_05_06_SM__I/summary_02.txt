And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the case is not ready for trial due to the parties' failure to prepare. Despite receiving the final status conference order on May 10, 2023, the parties have not submitted the required documents, including a short statement of the case, jury instructions, verdict form, and good faith estimate of total trial time. As a result, the court is vacating the trial date and will set an order to show cause (OSC) re: sanctions not to exceed $5,000 against both parties for their failure to comply with the court's instructions. A new trial date will be set at the court's convenience between July 2024 and December 2025.
