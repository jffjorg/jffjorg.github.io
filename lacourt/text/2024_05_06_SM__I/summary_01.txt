And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which outlines the key issues that need to be resolved before the jury trial begins. The main issue is whether the case is time-barred due to the statute of limitations. The plaintiff contends that the contract is governed by the Commercial Code's four-year statute, while the defendant argues that it is governed by the two-year statute. The judge notes that there are some disputes about the facts, including whether the defendant actually ordered the goods and whether he received them. The judge also indicates that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing will not save the case. The judge requires the parties to deposit witness Berry forthwith, and notes that the discovery rule will not apply in this case. The judge also outlines the procedures for the jury trial, including the requirement that the parties agree to waive the right to appeal or go through the settled statement process.
