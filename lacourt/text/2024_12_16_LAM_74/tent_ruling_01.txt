  Case Number:  24STCV10876    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  74 Reyes
Coco-Cola Bottling, LLC v. Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. et al. 
Defendants Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. and
Dr. Pepper / Seven Ups, Inc.’s Motion to Seal.
 
BACKGROUND  
On
September 24, 2024, the Court granted the motion by defendants Keurig Dr Pepper
Inc. and Dr. Pepper / Seven Ups, Inc. to dismiss based on Forum Non Conveniens.
Defendants
filed a motion to seal the Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. 
Plaintiff
Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, LLC (Plaintiff) filed a notice of non-opposition. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Unless confidentiality is required by law, court records are
presumed to be open to the public. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd.
(c).) Consequently, pleadings, motions, evidence, and other papers may not be
filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties; rather, a prior court
order is necessary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subd. (a).)  
The governing rule is California
Rules of Court, Rule 2.550(d) which states “that the court may order that a
record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that
establish:  

There exists an overriding
     interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; 


The overriding interest
     supports sealing the record; 


A substantial probability
     exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is
     not sealed; 


The proposed sealing is
     narrowly tailored; and 


No less restrictive means exist
     to achieve the overriding interest.” 

If the court fails to make the required findings, the order
is deficient and cannot support sealing. (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman
Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) Sanctions may be
imposed for overboard requests to seal. (Id. at p. 500.)  

 
DISCUSSION
California
law recognizes a constitutional right of access to court proceedings and court
documents because the public has an interest in observing and assessing the
performance of the judicial system.  (In
Re Marriage of Tamir (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 1068, 1078; see also McNair
v. NCAA (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 25, 31.) 
            The
first step to seal records within a civil case requires the movant to identify
an interest that overcomes the right of public access. Defendants allege that
the exhibits contain confidential information related to Defendants’ marketing
and business strategies, price information, and relationship with third
parties.  (McGaun v. Endovascular
Technologies, Inc. (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 974, 988-989; Overstock.com,
Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 504-11.)  
            The
proposed sealing includes Mario Delgado’s Declaration Exhibits A, B and C;
Nehal Desai’s Declaration Exhibits C, D, E, F, G and H; and Quanta Rhoneda
Hyatt’s Declaration Exhibits B, C, D, E, F and H.  The Court finds the designations are narrowly
tailored to information about proprietary and sensitive business
information.  The Court finds no less
restrictive means exist. 
            Therefore,
the motion is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
            The
Court grants Defendants’ Motion to Seal.
            Defendants
shall give notice.
