 Case Number:  24STCV15151    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  74 Silver
Strand Care, LLC v. Duenas et al. 
Defendant East Valley Adult Day
Health Center, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories. 
 
            On
October 11, 2024, defendant East Valley Adult Day Health Care Center, Inc
(Defendant) filed and served its motion to compel Plaintiff Silver Strand Care
LLC’s responses to form interrogatories. After defendant filed its motion, Plaintiff
served responses, making the motion moot.
Defendant
requests discovery sanctions. Plaintiff opposes sanctions on the grounds that
the notice of motion and motion did not “identify every person… against who the
sanction is sought.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
2023.040.) The notice and motion’s caption and body identify Plaintiff Silver
Strand Care, LLC by name. (Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co.
(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1435.) Mattco Forge is still controlling
precedent for the sufficiency of notice, regardless of any changes to notice
requirements in 2005.
Plaintiff
requests $1,2000.00 for 4 hours of work at $300.00 per hour.  (Taheripour Decl., ¶¶ 15-18.)  The Court finds the amount reasonable.
 
CONCLUSION
            The
Motion is moot. The Court orders Silver Strand Care, LLC to pay $1,200 to
Defendant’s counsel within 30 days.
