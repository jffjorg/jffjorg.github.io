And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions and is issuing this tentative ruling. The Court finds that Defendant is the prevailing party in this action and is entitled to recover costs. The Court has reviewed the costs claimed by Defendant and finds that some of them are reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The Court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff's motion to tax costs.

The Court finds that the following costs are reasonable and necessary:

* Filing and motion fees: $805.00
* Deposition costs: $12,506.65
* Service of process costs: $370.35
* Interpreter fees: $2,419.93
* Fees for electronic filing or service: $1,766.80

The Court denies the following costs:

* Mediation costs: $2,325
* Miscellaneous cost: $49.15

The Court finds that the mediation costs were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and were not authorized by statute. The Court also finds that the miscellaneous cost was not described and was not authorized by statute.

The parties are encouraged to meet and confer concerning this tentative ruling and to submit any objections by email to the Court. If the parties do not submit objections, the Court may adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
