And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses four motions filed by the defendant, Samantha Delgado, regarding discovery requests. The motions seek to deem admitted requests for admission, compel verified responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and a request for production. The plaintiff, Nicolas Lacan, opposes the motions.

The judge finds that the defendant served the discovery requests on March 8, 2024, and that the responses were due on April 10, 2024. However, no responses were served until May 17, 2024. The judge notes that the plaintiff has since served responses that are in substantial compliance, making the motions to deem admitted and compel responses moot.

The judge awards monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and his attorney in the amount of $2,040.00 for failing to serve timely responses to discovery requests. The judge also denies the motions to deem admitted and compel responses as moot.

The defendant is ordered to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
