CASE NUMBER:


22STCV01486




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Tax Costs




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Melchor Molina




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Pico Rivera Healthcare, Inc. 



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Januario Melchor Molina (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendants Pico Rivera Healthcare,
Inc. and Alex Benites for negligence per se, negligence and premises liability
based on a January 17, 2021 incident where Plaintiff fell while attempting to
trim a tree that was over 15 feet tall on property belonging to Defendant Pico
Rivera Healthcare. Inc. (FAC ¶¶ 14-16.)
 
On April 8, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Pico
Rivera Healthcare, Inc.’s (“Defendant”) motion for
summary judgment.  
 
Judgment for Defendant was entered on May 9, 2024.  
  
On June 10, 2024, Defendant filed and served electronically,
its Memorandum of Costs (forms MC-010 and MC-011), claiming $20,193.76 in
costs.  
 
On June 21, 2024, Defendant filed and served notice of the
entry of the judgment.  
 
On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to tax
costs. Defendant opposes and Plaintiff replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding. (Code
Civ. Proc. section 1032, subd. (b).) Under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subd. (c)(2), allowable costs “shall be reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.”¿Subdivision (3) requires: “Allowable costs shall be reasonable in
amount.”¿“Items not mentioned in [Section 1033.5] and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4).) There is no requirement that copies of bills,
invoices, statements, or any other such documents be attached to the
memorandum. Only if the costs have been put in issue via a motion to tax costs
must supporting documentation be submitted. (Bach v. County of Butte
(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308.) 
 
On a motion to tax costs, “[i]f the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs. Whether a cost item was reasonably
necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and
its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion. However, because the right to
costs is governed strictly by statute a court has no discretion to award costs
not statutorily authorized.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774, internal citations omitted.) “The court’s first
determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows the item, and
whether it appears proper on its face. If so, the burden is on the objecting
party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Nelson v. Anderson
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal citations omitted.) The objecting
party does not meet this burden by arguing that the costs were not necessary or
reasonable, but must present evidence and prove that the costs are not
recoverable. (Litt v. Eisenhower Med. Ctr. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1217,
1224; Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, as Plaintiff did not
“recover any relief against” Defendant, Defendant is the prevailing party in
this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) Defendant is therefore
entitled to recover its costs. 
 
Plaintiff seeks to tax the following: Filing and Motion
Fees in the amount of $805.00; Deposition costs in the amount of $12,506.65;
Service of Process in the amount of $370.35; Interpreter fees in the amount of
$2,419.93; Fees for electronic filing or service in the amount of $1,766.80; Other
costs in the amount of $2,325.00. 
 
Filing and Motion Fees
 
Plaintiff’s motion appears to address the filing and motion
fees requested in item 1 of the memorandum, in the section pertaining to
electronic filing and service. Therefore, the Court will address the merits of
those issues in the electronic filing section below. 
 
Deposition Costs 
 
Plaintiff argues that the total cost of $12,506.65 for the
depositions is excessive. Code of
Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(3)(A) expressly authorizes costs for the
“[t]aking, video recording, and transcribing” necessary depositions. 
 
According to the
memorandum, Plaintiff’s deposition cost $4,220.30 ($1,180 for taking, $1,295.30
for transcribing, and $1,745 for videotaping). Plaintiff argues this is
excessive and unreasonable given the deposition of Alexander Noe Benitez, which
he took, cost $2,729.75 total. (Motion, 4; Crisci Decl. ¶ 3.) However,
Plaintiff does not state whether the Benitez deposition was also videotaped and
does not provide a declaration stating that Plaintiff’s deposition lasted for a
shorter time.[1] Therefore, he
fails to show that the cost of Plaintiff’s deposition is unreasonable on the
face of the memorandum and fails to meet his burden. Similarly, Plaintiff fails
to present evidence that the transcribing costs are also unreasonable. (See County
of Kern v. Ginn¿(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1107, 1113-14 [the party did not meet
its burden where it submitted no affidavits in support of motion to tax costs,
but merely alleged depositions were unnecessary or unreasonable].) 
 
Next, Plaintiff contests
the $6,882.15 in deposition subpoena costs, which were issued to obtain
Plaintiff’s medical records. Plaintiff argues these are not considered
“depositions” under section 1033.5. The face of the memorandum does not show
that these costs included the “taking, video recording, and transcribing” of
depositions. Therefore, the burden shifts to Defendant to justify the costs. 
 
Defendant relies
on Naser v. Lakeridge Athletic Club (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 571. There,
the Court of Appeal first observed the absence of “any direct authority on
whether section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(3) applies to the costs of serving and
processing deposition subpoenas for the production of business records without
an in-person appearance of the custodian of records.” (Id. at 576.)
However, after discussing two previous cases that considered business records
subpoenas as “depositions”, the court held that “obtaining business records
through a deposition subpoena is a ‘deposition’ within the plain meaning of the
Civil Discovery Act.” (Id. at 578.) As a result, the Court allowed the
defendant to recover costs of serving and processing subpoenas for medical
records. (Id.) 
 
In reply, Plaintiff
does not discuss Naser, but argues for the first time that the deposition
subpoenas are unreasonable. While Plaintiff contends the medical records
provided contained few pages, he presents no facts showing that the records were
produced after the first subpoena, or that multiple subpoenas were unnecessary.
Therefore, the motion to tax deposition costs is denied. 
 
Service
of Process Costs
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(4)(B), allows costs for
service of process if “service is by a process server registered pursuant to
Chapter 16 (commencing with Section 22350) of Division 8 of the Business and
Professions Code, the recoverable cost is the amount actually incurred in
effecting service, including, but not limited to, a stakeout or other means
employed in locating the person to be served, unless those charges are
successfully challenged by a party to the action.” 
 
Plaintiff argues $370.35 in process server fees is unreasonable based
on Defendant’s two motions for summary judgment, and considering the parties
agreed to electronic service. The memorandum shows the process service fees
were directed to “Andrew Zeytuntsyan”, Plaintiff’s counsel, for $145.15 and
$225.20. In opposition, Defendant confirms it personally served the moving
papers for a motion for summary judgment, and argues it was entitled to do
this. Plaintiff fails to present evidence that these costs are unreasonable.
Accordingly, the motion to tax service of process costs is denied. 
 
Interpreter Fees 
 
Here, the costs
for interpreter fees of $2,419.96 for Plaintiff’s deposition appear reasonable
on the face of the memorandum. Plaintiff offers no facts in the declaration
regarding this issue. As a result, Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to
show the cost is unreasonable.  
 
            Fees
for Electronic Filing or Service
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5(a)(14) allows costs for “[f]ees for the electronic filing or
service of documents through an electronic filing service provider if a court
requires or orders electronic filing or service of documents.” Additionally,
section 1033.5(c)(2) states that “[a]n award of costs shall be subject to the
following: . . . Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct
of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.”  
The memorandum of costs
claims $1,766.80 in electronic filing or service.
First, Plaintiff argues Defendant
made a clerical error in scheduling the first motion for summary judgment in
2023 and incurred unnecessary electronic filing costs of $388.20. Additionally,
Plaintiff argues $140 in filing and motion fees under section 1 of the
memorandum should be taxed. However, the declaration in support does not explain
what the “clerical error” was. Based on the docket in this case, it appears
that the second summary judgment motion was filed in response to the Court’s
ruling in the first summary adjudication motion that Plaintiff was Defendant’s
de facto employee. (See Min. Order, 8/25/23, 4/8/24.) The values appear
reasonable on the face of the memorandum. Therefore, Plaintiff fails to meet
his burden to show that these costs are unreasonable. 
Next, Plaintiff contends $423.20
in courtesy copies should be taxed because the code does not authorize them. Pursuant
to the Court’s Standing Order Re: PI Court Procedures, courtesy copies are
required for Ex Parte Applications, Motions for Summary Judgment, Oppositions
to Ex Parte Applications and Motions for, Oppositions to, and Replies to
Oppositions to Motions for Summary Judgment, and must be submitted directly to
the Court.  (Super. Ct. L.A. County 8th
Amended Standing Order Re: PI Court Procedures ¶ 9C.)  
The courtesy copies that
Plaintiff contests were for a summary judgment motion. Thus, the costs are
permitted. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(4) [“Items not mentioned in this
section and items assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in the
court's discretion.”].) 
 
Lastly, Plaintiff
challenges a miscellaneous cost of $49.15 for a summary judgment motion that is
not described. Defendant does not respond. Accordingly, the motion to tax this
amount is granted. 
 
Therefore, the motion to
tax the electronic filing and service fees is denied except for the cost of
$49.15. 
 
Other
 
Plaintiff contends the
$2,325 in mediation costs are not recoverable and argues that Defendant did not
seriously attempt to resolve the matter during the mediation. 
 
“Section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(4), authorizes the trial court to
exercise its discretion to award costs for items not specifically allowed nor
prohibited under subdivisions (a) and (b), so long as they are ‘reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation.’” (Gibson v. Bobroff (1996) 49
Cal.App.4th 1202, 1207.) Section 1033.5 does not foreclose an award of
mediation expenses as costs. (Id. at 1208.) 
 
In opposition, Defendant argues that it participated in the mediation
in good faith but offers no declaration in support of its arguments. (Opp., 6.)
Accordingly, the motion to tax the mediation costs is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs is granted in part and denied in part. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
