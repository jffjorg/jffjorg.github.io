And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The defendant, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, has filed a motion to deem matters admitted in its Requests for Admission. The plaintiffs, Eveleen Martinez and others, have failed to respond to the requests by the deadline and have not provided any responses to date. Therefore, the court finds that the matters must be deemed admitted. The court grants the defendant's motion to deem matters admitted."

Note: The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after the hearing on June 3, 2024.
