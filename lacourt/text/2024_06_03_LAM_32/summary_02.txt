And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to add Christopher Smith and other corporate entities as judgment debtors. The judge found that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a unity of interest between CMS Equity, Inc. and the proposed defendants, and that there is no evidence that Smith has used the proposed entities to shield assets from collection. The judge also found that Plaintiff has failed to show that an inequitable result would occur if the proposed defendants are treated as separate from CMS.
