Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer to the complaint. The plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that the defendant, Thryv, Inc., and its third-party data collector and processor, Intercom, violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) by intercepting and recording user conversations and sharing and using the collected data for their own purposes. The complaint alleges that the defendant aided and abetted Intercom's violations of CIPA. The judge finds that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for invasion of privacy.
