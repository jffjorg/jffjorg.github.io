[1] Defendant attempts to
contradict this allegation by introducing evidence of Intercom’s actual privacy
policy. Such factual disputes cannot be considered on a demurrer. Plaintiff’s
reference to the privacy policy does not entitle Defendant to introduce
extrinsic evidence of it on a demurrer. The website link referenced by
Defendant cannot, at this stage, be authenticated as an accurate copy of the
privacy policy. It is reasonably subject to dispute and cannot be immediately
verified by a source of indisputable accuracy. (See Evid. Code, § 452(h).) Defendant’s
caselaw does not suggest otherwise.
