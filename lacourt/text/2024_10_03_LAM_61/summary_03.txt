And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition to confirm an arbitration award entered on May 31, 2023, in the amount of $34,257.06. The petition was filed by Mark Gomez and Gomez Law, APC, against George Panoussis. The award was for attorney fee arbitration under Business & Professions Code § 6200. The judge previously denied similar petitions due to a lack of writing agreeing to be bound by arbitration, but in this case, the petitioner has provided the sequence of emails and correspondence by which the parties agreed to be bound by arbitration. Therefore, the motion to confirm the arbitration award is granted, and the petitioner is ordered to provide notice.
