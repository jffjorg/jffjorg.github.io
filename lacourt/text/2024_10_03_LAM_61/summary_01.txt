And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion filed by Plaintiffs Ryan Koda and Environet, Inc. to compel further responses to requests for production from Defendant Los Angeles County Fair Association. The judge finds that the Defendant's responses were incomplete, inadequate, or evasive, and that the Defendant failed to indicate which documents were responsive to which request, as required by law. The judge orders the Defendant to provide further responses within 20 days.

The judge also awards sanctions against the Defendant in the amount of $2,000.00, payable within 30 days. The judge reduces the amount of sanctions from the $5,500 requested by the Plaintiff, finding that the complexity of the issues warranted a reduction.
