And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the petition filed by James Chung, the plaintiff, challenging the City of South Pasadena's approval of the Real Parties' Hillside Development Permit (HDP) application. The City approved the HDP application in 2021, and the plaintiff argues that the City did not comply with its own municipal code.

The City's approval of the HDP application was based on the Real Parties' application and supporting documentation, which included a staff report and a planning commission resolution. The City's planning director approved the HDP application, and the City issued building and grading permits in 2021.

The plaintiff argues that the City did not conduct a public hearing when approving the HDP application, and that the City's approval was arbitrary and capricious. However, the court finds that the City's approval of the HDP application was consistent with the South Pasadena Municipal Code (SPMC) and that the plaintiff did not demonstrate that the City's approval was arbitrary or capricious.

The plaintiff also argues that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies, but the court finds that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. Therefore, the court denies the petition and upholds the City's approval of the Real Parties' HDP application.
