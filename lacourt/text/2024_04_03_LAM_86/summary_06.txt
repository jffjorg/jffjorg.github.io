```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a dispute between Petitioners and Respondents regarding compliance with the California State Fire Prevention (CSFP) regulatory scheme. The judge notes that Respondents' new arguments are not supported by good cause and lack a comprehensive discussion of the statutory scheme. The judge also finds that Petitioners' request to compel compliance with the CSFP is justified, as the CSFP did not exist in the common law or prior to its enactment. The judge references several case laws, including People v. Property Listed In Exhibit One, Balboa Ins. Co. v. Aguirre, and Brandenberg v. Eureka Redevelopment Agency, to support their decision.
