And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a petition filed by ALADS (Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs) on behalf of 29 deputies who claim they have not been paid backpay and interest as required by settlement agreements. The County has argued that the deputies have not exhausted administrative remedies and that the claims are barred by laches. The judge has considered the evidence and argues that the County has not developed any argument that any of the deputies, except perhaps Deputy Doe 3, failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The judge also finds that the County's defense of laches is based on the same contentions addressed above. The judge is considering whether interest is required to be paid under the settlement agreements for Deputies Doe 8 and 10. The judge also notes that the County's standing arguments may also apply to Deputies Doe 19 through 22. The judge will decide whether the County's laches defense is valid and whether the deputies' claims are barred by the statute of limitations.
