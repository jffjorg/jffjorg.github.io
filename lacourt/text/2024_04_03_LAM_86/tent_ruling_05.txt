[Tentative]       ORDER
OVERRULING DEMURRER 
 
 
Respondents, Los Angeles Unified School District
(LAUSD), LAUSD’s Board of Education, and Alberto M. Carvalho, Superintendent of
LAUSD (collectively, Respondents), generally demur to the petition for writ of
mandate filed by Petitioners, California State Finance Authority (CSFA) and the
State Allocation Board (collectively, Petitioners).  
 
Respondents’ Request for Judicial Notice of Exhibits
1 through 3 is granted.  
 
Petitioners’ Request for Judicial Notice of Exhibit
O is granted.
 
The demurrer is overruled.
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
A demurrer
tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear
on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (Code Civil
Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
“We assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint, but do not assume the
truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law.” (California
Logistics, Inc. v. State of California (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone
and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) The
allegations in the petition must be liberally construed in favor of Petitioner
on demurrer. (See Mobil Oil Corp. v Exxon Corp. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d
942, 947.) “A demurrer
must dispose of an entire cause of action to be sustained.”  (Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
SUMMARY OF THE PETITION 
 
“In 2002, the California Legislature established
the Charter School Facilities Program to provide funding to qualifying entities
to establish school facilities for charter school pupils. (Ed. Code, 
§ 17078.52; Stats. 2002 ch. 935 § 14 (AB 14).)
Under the Charter School Facilities Program, an eligible project may receive
funding for new construction or rehabilitation of a school facility for charter
school pupils, including, but not limited to, the cost of retrofitting an
existing building for charter school purposes, purchasing a building, or
retrofitting a building that has been purchased by the charter school, subject
to certain restrictions. (Ed. Code, § 17078.54, subd. (a).)” (Pet. ¶¶ 1-2.)
 
The petition concerns school facilities “located
at 1215 Miramar Street, Los Angeles, California,” including “a three-story,
513-seat secondary school on 1.37 acres, with approximately 49,961 [square
feet] of programmable space, 19 classrooms, 47 underground parking stalls,
administration offices, food services and dining area, library, and labs”
(Facility). (Pet. ¶ 11, fn. 1.)  
 
“On April 13, 2011, Petitioners, [LAUSD] and
Camino Nuevo High School Charter (‘Camino Nuevo’) entered into a Memorandum of
Understanding (‘MOU’) under the Charter School Facilities Program to finance
construction of the Facility. (Exhibit A.)” (Pet. ¶ 17.) “Pursuant to the California School
Facilities Program, Petitioners extended funds to Camino Nuevo to construct the
Facility pursuant to a Funding Agreement dated April 25, 2011, for an amount of
up to $10,000,000 (the ‘Loan’).” (Pet. ¶ 18.)
 
“In or around January 2021, Petitioners learned
that Camino Nuevo intended to close its charter school at the Facility. As of
June 2021, Camino Nuevo no longer occupied the Facility and the obligations of
Camino Nuevo with respect to the MOU and Funding Agreement ceased. Camino Nuevo
vacated the Facilities and relinquished to [LAUSD] all right, title and
interest in the occupancy and use of the Facilities.” (Pet. ¶ 19.)
 
“On March 18, 2021, [LAUSD] issued a notice of
invitation and [publicly] notified all eligible charter schools to submit
proposals to operate at the Facility and to assume the Loan (hereafter referred
to as a ‘Request for Qualifications’ or ‘RFQ’). . . . Alliance College-Ready
Public Schools (‘Alliance’) timely submitted a proposal. . . . Petitioners and [LAUSD]
selected Alliance as the successor charter school to use the Facility and
assume the Loan.” (Pet. ¶ 21.) However, Alliance subsequently withdrew its
proposal because it was “not able to assume the financial obligations and use
the Facility.” (Pet. ¶ 22.)
 
“On or
about December 17, 2021, [LAUSD] issued a second RFQ to all eligible charter
schools inviting them to submit proposals to operate a secondary education
facility (i.e., high school) at the Facility and the RFQ set a deadline to
submit proposals by February 2, 2022.” (Pet. ¶ 23.)  “On or about March 30, 2022, Petitioners
approved Ednovate as a qualified successor charter school under the California
School Facilities Program.” (Pet. ¶ 24.) “On or about April 6, 2022, [LAUSD] recommended
Ednovate and posted its selection of Ednovate as the successor charter school,
pending approval by [LAUSD’s] Board of Education.”  (Id. ¶ 25.)
 
However, in September
2022, LAUSD informed Petitioners and Endovate that LAUSD wanted to evaluate available
options for the Facility and would be exercising “its rights under the RFQ to
cancel the entire RFQ.” (Pet. ¶ 29 and Exh. J.)
 
Petitioners contend Respondents’
actions violate the Charter School Facilities Program, including Education Code
section 17078.62, California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 1859.171 and
California Code of Regulations, title 4, section 10157, subdivision (a). (Pet.
¶¶ 13-16, 36-41, 43.)
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Statute of
Limitations 
 
Respondents contend the petition is an action upon a statute for a
forfeiture and is time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth
in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (b).)
 
“ ‘A demurrer on the ground of the bar of the statute of limitations
will not lie where the action may be, but is not necessarily barred.’
[Citations.] It must appear clearly and affirmatively that, upon the face
of the complaint, the right of action is necessarily barred.” (Lockley v.
Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 875, 881.)  
 
Respondents contend Petitioners seek “to preclude Respondents from
taking possession of and utilizing the Miramar Facility” and, therefore, “are
pursuing a forfeiture by [LAUSD] of its substantial investment consisting of
the purchase price of the property.” (Memo 12:10-12.)  Respondents therefore argue the one-year
statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (b)
applies. 
 
Petitioners dispute Respondents’ position. They assert the three-year
statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 338 applies
because “the gravamen of Petitioners’ action is to enforce Respondents’
obligations arising from a statute and regulations.” (Opposition 6:24-26.)
 
“To determine the statute of limitations which applies to a cause of
action it is necessary to identify the nature of the cause of action, i.e., the
‘gravamen’ of the cause of action. [Citations.] ‘[T]he nature of the right
sued upon and not the form of action nor the relief demanded determines the
applicability of the statute of limitations under our code.’ ” (Hensler v.
City of Glendale (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1, 22-23.)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (b) provides for a
one-year limitations period for “[a]n action upon a statute for a forfeiture or
penalty to the people of this state.” “A forfeiture is ‘[t]he divestiture of
property without compensation’ or ‘[t]he loss of a right, privilege, or property.
. . .’ ” (Brandenburg v. Eureka Redevelopment Agency (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1364.) The phrase “upon a statute” in Code of Civil Procedure
section 340, subdivision (b) is unambiguous and “can only mean that the
forfeiture or penalty being sought is based on a statute
providing such a remedy.” (Ramirez v. Tulare County Dist. Attorney’s Office (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 911, 936.) For example, in People v. Property Listed In
Exhibit One (1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1, cited by Respondents, the Court of
Appeal considered a statutory procedure “for the seizure of property connected
with and proceeds traceable to unlawful drug transactions.” (Id. at 5.)
Under the statutory scheme at issue, “title to the forfeited property vests in
the state from the time of the illegal conduct.” (Ibid.)[1]
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a), in contrast,
provides a three-year limitations period for “[a]n action upon a liability
created by statute, other than a penalty or forfeiture.” Code of Civil
Procedure section 338, subdivision (a) applies to “a liability that would not
exist but for the statute.” (Shewry v. Begil (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 639,
644; see e.g. California Teachers Association v. Board of Education of
Whittier School District (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 826, 833 [writ of mandate to
compel school district to comply with Education Code section 45028 subject to
three-year statute of limitations based on a liability created by statute].)
 
At the pleading stage, Respondents do not show the gravamen of the
action is to obtain a forfeiture of Respondents’ property pursuant to statute. Petitioners allege Respondents’ actions violate the
Charter School Facilities Program (CSFP), including Education Code section
17078.62, California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 1859.171 and
California Code of Regulations, title 4, section 10157, subdivision (a). (Pet.
¶¶ 13-16, 36-41, 43.) Petitioners pray for a writ of mandate compelling
Respondents “to comply with Education Code section 17078.62, subdivision (b)(2)
and California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 1859.171, subdivision (a),
and compelling Respondents to refrain from violating state law by taking
possession and using the Facility in a manner inconsistent with Education Code
section 17078.62, subdivision (b)(2) and California Code of Regulations, title
2, section 1859.171, subdivision (a) and title 4, section 10157, subdivision
(a).” (Prayer ¶ 1.) Obtaining compliance with the laws and regulations
governing the CSFP is not a forfeiture or penalty within the meaning of Code of
Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (b). 
 
 
Respondents have not cited any
language from Education Code section 17078.62, California Code of Regulations,
title 2, section 1859.171, subdivision (a) or California Code of Regulations,
title 4, section 10157, subdivision (a) that directly imposes a
forfeiture on Respondents’ property as a result of Respondents’ alleged
non-compliance with the CSFP. That alone suggests Code of Civil Procedure
section 340, subdivision (b) does not apply because, as noted, the phrase
“upon a statute” in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (b) “can
only mean that the forfeiture or penalty being sought is based on a
statute providing such a remedy.”  (Ramirez
v. Tulare County Dist. Attorney’s Office, supra, 9 Cal.App.5th at 936.)  
 
Seemingly recognizing the problem with
their argument, Respondents argue a writ or injunction that prevents
Respondents from taking possession of and utilizing the Facility (as prayed
for) would have the effect of causing LAUSD to forfeit “its
substantial investment consisting of the purchase price of the property and the
more than $13,000,000 that [LAUSD] contributed to the cost of construction.”
(Memo 12:10-12.) At the pleading stage, Respondents’ argument is not persuasive
for several reasons.  
 
First, Respondents do not cite any
case law applying Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (b) to
circumstances similar to those here, i.e. where the penalty or forfeiture is
not specified in the statute. (Cf. People v. Property
Listed In Exhibit One, supra, 227 Cal.App.3d at 5 [under statutory
scheme, “title to the forfeited property vests in the state from
the time of the illegal conduct”]; Brandenburg v. Eureka Redevelopment
Agency, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at 1364-1365 [Code of Civil Procedure section
340, subdivision (b) applied to an action to enforce Government Code sections
1090 and 1092 because those statutes authorize the public official’s forfeiture
of rights in a contract in which the public official had a conflict of
interest].)    
 
Second, Respondents’ demurrer does not
address the statutory and regulatory provisions under which LAUSD may have
obtained a security interest in the Facility. (See Ed. Code,
§§ 17078.57, subd. (a)(3) and 17078.62,
subd. (b)(5); Cal. Code Regs, tit. 2, § 1859.171, subds. (c), (d); Cal. Code
Regs., tit. 4, § 10157, subds. (d), (f).) Having failed to address those
provisions, Respondents do not establish the writ requested by Petitioners would
necessarily cause a forfeiture of Respondents’ investment in the Facility.[2]
 
Finally, Respondents’ statute of
limitations defense raises fact questions that cannot be determined at the
pleading stage. Respondents report “[t]here is no correlation between the sum
the District will forfeit and the remaining balance on Petitioners’ loan to
Camino Nuevo.”  (Memo 12:13-15.) However,
Respondents also acknowledge Education Code section 17078.62, subdivision (b)(4)
“provides for the reduction or elimination of payments in certain circumstances.”
(Memo 12:20.) Thus, the amount of Respondents’ feared loss of investment,
compared to the balance of Petitioners’ loan, cannot be determined from the
petition. Further, Respondents could elect to comply with any writ issued by
the court and thereby avoid any potential loss of its investment.  
 
Based on the foregoing, Respondents
have not shown, from the face of the petition, Petitioners’ action is for a
forfeiture “upon a statute” within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section
340, subdivision(b). Rather, because Petitioners seek to compel compliance with
the statutes and regulations governing the CSFP, it appears the petition is
governed by the three-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section
338, subdivision (a).[3]  Respondents have not disputed the petition
was timely filed assuming a three-year limitations period.  
 
The demurrer based on the statute of
limitations is OVERRULED.
 
Respondents’ Compliance with Title 4, Section 10157 of the California
Code of Regulations
 
Petitioners allege
Respondents have a ministerial duty “to refrain from using the Facility for
other purposes as allowed under Education Code section 17078.62, subdivision
(b)(3) until Respondents have demonstrated ‘due diligence’ to solicit and
identify a successor charter school, as determined by the California School
Finance Authority, which has not occurred.” 
(Pet. ¶ 39.) Petitioners further allege “[a]t the time of the filing of
this petition, [LAUSD] has not demonstrated sufficient due diligence to the
satisfaction of Petitioner California School Finance Authority under California
Code of Regulations, title 4, section 10157, subdivision (a).” (Pet. 
¶ 39.)
 
California Code of
Regulations, title 4, section 10157, subdivision (a) provides as follows: 
 
Pursuant to Education Code, Section 17078.62(b)(3), the school district in which the Charter School is physically located
may take possession and title of the facility only after having demonstrated
due diligence in soliciting alternative Charter Schools within the local area
to take possession and title of the facility, as permitted by Education Code Section 17078.62(b)(2). Such demonstration of due diligence shall be at the Authority's
discretion, but shall include, but not be limited to, documentary evidence of
solicitation of Charter Schools within the district boundaries, where
applicable.
 
Respondents do not
contend in their demurrer that their compliance with the regulation may be
determined from the face of the petition or judicially noticeable records.  Rather, Respondents argue “section 10157
impermissibly seeks to enlarge the scope of Education Code section 17078.62”
and is therefore invalid. (Memo 16:23-24.) 

 
              Validity of California Code of Regulations, Title 4,
Section 10157, Subdivision (a)
 
“Whenever by the
express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
regulations to implement, interpret, make specific or otherwise carry out the
provisions of the statute, no regulation adopted is valid or effective unless
consistent and not in conflict with the statute and reasonably necessary to
effectuate the purpose of the statute.” (Gov. Code,
§ 11342.2.)  
 
“Administrative
regulations that alter or amend the statute or enlarge or impair its scope are
void and courts not only may, but it is their obligation to strike down such
regulations.” (Morris v. Williams (1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 748.) “ ‘In
determining whether a specific administrative rule falls within the coverage of
a delegated power, ‘the sole function of this court is to decide whether the
department reasonably interpreted the legislative mandate.’ [Citations.]’
[Citation.] ‘The construction given to a regulation by the officials
charged with its enforcement is entitled to great weight.’ [Citation.] However,
‘an administrative agency has only such authority as has been conferred on it.’
”  (San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Barozzi
(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1376, 1379.)  
 
“[T]he burden is on the
party challenging a regulation to show its invalidity, since ‘the administrative
agency’s action comes before the court with a presumption of correctness and
regularity.’ ” (Mineral Associations Coalition v. State Mining & Geology
Bd. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 574, 589.) 

 
The purpose of the CSFP
is “to provide funding to qualifying entities for the purpose of establishing
school facilities for charter school pupils.” (Ed. Code, § 17078.52, subd. (a).)
“As a first priority, the existing charter school shall be permitted to
continue to use the facility until it is no longer needed by the charter school
for charter school purposes.” (Id. § 17078.62, subd. (a).) “The school
district shall permit continued use of the facility for charter school purposes
as long as the facility is needed for those purposes.” (Id. § 17078.62,
subd. (b)(6).)  
 
Significantly, the CSFP
gives priority to a successor charter school to occupy the facility, over a
school district, when a previous charter school ceases using it. (Ed. Code §
17078.62(b)(2); 2 CCFR § 1859.171.) In furtherance of this legislative purpose,
CSFP regulations also mandate school districts complete a process to solicit
and select a successor charter school before the school district can occupy the
facility. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 1859.171, subd. (a).)  
 
Considering the
presumption of correctness and regularity that applies, the court cannot
conclude, at the pleading stage, that California Code of Regulations, title 4, section
10157, subdivision (a) is inconsistent with the CSFP statutory scheme or
impermissibly enlarges its scope. The CSFP requires school districts to
facilitate and give “first priority” to the use of 
CSFP-funded facilities
by charter schools, rather than a school district. (See Ed. Code, §§ 17078.52, subd. (a), 17078.62, subd. (b)(1)-(6).) Petitioners
could reasonably determine the due diligence requirement of the regulation is
reasonably necessary to effectuate that charter-school-before-a-district
purpose of the CSFP.  
 
Contrary to
Respondents’ argument, absence of the phrase “due diligence” in Education Code
section 17078.62, does not necessarily mean the regulation exceeds its statutory
authority.   “[T]he absence of any
specific [statutory] provisions regarding the regulation of [an issue] does not
mean that such a regulation exceeds statutory authority. . . .” [Citations.]
The [agency] is authorized to ‘fill up the details’ of the statutory scheme.’ ”(California
School Bds. Assn. v. State Bd. of Education (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 530,
544.) For this same reason, the absence of the word “succession” in Education
Code section 17078.57 does not necessarily mean the regulation exceeded the
statutory authority.
 
Respondents point out the credits to California Code of
Regulations, title 4, section 10157 cite only Education Code section 17078.57 as
the statutory authority for the regulation. Education Code section 17078.57,
subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that Petitioner CSFA:
 
in consultation with the board, shall adopt regulations
establishing uniform terms and conditions that shall apply equally to all
projects for funding in accordance with Section 17078.58, including,
but not limited to, all of the following: . . . (2) The method for
determining whether a charter school is financially sound . . . (3)(A) Security
provisions, including, but not limited to, whether title to project
facilities shall be held by the school district in which the facility
is to be physically located, in trust, for the benefit of the state public
school system, or by another entity as authorized pursuant to Section 17078.63. (Emphasis added.)  
 
“As a basic principle of
statutory construction, ‘include’ is generally used as a word of enlargement
and not of limitation. . . .Thus, where the word ‘include’ is used to refer to
specified items, it may be expanded to cover other items.” (Rea v. Blue
Shield of California (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1227.) In light of this
rule of statutory construction, Education Code section 17078.57, subdivision (a)
may plausibly be interpreted to provide authority for the succession provisions
in California Code of Regulations, title 4, section 10157, subdivision (a). To
the extent there is ambiguity in Education Code section 17078.57, subdivision (a),
Respondents have not cited any legislative history or other extrinsic aids from
which the court could resolve such ambiguity on demurrer. (Nolan v. City
of Anaheim (2004) 33 Cal.4th 335, 340 [“when the language is susceptible of
more than one reasonable interpretation, we look to a variety of extrinsic
aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be
remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous
administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a
part”].) Again, Respondents are not precluded from providing relevant legislative
history or extrinsic evidence in subsequent proceedings in this proceeding. (Ibid.
[rules of statutory construction].)
 
Based on the foregoing,
for purposes of their demurrer, Respondents have not met their burden of
demonstrating the regulation conflicts with or impermissibly enlarges the scope
of the CSFP statutory scheme. Thus, for this motion, Respondents have not
proven California Code of Regulations, title 4, section 10157, subdivision (a)
is an invalid regulation.  
 
///
 
///
 
              Do Petitioners Seek to Apply the Regulation
Retroactively?  
 
Respondents also argue the
operative version of California Code of Regulations, title 4, section 10157,
subdivision (a) was promulgated after Petitioners and Respondents entered the
MOU and does not apply retroactively. 
                                                                                                                 
“Generally, the same
rules of construction and interpretation which apply to statutes govern the
construction and interpretation of administrative regulations. It is an
established canon of interpretation that statutes are not to be given a
retrospective operation unless it is clearly made to appear that such was the
legislative intent. However, a statute is not retroactive unless it
substantially changes the legal effect of past events. A statute does not
operate retroactively merely because some of the facts or conditions upon which
its application depends came into existence prior to its enactment.” (Union
of American Physicians & Dentists v. Kizer (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 490,
504-505 [cleaned up].)  
 
“While it is true that
as a general rule statutes are not to be given retroactive effect unless the
intent of the Legislature cannot be otherwise satisfied . . ., an exception to
the general rule is recognized in a case where the legislative amendment merely
clarifies the existing law.”  (People
ex rel. Deukmejian v. CHE, Inc. (1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 123, 135.)  
 
The court finds retroactivity
is not an issue here. The regulation operates prospectively—it imposes
obligations on a going forward basis only.
 
Camino Nuevo vacated
the Facility in June 2021, two and a half years after the amendment to California
Code of Regulations, title 4, section 10157, in October 2018. (Pet. ¶¶ 16, 19.)
The acts triggering the obligations of the regulation arose after the
regulation was amended. Petitioners seek to apply the regulation on a
prospective basis only.
 
Respondents have not
developed a persuasive argument, or cited any authority supporting a
conclusion, that the 2011 MOU required Petitioners to apply the law then in
effect (in 2011) to all aspects of the parties’ relationship with
respect to the Facility. That construction of the MOU, as well as the CSFP, could
likely lead to absurd results. Nonetheless, Respondents are not precluded from
further developing such argument in subsequent proceedings in this action.  
 
Based on the foregoing,
Respondents do not show, for purposes of their demurrer, California Code of
Regulations, title 4, section 10157, subdivision (a) is invalid or is being
applied retroactively. The petition sufficiently alleges Respondents failed to
comply with the due diligence requirements of the regulation. (See Pet.  (Pet. ¶¶ 16-41.) Accordingly, the demurrer is
OVERRULED. In light of the court’s conclusion, the court need not analyze
Respondents’ contentions that they complied with other statutory and regulatory
requirements from the CSFP.
