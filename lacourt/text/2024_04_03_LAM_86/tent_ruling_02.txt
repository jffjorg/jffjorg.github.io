[1] Along with the County, Petitioner named as
respondents to the petition the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, the
Los Angeles County Auditor Controller, the Los Angeles County Civil Service
Commission (Commission), and the Los Angeles County Employee Relations
Commission (ERCOM). On April 22, 2022, Petitioner dismissed the entire proceeding
as to the Commission and ERCOM.


[2] Paragraph 20 of the FAP alleges “None of the Deputy Doe
Petitioners has been paid any interest on the amount of the back pay awarded to
them.” In its answer, the County denied paragraph 20 due to insufficient
knowledge or information. As the
employer, the County should have (and likely has) records related to the
payment of backpay and interest to its employees.   In
opposition, the County has not cited any evidence Deputies Doe 1 through 5, 7 through 13, 16 through
23, and 27 through 29 received interest from the County on their awarded
backpay.  (See generally Opposition 15:9-16:21
and Reply Gibbons Decl. ¶¶ 12-13 and Exh. U at ¶ 6.)  


[3] While mandamus does not lie to enforce purely
contractual obligations, “mandamus is proper insofar as the public officials
would need to undertake certain ministerial duties to implement a contract with
a public employee.” (Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs v. County
of Los Angeles (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 764, 809.) As the County has
recognized, to implement the settlements, “county officials would need to carry
out certain ministerial duties.” (Id. at 810.)


[4] In its most recent opposition filed March 4, 2024, the
has not developed any argument any of the Deputies Doe, except perhaps Deputy Doe
3, failed to exhaust administrative or judicial remedies. (See Oppo. 18-19.)


[5] Whether interest is required to be paid under the
settlement agreements for Deputies Doe 8 and 10 is to be decided in this
proceeding. (Opening Brief 9:14-16.)


[6] Petitioner filed the petition on December 11,
2020—within three years of the superior court’s denial of Deputy Doe 29’s writ
petition.


[7]
“Equitable
tolling is a judge-made doctrine ‘which operates independently of the literal
wording of the Code of Civil Procedure’ to suspend or extend a statute of
limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and fairness.”
(Ibid.) Under equitable tolling, “courts have adhered to a general policy which
favors relieving plaintiff from the bar of a limitations statute when,
possessing several legal remedies [s]he, reasonably and in good faith, pursues
one designed to lessen the extent of [her] injuries or damage.” (Addison v.
State of California (1978) 21 Cal.3d 313, 317.)  


[8] The County’s laches defense as to Deputies Doe
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 17, and 29 is based on the same contentions addressed above with
respect to Petitioner and attorney Gibbons. 
 


[9] The County also argues Deputy Doe 3’s claim “did not
arise from discipline . . . .” (Opposition 17, fn. 3.) The court disagrees. The
evidence shows Deputy Doe 3 challenged a disciplinary action through a grievance
arbitration pursuant to the parties’ memorandum of understanding.  Specifically, Deputy Doe 3 challenged the
removal of his bonus position of Senior Field Training Officer and the
associated loss of 5.5 percent salary bonus, which were imposed by his captain
in response to a complaint of misconduct. (See Reply 7:16-8:2; Reply Gibbons
Decl. ¶¶ 32-37.)  


[10] Respondent has not
pleaded the Government Claims Act as a defense in its answer or asserted that
the Government Claims Act applies to the claims of any of the Deputies Doe
other than Deputies Doe 4, 8, 10, and 16. 



[11] It appears the County did not plead this defense in its
Answer. In any event, the court denies the defense on the merits.


[12] While somewhat unclear from the opposition,
Respondent’s standing arguments may also apply to Deputies Doe 19 through 22.
(See Opposition 29:4-12.)  The court’s
analysis is the same for Does 19-22 as stated for Does 8, 10-12, 18, 23, 27-28.
 


[13] In a footnote, the Answer states: “It remains unclear
whether the Court formerly ordered Petitioner-Does 1-29 to be joined as party
petitioners to this action. To the extent, the County refers to them as parties
or petitioners, this is only because ALADS seeks to vindicate their rights in
this action, and the County reserves the right to dispute that they have
been properly added as parties to the action.” (Ans. p. 2, fn. 4 [emphasis
added].) The court does not interpret this statement as a defense for
failure to join the Deputies Doe as parties pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 389. Rather, the County purported to reserve the right to
dispute that the Deputies Doe had been added as parties.
