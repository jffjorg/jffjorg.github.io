[1] Although People v. Property Listed In Exhibit One concerned
a different statute of limitations (in Health and Safety Code section 11488.4),
the Court discussed Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (b) and
the Court’s decision illustrates the type of statute that falls within the
scope of Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (b). (See id.
at 9.)

Respondents do not show good cause to raise new arguments about these statutes
and regulations in reply. (See Reply 4; Balboa Ins. Co. v. Aguirre (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010. [“The salutary rule is that points
raised in a reply brief for the first time will not be considered unless good
cause is shown for the failure to present them before.”]) Further, even in
reply, Respondents do not provide a comprehensive discussion of the statutory
scheme or adequately support their legal conclusion that the impact of the
statutes and regulations “is to cause the District to forfeit its
monetary contributions.” (Reply 4:24.) Of course, Respondents may fully develop
their contentions regarding security interests in subsequent proceedings in
this writ action.

As Petitioners point out, Code of Civil Procedure section 338 does not apply “where a cause of
action is based upon a statute which did not ‘create a new form of
liability . . . but merely codified and refined existing law.’ ” (Brandenberg
v. Eureka Redevelopment Agency, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at 1361-1362.)
Here, Petitioners seek to compel compliance with a statutory and regulatory
scheme (the CSFP) that did not exist in the common law or prior to enactment of
the CSFP.
