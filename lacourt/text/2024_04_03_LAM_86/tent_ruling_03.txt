SOUTH PASADENA
Case No. 22STCP01432
Hearing Date: April

[Tentative]       ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF
MANDATE WITH REMAND                           
 
                                                                                                                                                                                            
 
Petitioner, James
Chung, seeks an order compelling Respondent, the City of South Pasadena (City),
to “comply with [the South Pasadena Municipal Code] and state law, . . . .”
(Pet. Prayer.) More specifically, Petitioner contends the City unlawfully
issued building and grading permits in the absence of a valid hillside
development permit (HDP). According to Petitioner, the grading and building
permits “show on their face the facts that the City did not comply with its
Building Code and perform fully and completely all plan checks, issuance, and
inspections.” (Opening Brief 13:16-17.) Petitioner specifies 13 instances of
the City’s alleged “fail[ure] to perform in 2020-2021 the acts that are
required of it by law.”[1] (Opening Brief 14:2-3.)
Real Parties in Interest, Edmund Louie and Deborah Kotani, and the City oppose
the petition.
 
Petitioner’s
unopposed request for judicial notice is granted.
The City’s unopposed
request for judicial notice is granted.
 
The petition is denied.
 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
 
Petitioner and Real
Parties live in the City; they are neighbors. 
 
In February 2016,
Real Parties applied for a HDP to “grade rear yard to create a larger area at
the same level and install 6 [foot] perimeter walls, [and] install new swimming
pool.” (AR 6.) Real Parties’ application provided a justification statement for
hillside development. (AR 8.) The City’s application requested proposed factual
findings required for a HDP pursuant to SPMC section 36.410.065. (AR 8.)
 
Real Parties’ 2016 application
represented the “proposed use complies with the requirements of Division 36.340
(Hillside Protection) and all other applicable provisions of the Zoning Code”
because “both the site grading and the 6 [foot] retaining walls are allowed per
the hillside development guidelines.” (AR 8.) The application also specified
the proposed use did not affect the City’s general plan or the applicable
specific plan; would not be detrimental to the health, safety or general
welfare of the community or property and improvements in the neighborhood. (AR
9.) Finally, Real Parties’ application advised the “design, location, operating
characteristics, and size of the proposed use would be compatible with the
existing and future land uses in the vicinity . . . .” (AR 9.)
 
Through their 2016 application,
Real Parties sought City approval to remove “350 cubic yards of the hillside .
. .” for the project. (AR 8, 44, 80.)
 
The City approved the
project through its planning commission. (AR 80-82.) As part of the approval
process, the planning commission adopted a negative declaration in compliance
with the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000
et seq. (AR 80.) The planning commission also found the “proposed
project [] consistent with all five applicable findings to grant the [HDP] for
the project pursuant to [SPMC] Section 36.410.065, . . . .” (AR 80.)
 
On January 13, 2017,
the City issued a building permit and a grading permit for the approved
project. (AR 115-116.) The building permit described the work permitted as the
construction of a six foot-high retaining wall. (AR 115.) The grading permit
indicated the work “shall be in accordance with the approved plans” which
allowed 360 cubic yards of soil to be “handled.” (AR 116.)
 
At some point Real
Parties performed the grading work under the permits but did not complete the
project. (Opening Brief 11:18-19. AR 256. [“The work that was actually
completed under the approved building permit was to grade the site but the
retaining walls and swimming pool were never installed.”] Reply 2:11-25.) Real
Parties performed the grading work allowed under the permits. (AR 256. [“. . .
the grading was completed under the previously approved project”].) 
 
The permits
thereafter expired. (AR 256 [“the permits have expired”]. See also AR 152.) The
grading performed under the grading permit was never inspected by the City.
 
Several years later,
on April 27, 2020, Real Parties wrote to the City. (AR 152.) Real Parties
advised they wished to “put up our retaining wall” and recognized they would
have to obtain permits because they were “sure they expired.” (AR 152.) Real
Parties advised the City they were “having an erosion issue” so they needed to
get the retaining wall built as soon as possible. (AR 152.)
The City advised Real
Parties “[t]he project need[ed] to be submitted as a new HDP application in
order for the work to continue[2] and for it to be
completed.” (AR 142.)
 
On November 17, 2020,
Real Parties submitted their HDP application that is the subject of the
petition. (AR 175.)
 
At a planning
department staff meeting in December 2020, the City’s planning department decided
Real Parties’ HDP application could be decided by the City’s planning director
as a minor HDP. (AR 237, 259. See SPMC § 36.410.065, subd. (D)(2).) The
director’s approval nonetheless required “all the HDP requirements [to be]
applied to [the] project . . . .”[3] (AR 258.)
 
On February 25, 2021,
a “contract planner” found the project “conforms to the planning and zoning
standards” for the City. (AR 255.) The contract planner’s approval was
contingent upon “the approval of the City of South Pasadena planning division.”
(AR 255.) On April 14, 2021 or sometime prior, the City obtained the planning
director’s approval for the HDP. (AR 258 [“here is the Director’s approval for
planning”].)[4]
 
On April 29, 2021, the
planning department advised Real Parties the project would “not be going
through a public hearing as it has already been approved by Planning.” (AR
283.) The planning department also advised Real Parties to “coordinate with
Building for permit.” (AR 283.)
 
On August 4, 2021,
the City issued a building permit allowing a six-foot retaining wall running
140 feet to be constructed. (AR 683.) The City also issued a grading permit
specifying the work “shall be in accordance with the approved plans,” and the
plans specify “all site grading was completed under previous permits.” (AR 254,
684.) Real Parties represented during the permitting process the grading had
been completed pursuant to the 2017 grading permit and no additional grading
would be undertaken.[5]
 
Petitioner challenges
the 2021 HDP, building permit, and grading permit. He seeks a determination
from the court that they were “not lawfully issued” and are “legally invalid ab
initio.” (Pet. Prayer.) He also requests the court find Real Parties in
interest “have no vested right as to any of the excavation, grading, and
construction work” done at their property. (Pet. Prayer.) Finally, he requests
a court order compelling the City to comply with the law as to any “activities
Real Parties [] may want to undertake” on their property “for which any kind of
City-issued permit is required.” (Pet. Prayer.)

STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Petitioner seeks
relief from the court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
1094.5. The parties do not discuss which statute applies here; they merely engage
in general discussion of the statutes.
 
In a traditional
mandamus proceeding under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, the trial court
determines “whether the agency's action was arbitrary, capricious, or without
evidentiary support, and/or whether it failed to conform to the law. The trial
court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency or force the agency
to exercise its discretion in a certain way. [Citation.] [¶] The reviewing
court exercises independent judgment in determining whether the agency action
was ‘consistent with applicable law.’ [Citation.] Where the issue is one of
statutory [or regulatory] interpretation, the question is one of law for the
courts, which are the ‘ “ultimate arbiters” ’ of statutory [or regulatory]
construction. [Citations.]” (Association of Irritated Residents v. San
Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control Dist. (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 535, 542-543.)
 
Administrative
mandate addresses final orders by an agency “made as a result of a proceeding
in which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be
taken, and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the . . .
board or officer, . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (a).) Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (b), the relevant issues are
whether the respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a
fair trial, and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse
of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner
required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings
are not supported by the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (b).)
 
Here, the City did
not conduct a hearing (an issue contested by Petitioner), but the City was
required to make certain factual findings based on evidence submitted to issue
a HDP. There is also a formal appeal process available to contest the City’s
decision on a HDP application. (SPMC § 36.410.065, subd. (I).)
 
While a “ ‘purely
documentary’ hearing can satisfy section 1094.5, there must still be something in
the nature of a hearing, i.e., an adversarial process in which the agency
resolves disputed facts after affording interested parties an opportunity to
present evidence.” (300 DeHaro Street Investors v. Department of Housing &
Community Development (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1240, 1251.) “Here, no law required
the [City] to entertain input from interested parties . . . or to allow [Real
Parties] an opportunity for rebuttal.” (Id. at 1252.) As no administrative
hearing was required by law, the court finds Code of Civil Procedure section
1094.5 does not apply here. That is, the matter is governed by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085.[6]
 
Thus, the court must
determine whether the City actions were arbitrary, capricious, without
evidentiary support or failed to conform to the law.
 
Did the City Issue a
Valid HDP in 2021?
 
              Applicable Law under the SPMC
 
The SPMC provides
HDPs “may be approved or disapproved by the Planning Commission.” (SPMC § 36.410.040,
subd. (D)(1).) The SPMC also specifies “[m]inor [HDPs] may be approved or
disapproved by the Design Review Board (DRB), DRB Chair, or Planning Director
in accordance with SPMC 36.410.040.” (SPMC § 36.410.040, subd. (D)(2).)
 
SPMC section 36.700.020,
subdivision (D) defines Director as: “The City of South Pasadena Director of Planning
and Building, or designee of the Director, referred to in this Zoning Code as
the ‘Director.’ ” 
 
SPMC section
36.600.060, subdivision (C) provides:
 
The Director may delegate the
responsibilities of the Director to assigned Department staff under the
supervision of the Director. When the Director designates a Department staff
person, the staff person shall perform the duties assigned by the Director in
addition to those listed in Subsection B above, as appropriate to the personnel
title of the designee.
 
SPMC section 36.410.065,
subdivision (B) specifies a minor HDP is required for any proposed
development subject to the requirements of SPMC Division 36.340 (Hillside
Protection) that is other than the proposed construction of a new primary
dwelling unit. The City’s planning commission may approve or disapprove a HDP. (See
SPMC § 36.410.040, subd. (D)(1).) The issuance of a HDP—not a minor HDP—is
subject to a notice public hearing before the planning commission. (SPMC §
36.410.065, subds. (B), (D), (E).) A “[m]inor HDP may be approved or
disapproved by the . . . Planning Director in accordance with SPMC 36.410.040[]”—a
 design review provision. (SPMC §
36.410.040, subd. (D).) “Minor Design Review by the . . . Planning Director
shall be considered administratively without conducting a public hearing or
providing public notice before taking action.” (SPMC § 36.410.040, subd.
(F)(2).)[7]
 
The SMPC delegates
the Planning Director (as defined under the SPMC) with design review authority
for “[m]odifications to existing graded and/or improved outdoor areas on a
property subject to Division 36.340 (Hillside Prection), . . . .”[8] (SPMC § 36.410.040, subd.
(D)(5)(c).)
 
              Real Parties’ Project
 
Real Parties submitted
a planning commission application form to the City to obtain approval to build
a retaining wall.[9]
(AR 169.) Real Parties’ proposed project required a minor HDP since Real
Parties were not proposing construction of a new primary dwelling unit. (SPMC §
36.410.065, subd. (B).) The Planning Director or his designee—pursuant to SMPC
sections 36.700.020, subdivision (D) and 36.600.060, subdivision (C)—is
responsible under the SPMC for approval or disapproval of a minor HDP application
given the scope of the proposed project.[10] (SPMC 
§ 36.410.040, subd.
(D)(5)(c).) Since the SPMC designates the Planning Director or his designee as
responsible for approving the minor HDP application, no public hearing is
required. (See SPMC § 36.410.065, subds. (D), (E).)
 
The Planning
Director’s designee approved the plans as conforming with the City’s planning
and zoning standards on February 25, 2021. (AR 357.) Sometime prior to April
14, 2021, the Director approved the minor HDP.[11]
 
Based on the
foregoing, the court finds the City complied with its municipal code when it
approved Real Parties HDP application. That is, Petitioner has not demonstrated
the City’s process for approving the minor HDP and related permits was inconsistent
with the SPMC.
 
Was Petitioner
Required to Exhaust His Administrative Remedies?
 
The SPMC authorizes
an appeal from a design review decision of the Planning Director. (SPMC 
§ 36.410.040, subd.
(J).) An aggrieved party must file an appeal “within 15 days of the decision.” (Ibid.)
 
Given that the SPMC
does not require (and the City did not provide) notice to interested parties
that it was considering Real Parties’ application for a HDP and there is no
evidence the City provided Petitioner with notice of its decision within 15
days of having made it, it would be inappropriate (and unfair) to find
Petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and cannot seek
judicial review. The City’s position would suggest a property owner could obtain
a minor HDP with no notice to interested parties, wait more than 15 days to
obtain permits and/or begin work on the project, and claim the City’s decisions
were thereafter insulated from review based on the short 15-day appeal period. That
Petitioner did not appeal after learning of the City’s decision sometime after
the 15-day period had run is irrelevant. The SPMC makes clear any appeal must
be filed within 15 days of the decision.
 
The court rejects the
exhaustion of administrative remedies defense asserted by the City and Real
Parties.
 
Is the City’s
Decision to Issue the HDP and Related Building Permits Arbitrary, Capricious or
Without Evidentiary Support?
 
As noted, this matter
is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1085—the City issued the minor
HDP without any administrative hearing or adversarial process. Thus, the court’s
standard of review is whether the City’s acts were arbitrary, capricious or without
evidentiary support.
 
To issue an HDP, the
City must find:
 
1.     
The
proposed use complies with the requirements of Division 36.340 (Hillside
Protection) and all other applicable provisions of this Zoning Code. 
2.     
The
proposed use is consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific
plan; 
3.     
The
establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use would not, under the
circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, or
general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the
proposed use; 
4.     
The
use, as described and conditionally approved, would not be detrimental or
injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general
welfare of the City; and 
5.     
The
design, location, operating characteristics, and size of the proposed use would
be compatible with the existing and future land uses in the vicinity, in terms
of aesthetics, character, scale, and view protection. (§ 36.410.065, subd. (F).)
 
As for design, the
City must find:
 
1.     
Is
consistent with the General Plan, any adopted design guidelines and any applicable
design criteria for specialized areas (e.g., designated historic or other
special districts, plan developments, or specific plans); 
2.     
Will
adequately accommodate the functions and activities proposed for the site, will
not unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighboring, existing,
or future developments, and will not create adverse pedestrian or traffic
hazards; 
3.     
Is
compatible with the existing character of the surrounding neighborhood and that
all reasonable design efforts have been made to maintain the attractive,
harmonious, and orderly development contemplated by this section and the
General Plan; and 
4.     
Would
provide a desirable environment for its occupants and neighbors, and is
aesthetically of good composition, materials, and texture that would remain
aesthetically appealing with a reasonable level of maintenance and upkeep. (§
36.410.040, subd. (I).)
 
The Director had evidence
before him to support findings necessary to issue a minor HDP. That is, the Director
had a factual basis to issue the minor HDP. 
 
First, the Director
had the City’s planning commission’s findings and determinations for Real
Parties’ prior HDP which addressed the same retaining wall and development.[12] While the planning
commission’s resolution addressed the 2016 HDP, the information was nonetheless
relevant to the Director’s decision for the 2021 minor HDP. 
 
The planning
commission’s resolution explained how the proposed use (1) complies with the City’s
hillside protection ordinance (SPMC section 36.40) (AR 80-81); (2) is consistent
with the general plan and any applicable specific plan (AR 81); (3) would not
be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or
working in the neighborhood (AR 81); (4) would not be detrimental or injurious
to property and improvements in the neighborhood (AR 81-82); and (5) would be
compatible with the existing and future land uses in the vicinity. (AR 82.) (See
SPMC § 36.410.065, subd. (F).)
 
The Director also had
a planning commission staff report prepared for consideration of Real Parties’
2016 HDP application. (AR 42-90.) The staff report provided a thorough
evaluation of the 2016 proposed project. The staff report provides evidence
necessary for some design review requirements—consistency with the general plan
and any applicable specific plan (AR 45-46), compatibility with the character
of the neighborhood (AR 46), and compatibility with future land uses. (AR 46.)
 
As to the 2020 HDP, the
Real Parties submitted an application providing a factual basis for the
findings required for a minor HDP. (AR 169-170.) The application also addressed
design guidelines and how the proposed project complied with those guidelines.
(AR 171-172.) As to the design, Real Parties’ application explained the
retaining wall would not be visible from the street (AR 171), complies with the
City’s height limitations (AR 171), is screened from street view (AR 172) and
does not alter existing landscaping. (AR 172.) 
 
Based on the evidence
before the Director, the court finds Petitioner has not met his burden of
demonstrating the City acted in an arbitrarily or capriciously or without
evidentiary support when it issued the minor HDP and related building permits
in 2021.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing,
the petition is denied.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
