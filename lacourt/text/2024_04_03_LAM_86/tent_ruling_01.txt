  Case Number:  20STCV47465    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  86 ASSOCIATION FOR LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHERIFFS v.
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES
Case Number: 20STCV47465
Hearing Date: April 3, 2024
 
[Tentative]       ORDER
GRANTING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 
 
 
Petitioner, the Association for Los Angeles
Deputy Sheriffs and Deputies Doe 1 through 29, seek a writ of mandate ordering
Respondent, the County of Los Angeles (the County),[1]
to pay interest, including pre-judgment interest pursuant to Civil Code section
3287, subdivision (a), on backpay awards previously ordered in various forums
for the Deputy Does. The County opposes the petition.  
 
The parties stipulated to first try certain
defenses asserted by the County. On April 7, 2023, after written briefing and a
hearing, the court issued its Order on Bifurcated Issues (the April 2023 Order).
In the April 2023 Order, the court concluded the first and third defenses
asserted by the County (home rule doctrine and binding past practice) did not
result in a decision in the County’s favor. 

 
On June 16, 2023, the court set a second hearing
on the bifurcated issues of waiver and exhaustion of administrative remedies.
The court and the parties identified Deputies Doe 1, 5, 6, 18, 23, and 28 as
“test cases” as to the County’s waiver and exhaustion defenses. The court held
a hearing on the County’s waiver and exhaustion defenses on October 25, 2023,
and took the matter under submission. In a written order dated December 4, 2023
(the December 2023 Order), the court found (1) the County had not demonstrated
that Deputies Doe 1, 5, 6, 18, 23, and 28 waived their statutory right to
pre-judgment interest pursuant to Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a) in
connection with their awards of backpay from the Commission, ERCOM, or the
Superior Court; (2) Deputies Doe 1, 5, 18, 23, and 28 adequately exhausted
their administrative remedies as to requests for pre-judgment interest; and (3)
the writ action is moot as to Deputy Doe 6 because the court has, in a separate
action, already granted a petition for writ of mandate directing payment of
interest to Deputy Doe 6.  
 
In the December 2023 Order, the court also
directed the County to file an answer. The County filed its answer on January
4, 2024.  
 
At a trial setting conference held on January 5,
2024, the court scheduled a final hearing on all remaining issues raised by the
petition and set a briefing schedule.   
The County’s evidentiary objections to the
Declaration of Elizabeth Gibbons are all overruled except for the first
objection which is sustained.
 
The County’s evidentiary objection (number 19) to
the Declaration of Brian Ross is overruled. 

 
The County’s request for judicial notice of
Exhibits 1 and 2 is granted.  
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
Petitioner
seeks relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.  
 
There are two
essential requirements for the issuance of an ordinary writ of mandate under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1085: (1) a clear, present, and ministerial
duty on the part of the respondent, and (2) a clear, present, and beneficial
right on the part of the petitioner to the performance of that duty. (California Ass’n for Health Services at Home
v. Department of 
Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is
proper where . . . the claim is that an agency has failed to act as required by
law.” (Id. at 705.)
 
“Generally, mandamus is available to
compel a public agency’s performance or to correct an agency’s abuse of
discretion when the action being compelled or corrected is ministerial.”  (AIDS Healthcare Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Public
Health (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 693, 700.)  “ ‘While, of
course, it is the general rule that mandamus will not lie to control the
discretion of a court or officer, meaning by that that it will not lie to force
the exercise of discretion in a particular manner . . . [it] will lie to
correct abuses of discretion, and will lie to force a particular action by the
inferior tribunal or officer, when the law clearly establishes the petitioner's
right to such action.’ ”  (Flores v.
Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 199,
208.)  
 
An agency is presumed to have regularly
performed its official duties. (Evid. Code, § 664.) Therefore, a petitioner
“bears the burden of proof in a mandate proceeding brought under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085.” (California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th
1133, 1154.)  
 
“ ‘On questions of law arising in mandate
proceedings, [the court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’ . . . Interpretation
of a statute or regulation is a question of law subject to independent review.”
(Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Claims for
Pre-Judgment Interest of Does 6, 14, 15, 24 through 26
 
First, Petitioner
“has agreed to dismiss, without prejudice,” the claims for pre-judgment
interest of Deputies Doe 15 and 24 through 26 because the Commissions has not
yet issued a final decision in the administrative appeals of those Deputies Doe.
(Petitioner’s Third Supplemental Points and Authorities [Opening Brief] 8, fn.
2; see also Gibbons Decl. filed 2/2/24 [Gibbons Decl.] ¶ 5.)  
 
As noted, the
court previously found the writ proceeding is moot as to Deputy Doe 6 because
the court has, in a separate action, already granted a petition for writ of
mandate directing payment of interest to Deputy Doe 6. Petitioner acknowledges
“based on this Court’s ruling with regard
to Deputy Doe 6, Deputy Doe 14’s proper avenue for relief is a motion to
enforce the existing judgement awarding him interest on his back pay.” (Reply
15:8-10.)  
 
Accordingly, the petition is denied,
on grounds of ripeness or mootness, as to the claims for pre-judgment interest
of Deputies Doe 6 (moot), 14 (moot), 15 (unripe), and 24 through 26 (unripe).
 
The County Has a
Clear, Present and Ministerial Duty to Include Interest on the Awards of Backpay
to Deputies Doe 1 through 5, 7
through 13, 16 through 23, 27 through 29
 
Petitioner contends
the County has a ministerial duty to include interest on the awards of backpay
to Deputies Doe 1 through 5, 7 through 13, 16 through 23, and 27 through 29.
The court agrees.
 
As noted in the April
2023 Order, the Deputies Doe have a statutory right to interest on backpay that
has been wrongfully withheld during a termination or suspension set aside by
ERCOM or the Commission after an administrative hearing. (See April 2023 Order
7-8 [“right to prejudgment interest arises from Civil Code section 3287”]; see
also San Diego County Deputy Sheriffs
Assn. v. San Diego County Sheriff’s Dept. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1084,
1086 [pursuant to Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a), “when an
administrative agency determines an employee's employment was wrongfully
terminated, and reinstates the employee’s employment with backpay, the agency
must include interest in the award of wrongfully withheld backpay”]; Goldfarb v. Civil Service Com. (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 633, 635-637 [same].)
 
In Goldfarb v. Civil Service
Commission, a demoted employee appealed the demotion to the Alameda County
Civil Service Commission. The Commission rescinded the demotion and awarded the
employee backpay. After the County of Alameda refused to pay the employee
interest on his backpay award, the employee sought a writ from the superior court.
The superior court denied the employee’s petition, and the Court of Appeal
reversed. The Court of Appeal reasoned: 
 
A writ of mandate may be issued where there is a clear, present and
usually ministerial duty on the part of the defendant, and a clear, present and
beneficial right in plaintiff to performance of that duty. [Citation.] These
conditions are satisfied in appellant’s case insofar as the petition seeks
interest on his backpay.
 
Respondents’ duty to pay interest and appellant’s right to such
interest are established by section 3287, subdivision (a), which provides
in pertinent part that “[e]very person who is entitled to recover damages
certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right to
recover which is vested in him upon a particular day, is entitled also to
recover interest thereon from that day . . . . This section is applicable to
recovery of damages and interest from . . . any county. . .” The Civil Code
defines “damages” broadly as monetary compensation for one who suffers
detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another (§ 3281), and a number of cases have indicated
that backpay awards are “damages” under section 3287. (Goldfarb v. Civil Service
Com., supra, 225 Cal.App.3d at 635.)
 
Here, the preponderance of the
evidence demonstrates the Commission or ERCOM awarded Deputies Doe 1 through 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
through 13, 17 through 23, and 27 through 29 backpay in administrative
proceedings, and the County failed to pay pre-judgment interest pursuant to Civil
Code section 3287, subdivision (a) on those backpay awards. (See Gibbons Decl.
¶¶ 4, 6-39; Ross Decl. ¶ 9; Safarloo Decl. filed 3/4/24 [Safarloo Decl.] ¶¶
1-36; Reply Gibbons Decl. filed 3/25/24 [Reply Gibbons Decl.] ¶¶ 12-40 and Exh.
U and V; First Amended Petition (FAP) ¶¶ 16-21; Answer ¶¶ 16-21; Verifications
of Deputies Doe 1 through 30 filed 2/25/22.)[2] Based on the evidence,
Petitioner has proven the County has a clear, present, and ministerial duty to
pay pre-judgment interest pursuant to Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a)
on the awards of backpay to Deputies Doe 1 through 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 through 13,
17 through 23, and 27 through 29.
 
The County executed settlement agreements with
Deputies Doe 4, 8, 10, and 16 in connection with administrative or writ
proceedings of those Deputies Doe. (See Safarloo Decl. ¶¶ 7, 11, 13, 19 and
Exh. 7, 13, 16; Ross Decl. Exh. A.) In those settlement agreements, the County agreed
to pay backpay to the Deputies Doe or “make whole” the Deputies Doe for their
loss wages.  (Ibid.)
 
Although somewhat unclear, the County may
contend its agreement to pay backpay or “make whole” for Deputies Doe 4, 8, 10,
and 16 in a settlement does not trigger a ministerial duty to
include interest pursuant to Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a). (See
Opposition 22:21-23.)  The County points
out the Los Angeles County Code at section 6.20.100, subdivision (b) does not
expressly provide for payment of interest on backpay after an employee’s
reduction, suspension, or discharge had been set aside. (Opposition 22:12-21.)
The court previously rejected the County’s contention that an award of back pay
pursuant to the Los Angeles County Code excludes statutory interest.(April 2023
Order at 2-5.) The County has not explained why an agreement to pay backpay
pursuant to a settlement—for pending administrative proceedings—should be
treated differently than an award of backpay by the Commission or ERCOM as to
pre-judgment interest. In both cases, the backpay is monetary compensation for one who
suffers detriment from the alleged unlawful act or omission of another. (See Goldfarb
v. Civil Service Com., supra, 225 Cal.App.3d at 635; Civ. Code, § 3281.)
Thus, in the absence of an express waiver of pre-judgment interest (see
analysis in December 2023 Order and below as to the County’s waiver defenses),
the court concludes the County’s agreement to pay backpay or “make whole” for
Deputies Doe 4, 8, 10, and 16 triggered a ministerial duty to pay interest on
the backpay.[3]  
 
The County has a
ministerial duty to include interest on the awards of backpay to Deputies Doe 1
through 5, 7 through 13, 16 through 23, and 27 through 29.
 
Exhaustion of
Administrative Remedies 
 
As the court
concluded in the December 2023 Order, the test cases (Deputies Doe
1, 5, 18, 23, and 28) adequately exhausted their administrative remedies as to
requests for pre-judgment interest by requesting “full back pay, benefits, and
all other emoluments of employment,” “interest on all such back pay,” or words
to that effect. With its most recent briefing, Petitioner submits evidence Deputies
Doe 2 through 4, 7, 9 through 13, 17 through 22, 27, and 29 similarly made
requests for “interest” on backpay, payment of “full back pay, benefits, and
all other emoluments of employment,” or similar relief in their administrative
proceedings. (See Opening Brief 8:15-9:24; Gibbons Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6-39 and Exh. B-P;
and Ross Decl. ¶¶ 3-9, Exh. A.)[4]  
 
Further, Petitioner submits evidence that Deputies
Doe 8, 10, and 16 executed settlement agreements under which the County agreed
to pay backpay and/or “make whole” to Does 4, 8, 10, and 16.[5]
(Ibid.)  
 
Accordingly, for the reasons discussed in the
December 2023 Order, the court concludes Deputies Doe 1 through 5, 7 through 13, 16 through
23, and 27 through 29 have also exhausted their administrative remedies as to
their requests for pre-judgment interest.

///
Petitioner Has a
Beneficial Interest in the Writ and Does Not Have a Plain, Speedy, and Adequate
Remedy at Law
 
Petitioner is “a
recognized employee organization as defined in the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act
(‘MMBA’, Government Code section 3500, et seq.) representing sworn
non-management peace officers employed by the Department and the County
District Attorney’s Office with regard to all matters concerning wages, hours
and working conditions.” (FAP ¶ 9; Ans. ¶ 9.) “It is settled that ‘[a] labor
union is entitled to represent its members in an action which is inseparably
founded upon its members’ employment.’ [Citations.] Furthermore, a union
can bring a representative action even if, at the time of the action, the
affected employee is not a member or the union is no longer the exclusive
representative.” (Anaheim Elementary Education Assn. v. Board of Education (1986)
179 Cal.App.3d 1153, 1157.) This writ proceeding “is inseparably founded upon
its members’ employment,” specifically the statutory right of the Deputies Doe
to receive interest on their unpaid backpay. Because Petitioner has standing to
bring this writ proceeding on behalf of the Deputies Doe, Petitioner has also demonstrated
a beneficial interest in the requested writ directing payment of interest to
the Deputies Doe.  
 
There is also no
statutory enforcement procedure in Civil Code section 3287, or in pertinent
County rules or regulations, for Petitioner to enforce the right to interest
created by Civil Code section 3287. The Court of Appeal has also held a claim
for pre-judgment interest pursuant to section 3287 may be enforced by mandate. (Goldfarb v. Civil Service Com., supra, 225
Cal.App.3d at 635-637.) The court concludes Petitioner lacks a plain, speedy,
and adequate remedy at law.  
 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner has
demonstrated all elements for issuance of a writ of ordinary mandate directing the
County to pay pre-judgment interest pursuant to Civil Code section 3287 on the
awards of backpay made to Deputies Doe 1 through 5, 7 through 13, 16 through 23, and 27 through 29.  
 
Does the County
Have a Defense?
 
Statute of
Limitations 
 
The statute of
limitations is a defense upon which the County has the burden of proof. (See Salton
Bay Marina, Inc. v. Imperial Irrigation Dist. (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 914,
940, fn. 4.)  
 
In its answer, the
County pleads all claims of the Deputies Doe are barred by the applicable
statute of limitations. (Ans. 7th Aff. Def.) However, in its briefing,
the County only argues the claim of Deputy Doe 29 is barred by the three-year
statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 338,
subdivision (a). (Opposition 26:5.) The County concedes the claims for
pre-judgment interest of the remaining Deputies Doe were timely filed within
the three-year statute of limitations.
 
Respondent asserts Deputy Doe 29’s claim
accrued on September 30, 2016, when the Commission adopted the hearing
officer’s recommendation to reduce Deputy Doe 29’s discharge to a suspension. (Opposition
26:18-23 [citing Safarloo Decl. ¶ 27].) However, the County does not discuss
the full procedural history of Deputy Doe 29’s claim. Accordingly, the court
finds Respondent’s position to be unpersuasive. 

 
Specifically, on November 21, 2016, less
than two months after the Commission reduced the discharge to a suspension,
Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the suspension. The
trial court denied the petition on April 16, 2018. (Reply
Gibbons Decl. ¶¶ 37-39, Exh. DD.) The County fails to explain why the
limitations period was not be tolled given the lack of a final order given Deputy
Doe 29’s writ proceeding.[6] (Nelson
v. Avondale Homeowners Assn. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857, 862-863. [“When an appellant
fails to raise a point, or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned
argument and citations to authority, we treat the point as waived.”]; Pfeifer
v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1282 [same].)
 
Because
the amount of backpay owed to Deputy Doe 29 depended on the results of her writ
petition, the full amount of interest owed to Deputy Doe 29 could not be
calculated until April 16, 2018. Under these circumstances, the court concludes
Deputy Doe 29’s claim for interest did not accrue until April 16, 2018. (See Costa Serena Owners Coalition v. Costa
Serena Architectural Committee (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1175, 1195-96
[discussing accrual of a cause of action].) 
Alternatively, the statute of limitations on Deputy Doe 29’s claim for
interest was equitably tolled from November 21, 2016 to April 16, 2018. (See Lantzy
v. Centex Homes (2003) 31 Cal.4th 363, 370-371 [discussing equitable
tolling].)[7] In
either case, Petitioner timely filed its petition as to Deputy Doe 29 on
December 11, 2020, within the three-year limitations period.  
 
The County has not
demonstrated Deputy Doe 29’s claim for pre-judgment interest is barred by the
applicable statute of limitations.  
 
Laches 
 
The
County contends the “ALADS Petition [as] a whole is barred by laches and the
claims of Deputy Does 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 17 and 29 are barred by laches in this
action because they were unreasonably delayed in pursuing their interest claims
and such delay prejudiced the County.” 
(Opposition 15:3-5.)
 
“
‘The defense of laches requires unreasonable delay plus either acquiescence in
the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting
from the delay.’ ” (Womack v. San
Francisco Community College Dist. (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 854, 865.)
Generally, “prejudice is not presumed.” (Mercury
Ins. Co. v. Lara (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 82, 111.) The party claiming laches
has the burden of proof. (Id. at 110.) 

 
“ ‘[D]elay alone ordinarily does not
constitute laches . . . .’ ‘What makes the delay unreasonable in the case of
laches is that it results in prejudice.’ [Citation.] . . . . ‘A defendant has
been prejudiced by a delay when the assertion of a claim available some time
ago would be ‘inequitable’ in light of the delay in bringing that claim . . .
[and] ensues when a defendant has changed his position in a way that would not
have occurred if the plaintiff had not delayed.’ ”  (George v. Shams-Shirazi (2020) 45
Cal.App.5th 134, 142.) “The employing agency which enjoys better access to data
respecting prejudice should bear the burden of producing the pertinent
evidence.” (Conti v. Board of Civil Service Commissioners (1969) 1
Cal.3d 351, 361.) 
 
              The
County Has Not Proven Any Prejudice from Alleged Delay or Causation 
 
The County contends Petitioner’s alleged delay
with filing this petition “prejudiced the County by allowing new claims to
accrue while waiting years before pursuing the oldest claims.”  (Opposition 16:14-15.) However, the County
does not cite any evidence of the amount of interest that accrued
because of the alleged delay; that the County has changed its position as a
result of the delay; or that the County would be materially impacted—financially
or otherwise—by payment of the interest at issue. Accordingly, the County does
not demonstrate any prejudice from any alleged delay in bringing this
proceeding.  
 
To establish laches, the County must also
prove any prejudice was caused by Petitioner or its members. (See In re
Marriage of Parker (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 681, 689. [“Matthew needed to
show he suffered prejudice as a result of the Department’s alleged delay.”]) The
County does not prove causation. At all relevant times, the County had a
ministerial duty to include interest on the awards of backpay to Deputies Doe 1
through 5, 7 through 13, 16 through 23, and 27 through 29. (See April 2023
Order 7-8; San Diego County Deputy Sheriffs Assn. v. San Diego County
Sheriffs Dept., supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at 1086; Goldfarb v. Civil Service
Com., supra, 225 Cal.App.3d at 635-637.) In the declaration of Captain Jesus Carrasco,
filed earlier in this proceeding, the County admitted it did not pay interest
to the Deputies Doe because the County was not “specifically ordered” to do so
by Commission or ERCOM. (Reply Gibbons Decl. ¶¶ 12-13 and Exh. U at ¶ 6.) Based
on that admission, the court concludes the accrual of interest resulted from the
County’s own inaction.   
 
///
 
///
Respondent
Has Not Proven Unreasonable Delay by Petitioner or Any Deputies Doe Included in
this Writ Proceeding 
 
Because the County has not demonstrated the
prejudice or causation elements of laches, the court need not discuss, in
detail, the County’s contentions Petitioner and some of its members
unreasonably delayed in pursuing the claims for interest in this proceeding.  
 
Nonetheless, for completeness, the court has
considered the issue of unreasonable delay and all of the parties’ contentions
and cited evidence. Based on its review of the evidence, the court finds the
County has not proven unreasonable delay by Petitioner or any of the Deputies Doe
in this proceeding.  
 
Specifically, the County contends Petitioner
and its counsel, Elizabeth Gibbons, were “personally involved in the
representation of 25 of the 29 Deputy Does, including Deputy Does 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, and 29, who have the oldest claims” (Opposition 16:1-3) and “failed to take
any action for over 4 years to assert the right to interest on behalf of those
Deputy Does, which it claims it has the right to do.” (Opposition 16:9-10.) The
County cites evidence that some of administrative proceedings for the Deputies
Doe were concluded between September 30, 2016 and September 18, 2019. (Opposition
15:21-28 [citing Safarloo Decl. ¶¶ 4-27].) 

 
However, Respondent does not cite evidence
proving Petitioner and attorney Gibbons knew or should have known by any
specific date the County failed to pay interest on the backpay owed to the
Deputies Doe. Further, as the court concluded in the April 2023 Order, the
County has not proven an “unequivocal, regular, consistent, and readily
ascertainable” practice of not paying interest on backpay awards. (April 2023
Order at 9; see also Reply Gibbons Decl. ¶¶ 12-13, Exh. U.) 
 
Petitioner has also submitted evidence, in
declarations of its Executive Director, Derek Hsieh, and attorney Gibbons, the
County did not notify Petitioner of its alleged practice of failing to pay
interest; Petitioner does not have the manpower to check the accuracy of
backpay checks for its approximately 7,500 members; Petitioner learned the
County failed to pay interest to one specific deputy (Deputy Doe 6) in March
2019; and Petitioner promptly filed a grievance seeking interest on Deputy Doe
6’s behalf. (Reply Gibbons Decl. ¶¶ 14-28; see also id. ¶ 13, Exh. U
[Hsieh Decl.].)  Further, Petitioner did
not learn of the County’s position it was not required to pay interest on
backpay awards until approximately January 2020 in the course of a dispute over interest on an award of back pay issued
by ERCOM in an unfair labor practice charge.  (Reply Gibbons Decl. ¶¶ 20-28.) The court
finds from the evidence Petitioner and attorney Gibbons did not unreasonably
delay initiating this proceeding, including as to Deputies Doe 1, 2, 4, 5, 17
and 29.[8]
 
The County argues “Deputy Doe 3 claims should
be barred by the doctrine of laches because both ALADS and he were unreasonably
delayed pursuing his claim and forced the County to address his claims in
multiple forums.” (Opposition 16:23-25.)[9] As
discussed, the County has not shown any prejudice from the alleged delay or
shown the causation element of laches. Further, the County acknowledges the
arbitrator did not issue his decision until July 24, 2018. (Opposition 17:10.)
While Deputy Doe 3 did not file a grievance regarding the failure to pay
interest until November 7, 2019, the County does not cite evidence of when the
County paid Deputy Doe 3 the backpay owed. Without evidence of when Deputy Doe
3 knew or should have known he was not paid interest, the court cannot find the
delay between July 24, 2018 and November 7, 2019 was unreasonable. (Opposition
17:8-12.) The County did not deny Deputy Doe 3’s grievance regarding interest
until January 22, 2020. (Reply Gibbons Decl. ¶ 19.) Petitioner thereafter filed
this petition less than a year later on December 11, 2020.   
 
The County has not met its burden of proof on
its laches defense as to Petitioner or any of the Deputies Doe. The County’s
laches defense is therefore rejected. In light of this conclusion, the court
need not reach Petitioner’s contention the County is barred by unclean hands
from asserting laches. (Reply 10:8-21.)
 
The County’s Remaining
Defenses 
 
The County asserts
several other defenses as to individual Deputy Does.  
 
The County Does Not Demonstrate Deputy Does
4 and 16 Waived Their Claims for Interest 
 
Petitioner contends
Deputies Does 4 and 16 waived their claims for pre-judgment interest by
executing settlement agreements that did not expressly “reference interest” and
that also released Respondent from all claims arising out of or connected with
the prior discipline or concerning the subject matter of the administrative
proceedings. (See Safarloo Decl. Exh. 7, 30.) 

 
“Under California
law, a waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right
or privilege. . . . Waiver is a question of fact . . . and always is based upon intent.” (Smith
v. Selma Community Hospital (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1506.) “ ‘[I]t is
settled law in California that a purported ‘waiver’ of a statutory right is not
legally effective unless it appears that the party executing it had been fully
informed of the existence of that right, its meaning, the effect of the
'waiver' presented to him, and his full understanding of the explanation.’ [Citation.]
‘The first requirement of any waiver of statutory or constitutional rights, of
course, is that it be knowingly and intelligently made.’ ” (Hittle v. Santa
Barbara County Employees Retirement Assn. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 374, 389.)
 
In its settlement
agreement with Deputy Doe 4, the County agreed to rescind a notice of discharge
and instead impose a 25-day suspension on Deputy Doe 4. The County also agreed
to reimburse Deputy Doe 4 “for back pay in accordance with the provisions of
the County Code, as soon as practicable.” (Safarloo Decl. Exh. 7 at ¶¶ 1-3.) Deputy
Doe 4 also agreed to, among other things, to waive any and all future
administrative and/or judicial remedies with regard to the notice of discharge
and release Respondent from liability for all claims arising out of or
connected to the employment relationship concerning the subject matter of the
settlement.  (Id. ¶¶ 6-11.)  
 
In its settlement
agreement with Deputy Doe 16, the County agreed to rescind its discharge
decision, reinstate Deputy Doe 16 as a Deputy Sheriff, and “make whole” Deputy Doe
16 “as if he had not been released/discharged and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the County Code . . . from the date of January 20,
2016 until the date of reinstatement.” (Id. Exh. 30 at ¶¶ 1-4.) Deputy Doe
16 also agreed to, among other things, to release the County from liability for
all claims arising out of or connected to the prior discipline or the subject
matter of the administrative proceedings. (Id. ¶¶ 9-10.)  
 
Deputies Doe 4 and
16 did not expressly waive their rights to pre-judgment interest in the
settlement agreements, which are silent on the issue. The court cannot infer an
intentional relinquishment of the statutory right to interest from settlement
agreements that are silent on the issue. (See Urshan v. Musicians’ Credit Union (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 758, 768. [“[W]aiver of the right to the statutorily mandated minimum
notice period for summary judgment hearings should not be inferred from
silence.”]) While Deputies Doe 4 and 16 did waive certain claims related to the
discipline and release the County from liability, those waivers would only be
relevant here if pre-judgment interest was separate from the agreement
to pay backpay.  
 
The settlement agreements specifically
provide the County will pay Deputies Doe 4 and 16 “back pay” or, in the case of
Deputy Doe 16, make him “whole.” As discussed, an award of “backpay” or an
order to make an employee “whole” after reinstatement will, as a general
matter, trigger a ministerial duty for the County to pay interest on the
backpay pursuant to Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a). (See Goldfarb v.
Civil Service Com., supra, 225 Cal.App.3d at 635.) Because there is no language in the settlement
agreements specifically excluding the payment of interest, and because the
interest is inherently intertwined with the agreement to pay backpay or make
whole, the County does not demonstrate Deputies Doe 4 and 16 waived their
claims for interest in the release provisions in the settlement agreements.
 
The court rejects the County’s waiver
defense as to Deputies Doe 4 and 16.

Do Deputies Doe 4, 8, 10, and 16 Have
Adequate Remedies at Law to Enforce their Settlement Agreements in a Breach of
Contract Action?  
              
The County contends Deputies Doe 4, 8, 10, and
16 have adequate remedies at law in contract actions to enforce any claims for
interest based on their settlement agreements. The County also suggests the
Government Claims Act may bar any contract claims for interest for Deputies Doe
4, 8, 10, and 16.[10]  
 
“As a general proposition, mandamus is not an
appropriate remedy for enforcing a contractual obligation against a public
entity. . . .” (Wenzler v. Municipal Court of Pasadena Judicial Dist. (1965)
235 Cal.App.2d 128, 132.) As noted earlier, however, a contract between a
public entity and a public employee can, under certain circumstances, be
enforced through a writ of mandamus. (Association for Los Angeles Deputy
Sheriffs v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 94 Cal.App.5th at 806.) “[O]ften
the payment of wages of a public employee requires certain preliminary
steps by public officials, in such instances, the action in contract is
inadequate and mandate is the appropriate remedy.” (Id. at 807 [quoting Glendale
City Employees’ Assn., Inc. v. City of Glendale (1975) 15 Cal.3d 328,
343].) Mandamus “is proper insofar as public officials would need to undertake
certain ministerial duties to implement a contract with a public employee.” (Id.
at 809.)
 
To implement the settlement agreements with Deputies Doe 4,
8, 10 and 16, public officials must undertake certain ministerial duties.
Therefore, mandamus is an appropriate remedy.
 
Further, “mandamus is available to compel a
public agency's performance or to correct an agency's abuse of discretion when
the action being compelled or corrected is ministerial.”  (AIDS Healthcare Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Public
Health (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 693, 700.) Petitioner persuasively argues the County has
a ministerial duty to pay interest pursuant to Civil Code section 3287,
subdivision (a) on awards of backpay that were ordered by the Commission,
ERCOM, or promised in settlement agreements for related administrative/writ
proceedings. The County does not show Deputies Doe 4, 8, 10, and 16 have an
adequate remedy at law in a contract action to litigate that legal question.
 
Moreover, Petitioner is not a party to
the settlement agreements and lacks an adequate remedy in a contract action. This
writ proceeding has also been pending since December 2020. At this juncture,
dismissing the claims of Deputies Doe 4, 8, 10, and 16 would only result in a
multiplicity of actions and further delay enforcement of the County’s
ministerial duty to pay interest. The County’s cited authority is
distinguishable for these reasons. (Opposition 21:16-17 [citing Canova v. Trustees
of Imperial Irrigation Dist. Employee Pension Plan (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th
1487, 1494].)  
 
Further, the payment of interest by the
County is incidental to the County’s ministerial duty to comply with Civil Code
section 3287, subdivision (a). Accordingly, the County does not show the
Government Claims Act bars the claims of Deputies Doe 4, 8, 10, and 16. (See Eureka
Teacher’s Assn. v. Board of Education (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 469,
475-476.)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure Section 426.30
Does Not Bar the Claims of Deputies Doe 11 and 23
 
The County contends
the claims for interest of Deputies Doe 11 and 23 are barred by Code of Civil
Procedure section 426.30 because Deputies Doe 11 and 23 did not file
cross-complaints seeking interest in response to writ petitions filed by the
County regarding the disciplinary matters at issue.[11]
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 426.30, subdivision (a) does not apply to special
proceedings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.60, subd. (a).) Writ proceedings are
special proceedings. Thus, Deputies Doe 11 and 23 had no obligation to assert
any claims pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30 in the writ
proceedings initiated by the County, and the statute does not bar there claims
here.
 
Moreover, even
assuming the statute applied to special proceedings, the County would not
prevail on its defense.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30,
subdivision (a) provides: 
 
Except
as otherwise provided by statute, if a party against whom a complaint has been
filed and served fails to allege in a cross-complaint any related cause of
action which (at the time of serving his answer to the complaint)
he has against the plaintiff, such party may not thereafter in any other action
assert against the plaintiff the related cause of action not pleaded.”
(Emphasis added.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 426.10,
subdivision (c) defines “related cause of action” as “a cause of action which
arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of 
transactions or occurrences as the cause of
action which the plaintiff alleges in his complaint.” “The related cause of
action must be one that was in existence at the time of service of the answer (§ 426.30, subd. (a));
otherwise, the failure to assert it in prior litigation is not a bar under the
statute.” (Heshejin v. Rostami (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 984, 993.)
 
Here, the Commission reduced the discharge
imposed on Deputy Doe 11 to a 25-day suspension. On August 11, 2020, the County
filed a writ petition challenging the Commission’s decision. Deputy Doe 11
filed an answer to the petition on March 1, 2021. (Safarloo Decl. ¶ 14.)  Petitioner’s and Deputy Doe 11’s claim in
this writ petition arises from Respondent’s failure to pay interest with the
backpay owed to Deputy Doe 11. The County does not submit any evidence it had
paid backpay to Deputy Doe 11 by March 1, 2021, when Deputy Doe 11 filed an answer.
In reply, Petitioner submits evidence the County paid Deputy Doe 11 his
backpay, without interest, in May 2021, after Deputy Doe 11 filed his answer in
the County’s writ proceeding. (Reply Gibbons Decl. ¶ 38.) Because Deputy Doe
11’s claim for unpaid interest did not exist as of March 1, 2021, when Deputy
Doe filed the answer, that claim is not barred by Code of Civil Procedure section
426.30, subdivision (a).  
 
The Commission reduced the discharge imposed on Deputy
Doe 23 to a 30-day suspension. On August 3, 2021, the County filed a writ
petition challenging the Commission’s decision. Deputy Doe 23 opposed the
petition but did not file an answer. The County’s writ petition was denied on
June 14, 2022. (Safarloo Decl. ¶ 23.) The County does not submit any evidence
of when it paid backpay to Deputy Doe 23. In reply, Petitioner submits evidence
that Doe 23 was reinstated on November 15, 2021, and was paid his backpay,
without interest, on January 28, 2022. 
 
Since Deputy Doe 23 did not file an answer, Code
of Civil Procedure section 426.30, subdivision (a) has no application. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 426.30, subd. (b)(2) [statute does not apply if “[t]he person who
failed to plead the related cause of action did not file an answer to the
complaint against him”].) Moreover, Deputy Doe 23 did not have a ripe claim for
unpaid interest until January 28, 2022, well after his time to file an answer
to the County’s writ petition. Accordingly, Deputy Doe 23 did not have a
“related cause of action” within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section
426.30, subdivision (a).
 
Respondent’s defense based on Code of Civil Procedure
section 426.30, subdivision (a) is unavailing.
 
Deputy Doe
3’s Exhaustion of Judicial Remedies 
 
The County contends Deputy Doe 3’s claim for
interest is barred because Deputy “Doe 3 failed to exhaust his available
judicial remedies to correct, vacate, or enforce the arbitration award in a
timely fashion or to compel arbitration in his second grievance.” (Opposition
18:23-25.)  
 
The court already decided this issue against the
County with the similar “test case” of Deputy Doe 18.  Specifically, in the December 2023 Order, the
court stated: 
 
The arbitrator made an award rescinding
the discipline against Deputy Doe 18 and specifying Deputy Doe 18 “should be
made whole for lost income.”  (Gibbons
Decl. Exh. K.)  In the context of an
order setting aside the discipline, the order for Doe 18 to be “made whole for
lost income” may be reasonably interpreted by a trial court, in an action
enforcing the arbitration order, to include pre-judgment interest on the lost
income. (December 2023 Order at 13.)  
 
Similarly here, the
arbitration award in favor of Deputy Doe 3 ordered the County to reinstate Deputy
Doe 3 to his FTO I bonus position and pay him backpay and benefits “calculated
as the difference in what he received as a deputy sheriff and what he would
have received as a Bonus I FTO.” (Reply Gibbons Decl. Exh. BB at 24-25.) In the
context of an order setting aside the removal of Deputy Doe 3’s bonus position,
the arbitration award in favor of Deputy Doe 3 may be reasonably interpreted to
include pre-judgment interest. (See San
Diego County Deputy Sheriffs Assn. v. San Diego Sheriffs Dept., supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at 1086 [“when an administrative agency . . . reinstates the employee's
employment with backpay, the agency must include interest in the award of
wrongfully withheld backpay”].) 
Accordingly, Deputy Doe 3 was not required to pursue any judicial
remedies to correct, amend, or vacate the arbitration award to obtain
pre-judgment interest.  
 
Standing of
Deputies Doe 8, 10 through 12, 18, 23, 27 through 28
 
The County argues Deputies
Doe 8, 10 through 12, 18, 23, 27 through 28 “should not have been included in
this action” because no final administrative decision had been issued in their
favor by December 11, 2020 when Petitioner filed the petition. (Opposition
30:15.)[12] The County relies on precedent
stating (in a different context) that “[f]or a lawsuit properly to be allowed
to continue, standing must exist at all times until judgment is entered
and not just on the date the complaint is filed.” (Opposition 27:13-17 [citing Californians
for Disability Rights v. Mervyn's, LLC (2006) 39 Cal.4th 223, 232-233].)  
 
Petitioner, as the
labor union for the Deputies Doe, had standing and a ripe claim since it filed
the petition on December 11, 2020. (See Anaheim Elementary Education Assn.
v. Board of Education, supra, 179 Cal.App.3d at 1157.) Further, the County acknowledges
the administrative proceedings for Deputies Doe 8, 10 through 12, 18, 23, 27
through 28 were all completed by February 2022, when the Deputies Doe executed
verifications of the petition.
 
The County does not
dispute the claims for interest of Deputies Doe 8, 10 through 12, 18, 23, 27
through 28 are currently ripe. The County does not cite any authority holding
that, in a legal proceeding brought by a labor union, the claims of specific
members must be dismissed if they ripened while the action was pending. The
County also does not identify any prejudice based upon the claims of Deputies Doe
8, 10 through 12, 18, 23, 27 through 28 ripening during the pendency of this
proceeding. Because their claims for interest are now ripe, and because the
County shows no prejudice, the court finds no basis to dismiss the claims of Deputies
Doe 8, 10 through 12, 18, 23, 27 through 28 even if the claims were not ripe
when Petitioner first filed the petition.

The County Has Not
Pleaded or Proven a Defense for Misjoinder of Parties
 
At the close of its
opposition brief, the County argues “Deputy Does 1 through 6, 7 through 14, 16
through 23, and 27 through 29 must be joined in this matter prior to the
issuance of a writ, if any, in their favor pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 389.” (Opposition 33:7-9.)
 
The County did not
assert a defense for misjoinder or nonjoinder of parties in its demurrer or Answer.
Accordingly, the County has waived the defense. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.80,
subd. (a); see also Hastings v. Stark (1868) 36 Cal. 122, 126. [“Where the
misjoinder of parties plaintiff does not appear upon the face of the complaint,
and the objection is not taken by answer, it is deemed waived.”])[13] 

 
Moreover, even if the County did not
waive the defense, it has not proven that any of the Deputies Doe are
“indispensable” and the writ proceeding cannot proceed in their absence.  
 
“In civil litigation generally, the
question whether a person must be joined as a party to a suit is governed by
the compulsory joinder statute, section 389 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Subdivision (a) of that
statute states: ‘A person who is subject to service of process and whose
joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of
the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence
complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties or (2) he claims
an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the
disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair
or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the
persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,
multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed
interest.’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 389, subd. (a).) If such a person (sometimes called a
‘necessary’ party) cannot be joined, subdivision (b) requires the court to
consider ‘whether in equity and good conscience’ the suit can proceed without
the absent party, or whether the suit should instead be dismissed without
prejudice, ‘the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.’ (Id.,
subd. (b).).” (Bianka M. v. Superior
Court (2018) 5 Cal.5th 1004, 1016-17.)
 
If a party is necessary under Code of
Civil Procedure section 389, subdivision (a), and “cannot be made a party, the court
shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed
among the parties before it, or should be dismissed without prejudice, the
absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 389,
subd. (b).)  Specifically, “[t]he factors to be considered by the
court include: (1) to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence
might be prejudicial to him or those already parties; (2) the extent to which,
by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other
measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; (3) whether a judgment
rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; (4) whether the plaintiff or
cross-complainant will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for
nonjoinder.”  (Ibid. See generally
Citizens for Amending Proposition L v. City of
Pomona (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1159, 1178-1179.)
 
As discussed, Petitioner has standing, as the Deputy Does’ labor
union, to enforce the claims for pre-judgment interest of the Deputies Doe in
this writ proceeding. The Deputies Doe have all participated in this action by having
verified the petition. Petitioner and the County have both presented evidence,
which is largely undisputed, relevant to the claims for interest of each Deputy
Doe. The only remaining issue for each
individual Deputy Doe is the calculation of the exact amount of interest owed. The County has not developed any argument that the Deputies Doe
must be added to this proceeding for that calculation to be made for each
specific Deputy Doe. Thus, the County does not show complete relief cannot be
granted if the Deputies Doe are not made parties to this proceeding, or that
disposition of this proceeding without the Deputies Does will impair or impede
the ability of the Deputies Doe to protect their interests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
389, subd. (a)(1) and (2)(i).)
 
Respondent argues failing to join the Deputies Doe “would
leave the County subject to a substantial risk of incurring double or otherwise
inconsistent obligations by reason of their claimed interest should they file
their own actions later.” (Opposition 33:10-12.) Relatedly, the County argues “if
the Deputy Does are not parties in this matter, the County might be unable to
assert the doctrine of res judicata or collateral estoppel in any subsequent
actions filed by them regarding these matters.” (Opposition 33:12-14.) The
County’s concerns might be justified if there was some reason to believe that
the calculation of interest for each Deputy Doe will depend on facts or
evidence that has not, or cannot be, presented in this action. However, the
County does not develop any argument the evidence necessary to perform the
interest calculations is not already available to the County or cannot be
obtained in this proceeding, without joinder of the Deputies Doe. Thus, the
County does not demonstrate the Deputies Doe are necessary parties pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 389, subdivision (a)(2)(ii).
 
Finally, even assuming the Deputies Doe could be
viewed as “necessary” within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 389,
subdivision (a), the County does not develop an argument the factors set forth
in Code of Civil Procedure section 389, subdivision (b) weigh for dismissal of
the proceeding.
 
Respondent has waived any defense for misjoinder or failure
to join the Deputies Doe. Further, the County does not demonstrate the Deputies
Doe are necessary or indispensable within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure
section 389, subdivisions (a) and (b). Accordingly, to the extent the County has
not waived any defense for failure to join the Deputies Doe, the defense is rejected.
 
The County Must
Calculate the Amount of Pre-Judgment Interest Owed to Does 1 through 5, 7 through 13, 16 through 23, 27 through 29

 
Petitioner seeks a
writ directing the County to pay Does 1
through 5, 7 through 13, 16 through 23, and 27 through 29 “interest on the back
pay previously awarded each Deputy Doe by the Civil Service Commission or the
Employee Relations Commission, calculated from the date each back salary
payment should have been paid, until the entry of judgment herein, at the rate
of 7% per annum.” (Opening Brief 10:6-9; see also FAP Prayer ¶ 1.) In the
petition, Petitioner made a slightly different request for payment of interest
“until the back pay with interest was paid in full.” (Prayer ¶ 1
[bold italics added].)  
 
Petitioner has not
cited any evidence any of the Deputies Doe have not been paid their backpay. Thus,
it appears Petitioner’s damage claim for each Deputy Doe is based on the amount
of interest that should have been paid at the time each deputy received their
backpay award. As the court understands it, Petitioner seeks an award of
damages for each deputy equal to the amount of interest the deputy should have
received on the backpay award with interest running therefrom.
 
By way of example,
if a deputy received an award of backpay on January 1, 2022 and the County did
not pay the award until March 31, 2022, the deputy would be entitled to
interest running from the date of the award until payment—that is, interest
running from January 2, 2022 through March 31, 2022. The interest awardable on
March 31, 2022 is the damage award sought here—the detriment suffered based on the
County’s failure to comply with its ministerial duty. That damage award, under
Petitioner’s theory, should then be subject to interest to seven percent
interest running from April 1, 2022 until the date the award herein is
satisfied.
 
Petitioner’s damage
and interest calculation appears appropriate. (See Yoo v. Shewry (2010)
186 Cal.App.4th 131, 148-149.)
 
Petitioner Is Not
Entitled to Writs of Mandate Directing Payment of Interest to Deputy Does Whose
Claims Were Not Included in this Writ Action or on “Future Back Pay Awards”
 
Petitioner also seeks a writ directing the County “to
pay interest on any future back pay award entered by the Civil
Service Commission or the Employee Relations Commission to any ALADS member,
calculated from the date each back salary payment should have been paid, until
such back pay and interest are paid in full, at the rate of 7% per annum.” (Opening
Brief 10:16-20 [emphasis added].) In the petition, Petitioner seeks similar
relief as to future and not final awards for backpay. (Pet. Prayer ¶¶ 2, 4.)
 
The County contends, in effect, such
future claims for relief are not ripe because “[f]uture ALADS members in future
matters cannot show a present beneficial right to performance.”  (Opposition 31:20-21.) The court agrees with the
County.  
 
“ ‘[A] basic prerequisite to judicial
review of administrative acts is the existence of a ripe controversy.’ (Pacific Legal Foundation v. California Coastal Com. (1982)
33 Cal.3d 158, 169 [].) The
ripeness doctrine is based upon the recognition that judicial decisions are
best made in the context of an actual set of facts so that the issues will be
framed with sufficient definiteness to enable the court to make a decree
finally disposing of the controversy. (Id. at p. 170 [].) ‘The controversy must be definite
and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal
interests. [Citation.] It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting
of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished
from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of
facts.’ (Id. at pp. 170-171 [].) ‘A controversy is ‘ripe’ when it has
reached, but has not passed, the point that the facts have sufficiently
congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made’.” (Santa
Teresa Citizen Action Group v. City of San Jose (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 689,
708.)  
 
Petitioner’s claim for writ relief
with respect to “future back pay awards” lacks “sufficient definiteness to enable the court to make a decree finally
disposing of the controversy” and is not
ripe. Therefore, Petitioner’s request for such relief is denied.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The petition is denied as to the
claims for pre-judgment interest of Deputies Doe 6, 14, 15, and 24 through 26.
 
The petition is granted in part as to
the claims for pre-judgment interest of Deputies Doe 1 through 5, 7 through 13, 16 through 23, and 27 through 29. The
court will issue a writ directing the County to pay interest calculated in the manner described above.
 
The writ petition is denied in all
other respects, including with respect to Petitioner’s requests for a writ
directing the County “to pay interest on any future back pay award entered by
the Civil Service Commission or the Employee Relations Commission to any ALADS
member. . . .”  (Opening Brief 10:16-18.)   
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
