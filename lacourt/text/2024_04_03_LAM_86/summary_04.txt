And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling discusses the City's issuance of a Home Development Permit (HDP) in 2016 and related permits in 2017 to Real Parties. The HDP and permits expired, and Real Parties sought to improve their property with a retaining wall project. The City issued a new HDP and related permits in 2021, which is the subject of the dispute. The Judge finds that the City complied with its municipal code and that the Planning Director had authority to approve the minor HDP. The Judge also finds that Real Parties' application described the project as a retaining wall and that the site had been graded pursuant to a 2016 HDP and 2017 permit.
