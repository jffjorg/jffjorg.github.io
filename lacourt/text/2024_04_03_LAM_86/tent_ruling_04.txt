[1] There appears to be
no dispute the City issued a HDP in 2016 as well as grading and building
permits issued in 2017 to Real Parties. The HDP and permits had expired by the
time Real Parties sought to improve their property with a retaining wall in
2020. (See Opening Brief 11:11-21.) There also seems to be no dispute—because
of the expiration of the HDP and permits—Real Parties required a new HDP and
permits for the retaining wall project. (See Opening Brief 11:21-28.) The issue
raised by Petitioner is whether the City complied with its municipal code when
it issued the 2021 HDP and related permits. The City’s actions in 2016 and 2017
are not in issue.


[2] The City’s reference
to continuing the work was to that work performed under the HDP issued in 2016
and the permits issued in January 2017. (AR 142.)


[3] The findings
necessary to issue a HDP are set forth in SPMC sections 36.140.065, subdivision
(F) and 36.410.040, subdivision (I).


[4] There is no
attachment to the email communication. It is not entirely clear what, if
anything, the City transmitted with the communication. This single email
communication appears to be the only reference in the administrative record to
the Director’s approval.


[5] As the court
understands it, to inspect and sign off on the grading done pursuant to the
2017 permit, the City required Real Parties to obtain a new grading permit.


[6] Petitioner appears to
agree Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 is inapplicable here. He advises “
. . . so there is nothing adjudicatory, quasi-adjudicatory, or after hearing
and evidence.” (Opening Brief 10:8-9.) He also states: “Because there is no
decision, there is no discretion or adjudicatory act that could be reviewed.”
(Opening Brief 10:20-21.)


[7] A minor HDP application
does not require a staff report because the planning commission does not
consider minor HDP applications.


[8] Petitioner’s claim the
Planning Director had no authority here because the area was graded “in violation
of law” ignores the 2017 grading permit and work authorized and done under that
permit. (Opening Brief 1:25.) Moreover, Petitioner provides no authority for
his legal position.


[9] Despite Petitioner’s
claim to the contrary, Real Parties’ application described the project as a retaining
wall. (AR 169.) Real Parties completed the entire HDP application. The
application included a site plan showing the proposed retaining wall. (AR 176.
See AR 177.) While the plans were drafted in 2014, the plans included engineered
construction drawings and showed the location of the wall. (AR 177.) The
application also advised there would be no excavation on the site. (AR 168.) On
January 26, 2021, Real Parties updated their plan “to show that no grading is
being performed . . . .” (AR 248.) On March 9, 2021, Real Parties explained a
drainage plan was not required “because the tributary area is very small and
the proposed swales will easily handle the runoff.” (AR 256.)


[10] While Petitioner
contends the Planning Director had no authority to approve the minor HDP, the
court agrees with the City. (Opening Brief 5, fn. 1; City Opposition 11:15-20.)
The site had been graded pursuant to a HDP and grading permit issued in 2016
and 2017, respectively. As specified in the updated plan, the project as
proposed did not include any grading, and therefore was to be built on the
“existing graded[] . . . outdoor areas.” (SPMC § 36.410.040, subd. (D)(5)(c).)
Moreover, as argued by the City, substantial evidence supports the City’s
finding the project involved “existing graded[] . . . outdoor areas . . . .” (Ibid.)
(See AR 256, 429.) Petitioner has not cited any evidence to suggest Real
Parties graded their property after the 2017 permit had expired. 


[11] It is not entirely
clear when the City approved the minor HDP. The City contends the Director’s
designee approved the site plan “and by extension, the Minor HDP.” (City
Opposition 11:12.) Email communications demonstrate the City considered the
Minor HDP approved sometime on or before April 14, 2021. (AR 258 [“. . . here
is the Director’s approval . . .”].) (See Opening Brief 13, fn. 7.) Those same
communications reflect an approval by the Director, not his designee.


[12] While Petitioner
contends the City’s prior investigation and findings “did not address the property
in 2020-2021” (Opening Brief 1:15), Petitioner does not explain how the information
before the Director was no longer relevant to his decision in 2021 to issue the
minor HDP.
