Background
 
On October 2, 2023, TruConnect Communications, Inc.
(“Plaintiff” or “TruConnect”) filed a Complaint against Torq LLC (“Defendant”
or “Torq”) and Does 1 to 10. The Complaint alleges two causes of action: (1)
Breach of Contract; and (2) Unjust Enrichment. 
 
On December 14, 2022, Torq filed a Cross-Complaint
against TruConnect. The operative First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”)
alleges six causes of action: (1) Fraud – Inducement; (2)
Fraud-Misrepresentation; (3) Unfair Business Practices; (4) Breach of
Contract); (5) Declaratory Relief; and (6) Common Counts. 
 
On January 23, 2024, TruConnect filed a demurrer to the
FACC. Defendant/Cross-Complainant Torq opposes the demurrer. The matter is now
before the court 
 
request for JUDICIAL notice
 
The Court may take judicial notice of records of any court of record of
the United States. (Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may only
judicially notice the existence of the record, not that its contents are the
truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant TruConnect requests judicial
notice of the following: 
 
1)     Exhibit A: TruConnect’s Complaint filed December 2, 2023. 
2)     Exhibit B: Court’s Ruling on the TruConnect’s Demurrers to
Torq’s First Amended Cross-Complaint.
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Torq requests judicial notice
of the following: 
 
1)     Exhibit A: Tentative
Ruling dated April 15, 2024, re Demurer to First Amended Cross-Complaint. 
2)     Exhibit B: Final Ruling dated April 17, 2024, re Demurer to
First Amended Cross-Complaint. 
 
Defendant Torq’s request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Summary
of Allegations in Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SACC”)
 
Cross-Defendant TruConnect is a prepaid wireless service
that predominantly provides service to low-income and lower-volume consumers. (SACC,
¶¶ 9) TruConnect participates in two federal programs that provide low-income
individuals with discounts on phone service, the “Lifeline” program, and the
Affordable Connectivity Program (“APC”) programs. (SACC, ¶¶ 6,7.) Torq believes
that TruConnect is using its relationship with distributors, like Torq, to
obtain wrongful profits through the Lifeline and ACP programs. (SACC, ¶ 12.) 
 
Torq opened for business in 2018 to provide direct sales
in communications. (SACC, ¶ 13.) In the Fall of 2020, Torq’s Eric Wendland
(“Wendland”) and TruConnect’s Hao Zhang (“Zhang”) began communications about
entering into an agreement, which Mr. Wendland liked because  it would assist low-income families. (SACC, ¶
12.) On October 20, 2020, Torq and TruConnect entered the “TruConnect Master
Service Agreement” (the “Master Agreement”). (SACC, ¶ 14, Ex. A.) After
entering into the Master Agreement, Torq noticed odd accounting issues in
TruConnect’s “Pay sheets” in which TruConnect would provide a higher per-unit
rate, such as $50.00, then lower that rate through debits and charges that were
“obfuscating and confusing.” (SACC, ¶ 16.) In December 2022, TruConnect sent a
form agreement that would replace all previous agreements between the parties
that was signed by Wendland on behalf of Torq on December 15, 2022 (the
“Distributor Agreement”). (SACC, ¶ 17, Ex. B.) Torq asserts that the terms of
the Distributor Agreement were “grossly one-sided” in TruConnect’s favor. (SACC,
¶18-20.) 
 
On May 12, 20223, TruConnect sent Torq an odd and
incorrect invoice (the “May Invoice”) for $552,000.00 which Torq believed to be
inaccurate and issued in error since the volume of devices did not match the
number of devices transacted by Torq since the unique international mobile
equipment identity (“IMEI”) numbers did not match. (SACC, ¶ 22, fn. 5, Ex. C.)
Torq notified TruConnect that the May Invoice was incorrect, but TruConnect did
not provide a corrected or updated Invoice, nor did it insist that the numbers
on the May Invoice were correct. (SACC, ¶ 23.) 
 
Given the May Invoice, Torq proposed and TruConnect
accepted an interim payment arrangement with Torq paying $10,000 per month so
that Torq could audit TruConnect’s accounting in the May Invoice. (SACC, ¶ 24.)
TruConnect advised it would produce a written amendment to the Distributor
Agreement addressing the interim agreements but on September 25, 2023,
TruConnect via its lawyer terminated the Distributor Agreement and demanded
that Torq pay $641,007.00 by filing this action. (SACC, ¶¶ 24, 25.) 
 
Torq asserts that TruConnect’s records from December 3,
2020, to September 1, 2023, show inconsistencies in the number of orders
shipped and the commission Torq received, with the unique IMEI confirming
duplication of orders, phantom devices, and inflated order quantities. (SACC,
¶¶ 27-31.) The SACC asserts that there are inconsistencies in TruConnect’s
invoices and that at a minimum the invoices violate generally accepted
accounting principles known as “GAAP.” (SACC, ¶ 29.) TruConnect’s refusal to
acknowledge and/or correct its invoicing leads to the conclusion that
TruConnect intentionally skewed its invoice for an improper purpose. 
 
B.        First Cause of Action – Fraudulent Inducement 
“Fraud in the inducement
is a subset of the tort of fraud.”
(Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
289, 294.) “Fraud in the inducement”
“occurs when ‘the promisor knows what he is signing but his consent is induced
by fraud, mutual assent is present and a
contract is formed, which, by reason of the fraud,
is voidable. In order to escape from its obligations the
aggrieved party must rescind....’ [Citations.]” (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996)
14 Cal.4th 394, 415 [italics original].)
 
SACC alleges that TruConnect intended to
grossly inflate its accounting and used Torq in a scheme to obtain wrongful government
subsidies resulting in damages to Torq estimated to be at $3,330,000.00. (SACC,
¶¶ 33  -35.) 
 
The court finds that the promise to provide
accurate accounting via invoices is an obligation set out in the Parties’
respective agreements, such that Torq should look to contractual damages rather
than tort damages. The Master Agreement provides that the Parties “agree to
keep accurate books of account and records covering all payment owed in
relation to this Agreement . . ..” (SACC, Ex. A, § 18; Ex. B, § 20.) To the extent
TruConnect induced Torq to enter into a “legitimate business” agreement, Torq
must allege what specific facts were concealed or misrepresented that induced
Torq to enter into the agreements such that if the facts were known to Torq,
Torq would not have agreed to enter the Agreements. Moreover, the facts
represented or concealed must have occurred prior to the signing of the Agreements.
Lastly, the concealment or representation must relate to a past or present
material fact, not a future event. (Cansino v. Bank of
America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469–1470.) Lastly, the SACC fails to allege if the
fraudulent inducement claim is premised on concealment or misrepresentation. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the first cause of
action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
C.
       Second Cause of Action –Fraudulent
Misrepresentation 
 
To plead a cause of action
for fraudulent misrepresentation, a plaintiff must plead (1) a false representation,
(2) knowledge of falsity (scienter), (3) intent to defraud (i.e., to induce
reliance), (4) justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage. (Alliance
Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1226, 1239.)
 
Fraud must be pleaded
specifically. To survive demurrer, the plaintiff must plead facts that “show
how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.” (Hamilton v. Greenwich Investors XXVI, LLC (2011) 195
Cal.App.4th 1602, 1614.) “[A] plaintiff is held to a higher standard in
asserting a fraud claim against a corporate defendant. ‘In such a case, the
plaintiff must ‘allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly
fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what
they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.’ ” (Tenet Healthsystem
Desert, Inc. v. Blue Cross of California (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 821, 838
citing Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) 
 
The SACC alleges that
TruConnect, through its office Brian Stewart, generated false accounting
figures and presented those figures to Torq in a manner intended to deprive
Torq of the benefits and profits “beyond those contemplated by the parties’
agreements.” (SACC, ¶ 39.) TruConnect began 
to inflate figures beginning May 2023. (SACC, ¶ 39.) “The generation of
these figures was self-serving for TRUCONNECT and had nothing to do with the
actions or performance of TORQ under the Distributor Agreement; rather,
TRUCONNECT presented these figures to TORQ for the unrelated purpose of turning
around and making overinflated claims on government programs to generate its
own wrongful profits.” (SACC, ¶ 40.) Torq was damaged by being exposed to
government liability. (SACC, ¶ 41.) 
 
TruConnect demurs to the
second cause of action on the basis that the claim is barred by the economic
loss rule. “Not all tort claims for monetary losses between contractual parties
are barred by the economic loss rule. But such claims are barred when they
arise from — or are not independent of — the parties’ underlying contracts.” (Sheen
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 923.) In Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, the California Supreme
Court found that the representation related to the presentation of false
certificates of conformance, arose independent of the parties’ contract because
the use of the nonconforming clutches by the plaintiff for years resulted in
the plaintiff enduring  “the cost of investigating the cause of the
faulty clutches” which was a damage that arose separate from the parties’
contract. (Id. at pp. 990-991.) 
 
Accordingly, Dana's tortious conduct was separate from the
breach itself, which involved Dana's provision of the nonconforming clutches. In addition, Dana's
provision of faulty clutches exposed
Robinson to liability for personal damages if a helicopter crashed and to
disciplinary action by the FAA. Thus, Dana's fraud is a tort independent of the
breach. 
 
(Id. at p. 991.) 
 
The SACC fails to explain how the false
accounting resulted in damages to Torq that went beyond the parties’
contractual obligations such that the liability arose independent of the
contract.  The economic expectations of
Torq cannot be protected by commercial or contract law. The economic loss rule
“ ‘hinges on a distinction drawn between transactions involving the sale of
goods for commercial purposes where economic
expectations are protected by commercial and contract law, and those
involving the sale of defective products to individual
consumers who are injured in a manner which has traditionally been remedied by
resort to the law of torts.’ [Citation.]” (Robinson, supra,
34 Cal.4th at p. 988.)
 
In Robinson, the false certificates of
performance “exposed Robinson to liability for
personal damages if a helicopter crashed and to disciplinary action by the FAA.”
(Robison, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 991.) 
 
Robinson's
claims are based on Dana’s intentional and
affirmative misrepresentations that risked physical harm to persons. Robinson's helicopters
are flown by and carry people. A properly functioning sprag clutch is vital to
the safe performance of the aircraft, and compliance with the certificate
requirement is part of an integrated regulatory scheme intended to ensure their
safe operation. The economic loss rule is designed to limit liability in
commercial activities that negligently or inadvertently go awry, not to reward
malefactors who affirmatively misrepresent and put people at risk.
(Id., at p. 991, fn. 7.) 


Here, Torq fails to explain how the false
accounting or false invoices exposed Torq to potential personal liability or
how the payment of false invoices could expose Torq to governmental liability. 
 
Accordingly, the SACC fails to allege sufficient
facts to show that the fraudulent accounting was tortious conduct that was
completely independent of the parties’ agreements, despite the parties’
obligations to provide accurate accounting. (SACC, Ex. A, § 18; Ex. B, § 20.) “[C]onduct
amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates a
duty independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law.” (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551.) “‘[A]n
omission to perform a contract obligation is never a tort, unless that omission
is also an omission of a legal duty.’ ” (Applied Equipment Corp. v.
Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 515 citing Jones v. Kelly (1929) 208 Cal. 251, 255.) 


Based on the above, the demurrer to the
second cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Complainant TruConnect’s demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend. Defendant/Cross-Complainant Torq is granted 10
days leave to amend. The court sets a Non-Appearance OSC RE: Amended Complaint for
August 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Plaintiff/Cross-Defenant to give notice.
