```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Caesarstone Ltd's motion to strike the First Amended Complaint. The motion sought to strike certain allegations related to punitive damages and failure to allege sufficient facts to show malice, oppression, or fraud. The court held that while the allegations may be conclusory, they are sufficient under the California Supreme Court's decision in Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. and that discovery procedures will clarify the specific products involved. The court also found that the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment is properly pled and supports a claim for punitive damages.
