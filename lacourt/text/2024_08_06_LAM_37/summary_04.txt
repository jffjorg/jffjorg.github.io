And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Plaintiff TruConnect's demurrer to Defendant Torq's Second Amended Cross-Complaint is sustained with leave to amend. Defendant Torq is granted 10 days leave to amend. The Judge sets a Non-Appearance OSC RE: Amended Complaint for August 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.

The case involves a dispute over TruConnect's alleged fraud in the inducement and misrepresentation, and Torq's claim that TruConnect's accounting records show inconsistencies and violations of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Judge finds that the first cause of action (fraudulent inducement) is sustained with leave to amend, as it fails to plead specific facts showing how, when, where, and by what means TruConnect's representations were tendered. The second cause of action (fraudulent misrepresentation) is also sustained with leave to amend, as it fails to allege sufficient facts showing that TruConnect's alleged fraud was tortious conduct independent of the parties' agreements.

The Judge concludes that TruConnect's demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, and Defendant Torq is granted 10 days leave to amend. The Judge sets a Non-Appearance OSC RE: Amended Complaint for August 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
