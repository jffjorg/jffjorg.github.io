And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a Tentative Ruling on the Defendant's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production from the Plaintiff. The Judge has denied the motion, finding no good cause to support the requests. The requests were made to assess the Plaintiff's standing to bring a fraudulent transfer action, but the Plaintiff's standing is based on a judgment in its favor against the Defendant in another action. The Judge has also awarded sanctions against the Defendant in the amount of $5,238.00, payable within 30 days, for the Defendant's unsuccessful motion.
