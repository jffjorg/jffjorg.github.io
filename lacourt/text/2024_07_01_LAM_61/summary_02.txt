And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has granted Defendant City of Palmdale's motion to bifurcate the trial, allowing the court to try the equitable issues first. The Judge finds that trying the equitable issues first is consistent with the ordinary practice of trying equitable issues before legal issues, and that it would promote judicial economy. The Judge also finds that trying the equitable issues first would not deprive the Plaintiffs of their right to a jury trial on their legal claims. The motion is granted, and the Defendant is ordered to provide notice.
