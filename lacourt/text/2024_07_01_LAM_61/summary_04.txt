And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Kelly Gibbons' Special Motion to Strike (Anti-SLAPP) the First Amended Complaint as to the third, fourth, and sixth through eleventh causes of action, and denies it as to the first, second, and fifth causes of action for defamation and false light. The ruling holds that Defendant Gibbons' statements about Plaintiff Stewart Lucas Murrey on a Facebook group were protected by the anti-SLAPP statute because they were made in a public forum and concerned a matter of public interest, namely women's security against male violence and harassment. The ruling also holds that Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to support his remaining claims against Defendant Gibbons, including invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and declaratory relief.
