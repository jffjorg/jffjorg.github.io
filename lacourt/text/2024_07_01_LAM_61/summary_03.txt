And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to lift the stay of proceedings in this derivative action. The stay was originally entered because of the overlap between the claims in this action and an arbitration proceeding involving the same parties. However, since the defendant BR CO I, LLC has dismissed its claims in this action, there is no longer any overlap between the claims in this action and the arbitration. The judge has determined that the plaintiff Nedco, LLC is not conflicted out of this case and can proceed with the litigation. The judge has also rejected the defendants' arguments that the stay should be maintained to prevent Cookies from being forced into a difficult position between this action and the arbitration.
