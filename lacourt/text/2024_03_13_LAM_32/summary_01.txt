And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Jose Rafael Morales Corona's motion to amend his answer, which was filed on February 14, 2024. The amended answer will be filed within 10 days of this order. The original answer mistakenly identified the owner of the subject property, and Defendant Corona asserts that he was never an owner. The court has considered the legal standard for allowing amendments, which requires a showing of no prejudice to the opposing party. In this case, Plaintiffs have not articulated any prejudice that would result from the amended answer. The court has also considered the facts of the case, including the transfer of title from Manuel Yanez, Sr. to his son, Yanez, Jr. The judge notes that Ms. Kenninger, the original counsel for the defendants, failed to file a motion to amend the answer prior to substituting out of the case.
