And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a scheduling issue that has been delayed due to the court's own scheduling issues. The parties, Jona and Rachel Rechnitz, were unable to agree on dates for depositions and document production. The Judge is inclined to agree with the dates proposed by the defendant and third party for the depositions, but believes that the documents should have been produced earlier. The Judge orders the documents to be produced on January 18, 2024, and sets a schedule for the depositions to be held from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday to Friday, with breaks for lunch and two 15-minute breaks. The parties are free to agree on any changes to this schedule.
