  Case Number:  20SMCV00216    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2024    Dept:  I The court is unhappy with the need for judicial intervention
on what ought to be a simple scheduling issue. 
The court apologizes for moving the January 16 and 17 dates, but it is
surprising that the parties cannot agree at this point.
Because the court cannot see undue urgency over the first
and second weeks of February and late January, the court is inclined to agree
to the dates defendant and third party propose for the depositions.  However, the court perceives no reason why
the documents cannot be produced earlier. 
The deposition delay was due to the court’s scheduling issues, but that
ought not delay the production of documents.
The court is inclined, therefore, to allow the depositions
to go forward on the earliest dates provided by Jona and Rachel Rechnitz.  The court is inclined to have the documents
produced on January 18, 2024.  The
requests were sent a while ago, and the documents would have been produced on
Tuesday but for the court’s need to move the date.  They should have no trouble producing on 1/18/24.  This will allow the deposition to move
forward more efficiently.  Once started,
each deposition will continue from day to day until completed, weekends and
holidays excepted, from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm with a one hour lunch and two 15
minute breaks, one in the morning and one in the evening each day.  The parties may, by agreement, alter this
schedule.
