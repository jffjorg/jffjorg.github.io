Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for sanctions filed by Cross-Complainants against Nicholas Behunin, the judgment debtor. The motion seeks an order finding Behunin failed to comply with a court order, awarding monetary sanctions against Behunin in the amount of $2,450.00 for attorneys' fees reasonably incurred in bringing the motion, and to show cause why a contempt sanction should not be issued.

The judge finds that Behunin has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, including failing to obey a court order, failing to oppose a motion to compel, and failing to file an opposition to the instant motion. As a result, the judge grants the motion for sanctions in the amount of $2,450.00 and orders Behunin to pay the amount within 20 days. The judge also declines to issue a show cause order for a contempt hearing.
