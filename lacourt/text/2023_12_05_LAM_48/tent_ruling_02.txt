  CASE NO.: 20STCV45372
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 5, 2023



 
Thomas
H. Citron, counsel of record for Defendant 6640 N. Orizaba LLC, seeks to be relieved
as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states
that there has been a complete breakdown of all communication between client
and counsel, making it impossible for counsel to effectively represent
Defendant.
Defendant,
through specially appearing counsel Amie Jacoby, filed an opposition.  Defendant agrees that the relationship is
unrepairable and is willing to substitute new counsel, but it asks for a 90- to
120-day trial continuance so it can secure new counsel.  Trial is currently scheduled for March 11,
2024.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and no prejudice is shown.
At
the hearing, the parties should be prepared to discuss what length of trial continuance,
if any, is appropriate.
The
proposed order does not include the correct upcoming hearing dates.  Before signing the order, the Court will amend
this information.
The
motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of service showing
service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on 6640 N. Orizaba LLC and
all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)
An
Order to Show Case Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel For Defendant 6640 N. Orizaba
LLC is scheduled for 01/05/2024 (January 5, 2024) at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48
at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  Defendant
6640 N. Orizaba LLC must retain new counsel before that date or the Court may
strike its answer and place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
