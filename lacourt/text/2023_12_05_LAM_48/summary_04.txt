And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for reconsideration filed by plaintiff I-Ching Nancy Chuang. The motion was filed on August 30, 2023, following the dismissal of plaintiff's action with prejudice on August 22, 2023.

The judge's ruling is based on three grounds. First, the motion was improperly filed, as it was signed by Mason Yost, who is not plaintiff's counsel of record. Second, the motion does not meet the standards for reconsideration, as it does not present sufficient new or different facts or circumstances. Third, the court determined on the merits that plaintiff would be unable to amend her complaint to state a claim against defendant, as her common law claims are barred by Government Code sections 815 and 818.

The judge also notes that even with the assistance of counsel, plaintiff cannot overcome these statutory bars, and that counsel's appearance at the hearing would not cause the court to change its ruling. The motion for reconsideration is therefore denied.
