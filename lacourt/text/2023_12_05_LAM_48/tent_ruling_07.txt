  CASE NO.: 23STCV17899
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 5, 2023



 
On
July 31, 2023, Plaintiff Melissa Penuela filed this action against Defendants Dennis
Behdadnia, Eman Zokaeim, Jason Shamtoob, and California Accident Firm.  The Complaint seeks only declaratory relief about
attorney liens in two other cases.
On
October 31, 2023, Defendants filed a demurrer.
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
According
to Defendants, “[t]he Complaint contains no factual allegations other than those
related to jurisdiction and venue, and the case numbers of the Lawsuits,” and “Plaintiff
is seeking a declaration that the liens do not exist but fails to make that allegation
anywhere in the Complaint, and certainly fails to state any factual or legal grounds
for the requested relief that the court declare the liens never existed.”  (Demurrer at p. 6.)
A
person who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties with respect to
another may, in cases of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties
of the respective parties, bring an action for a declaration of rights or duties,
either alone or with other relief.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1060.)  Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants claim they have an attorney lien on all proceeds she may obtain from
her two pending cases, Case Nos. 21STCV22094 and 22STCV24816.  (Complaint ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff disputes that Defendants have any liens,
and she seeks “a judicial determination of her rights and duties, and a declaration
as to whether the defendants have any lien from any proceeds from the plaintiff’s
pending cases.”  (Complaint ¶¶ 8, 10.)  This sufficiently alleges facts about the actual
controversy between the parties and the declaration of rights or duties that Plaintiff
desires.
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendants are ordered
to file an answer within 10 days.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j).)
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
