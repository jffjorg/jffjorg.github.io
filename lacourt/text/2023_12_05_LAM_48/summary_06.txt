And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to deem the plaintiff's requests for admission admitted. The plaintiff failed to respond to the requests for admission, and the defendant filed a motion to deem the requests admitted. Since the plaintiff did not file opposition to the motion, the court granted the motion. Additionally, the court ordered the plaintiff's counsel to pay sanctions of $1,500.00 to the defendant within 30 days. The court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.280 and 2033.220, which provide that a party who fails to respond to requests for admission may have their requests deemed admitted unless they serve a proposed response in substantial compliance with the code.
