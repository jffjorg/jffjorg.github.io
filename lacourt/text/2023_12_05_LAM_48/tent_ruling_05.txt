[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING IN PART DEMURRER;
  DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 5, 2023



 
On
June 30, 2023, Cross-Complainant filed a first amended cross-complaint (“FACC”)
against Cross-Defendants American Industrial Inspection and Eduardo Avalos, alleging
(1) judicial dissolution of partnership; (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (4) breach of fiduciary duty; (5) failure
to produce corporate records; (6) fraud; (7) negligent misrepresentation; (8) conversion
(erroneously numbered as seventh cause of action); (9) accounting (erroneously numbered
as eighth cause of action); and (10) declaratory relief (erroneously numbered as
ninth cause of action).
On
August 7, 2023, Cross-Defendants filed a demurrer and a motion to strike.
DEMURRER
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)  A special demurrer
for uncertainty under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f) is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant
or plaintiff cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues
must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or
her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
A.        Cross-Defendants’ Request for Judicial
Notice Is Unnecessary.
Cross-Defendants’
request for judicial notice of the Complaint and Cross-Complaint is denied as unnecessary
because these documents are already part of this case’s record.
B.        The FACC is Not Facially a Time-Barred
Sham Pleading.
Cross-Defendants
argue that the amendments in the FACC render it a sham pleading because the FACC
is not wholly inconsistent with the prior Cross-Complaint.  (Demurrer at pp. 13-14.)  “Under the sham
pleading doctrine, a plaintiff cannot avoid allegations that are determinative to
a cause of action simply by filing an amended complaint which omits the problematic
facts or pleads facts inconsistent with those alleged in the original complaint.”  (Tindell v. Murphy (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th
1239, 1248.)
Specifically,
Cross-Defendants contend that the amended allegations are contradictory and an effort
to avoid the statute of limitations.  (See
Demurrer at pp. 13-15.)  The original Cross-Complaint
alleges that the acts of Cross-Defendants’ fraud “were committed as early as 2020
and continue to the present.”  (Cross-Complaint
¶ 44.)  The FACC similarly alleges that the
actions “were committed as early as 2020 and continue to the present.”  (FACC ¶ 72.) 
However, the FACC now alleges that Cross-Complainant discovered the misconduct
“on or around August to October 2022.”  (FACC
¶ 72.)  The Cross-Complaint did not allege
a discovery date, so the addition of the date is not inconsistent.
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
C.        The Contract Claims Are Not Facially Barred
By the Statute of Limitations.
Cross-Defendants
argue that the contract-based claims are barred by the statute of limitations.  (Demurrer at pp. 14-15.)
“‘In
order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect
must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough
that the complaint shows that the action may be barred.’”  (Geneva Towers Ltd. Partnership v. City of
San Francisco (2003) 29 Cal.4th 769, 781.) 
An action based on a written contract must be brought within four years.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 337.)  An action based on an oral contract must be brought
within two years.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 339.)
The
FACC alleges an oral contract entered into in July 2021.  (FACC ¶ 33.) 
Although the date of breach is not alleged, this claim was timely alleged
in the March 27, 2023 Cross-Complaint.
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
D.        The Claims For Accounting and Declaratory
Relief Are Properly Pleaded.
Cross-Defendants
argue that the claims for accounting and declaratory relief are remedies, not causes
of action.  (Demurrer at pp. 15-16.)
Accounting
may be pleaded as a cause of action.  (See
Fleet v. Bank of America N.A. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1413.)
The
cause of action for declaratory relief, seeking a determination of the parties’
rights and duties in light of the other alleged conduct, is also proper.  A person who desires a declaration of his or her
rights or duties with respect to another may bring an action for a declaration of
rights or duties, either alone or with other relief.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1060.)
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
E.        The Claim For Failure to Produce Corporate
Records Alleges Only a Remedy.
According
to Cross-Defendants, the fifth cause of action for “‘Failure to Produce Corporate
Records’ is not a recognized cause of action in California.  At best, it is a form of breach that might give
rise to an action for involuntary dissolution.” 
(Demurrer at p. 15.)
The
FACC alleges that under Corporations Code section 16403, the partnership must keep
its books and records at its chief executive office, and the partners must be provided
with access to inspect the records.  (FACC
¶¶ 59-60.)  Cross-Complainant has demanded
production of all records, but the partnership has produced only a fraction of the
records requested and required to be kept. 
(FACC ¶¶ 62-63.)  Cross-Complainant
therefore seeks reasonable expenses and attorney fees under Corporations Code section
1604.  (FACC ¶ 61.)
Section
1604 provides for reimbursement of expenses “[i]n any action or proceeding under
Section 1600 or Section 1601.”  (Corp. Code,
§ 1604.)  The fifth cause of action is not
brought under sections 1600 or 1601.
The
demurrer to the fifth cause of action is sustained.
F.         Conclusion
The
demurrer to the fifth cause of action is SUSTAINED with 10 days’ leave to amend.  The demurrer is otherwise overruled.
MOTION
TO STRIKE
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California,
a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)
Cross-Defendants
move to strike paragraphs 57, 77, and 92, as well as the prayer for punitive damages.  A plaintiff can recover punitive damages in tort
cases where “the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.”  (Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (a).)  “The mere allegation an intentional tort was committed
is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages.  [Citation.] 
Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but
facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim. [Citation.]”  (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d
159, 166, fn. omitted.)  Paragraphs 57, 77,
and 92 (and the related causes of action) involve the same allegedly fraudulent
conduct supporting the fraud causes of action. 
(See FACC ¶¶ 54, 66-76, 88.)  Cross-Defendants
did not challenge the fraud claims, which can support punitive damages.
Cross-Defendants
also move to strike paragraphs 61, 63, and 64 of the fifth cause of action, as well
as the prayer for attorney fees and costs. 
This is duplicative of the demurrer, and Cross-Complainant has been granted
leave to amend these allegations.
The
motion to strike is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  Parties intending
to appear are encouraged to appear remotely and should be prepared to comply with
Dept. 48’s new requirement that those attending court in person wear a surgical
or N95 or KN95 mask.
