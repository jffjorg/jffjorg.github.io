And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant 6640 N Orizaba, LLC, effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the signed order and this order on all parties. The motion is granted because the relationship between the client and counsel has broken down, making it impossible for counsel to effectively represent the Defendant. The Defendant agrees to substitute new counsel and the judge finds that no prejudice would result from granting the motion. The judge also schedules an Order to Show Cause for January 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48, requiring the Defendant to retain new counsel by that date or risk having its answer struck and being placed in default.
