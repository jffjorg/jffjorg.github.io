  CASE NO.: 23STCV03072
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION
  TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 5, 2023



 
On
June 21, 2023, Defendant Irene Chen, M.D. served Request for Admissions, Set One
on Plaintiff Merhnaz Hadian.  Defendant has
not received any responses.
On
November 6, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to deem requests for admissions admitted.
Where
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections,
unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party
has subsequently served a substantially compliant response and that the party’s
failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  The court shall grant a motion to deem admitted
“unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  A monetary sanction against the party whose failure
to serve a timely response to requests for admission is mandatory.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff
did not serve responses, and she did not file any opposition to the motion.  Accordingly, the motion to deem Requests for Admission,
Set One admitted is GRANTED.
Plaintiff’s
counsel is ORDERED to pay sanctions of $1,500.00 to Defendant within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
