And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, Melissa Penuela, is seeking declaratory relief regarding attorney liens on two pending cases. The defendants argue that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because it does not allege the existence of the liens. However, the court finds that the complaint does sufficiently allege facts about the actual controversy between the parties and the declaration of rights or duties that the plaintiff desires. The demurrer is therefore overruled, and the defendants are ordered to file an answer within 10 days.
