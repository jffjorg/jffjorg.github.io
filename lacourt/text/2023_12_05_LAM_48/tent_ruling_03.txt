On
March 27, 2023, Plaintiffs Ricky Millan, Silvia Millan, Michael Millan,
Samantha Millan, and Tommy Millan filed a first amended complaint against
Defendant Joan Plotkin (individually and as trustee of Plotkin Trust Agreement
Dated August 28, 1991).
On
June 1, 2023, Defendant served Request For Production of Documents, Set One;
Form Interrogatories, Set One; and Special Interrogatories, Set One.  Plaintiffs provided unverified responses on
July 2, 2023.  Defendant requested
verified responses and granted Plaintiffs an extension.  When no verified responses were provided,
Defendant attempted to contact Plaintiffs, but counsel did not receive a
response.
On
September 6, 2023, Defendant filed motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
Request For Production of Documents, Set One; Form Interrogatories, Set One;
and Special Interrogatories, Set One.
On
October 12, 2023, Department 30 referred this case to Department 1 for
reassignment to an Independent Calendar Court. 
On October 13, 2023, the case was transferred to this Department.  Pursuant to the October 12 order, all
hearings set in Department 30 were taken off calendar.
On
October 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed oppositions to the discovery motions.
On
November 3, 2023, Defendant refiled its discovery motions.  Defendant also filed replies to Plaintiffs
October 27 oppositions.
When
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)
Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant did not first request an Informal Discovery
Conference.  But according to Page 1 of
Department 48’s Courtroom Information, available on the Court’s website,
“Informal Discovery Conferences (IDC) will no longer be conducted in Department
48.  You may file your motions to compel further
discovery.  However, the Court now
requires the parties to also file a joint statement for discovery disputes (as
outlined in Exhibit A) together with your motions.”  A joint statement is not required for motions
to compel initial responses.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant failed to meet and confer before filing these motions.  However, that is not required for a motion to
compel initial, not further, responses. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
Plaintiffs
also argue that the motions are moot because Plaintiffs have provided
supplemental responses before the hearing. 
Plaintiffs’ counsel confirms that the only responses were served on July
2, 2023.  (Yadegari Decl. ¶ 3.)  These responses were unverified, and counsel
admits that he “encountered certain difficulties in the process of obtaining
verifications from my clients pertaining to the responses provided.”  (Yadegari Decl. ¶ 4.)  “[C]aselaw provides that an unverified
response is tantamount to no response at all.” 
(Melendrez v. Superior Court (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1343, 1348.)  Accordingly, the motions are not moot because
Plaintiffs have failed to provide compliant verified responses.
The
motions to compel are GRANTED.
Plaintiff
is ordered to serve verified responses, without objections, to Defendant’s
Request For Production of Documents, Set One; Form Interrogatories, Set One;
and Special Interrogatories, Set One within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
