The Plaintiffs failed to serve timely responses to discovery requests, which were deemed tantamount to no response. The Defendant requested verified responses and granted the Plaintiffs an extension, but no verified responses were provided. The Judge finds that the motions are not moot since the Plaintiffs failed to provide compliant verified responses. The Judge orders the Plaintiffs to serve verified responses, without objections, to the Defendant's discovery requests within 30 days.
