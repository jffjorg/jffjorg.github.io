 Case Number:  23SMCV01051    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the motion.  Plaintiff’s counsel to pay any fees and costs
associated with the underlying motion (to the extent not already included in
the sanctions order), including the cost of appearing at this hearing.  Verified responses, without objection, will
be served within 2 court days of today. 
If there was a 17.1 interrogatory, verified responses, without objection,
will be served within 5 court days from today as to it as well.  Plaintiff’s counsel would be well advised to
insure that no motion to compel or compel further is brought related to those
responses.
 
If defendant believes it has cause to oppose this motion,
the court will consider DENYING the motion, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE to allow it
to be brought as a noticed motion.  That
said, though, the court finds it hard to understand how it could be anything
but an abuse of discretion to not grant this relief.
