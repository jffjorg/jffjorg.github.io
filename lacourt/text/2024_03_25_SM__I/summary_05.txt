And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion and is inclined to grant it. The plaintiff's counsel is required to pay any fees and costs associated with the motion, including the cost of appearing at the hearing. The plaintiff's counsel must also serve verified responses to the motion without objection within 2 court days. Additionally, if the defendant has not already received a response to a 17.1 interrogatory, the plaintiff's counsel must serve a verified response within 5 court days. The judge warns that if a motion to compel or compel further is brought related to these responses, it will be an abuse of discretion. If the defendant believes they have grounds to oppose the motion, they can file a noticed motion, but the judge is hesitant to deny the relief.
