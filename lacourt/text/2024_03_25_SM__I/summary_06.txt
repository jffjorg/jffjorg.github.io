And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling for a court hearing on March 25, 2024. The defendant's counsel initially stated that a check in question had cleared, but the plaintiff has since submitted evidence that the check was returned and not cashed. The judge is inclined to grant the plaintiff's application for a judgment, pending confirmation from the defense. If the check was indeed returned and not cashed, the judge will request the plaintiff to submit a form of judgment within 10 court days, subject to approval by the defense as to form only.
