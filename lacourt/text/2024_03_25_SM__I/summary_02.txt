And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This is a demurrer to the cross-complaint brought by Channel against Primex, seeking indemnity and contribution. The court has considered the arguments presented and finds that the demurrer is without merit. The court does not see misjoinder, and the uncertainty argument is also not well founded. The real issue is a lack of facts giving rise to a cause of action. The court believes that Channel has stated a sufficient cause of action for equitable indemnity and contribution, and that Primex's arguments are not sufficient to sustain the demurrer. The court finds that Primex and Channel are joint tortfeasors, and that Channel can claim indemnity from Primex for the construction defects alleged in the complaint. The court also notes that the fact that Channel has paid no money is not relevant to the indemnity action, and that such actions can be brought before a judgment is entered or paid. The demurrer is therefore overruled, and Primex is ordered to answer within 15 court days.
