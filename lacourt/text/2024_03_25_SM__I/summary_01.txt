And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' motions and has reached a tentative ruling on the propriety of the defendants' supplemental expert designation. The court finds that the defendants' supplemental expert designation is improper because it was not disclosed in a timely manner and because it appears to be an attempt to swap out experts rather than to provide additional expertise. The court also notes that the defendants failed to provide all discoverable writings and reports by their expert, Stephen Yates, and that this may be a problem.

The court will require the defendants to produce all discoverable writings and reports by Yates from the time he was first contacted to the present. The production will be accompanied by a declaration from lead counsel and Yates that this has been done and that nothing has been withheld.

The court will continue this hearing to April 15, 2024, at 9:00 am. The court warns that there is a good chance that the matter will be continued again.
