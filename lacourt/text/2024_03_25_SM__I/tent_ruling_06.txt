 Case Number:  23SMCV03173    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  I At the last hearing, defendant’s counsel stated that the
check in question had cleared and thus the default had been cured.  The court determined that if the check had in
fact cleared and been accepted, it was far from clear that a judgment ought to
be entered, so the matter was continued. 
Since then, plaintiff has submitted evidence that the check was returned
and not cashed.  The court will inquire
of the defense, but if that is indeed the case, the court is inclined to GRANT
the application and will request plaintiff to submit a form of judgment within
10 court days, first running it by the defense for approval as to form only.
