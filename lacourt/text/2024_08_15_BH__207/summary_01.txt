And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion of Jason G. Eisenberg, Esq. (Counsel) to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Stephen Strachan. The motion was unopposed, and the Judge found that it was both procedurally and substantively proper. Counsel had filed the required forms and indicated that the motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Judge noted that Counsel was unable to confirm the client's current address and had provided a declaration indicating that the address served was the last known address. The Judge ordered Counsel to prepare and file an amended MC-053 within 10 days of the date of this Order, which shall include information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by any party, or ordered by the Court.
