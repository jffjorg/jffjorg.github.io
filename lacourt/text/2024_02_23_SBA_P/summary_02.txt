And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings. The plaintiff, Blanca Cadenas De Garcia, filed a complaint against defendants Hudson Insurance Company and Redondo Automotive, alleging causes of action including intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of consumer legal remedies act. The defendant, Malty Automotive, Inc. dba Redondo Mitsubishi, filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings. The court finds that the defendant has met its burden in showing that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties, and the agreement is enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act. However, the court notes that the parties agreed not to have the arbitrator make decisions on injunctive relief, and therefore, the request for injunctive relief is not subject to arbitration. The court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the proceedings until all claims for money damages have been resolved by arbitration.
