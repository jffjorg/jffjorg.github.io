And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' request for entry of default judgment against the defendants RSVP Group, LLC and Garry Mear. The plaintiffs had filed a complaint alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, securities fraud, and securities fraud, and had served the defendants via personal service. The clerk had entered default against the defendants on January 25, 2022, and the plaintiffs had submitted a request for default judgment. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs had not sufficiently proven their damages of $414,000.00, and therefore denied the request for entry of default judgment. The judge also noted that the plaintiffs had not supported their claims with evidence of payment and had not submitted exhibits to support their claims.
