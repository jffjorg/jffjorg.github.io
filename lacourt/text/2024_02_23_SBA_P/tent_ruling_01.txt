  Case Number:  21TRCV00673    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  P BACKGROUNDOn September 20, 2021, plaintiffs Bui Tran and Danh Do sued RSVP Group, LLC; Garry Mear; Christopher Michael Mear; and DOES 1 to 25 for the following causes of action: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) breach of contract; (3) securities fraud; and (4) securities fraud.On January 25, 2022, plaintiffs filed proofs of service showing that the complaint was served via personal service on RSVP Group, LLC, and Garry Mear on November 4, 2021, at 301 Calle Miramar #1, Redondo Beach, California 90277. The clerk entered default against the defendants on January 25, 2022. Plaintiffs dismissed Christopher Michael Mear on August 29, 2022. Plaintiffs dismissed Doe Defendants on November 27, 2023. This is Plaintiffs’ first request for default judgment.ANALYSISCode of Civil Procedure Section 585 permits entry of a judgment after a defendant’s default has been entered. A party seeking judgment on the default by the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and the following: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP Section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. CRC 3.1800.JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court judgment. Item number 2 must be completed. Item number 8 must be completed if the Defendant is an individual. Plaintiffs must submit a proposed form of judgment.Plaintiffs used JC Form CIV-100 and completed items number 2 and 8. Plaintiffs have submitted a proposed form of judgment.Plaintiffs request a total judgment of $552,523.72, consisting of the demand of the complaint for $414,000.00, interest in the amount of $137,918.72, and $605.00 in costs.By defaulting, a defendant is deemed to admit all material allegations of the complaint that are well pleaded. Molen v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1156. The complaint need only allege facts sufficient to apprise a defendant of the nature of the plaintiff’s demand, and it is immaterial that the complaint might have been subject to a demurrer for failure to make an allegation necessary to state a cause of action. Id. at 1157. See also CCP § 431.20; Bristol Convalescent Hospital v. Stone (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 848, 859 (stating that defaulting defendant admits absolute verity of all allegations of complaint giving rise to liability).The plaintiff must prove the amount of damages before an actual entry of default judgment. See Ostling v. Loring (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1731, 1745. In determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to an award of damages after the defendant has defaulted, the plaintiff is only required to present evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages. Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362. The trial court must hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff and render judgment “‘in [its] favor for such sum, not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint, or for such relief, not exceeding that demanded in the complaint, as appears from the evidence to be just. [Citations.]’” Id. at 362.A. General DamagesPlaintiffs request $414,000.00. Request for Entry of Default Judgment, ¶ 2. Plaintiffs have submitted the declaration of Danh Do. Do states that he and his wife invested $350,000 for the non-voting membership shares in RSVP Group, LLC. Decl. Do, ¶ 5. He also states that they have not received any K-1s, annual statements, profit and loss statements, and/or books and records. Decl. Do, ¶ 6. He further states that the business is no longer active, and he does not know why. Decl. Do, ¶ 6. In addition, he states that they loaned an additional $64,000.00. Decl. Do, ¶ 16. However, Plaintiffs do not support these statements with evidence of payment. There are no cancelled checks or bank statements, e.g. They refer to the $350,000 payment as Exhibit 4, but they have not submitted an Exhibit 4.Thus, Plaintiffs have not sufficiently proven their damages of $414,000.00.B. InterestAccording to form CIV-100, Plaintiffs request interest in the amount of $137,918.72. Plaintiffs calculate interest based on 10 percent of $414,000 from July 12, 2019, to November 10, 2022: $41,400 per year divided by 365, equally $113.42 per diem, which adds up to 1,216 days totaling interest of $137,918.72. (Decl. Do, ¶ 24.)Accordingly, Plaintiffs would be entitled to interest in the amount of $18,802.00.C. CostsPlaintiffs request recovery of costs in the amount of $605.00. The memorandum of costs states that the request is based on $435.00 in clerk’s filing fees and $170.00 in process server fees. CIV-100, ¶ 7.Accordingly, Plaintiffs would be entitled to costs in the amount of $605.00.For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs Buy Tran and Danh Doh’s request for entry of default judgment in their favor and against Defendants RSVP Group, LLC and Garry Mear is DENIED.
