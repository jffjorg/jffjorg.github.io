And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against Bolive, Inc. in the amount of $238,048.37. The plaintiff failed to attach any originals, copies, or declaration explaining the unavailability of the written agreement, as required by the court's rules. The court finds that the damages may be made certain by calculation and awards interest at the legal rate of 10% per annum on the past-due payments from April 20, 2022 to August 11, 2023. The court also notes that the amount in the complaint prayer controls, and therefore, the relief afforded in default judgment is limited to the type and amount of claims in the complaint.
