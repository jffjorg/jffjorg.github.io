The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Plaintiff Gregory Allen French's motion for trial preference.

French filed a complaint in September 2023 and a motion for trial preference in October 2023. The motion is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 36, which allows for trial preference when a party has substantial medical doubt regarding their survival beyond six months. French's doctor, Shahab Attarchi, M.D., has provided declarations stating that French's medical conditions, including a spinal infection, poorly managed diabetes, and risk of sepsis, raise substantial medical doubt regarding French's survival. The Judge has granted French's motion, finding that French has established substantial medical doubt regarding his survival beyond the next six months.
