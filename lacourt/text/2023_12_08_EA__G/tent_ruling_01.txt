Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor
or a Person with a Disability
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Petitioner Evelyn Aguilar’s Petition for Approval of
Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor
or a Person with a Disability is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
action arises from the sexual abuse of an elementary school student by a fellow
student. In August 2022, Plaintiff John Roe was a minor student attending Kwis
Elementary School in the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District (HLPUSD).
During that month, Roe allegedly was twice subjected to sexual abuse in school
restrooms by another minor student attending Kwis Elementary School.
On
October 25, 2022, Roe filed a complaint against HLPUSD and Does 1-100, alleging
a single cause of action for negligence.
On
January 17, 2023, Roe filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against same
defendants alleging the same cause of action.
On August
29, 2023, Roe filed a notice of settlement and submitted the present petition
on October 11. A hearing on the petition is set for November 6, along with an
OSC Re: Dismissal.
ANALYSIS
Roe
petitions for the court’s approval of a $200,000 settlement reached between Roe
and HLPUSD.
Legal Standard
An
enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be
consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for approval must be presented
to the court and until it is granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton
v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any
settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Id.,
at p. 1606.)
Probate
Code section 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement proceeds are to be paid.
Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, the order shall approve payment of
reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows:
The court making the order or giving the judgment
referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further order
authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise
and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and
attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid
from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the
minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).)
In
cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, “unless the court has approved the
fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when
approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or
property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a
disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he
court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made
between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances
existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the
attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955,
subd. (a)(2).
Discussion
The current matter involves the
alleged sexual assault of minor plaintiff Roe which occurred while Roe was
attending Kwis Elementary School.
Pursuant to the settlement
agreement reached between the parties, HLPUSD will pay a total of $200,000 to
Roe.
The contingency agreement is
attached to the Petition as Attachment 17a. In it, the attorney fees for Roe
will be 35% of the gross recovery. Counsel requests $69,861.70 in attorney fees
which constitutes 34.93% of the gross recovery. (See Attach. 13a, Khedry
Decl., ¶ 14.) Counsel also requests $17,984.23 in costs and expenses. As a
result, Roe will receive a total net amount of $112,154.07 with $30,000 being
deposited into an insured bank account and $82,154.07 being invested in a
single-premium deferred annuity.
Based
on the petition, the court finds the amount awarded to Roe is reasonable. The
court also finds as reasonable counsel’s recovery of fees in the amount of $69,861.70, or 34.93% of the
total recovery. Finally, the court finds the allocation of settlement funds into
an insured bank account and a single-premium deferred annuity to be appropriate and proper.
Accordingly,
the petition is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the
court GRANTS the petition to confirm minor’s compromise.
The court will inquire from
Plaintiff’s counsel at the hearing as to the time requested to deposit
settlement funds as outlined above, and intends to set a future hearing date
for an OSC re: Proof of Deposit of Settlement Funds and Dismissal.
