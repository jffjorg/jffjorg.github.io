SUMMARY OF ACTION
On June 18, 2022, plaintiff Yeroos Noorijanian alleges
that two dogs owned by defendants Susan Pritchard Pone and Joseph Pone jumped
out of defendants’ vehicle and attacked both Plaintiff and dog Leo, while the
two were on a walk.
 
On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for
Negligence and Strict Liability.
 
RULING: Overruled/Denied.
Defendants
submit both a demurrer and motion to strike the allegations in support of, and
claim for, punitive damages in the first amended complaint, as pled in the
retaliation cause of action. [Comp., ¶¶ 35-41, Prayer, ¶ 6.] Defendant
challenges the claim for punitive damages based on a lack of any showing of
malicious or oppressive conduct. Plaintiff in a one day late opposition
contends the demurrer to the punitive damages is improper. Plaintiff maintains
the punitive damages claim is otherwise sufficiently pled. Defendant in reply objects
to the late filed opposition and reiterates the arguments regarding the lack of
facts supporting punitive damages.
 
The court declines to consider the demurrer to the punitive
damages claim. (Quiroz v. Seventh Ave.
Center (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1281 [“Where a whole cause of
action is the proper subject of a pleading challenge, the court should
sustain a demurrer to the cause of action rather than grant
a motion to strike”]; PH
II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682-1683
[While a demurrer is not the exclusive means to challenge a cause of action, a
motion to strike generally applies to parts of a cause of action, claim for
damages, or where the cause of action or primary right is barred as a matter of
law.]; Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166
(footnote 9) [“we reiterate our view the adequacy of punitive damage
allegations may not properly be tested by demurrer].) The demurrer is therefore
overruled in that it only challenges a claim for damages.
 
On the
motion to strike, Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive
damages upon a showing of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means conduct which is intended
by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which
is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression” means despicable conduct
that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of
that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the
defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving
a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
Punitive damages require more than the mere commission of a
tort. (See Taylor v. Superior Court
(1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 894-95.) Specific facts must be pled in support of
punitive damages. (Hillard v. A.H. Robins
Co. (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 374, 391-392.) “The mere allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient
to warrant an award of punitive damages. [Citation.] Not only must there be
circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.
[Citation.]” (Grieves v. Superior Court
(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166, fn. Omitted [emphasis added].)
 
Any negligence based causes of action in and of
themselves will not support the claim for punitive damages. Plain
unintentional carelessness, characterized as negligence or recklessness, is not
sufficient to support punitive damages. (Nolin
v. National Convenience Stores, Inc. (1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 279, 285-286
[“Conduct classified only as unintentional carelessness, while it may
constitute negligence or even gross negligence, will not support an award of
punitive damages”]; G. D. Searle &
Co. v. Superior Court (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 22, 32 (“When nondeliberate injury is charged,
allegations that the defendant's conduct was wrongful, willful, wanton,
reckless or unlawful do not support a claim for exemplary damages;
such allegations do not charge malice”]; Dawes
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82, 87 [“Inasmuch
as Civil Code section 3294 requires as a prerequisite to the recovery of
punitive damages that the defendant “has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice,” the cases have uniformly recognized that proof of negligence, even
gross negligence, or recklessness is insufficient to warrant an award of
punitive damages’]; Ebaugh v. Rabkin
(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 891; McDonell v.
American Trust Co. (1955) 130 CA2d 296, 300 [Awareness of a potential
condition under a negligence claim not sufficient to support a claim for
punitive damages].)
 
Plaintiff depends on an allegation of Defendants’ knowledge
of the dogs’ vicious propensities, failure to restrain the dogs, and therefore
presenting a public risk. [Comp., ¶¶ 18-19, 27-28.] For purposes of the motion
to strike, the court finds the operative complaint sufficiently articulates the
claim based on a failure to control/restrain/protect the public from knowingly
vicious dogs. The motion to strike is therefore overruled.
 
In summary, the demurrer is overruled, and the
motion to strike is denied. Defendants to answer the operative verified
complaint within 10 days of this order.
