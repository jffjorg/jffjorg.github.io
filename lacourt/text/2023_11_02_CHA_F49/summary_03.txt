And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Susan Pritchard, et al, against the plaintiff, Yeroos Noorijanian. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants' two dogs jumped out of their vehicle and attacked the plaintiff and his dog, Leo, while they were on a walk. The defendants have challenged the claim for punitive damages, arguing that there is no showing of malicious or oppressive conduct. The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the claim for punitive damages is sufficient, and denied the motion to strike, finding that the operative complaint sufficiently articulates the claim. The Judge has also noted that punitive damages require more than the mere commission of a tort and that specific facts must be pled in support of punitive damages.
