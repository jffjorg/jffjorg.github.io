And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for attorney fees filed by Design Masonry, Inc., Scott Floyd, and Erik Doyle. The motion requested $89,478.20 in attorney fees as prevailing parties in the bench trial. The court finds that the 2020 version of Government Code section 12965, which allows for the recovery of reasonable attorney's fees to a prevailing party, is applicable. However, the court denies the motion because the prevailing party did not meet the burden of proof to establish a frivolous or groundless action. The court also finds that the motion lacks a basis of statutory authority for recovery of fees on non-FEHA related claims. Additionally, the court declines to consider potentially unmade arguments that should have been properly raised as a motion to tax costs.
