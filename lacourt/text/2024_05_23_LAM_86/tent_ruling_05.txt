[1]           On January 9, 2024, plaintiff also
filed an application for such relief against defendant Ryan Thomas Isbell.  On February 20, 2024, counsel for Isbell
filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings due to an automatic stay of proceedings
upon his filing for bankruptcy.


[2]           On January 9, 2024, default was entered
against defendants DTSE, DTSB, and Sorg.
 


[3]           Because proceedings against Isbell
were stayed automatically due to his filing of bankruptcy, Judge Richardson
denied the motion to compel arbitration as to him without prejudice.  (3/13/24 Minute Order at 6.)


[4]           The Note allows for recovery of
attorney fees incurred to collect on the Note. (Pyle Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. 2 at
2.)
