[1]           “Rental units,” “single-family
residence,” and “condominium” are separately defined in the RSO. (WHMC §
17.08.010.) 


[2]           Staff of the Rent Stabilization
Division also determined that the Hearing Examiner erred in calculating the maximum
allowable rent and by not calculating the amount of the overpayment. (AR
21-22.) The Commission remanded the Hearing Examiner’s Decision for these
reasons only. (AR 77-78.) In the instant writ petition, petitioner Landlord only
challenges the ruling that the Unit is subject to the RSO. (Pet. ¶¶ 25, 26.)
 


[3]           Landlord’s reply exceeds 10 pages, in
violation of Rule of Court 3.1113(d) and Local Rule 3.231(i).  Accordingly, the Court does not consider pages
14 through 16 of the reply.


[4]           In the reply, petitioner refers to
Civil Code section 1940(c), erroneously cited as section 1946(c), for a
definition of “dwelling unit.” (Reply at 5, fn. 2.) Section 1940, however, is
not part of the Act.
 


[5]           Even if the Court were to look to
legislative history, it is inconclusive. The City references an analysis of
Assembly Bill 1164 (AB 1164), which states that the Act “exempts from rent
control single-family residences and other similar units.” (City RJN Ex. A.) While
it could be argued that the Unit is not a unit similar to a single-family
residence because the Unit is attached to a commercial unit, it could also be argued
that the Unit is very much similar to a single-family residence in that both comprise
a single dwelling unit that cannot be transferred separately from any other
dwelling unit. Likewise, the analysis of Senate Bill 1257 (SB 1257) states that
the bill “would exempt from local rent controls any dwelling unit which could
be sold or transferred separately from any other dwelling unit” (Landlord RJN
Ex. 8)—language consistent with Landlord’s view.  But the analysis of SB 1257 also described
the exemption as covering “all single-family homes, condominiums, townhouses,
or any subdivided interest in a community apartment project, stock cooperative,
or limited-equity housing cooperative”—a list of examples that appears not to encompass
the Unit. (The Court does not consider the analysis of Senate Bill 985 because
it post-dates enactment of the Act.)  In
short, the legislative history is unhelpful, but it is certainly not
inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute as discussed above.

[6]           The City also cites ABCO, LLC v.
Eversley (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1092 for the assertion that the Unit must
be detached for subdivision (a)(3)(A) to apply. (Opp. at 13:5-24.) However, ABCO
is inapposite because it does not address the exemptions to local rent
control ordinances under the Act. Rather, ABCO discussed exemptions
contained within the local rent control ordinance. (Id. at 1099-1100.)
