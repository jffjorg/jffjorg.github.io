Petitioner
8242 Samo LLC petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondents City of
West Hollywood and Rent Stabilization Commission of the City of West Hollywood (collectively,
“City”) to set aside Resolution RSC No. 23-622, which affirmed a decision
finding that a unit located at 8242 ½ Santa Monica Blvd. in West Hollywood is
subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Costa-Hawkins
Rental Housing Act
 
            “The Costa-Hawkins [Rental Housing] Act,
enacted in 1995, generally prohibits public entities from applying rent control
laws to certain categories of dwellings….” (Hirschfield v. Cohen (2022)
82 Cal.App.5th 648, 663.) Civil Code section 1954.52, contained within the
Costa-Hawkins Act (“Act”), sets forth dwellings that are exempt from local rent
control. As pertinent to this proceeding, “an owner of residential real
property may establish the initial and all subsequent rental rates for a
dwelling or a unit” if “[i]t is alienable separate from the title to any other
dwelling unit….” (Civ. Code § 1954.52(a)(3)(A).) The Act defines “residential
real property” to include “any dwelling or unit that is intended for human
habitation.” (Civ. Code § 1954.51(e).) Neither “dwelling” nor “unit” are
defined within the Act. 
 
B.          
Rent
Stabilization Ordinance in West Hollywood
 
In
1985, the City of West Hollywood (“City”) enacted the Rent Stabilization
Ordinance (“RSO”) to “protect tenants from unreasonable and excessive rents, to
protect tenants from involuntary displacement, to keep rents within the city at
a moderate level and at the same time to ensure a just and reasonable return to
landlords.” (West Hollywood Municipal Code [“WHMC”] § 17.04.020; see RJN
Ex. C.) The RSO requires landlords to register rental units unless specifically
exempt. (WHMC § 17.28.010(a)(1).) “[S]ingle-family residences, condominiums,
cooperatives, and other residential rental units which are separately
alienable” are exempt from the RSO.[1]
(WHMC § 17.24.010(a)(11).) 
 
C.          
Real
Property at Issue
 
Since
March 15, 2012, real party in interest Derek Ferguson (“Tenant”) has been a
tenant at the residential unit located at 8242 ½ Santa Monica Boulevard
(“Unit”) in the City. (AR 16.) The Unit sits on top of a commercial unit
located at 8242 ½ Santa Monica Boulevard. (AR 16, 101.) The residential unit
and commercial unit share the same assessor parcel number. (AR 16.) 
 
In
May 2012, Tenant’s then-landlord registered the Unit with the City as subject
to the RSO. (AR 36, 45.) On May 14, 2023, the City determined that the maximum
allowable rent for the Unit for the tenancy was $1,700 per month. (AR 16, 52-53.)
The Unit is now owned by petitioner 8242 Samo LLC (“Landlord”). (AR 16.) 
 
D.          
Tenant’s
Assertion of Overcharge of Rent
 
            On August 17, 2022, Tenant applied
to the City’s Rent Stabilization Division for a rent adjustment under the RSO.
(AR 16, 41-42.) At the time of the application, Tenant’s rent was $1,900 per
month. (AR 16.) 
 
On
November 14, 2022, a hearing was held before a Hearing Examiner. (AR 16.) Tenant
argued that the Unit is subject to the RSO because it has been registered pursuant
to the RSO since 2012. (AR 45-49, 102-03 [HT 19:440-20:476], 105-06 [HT
22:528-23:544].) Landlord argued that the Unit was exempt from the RSO because
it was the sole residential unit in the building. (AR 35-36.)
 
On
December 21, 2022, the Hearing Examiner issued a decision. (AR 34-39.) With
respect to Landlord’s claim that the Unit is exempt from the RSO, the Hearing
Officer determined, “The subject property is not a single-family house or
condominium unit that can be alienated separate from the main building under
RSO section 17.24.010(a)(11) and is therefore not subject to exemption from the
requirements of the RSO.” (AR 37.)  The
Hearing Examiner’s decision makes no mention of the RSO exemptions set forth in
Civil Code section 1954.52 of the Act.
 
On
January 5, 2023, Landlord appealed the Hearing Examiner’s determination to the
Rent Stabilization Division. (AR 17.) Landlord argued that the Unit is not
subject to the RSO because it “consists of a single dwelling unit that is
joined by a commercial unit.” (AR 17.) Citing the Act and its legislative
history, as well as Owens v. City of Oakland Housing, Residential Rent and
Relocation Board (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 739, staff of the Rent Stabilization
Division determined that the Unit is subject to the RSO because the Unit is not
separately alienable from the property in its entirety, i.e., from the
commercial unit.[2]
(AR 19-21.) On February 9, 2023, the City’s Rent Stabilization Commission
(“Commission”) adopted Resolution No. 23-622, which, in relevant part, affirmed
the Unit’s status as a rent-controlled residential rental unit subject to the
RSO. (AR 73-79.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
May 10, 2023, petitioner filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Administrative
Mandate. On August 15, 2023, real party filed an Answer. On August 16, 2023,
real party filed an Amended Answer. On September 25, 2023, respondents filed an
Answer. 
 
            On
March 19, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On April 23, 2024, respondents
filed an opposition. On May 8, 2023, petitioner filed a reply and filed the
administrative record.[3]  Real party has not filed any brief.
 


III.     Standard of Review
 
            WHMC section 17.44.010(4) requires the City to conduct a
hearing on rent adjustment applications. CCP § 1094.5 is applicable to “any
final administrative order or decision made as the result of a proceeding in
which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be
taken, and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior
tribunal….” (CCP § 1094.5(a).) 
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
(CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
The sole issue presented
in the instant writ is whether Civil Code section 1954.52(a)(3)(A) applies to the Unit. The interpretation of a statute
or regulation is a question of law. (See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.
Co. v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 71.) “On questions of law
arising in mandate proceedings, [the Court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’”
(Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Evidentiary
Matters
 
Respondents’
request to take judicial notice of Exhibit A (California Bill Analysis,
Assembly Floor, 1995-1996 Regular Session, Assembly Bill 1164, July 20, 1995)
and petitioner’s request to take judicial notice of Exhibit A (California Bill Analysis,
Senate Judiciary Committee, 1995-96 Regular Session, Senate Bill 1257, April 4,
1995) are GRANTED. (Whaley v. Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc.
(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 479, 487, fn. 4 [taking judicial notice of legislative
history in appeal involving statutory construction].) 
 
Respondents’
request to take judicial notice of Exhibit B (California Bill Analysis,
Assembly Committee, 2001-2002 Regular Session, Senate Bill 985, July 11, 2001)
is DENIED. As Exhibit B post-dates enactment of Section 1954.52(a)(3)(A), the
Legislative could not have considered it before enacting the statute. (See
ibid. [“Post enrollment documents are not proper indicia of legislative
intent because it is not reasonable to infer that they were ever read or
considered by the Legislature”].) 
 
Respondents’
request to take judicial notice of Exhibit C, portions of the West Hollywood
Municipal Code is GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(b).


 
B.          
Application
of Costa-Hawkins Act
 
Landlord
seeks a determination that the Unit is exempt from the RSO under the
Costa-Hawkins Act. Civil Code section 1954.52(a)(3)(A) states, in relevant part:

 
Notwithstanding
any other provision of law, an owner of residential real property may establish
the initial and all subsequent rental rates for a dwelling or a unit about
which any of the following is true: . . . It is alienable separate from the
title to any other dwelling unit….
 
Landlord’s
contention raises an issue of statutory interpretation. 
 
“The
general principles that guide interpretation of a statutory scheme are well[
]settled. Our function is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to
effectuate the purpose of the law. To ascertain such intent, courts turn first
to the words of the statute itself, and seek to give the words employed by the
Legislature their usual and ordinary meaning. When
interpreting statutory language, we may neither
insert language which has been omitted
nor ignore language which has been
inserted. The language must be construed in the context of
the statutory framework as a whole, keeping in mind the policies and purposes
of the statute [citation], and where possible the language should be
read so as to conform to the spirit of the enactment.” (Welch v. Welch
(2022) 79 Cal.App.5th 283, 296.)
 
The
Court agrees with Landlord. It is undisputed that the subject property consists
of a residential unit and a commercial unit. (AR 16.) Because the property has
only one residential unit, the Unit at issue is “alienable separate from the
title to any other dwelling unit,” as set forth in section 1954.52(a)(3)(A). Indeed,
there is no other dwelling unit in the property from which there could be any
question or dispute over whether the Unit is separately alienable from any
other dwelling unit. Because section 1954.52(a)(3)(A) applies to the Unit, Landlord
may impose rents beyond those allowed under the RSO. 
 
            The City contends that section
1954.52(a)(3)(A) does not apply to the Unit because, due to the commercial unit
at the property, the Unit is not separate from the title to any other unit on
the property. (See NCR Properties, LLC v. City of Berkeley (2023) 89
Cal.App.5th 39, 47 [describing exemption under subdivision (a)(3)(A) as
“complex,” but observing that it “generally includes single-family homes and
condominiums, which are both separately alienable property interests”].) The
City’s contention ignores the language of subdivision (a)(3)(A) of section
1954.52. Under subdivision (a)(3)(A), a local governmental entity cannot impose
rent control if the dwelling or unit at issue “is alienable separate from the
title to any other dwelling unit.” (Civ. Code § 1954.52(a)(3)(A),
emphasis added.) The unit from which the dwelling or unit must be separately
alienable must be a “dwelling unit,” not a dwelling or unit. 
 
            The City is correct that neither
“dwelling” nor “unit” is defined in the Act. (Opp. at 6:8-9.) However, the
Court construes the words “dwelling unit” in the context of the statute. (Wells
v. One2One Learning Foundation (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1164, 1190.) Section
1954.52(a)(3)(A) sets forth an exemption to local rent control in favor of
owners of “residential real property.” The Act defines “residential real
property” as “any dwelling or unit that is intended for human habitation.” (Civ.
Code § 1954.51(e).) Because subdivision (a)(3)(A) governs rental rates that can
be imposed for units intended for human habitation, the Court interprets “dwelling
unit” in the subdivision to mean a unit intended for human habitation.[4]
It is undisputed that the Unit is the only habitable unit on the subject
property. (AR 16.) The only other unit on the property is for commercial
business. (AR 16.) As stated above, because there is no other dwelling unit on
the property, the Unit is separately alienable from the title to any other
dwelling unit. 
 
The
Court finds that the language of subdivision (a)(3)(A) is clear. Accordingly, the
Court does not resort to the statute’s legislative history to construe the
meaning of subdivision (a)(3)(A). (See Wells, 39 Cal.4th at 1190 [“If
the words themselves are not ambiguous, we presume the Legislature meant what
it said, and the statute’s plain meaning governs. On the other hand, if the
language allows more than one reasonable construction, we may look to such aids
as the legislative history of the measure….”].)[5]

 
The
City contends that this case is similar to Owens v. City of Oakland Housing,
Residential Rent and Relocation Board (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 739. In Owens,
the owner of a single-family home rented bedrooms in the residence to separate
tenants. (Owens, 49 Cal.App.5th at 741-42.) The owner contended that the
rented rooms were exempt from local rent control because all single-family
homes are exempt under the Act. (Id. at 744.) The Court of Appeal
disagreed, finding that the relevant question was “whether the ‘dwelling’ or
‘unit’ separately rented by [the tenant] and for which [the owner] claims the
right to establish the amount of rent, was itself separately alienable from the
title to any other dwelling or unit.” (Id. at 745.) Because the bedroom
rented by the tenant was not separately titled and could not be separately alienated
from the rest of the home, the Owens Court held that the Act did not
apply to the units rented by the owner. (Id. at 746.) 
 
            Owens has no application
here. The bedroom in Owens was not separately alienable because only
the residence was separately alienable. Thus, the bedroom was not “alienable
separate from the title to any other dwelling unit,” i.e., the other bedrooms contained in the residence.  Here, by contrast, the Unit is the only dwelling
unit at the property. Thus, the Unit is “alienable separate from the title to
any other dwelling unit.”[6]
 
            Lastly, the City contends that following
the plain meaning of subdivision (a)(3)(A) as argued by Landlord would lead to
absurd results. (Reply at 10:15-22.) Courts will not follow the plain meaning
of the statute when the manifest purpose of the legislation would be frustrated
as a whole or would lead to absurd results. (Owens, 49 Cal.App.5th at
744.) Here, the Act “generally prohibits public entities from applying rent
control laws to certain categories of dwellings….” (Hirschfield, 82
Cal.App.5th at 663.) The City provides no explanation why exempting a
residential unit that happens to be combined with a commercial unit would
frustrate the Legislature’s purpose of setting forth the dwellings to be exempt
from local rent control. Further, it is unclear how a combined
residential/commercial property is so different from a single-family home or a
condominium such that the statute’s explicit language should be disregarded. All
three types of dwellings constitute dwelling units separately alienable from
other dwelling units. 
 
In
short, other than contending that the Legislature intended the Act to apply just
to single-family homes and condominiums—a contention not entirely clear from
the Act or the legislative history (see fn. 5, supra)—the City
does not set forth how application of subdivision (a)(3)(A) to the Unit would
result in absurdity. Indeed, it may be perfectly reasonable (and certainly not
absurd) to allow rent control for Landlords who are able to collect rent from multiple
dwelling units in a single parcel but exempt from such economic restriction and
potential hardship Landlords renting a single dwelling unit on their property.
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the Court
finds that the Unit is exempt from the rent control provisions of the City’s
Rent Stabilization Ordinance. 
 
C.          
Laches
 
“Laches,
as a successful affirmative defense, requires a showing of the plaintiff's unreasonable
delay in filing suit, together with either the plaintiff's acquiescence in the
conduct about which it complains or prejudice resulting to the defendant
because of the delay. The proponent of the laches defense bears the burden of
establishing its application.” (Blaser v. State Teachers’ Retirement System (2022)
86 Cal.App.5th 507, 539.)
 
            In June 2022, petitioner notified
Tenant that the rent would increase by more than double. (AR 98-99 [HT
15:360-16:364].) The City argues that petitioner cannot seek rent in excess of
the rent allowed under the RSO after Tenant has lived in the Unit for a decade.
Petitioner, however, was not the landlord that registered the Unit with the
City under the RSO. (See AR 45-53 [landlord Richard Lewis registered
Unit with City].) The City does not establish that petitioner knew the Unit had
been registered as a rent-controlled unit before it purchased the combined
residential-commercial property. The City does not refer to anywhere in the
record indicating when petitioner became aware of the argument that the the
Unit was exempt from rent control under the RSO. Consequently, the City fails
to show that Landlord acquiesced to the Unit’s status or registration as a
rent-controlled unit. 
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the City’s
assertion of laches is unavailing. 
 
D.          
Unclean
Hands
 
“The
[unclean hands] rule is settled in California that whenever a party who, as
actor, seeks to set judicial machinery in motion and obtain some remedy,
has violated conscience, good faith or other equitable principle in his prior
conduct, then…the court will refuse to interfere on his behalf to acknowledge
his right, or to afford him any remedy.” (Pond v. Insurance Co. of North
America (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 280, 289-90, quoting Moriarty v.
Carlson (1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 51, 55, internal quotations omitted.)
 
            The City argues that Landlord cannot
seek an exemption from the RSO because it was aware that the Unit was subject
to the RSO. However, in support of Landlord’s purported awareness, the City
cites an email from Tenant to the Hearing Examiner “submit[ting] for
consideration that the new and current owners were made fully aware that my
unit was rent stabilized prior to entering into the arms length transaction to
purchase the building with tenants that are occupying the space under RSO
guidelines for over 10 years.” (AR 44.) Tenant did not provide any evidence for
his assertion. The fact that Tenant enjoyed the benefits of the RSO for a
decade does not render Landlord’s attempts to determine the applicability of
the RSO during the administrative hearing and through the instant writ petition
violative of conscience, good faith, or other equitable principles.  
 
For
the foregoing reasons, the City’s assertion that Landlord has unclean hands is
unavailing.
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is GRANTED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), petitioner shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed
judgment and proposed writ of mandate.
