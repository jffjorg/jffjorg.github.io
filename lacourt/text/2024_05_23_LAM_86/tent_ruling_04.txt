Plaintiff American
Business Bank moves for a right to attach order against defendants D T S
Enterprise, Inc. and Leslie Dain Sorg in the amount of $789,535.74,
as well as a temporary protective order.[1]  Plaintiff American Business Bank moves for a
right to attach order against defendant D T S Builders Inc. in the amount of $483,089.35,
as well as a temporary protective order.
 
I.       Factual Background
 
            On December 28, 2020, plaintiff
American Business Bank entered into a Business Loan Agreement (“Loan
Agreement”) (Loan No. 7310022-1)
with defendant D T S Enterprise Inc. (“DTSE”) (Pyle Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. 1.) In
addition to loan disbursements, the Loan Agreement provided for extension of a
revolving line of credit. (Id. ¶¶ 4, 7 & Ex. 1.) The Loan Agreement
governed all loans and lines of credit issued by plaintiff and remained
effective until all loans have been paid in full. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 8, 9.)
 
On
December 28, 2020, plaintiff extended a line of credit to DTSE (Loan No. 7310022-3)
pursuant to the Loan Agreement in the amount of $500,000. (Id. ¶ 10.) As
a condition of the line of credit, DTSE executed a Promissory Note (“Note”) in
favor of plaintiff on December 28, 2020. (Id. ¶ 11 & Ex. 2.) 
 
            The funds disbursed pursuant to the
Loan Agreement were secured by collateral specified in a Collateral Security
Agreement executed by DTSE in favor of plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 12 & Ex.
3.) Defendants Leslie Dain Sorg and Ryan Thomas Isbell guarantied DTSE’s
performance under the Loan Agreement by executing Commercial Guaranties. (Id. ¶¶ 12, 13 & Exs. 3, 4.) 
 
            On
December 23, 2022, defendant D T S Builders Inc. (“DTSB”) executed a Commercial
Security Agreement in favor of plaintiff, securing repayment of Loan No. 7310022-1
in the amount of $488,576.05. (Id. ¶ 31
& Exs. 9, 13, 14.) 
            
            Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, DTSE
received loan disbursements and drew from the line of credit. (Id. ¶¶
15, 18 & Exs. 6, 8.) Outstanding unpaid balances in the amount of $479,089.35
for the loan disbursements and $305,446.39 for the line of credit, which totals
$784,535.74, remain due. (Id. ¶¶ 17, 20 & Ex. 7.)
 
II.      Applicable Law
 
            “Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply
pursuant to this article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment
by filing an application for the order and writ with the court in which the
action is brought.” (CCP § 484.010.) 
 
The application shall be executed under oath and
must include: (1) a statement showing that the attachment is sought to secure
the recovery on a claim upon which an attachment may be issued; (2) a statement
of the amount to be secured by the attachment; (3) a statement that the
attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim
upon which the attachment is based; (4) a statement that the applicant has no
information or belief that the claim is discharged or that the prosecution of the
action is stayed in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. section
101 et seq.); and (5) a description of the property to be attached under the
writ of attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is informed and believes
that such property is subject to attachment. (CCP § 484.020.)
 
            The
application for a writ of attachment must be supported “by an affidavit showing
that the plaintiff on the facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on
the claim upon which the attachment is based.” (CCP § 484.030.) 
 
The Court shall consider the showing made by the
parties, as well as the pleadings and other papers in the record. (CCP §
484.090(a), (d).) The Court shall issue a right to attach order if it finds all
of the following:
 
(1) The claim upon which the attachment is based is
one upon which an attachment may be issued.
 
(2) The plaintiff has established the probable
validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based.
 
(3) The attachment is not sought for a purpose
other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based.
 
(4) The amount to be secured by the attachment is
greater than zero.
 
(CCP § 484.090(a)(1-4).) 
 
            At
the times prescribed by CCP § 1005(b), the defendant must be served with a copy
of the summons and complaint, notice of application and hearing, and a copy of
the application and supporting affidavits. (CCP § 484.040.)
 
“The Attachment Law statutes are subject to strict
construction….” (Epstein v. Abrams (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.) 
 
III.     Analysis
 
1.    Notice
 
The
proofs of service attached to the moving papers indicates that service was
timely. 
 
2.   
Arbitration
 
Plaintiff
filed a motion to compel arbitration against all defendants, which was heard on
March 13, 2024, in Department 40 (Hon. Anne Richardson, presiding).[2]  Judge Richardson granted the motion to compel
arbitration as to defendants DTSE, DTSB, and Sorg and stayed this action as to
the Complaint against them.[3]  (3/13/24 Minute Order at 6.)
 
CCP
§ 1281.8(b) states in pertinent part (emphasis added):
 
A
party to an arbitration agreement may file in the court in the county in which
an arbitration proceeding is pending, or if an arbitration proceeding has not
commenced, in any proper court, an application for a provisional remedy in
connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the
award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual
without provisional relief. 
 
The
Court cannot grant an attachment if this showing has not been made. (California
Retail Portfolio Fund GMBH & Co. KG v. Hopkins Real Estate Group (2011)
193 Cal.App.4th 849, 856-57.)
 
In
California Retail Portfolio Fund, the Court of Appeal held “the apparent
insolvency of a party to an arbitration agreement, or other evidence showing
that the party was experiencing severe financial difficulties, is sufficient to
satisfy the ineffectual relief requirement.” (California Retail Portfolio
Fund, 193 Cal.App.4th at 857.) The California Retail Portfolio Fund court
concluded there was sufficient evidence of insolvency where the defendant’s CFO
wrote in an email that he was concerned about the defendant’s overall
liquidity, that there was a risk of defaulting on certain notes, that income
was down, that revenue was not covering overhead costs, and that assets would
need to immediately be sold off. (Id. at 860.) The California Retail
Portfolio Fund court reached this conclusion after relying on a federal
case, China National Metal Products Import/Export Co. v. Apex Digital Inc.
(C.D. Cal. 2001) 155 F.Supp.2d 1174, in which evidence of “the company's
unwillingness to pay its debts, threats by its customers for claims of
indemnification in the millions of dollars, and a statement from the company's
president that the company was having financial difficulties, thus making it
hard to meet its obligations,” was sufficient to satisfy the ineffectual relief
requirement. (Id. at 856.)
“The term ‘insolvency’ has two generally
accepted definitions: (1) where there is an excess of liabilities over assets;
and (2) where one is unable to meet his obligations as they mature in the
ordinary course of business.” (Id. at 859-60.) “[T]he inability to pay
damages is an alternative to insolvency” and can also satisfy section 1281.8. (Id.
at 862.)
 
            Here,
plaintiff has made a sufficient showing of ineffectual relief for purposes of CCP
§ 1281.8(b).  Plaintiff demonstrates that
defendants have not paid the amounts owed under the Loan Agreement and Note. (Pyle
Decl. ¶ 53.) While that showing, standing alone, might be insufficient, as the
mere failure to pay obligations is as consistent with an unwillingness to pay
as it is with an inability to pay.  Defendants,
however, have also failed to provide financial documents evidencing their
financial condition, which, under the circumstances, raises the inference of an
inability to pay and attempt to conceal such inability.  (Pyle Decl. ¶¶ 21, 22, 53.)  The insolvency and inability to pay is also
consistent defendants entering into forbearance agreements after initially failing
to make required payments to plaintiff. 
(Pyle Decl. ¶¶ 25-45.)
 
Accordingly,
plaintiff has made a sufficient showing of entitlement to provisional remedies
from this Court.
 
3.   
Basis of Attachment
 
“[A]n
attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each
of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount
of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than
five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney’s
fees.”  (CCP § 483.010(a).)  “An attachment may not be issued on a claim
which is secured by any interest in real property arising from agreement
….”  (CCP § 483.010(b).)  
 
            With
respect to DTSE, the amount sought to be attached is based on amounts due under
a written Loan Agreement and Note executed by DTSE in favor of plaintiff. (Pyle
Decl. ¶¶ 4, 11 & Exs. 1, 2.)
 
            With
respect to Sorg, the amount sought to be attached is based on their guaranties
that DTSE will pay all amounts due under the Loan Agreement. (Id. ¶¶ 13,
14 & Exs. 4, 5.) 


            With
respect to DTSB, the amount sought to be attached is based on its Commercial
Security Agreement securing Loan No. 7310022-1 with specified collateral. (Id.
¶ 31 & Ex. 9.) The Commercial Security Agreement executed by DTSB secured the
money owed by DTSE under the Loan Agreement and Note. (Ibid.) 
 
No
oppositions were filed. Accordingly, DTSE and Sorg do not dispute that the total
due under the Loan Agreement and Note is $784,535.74. (Id. ¶¶ 17, 20
& Ex. 7.) DTSB does not dispute that loan disbursements under Loan No. 7310022-1
total $479,089.35, which is secured by the collateral specified in the Commercial
Security Agreement. (Id. ¶ 17 & Ex. 7.) 
 
4.    Probable Validity of Plaintiff’s
Claims
 
“A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more
likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant
on that claim.” (CCP § 481.190.) “If the defendant opposes the
application, ‘the court must then consider the relative merits of the positions
of the respective parties and make a determination of the probable outcome of
the litigation.’ [Citations.]” (Pech v. Morgan (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th
841, 855.)
 
            With
respect to DTSE, both the Loan Agreement and Note require payment of funds disbursed
by plaintiff when due or otherwise be in default. (Pyle Decl. ¶¶ 22, 25 &
Ex. 1, 2.) Plaintiff has not received any payments due since May 1, 2023. (Id.
¶¶ 16, 19, 46 & Exs. 6, 8, 15, 16.) On November 15, 2023, pursuant to
the Loan Agreement, plaintiff has accelerated the amounts due under the Loan
Agreement and Note and declared them immediately payable and due. (Id.
¶¶ 48, 49 & Ex. 17.) A total of $784,535.74 remains due. (Id. ¶¶ 17,
20 & Ex. 7.) 
 
            With
respect to Sorg, she guaranteed DTSE’s performance under the Loan Agreement and
Note agreed to make payments on demand. (Id. ¶¶ 13, 14, 27, 29 &
Exs. 4, 5.) Despite demand, Sorg has not made any payments due under the Loan
Agreement and Note. (Id. ¶¶ 28, 30 & Exs. 15, 16.) 
 
            Accordingly,
plaintiff demonstrates the probable validity of its claim for breach of
contract against defendants DTSE and Sorg. (Compl. ¶¶ 35-42, 46-50
[DTSE], 73-75 [Sorg], 79-81 [Isbell].) 
 
            With
respect to DTSB, DTSB and DTSE agreed that the property specified in the
Commercial Security Agreement that they executed may serve as collateral to
secure amounts owed by DTSE under Loan No. 7310022-1. (Id. ¶ 31 &
Ex. 9.) DTSE has not paid the amounts due under the Loan Agreement and Note. (Id.
¶¶ 17, 20 & Ex. 7.) Accordingly, plaintiff demonstrates a probable validity
of being able to foreclose on the collateral. (Compl. ¶¶ 61-63.) 
 
5.   
Purpose and Amount of Attachment

 
The
other required findings under CCP § 484.090 are that the “attachment is not
sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the
attachment is based” and that the “amount to be secured by the attachment is
greater than zero.” (CCP § 484.090(a)(3), (a)(4).) 
 
Plaintiff
declares that “[a]ttachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery
on a claim upon which the attachment is based.” (Apps. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff also
declares that “the prejudgment writ of attachment is sought by ABB to collect
any and all collateral of the defendants and protect it pending the arbitration
hearing and award so as to allow the award and subsequent judgment to be
enforceable.” (Pyle Decls. ¶ 55.)
 
Plaintiff
also demonstrates that the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero, either $483,089.35 with respect to DTSB ($4,000 added to total
balance for estimated costs and attorney fees) or $789,535.74 for the other
defendants ($5,000 added to total balance for estimated costs and attorney
fees) remains due.[4]
(Id. ¶¶ 17, 20 & Ex. 7.)
 
6.   
Bankruptcy
 
CCP § 484.020(d) requires a “statement
that the applicant has no information or belief that the claim is discharged in
a proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy) or that the
prosecution of the action is stayed in a proceeding under Title 11 of the
United States Code (Bankruptcy).” Plaintiff provides this statement. (Apps. ¶ 5.)

 
7.   
Property Subject to Attachment
 
With
respect to DTSE and DTSB, CCP § 487.010(a) states that, where the defendant is
a corporation, all corporate property for which a method of levy is provided in
CCP § 488.300, et seq. is subject to attachment. Plaintiff
moves to attach any property of DTSE and DTSB. 
 
With
respect to Sorg, CCP § 487.010(c) lists categories of property subject to
attachment where the defendant is a natural person. The property listed in item
9(c) of the application as to Sorg is expressly subject to attachment under CCP
§ 487.010(c). 
 
8.   
Exemptions
 
No
claims of exemptions have been filed. 
 
9.   
Undertaking 
 
CCP
§ 489.210 requires the plaintiff to file an undertaking before issuance of a
writ of attachment. CCP § 489.220 provides, with exceptions, for an undertaking
in the amount of $10,000. Plaintiff does not address the proper amount of an
undertaking. The Court will order an undertaking in the amount of $10,000 as to
the writ of attachment for each defendant. 
 
10. Temporary
Protective Order
 
Plaintiff
also seeks a temporary protective order pursuant to CCP § 486.010, et seq.
If plaintiff is entitled to a right to attach order, a temporary protective
order may issue if plaintiffs “will suffer great or irreparable injury (within
the meaning of Section 485.010) if the temporary protective order is not
issued.” (CCP § 486.020.) 
Based on DTSE’s failure to pay amounts
due under the Loan Agreement and Note, plaintiff speculates that DTSE is
insolvent and the other defendants are attempting to “hide, distribute and
dissipate the assets of DTSE, and DTSB.” (Pyle Decl. ¶ 53.) This is merely
speculative. Considering that the amounts at issue in this action have not been
reduced to judgment, it would not be in the interest of justice to issue the
temporary protective orders as proposed. (CCP § 486.040.) Writs of attachment
sufficiently protect plaintiff’s interests. 
 
IV.     Conclusion
 
            With
respect to D T S Enterprise, Inc. and Leslie
Dain Sorg, the applications are granted in the amount of $789,535.74. Plaintiff American
Business Bank is ordered to post an undertaking for each of these defendants in
the amount of $10,000 before any writ shall issue.
 
With respect to D T S Builders Inc., the application is granted in the amount of $483,089.35.
Plaintiff American Business Bank is ordered to post an undertaking for this
defendant in the amount of $10,000 before any writ shall issue.
