Bonilla, et al. v. Jose L. Torres
Case
No. 23STCV23148
Demurrer
and Motion to Strike
Case
Management Conference
 
            Plaintiff
Isidro Bonilla (“Plaintiff”), an assignee of Elsie Pineda and Fortunato Sens
Arriaga, filed this action against Jose L. Torres (“Defendant”) for equitable
indemnity, implied indemnity, and declaratory relief.  Plaintiff alleges as follows:
 
Arriaga was in
the business of providing tour buses for various clubs and functions, and
Pineda was an unpaid volunteer for the Montecito Heights Seniors Club (the
“Seniors Club”).  In October 2017, the
Seniors Club scheduled a trip to Las Vegas, which required two buses.  The Seniors Club contracted with Arriage to
provide the buses, but he did not have any buses available for the trip, so he
subcontracted with Defendant.  Defendant
had only one bus available, so he subcontracted the other bus to a company
called CHR Tours, which was owned by Maria Lourdes Huizar and Carlos
Rivas.  Plaintiff was a passenger on the
bus driven by Rivas, and he was injured when disembarking the bus due to use of
an unsafe step. 
 
Defendant
demurs to the complaint.  “It is black
letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  In ruling on a demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[]” the
allegations of the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  “This rule of liberal construction means that
the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.) 
 
Defendant requests
that the Court take judicial notice of pleadings in Isidro Bonilla v. Red Star
Charter, Inc., Case Number 18STCV08868. 
The Court takes judicial notice of the existence and legal effect of the
pleadings, but not the truth of their factual contents, per Evidence Code
section 452(d).  
 
Defendant
argues that “Plaintiff’s newly fabricated allegations that attempt to implicate
Mr. Torres are 100 percent false.”  Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s pleadings in his prior case constitute “judicial
admissions.”  In his prior case,
Plaintiff alleged as follows: “Plaintiff arranged for the tour through
Defendant Pineda who in turn contracted with Defendants Red Star Charter, Inc.
and Arriaga dba Red Star Charter and Tours. 
Red Star Charter, Inc. and Arriaga in turn contracted with CHR/Huizar/Rivas
to provide the bus and driver.”  (Request
for Judicial Notice, Ex. #1, p. 3.) 
Defendant was added to the underlying case by way of Doe and Roe
amendments.  (See Defendant’s Memorandum
of Points & Authorities in Support of Demurrer, p. 2:8-10.)  Then, Elsie Pineda dismissed Defendant from the
cross-complaint on July 30, 2020.  (See
Request for Judicial Notice, Exh. #2.) 
Plaintiff dismissed Defendant from the complaint on August 21,
2020.  (See Request for Judicial Notice,
Exh. #3.)  Now, Plaintiff alleges that Pineda
subcontracted with Arriaga, who subcontracted with Defendant, who subcontracted
with CHR/Huizar/Rivas.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 7-14.)  Accordingly, Defendant demurs on this basis. 
 
There are two
problems with Defendant’s argument. 
First, admissions—i.e., Plaintiff’s allegations in the complaint in Case
Number 18STCV08868—are binding as judicial admissions only in the case in which
they were made.  (Minish v. Hanuman
Fellowship (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 437, 456.) 
A pleading from a prior case may only be offered in a different case as
an evidentiary admission.  (See Magnolia
Square Homeowners Assn. v. Safeco Ins. Co. (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1049, 1061.)  The Court cannot rely on an evidentiary
admission in sustaining a demurrer because there may be factual disputes: “[I]t
is always competent for the party against whom the pleading is offered to show that
the statements were inadvertently made or were not authorized by him or made
under mistake of fact.”  (Ibid.)  There is good reason for this law.  A complaint is a pleading prepared by the attorney
before discovery, which often clarifies the issues, and parties get dismissed
for countless reasons.  The Court is
baffled that Defendant’s counsel did not cite this case law in his motion or
address the issue—raised by Plaintiff’s opposition—in his reply brief.       
 
Second, the
instant case is a different case.  The
underlying case was Plaintiff’s direct claims. 
In the instant case, Plaintiff is prosecuting Pineda and Arriaga’s
claims against Defendant, and he provides a copy of the assignment.  The Court notes that Pineda dismissed her
cross-claims against Defendant with prejudice. 
(See Request for Judicial Notice, Exh. #3.)  Defendant may have an argument that Plaintiff’s
claims on Pineda’s behalf should be dismissed under the doctrine of retraxit.  However, Defendant does not raise the issue
in the motion, and that would not affect the claims prosecuted on behalf of
Arriaga anyway.  
 
Defendant also
argues that the claims are time-barred. 
Plaintiff’s claims for indemnity did not accrue until Plaintiff obtained
a judgment against Pineda and Arriaga.  (Preferred
Risk Mut. Ins. Co. v. Reiswig (1999) 21 Cal.4th 208, 213.)  Plaintiff attaches the judgment against both
assignees, which is dated February 13, 2023. 
This action was filed within the statute of limitations.  The Court has considered Defendant’s remaining
arguments and finds none to be persuasive. 
Therefore, the Court overrules the demurrer to the first and second
causes of action.
 
The Court sustains the demurrer to the
third cause of action, declaratory judgment. 
A declaratory relief action is inappropriate when a plaintiff has an
adequate remedy on other causes of action at trial.  (See Hood v.
Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 319, 324; California Ins. Guarantee Assn.
v. Superior Court (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1617, 1624.)  
 
            The declaratory relief statute
should not be used for the purpose of anticipating and determining an issue
which can be determined in the main action. 
The object of the statute is to afford a new form of relief where needed
and not to furnish a litigant with a second cause of action for the
determination of identical issues.
 
(General of America Ins. Co.
v. Lilly (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470.) 
In this case, the declaratory relief claim is duplicative of the
indemnity claims.  The Court has
discretion to decline to issue a declaratory judgment under these
circumstances.  (See AICCO, Inc. v.
Insurance Company of North America (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 579, 590.)  
 
            The
Court denies the motion to strike.  Defendant
seeks to strike individual factual allegations because they conflict with the
allegations in Case Number 18STCV08868.  The
Court has already addressed that issue.  
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the Court rules as follows:
 
            1.         The Court overrules the demurrer to the
first and second causes of action.
 
            2.         The Court sustains the demurrer to the third
cause of action without leave to amend.
 
            3.         The Court denies the motion to strike.
 
            4.         The Court sets the following dates for
trial:
 
                        Final Status Conference:        July 3, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.
 
                        Trial:                                       July 15, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. 
 
The parties shall file joint
trial documents on or before June 26, 2025. 
The parties shall disclose all witnesses they intend to call in their
respective cases-in-chief, and identify and produce all exhibits they intend to
introduce in their respective cases-in-chief, on or before June 26, 2025.
 
            5.         The parties shall post jury fees on or
before January 31, 2025.  Otherwise, the
parties shall waive jury. 
 
            6.         The parties shall comply with all
courtroom procedures for Department #39. 

  
7.         Defendant’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
