And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment/adjudication filed by the defendants, Gregory A. Yates and his practice. The plaintiff, Marvin Kay, is seeking to access sealed documents related to the Lime Grove settlement. The judge has previously bifurcated discovery to address the issue of whether the Lime Grove settlement falls within the scope of the referral agreement between the parties. The judge intends to only consider the defendants' motion with respect to the issues in Phase One, which includes whether Mr. Yates worked on the Lime Grove settlement, whether the settlement was part of his referral agreement with the plaintiff, and whether the referral agreement is valid. The judge has also noticed its own motion for reconsideration to determine whether it should vacate its previous order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings to Steve Vartazarian's practice on the conversion claim.
