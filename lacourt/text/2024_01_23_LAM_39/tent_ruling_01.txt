Zazueta v. Mi Pueblito San Juan Restaurant, et al.
Case
No. 20STCV33903
Plaintiff’s Motions
in Limine #2 & #3
 
            A.        Labeling of Exhibits
 
            Defendants
seek to introduce certain video recordings at trial.  The parties have been arguing over how the videos
should be titled.  While the jury will
not see the exhibit list, the jury may see the titles of the videos while Defendants’
counsel is opening the files to play the videos.  Therefore, on October 10, 2023, the Court ordered:
“[T]he parties shall not show the jury titles of video exhibits that are
argumentative” and “each video shall be titled with a basic description, e.g.,
video of plaintiff, video of restaurant, video of kitchen, etc., and a date.”  (See Court’s Order, dated October 10,
2023.)  Inexplicably, the parties are
still arguing over this issue.  Therefore,
the Court orders as follows: (1) Defendant’s counsel may describe the videos on
the exhibit list in any descriptive manner because the jury will not see the
exhibit list; and (2) The actual file name on the recording shall be “Exhibit”
and the number, i.e., “Exhibit #125,” “Exhibit #126,” etc.  
 
            B.        Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine #2 –
Granted in Part; Denied in Part 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks to exclude certain evidence at trial based upon late production, viz.,
“twelve new videos” that were produced on September 14, 2023.  (See Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine #2, p.
9:9-10.)  These videos are as follows:
 
            Exhibit
#110 – Video of Plaintiff allegedly stealing tips
            Exhibit
#111 – Video of Plaintiff allegedly kicking food supplies
            Exhibit
#114 – Video of Plaintiff allegedly making demands 
            Exhibit
#121 – Video of Neida Padilla deleting cash register entries 
            Exhibit
#125 – Video of Plaintiff speaking with Defendant
            Exhibit
#127 – Video of Plaintiff allegedly receiving money she asked Defendant to hold

            Exhibit
#128 – Video of Plaintiff allegedly allowing former employee into office 
            Exhibit
#129 – Video of Plaintiff allegedly allowing former employee into office 
            Exhibit
#130 – Video of Plaintiff allegedly at home 
            Exhibit
#132 – Video of Plaintiff allegedly asking to be fired 
            Exhibit
#133 – Video of Plaintiff allegedly cleaning with her boyfriend 
            Exhibit
#135 – Video relating to lost tickets
 
In Defendants’ opposition, they
“conceded the evidence produced after August 18, 2023 shall not be used in the
Defendant’s case-in-chief . . . .” 
(Defendants’ Brief in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine #2, p.
4:1-2.)  Therefore, the Court granted the
motion and ordered that “[s]uch evidence may only be used for impeachment
purposes or in any rebuttal case.”  (See
Court’s Minute Order, dated October 10, 2023.) 

 
            The
Court continued the motion with respect to the issue whether these videos
should be excluded for all purposes based upon alleged violations of Penal Code
section 632.  Section 632(d) states:
“Except as proof in an action or prosecution for violation of this section,
evidence obtained as a result of eavesdropping or recording a confidential
communication in violation of this section is not admissible in any judicia,
administrative, legislative, or other proceeding.”  (Pen. Code, § 632(d).)  As an initial matter, videos from the
surveillance cameras at the restaurant do not violate section 632.  (See Santa Ana Police Officers Assn. v. City
of Santa Ana (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 317, 325-326.)  Regardless, section 632 (d) does not prohibit
use of illegal recordings to impeach a witness making statements inconsistent
with those conversations.  (See Frio v.
Superior Court (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1480, 1496-1497; People v. Crow (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 440, 452.)  Nor does it
prohibit Defendant’s counsel from using the materials to refresh a witness’s
recollection (provided that the jury does not see or hear the videos).  (See Frio, supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p.
1496-1497.)  Therefore, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s motion under section 632(d).
 
            The
Court rules as follows with respect to Plaintiff’s counsel’s objections to use
of the videos under Evidence Code section 352: 
   
 
1.         Exhibit #110 – DENIED.  A video of Plaintiff allegedly stealing tips
is admissible for impeachment purposes.  To
the extent the video demonstrates dishonest conduct, it reflects upon
Plaintiff’s credibility as a witness.  However,
the Court will give a limiting instruction at the request of Plaintiff’s
counsel.  
 
            2.         Exhibit #111 – GRANTED.  A video of Plaintiff allegedly kicking food
supplies is not admissible.  There is
little, if any, probative value because Defendants’ defense is that Plaintiff
voluntarily left her employment, not that she was terminated for
vandalism.  The Court finds that any
probative value would be greatly outweighed by the prejudice under Evidence
Code section 352.  Therefore, this
evidence is excluded.
 
            3.         Exhibit #114 – DENIED.  A video of Plaintiff allegedly making demands
is admissible for impeachment purposes assuming Plaintiff denies having done
so.  The issue whether Plaintiff made
demands is part of the defense in this case and therefore the video has
probative value for impeachment purposes. 
The Court finds that any probative value would not be greatly outweighed
by the prejudice  under Evidence Code
section 352/  Therefore, this evidence is
excluded.
 
            4.         Exhibit #121 – GRANTED.  A video of someone else deleting cash
register appears not to relate to any issue in this case and therefore has no
probative value.  Any probative value is
greatly outweighed by the prejudice. 
Therefore, this evidence is excluded.
 
            5.         Exhibit #125 – DENIED for the same
reasons as Exhibit #114.
 
            6.         Exhibit #127 – DENIED for the same
reasons as Exhibit #114.
 
            7.         Exhibit #128 – GRANTED.  There is no probative value in inquiring
whether Plaintiff allowed a former employee into the back office and therefore
no impeachment value in this video. 
Defendant maintains that Plaintiff voluntarily resigned, not that she
was terminated for this alleged violation. 
Any probative value would be greatly outweighed by the prejudice under
Evidence Code section 352.  Therefore,
this evidence is excluded.
 
            8.         Exhibit #129 – GRANTED for the same
reasons as Exhibit #128.
 
            9.         Exhibit #130 – DENIED for the same
reasons as Exhibit #114.
 
            10.       Exhibit #132 – DENIED for the same
reasons as Exhibit #114.
 
            11.       Exhibit
#133 – The Court does not have sufficient information to rule on this issue.
 
            12.       Exhibit
#135 – The Court does not have sufficient information to rule on this
issue.  
 
            Plaintiff
also argues that Martin Padilla did not preserve videos following a
preservation letter, and Defendants allege that the video surveillance system only
maintains videos for two weeks.  This is
not a basis to exclude the videos.  There
is insufficient evidence that Defendants intentionally destroyed or failed to
preserve evidence.  Moreover, the nature
of the surveillance videos does not suggest that there would be some other
evidence to rebut them.  However,
Plaintiff’s counsel may inquire of Defendants concerning any failure to preserve
evidence, e.g., whether Martin Padilla was aware of the need to preserve videos
and whether he did so, etc.  Plaintiff’s
counsel may not ask Martin Padilla questions about his conversations with
counsel and efforts to gather/produce discovery, as those topics are privileged
and/or violative of Evidence Code section 352.
 
            Finally,
Plaintiff’s counsel argues that the videos are confusing and/or unintelligible.  This is an issue for the jury, as none of
these issues would justify exclusion under Evidence Code section 352.  Plaintiff’s counsel also argues that certain
videos are undated.  Presumably, Martin
Padilla (or whoever authenticates these videos) will provide a rough date/time
period.  Even if not, presumably,
Plaintiff’s counsel will argue these deficiencies to the jury.  This is an issue for the jury.
 
            C.        Additional Issues
 
            As
discussed, the following videos may be introduced for impeachment purposes: Exhibits
#110, #114, #125, #127, #130, and #132. 
Of these exhibits, Plaintiff’s counsel argues that Defendants’ counsel
replaced certain exhibits with a different version that was only recently
produced:
 
Exhibit #110 – The prior version is 11 seconds; the current
version is 32 seconds
 
Exhibit #114 – The prior version has been replaced by a pdf
showing “Plaintiff on multi-camera view”
 
Exhibit #130 – The prior version has been replaced by a pdf
showing “Zazueta and Padilla speaking”
 
Exhibit #132 – This exhibit is now Exhibit #133 and has been
relabeled “Zazueta and Padilla re: employment”
 
            The Court
will discuss these issues with the parties. 

 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel also complains that Exhibit #133 has been re-labeled Exhibit #134, and
Exhibit #134 has been re-labeled Exhibit #135 and is a pdf of an image of
Divina Barete that was never produced.  The
Court has not yet determined whether these exhibits will be admitted.
 
D.        Plaintiff’s
Motion in Limine #3 – Granted in Part; Denied in Part 
 
            Plaintiff
moves to preclude Defendant from calling Olga Perez Jiminez, one of Defendant’s
current or former employees, because she failed to appear at her deposition.  There appears to be no dispute that Ms.
Jiminez testified during a deposition on August 1, 2022; Plaintiff’s counsel
noticed her for a second deposition on August 29, 2023; and she failed to
appear at that deposition.  The Court had
authorized Plaintiff’s counsel to take a second deposition of Olga Perez
Jiminez.  
 
            As an
initial matter, Plaintiff’s motion is granted with respect to any hearsay
issues, i.e., other employees may not testify that Ms. Jiminez told them that Plaintiff
was stealing tips.  However, other
employees may testify that Plaintiff was stealing tips if based upon personal
knowledge, e.g., they saw her stealing tips.
 
            Tentative
Order #1
 
            With
respect to Plaintiff’s motion to preclude Defendants from calling Ms. Jiminez
as a witness, the Court cannot exclude witnesses absent a violation of a court
order or willful misconduct.  (See New
Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1422-1434;
see also Mitchell v. Superior Court (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 269, 272; Saxena
v. Goffney (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 316, 334.)  Plaintiff never sought to compel the
deposition after she failed to appear on August 29, 2023.  Therefore, there is no basis to exclude her
testimony for violating a court order. 
Nor can the Court conclude with certainty that Defendants engaged in
gamesmanship that facilitated Ms. Jiminez’s non-appearance.  Therefore, the motion is denied.  However, Plaintiff’s counsel is free to
cross-examine Martin Padilla and/or Olga Perez Jiminez concerning her alleged
termination from the restaurant and any communications Padilla had with her
concerning the deposition.  If Plaintiff’s
counsel develops a sufficient record, the Court will strike the testimony of
Jiminez or will give CACI 204.   
 
            Tentative
Order #2
 
            The
Court orders Defendants’ counsel to inform the Court and Plaintiff’s counsel as
soon as he or his client have made contact with Olga Perez Jiminez, at which
point the Court will order her deposition. 
If necessary, the Court will go dark one day during trial to accommodate
the deposition.
