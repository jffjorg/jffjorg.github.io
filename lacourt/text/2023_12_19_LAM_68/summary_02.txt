And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to strike the answer filed by Defendant El Zarape Cocina on Melrose, Inc. because the Defendant is not represented by counsel. The judge notes that California law prohibits corporations from representing themselves in court, and that the Defendant's answer is therefore void. The judge cites several cases to support this decision, including Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) and Thomas G. Ferruzzo v. Superior Court (1980). The judge grants the motion to strike the Defendant's answer, ordering it to be stricken.
