Petitions
            Petitioners
Nancy Sura and Moises Rafael Gomez have filed three petitions in this case for
the Court to approve the settlement compromises of Minors Arnold Ayala, Alden
Ayala, and Preciosa Gomez. This was a habitability case that was settled in
favor of Petitioners and Minors.
            The total
settlement amount was $305,350.00. Each of the three minors is getting
$22,750.00 from the Settlement. After attorney fees and court costs are
deducted, the Minors’ net settlement is $13,000.00 each. 
            It appears
that everything is in order to approve the Minors’ Compromise. The petitions
and proposed orders were filed on the MC-350 and MC-351 forms. The petitions
comply with CCP § 372; Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600-3613; and Cal. Rules of Court
Rules 3.1384, 7.101, 7.950-7.952.
            The Court
approves the Petitions to Confirm Minor’s Compromise filed on behalf of Arnold
Ayala, Alden Ayala, and Preciosa Gomez.
