And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Plaintiff Jose Vallerivas' motions to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production from Defendant CEVA Logistics LLC are denied. The motions were served late, and the judge lacks jurisdiction to hear them. The judge also denied Defendant's request for sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel.

The judge conditioned the denial of the motion to compel further responses to interrogatories on Plaintiff's payment of $60 in filing fees within 5 days of the order. The judge declined to award sanctions against Defendant, finding that the request was not supported by sufficient evidence.

The judge noted that combining multiple motions into a single filing is improper and manipulates the court's reservation system. The judge also emphasized the importance of complying with the 45-day notice requirement for serving and filing motions to compel further responses.

The judge's ruling is final unless any party submits a written request to modify it, which must be received by the court by 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
