//
Entitlement to
Fees
 
Plaintiff requests an award of
attorney’s fees as the prevailing party against the remaining Defendants—who
have defaulted—on claims under the Labor Code.  Labor Code section 218.5 authorizes an award
of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party in any action
brought “for the nonpayment of wages, fringe benefits, or health and welfare or
pension fund contributions.” (Labor Code. § 218.5.) Plaintiff brought
individual wage and hour claims under Labor Code sections 245 through 246.5, as
well as a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy rooted
in the same facts. (See generally FAC.) Plaintiff is therefore entitled to
reasonable attorney’s fees under Labor Code section 218.5 as the prevailing
party. 
 
Reasonableness of Fees
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel requests an award of $52,425 in attorney’s fees. 
 
Reasonable
attorney fees are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to the “lodestar”
method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134
Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)
In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the
“fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for
similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the
fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
 
The Court has broad discretion in determining the
amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned
absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or
necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)  The
Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258,
274-275.) 
 
            Here,
Plaintiff’s counsel requests an award for fees actually incurred in the amount
of $52,425, based on a total of 83.5 hours of work spent by the firm on this
case by four attorneys: 50 hours billed by Tielle Shu at $600 per hour, 4.5
hours by Vincent Granberry at $750 per hour, 22 hours by Danielle Montero at
$375 per hour, and 27 hours by Melanie Rodriguez at $400 per hour.  (Declaration of Tielle Shu ISO Mot. ¶ 49.)
All four attorneys attest to their training, experience, and hourly rates. (Shu
Decl. ¶ 36; Declaration of Danielle Montero ISO Mot. ¶¶ 2, 4; Declaration of
Vincent Granberry ISO Mot. ¶¶ 2-4; Declaration of Mielanie Rodriguez ISO Mot.¶¶
2-3.) Attorneys Shu and Rodriguez also provide itemized billing records showing
the tasks performed and the hours billed. (Shu Decl. Exh. 1., Rodriguez Decl.
Exh. 1.) Attorney Granberry does not provide itemized records, but states that
he performed 4.5 hours of work on “initial case review, initial demand [he]
drafted and sent to defendants, and reviewing this Motion for Attorney’s Fees.”
(Granberry Decl. ¶ 4.) Although Plaintiff states that Attorney Montero billed
22 hours of attorney time, no itemized record nor explanation of how those
hours were billed is included in the motion. Such an exhibit is referenced in
Attorney Montero’s Declaration at paragraph 6, but it was not included in the
papers. Without this evidence, the Court cannot approve the fee award in its
entirety. That said, since the absence of this exhibit appears to be an
inadvertent omission, the Court will permit Plaintiff to submit that evidence
as a supplemental filing before ruling on the fee request. 
 
Costs
 
            Plaintiff
also moves for an award of $4,157.37 in costs pursuant to the Memorandum of
Costs filed and served on May 29, 2024. Because the Court is permitting
supplemental briefing on the fee award, the Court declines to rule on the award
of costs at this time. However, the Court notes that there has been no
challenge to the Memorandum of Costs. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
For the reasons above, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees is CONTINUED to Friday, August 2, 2024 at 9:00 AM. 
 
            Plaintiff
is directed to serve and file any supplemental evidence supporting its request
for attorney’s fees by Friday, July 26, 2024. 
 
            Moving
party to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
