And here is the English text summary:

Judge Theresa M. Traber has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Diane Bradley, et al. v. Swagg Media, Inc., et al. (Case No. 20STCV32007). The case involves a breach of contract and fraud action, where the plaintiffs (Diane Bradley and DAB Promotions, LLC) seek to compel the judgment debtor, Craig Nobles, to comply with a subpoena duces tecum for financial records and for sanctions.

The judge denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel compliance with the subpoena duces tecum, citing that the plaintiffs failed to provide a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(b)(1) and did not provide sufficient documentation to support their claims. The judge also noted that the judgment debtor had already produced certain documents, but did not make a complete disclosure.

The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1(a), which allows the court to make an order directing compliance with a subpoena duces tecum, and California Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(b)(1), which requires a separate statement when a response is provided to a request for discovery. The judge also cited Terry v. SLICO (2009) and California Code of Civil Procedure section 2020.510(b) in her ruling.
