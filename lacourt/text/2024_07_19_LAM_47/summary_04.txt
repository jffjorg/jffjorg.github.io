The defendant has moved to dissolve a preliminary injunction that was entered on February 22, 2024, on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to post the required bond. The court has denied the motion on the condition that the plaintiffs serve and file an agreement authorizing the deposit to be applied to enforce the liability of the principal, within 10 days of this order. If the condition is not satisfied, the motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction will be granted.
