STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a breach of contract and fraud action. Plaintiffs allege that the
parties entered into a joint venture agreement in 2019 regarding the promotion
and production of an event called the Fall Ball All Star Event. Plaintiffs
contend that Defendants misrepresented that the event was scheduled for March
21, 2020, and that certain celebrities would appear.
 
Plaintiffs, as judgment creditors,
move to compel Judgment Debtor Craig Nobles to comply with a subpoena duces
tecum, and for sanctions. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiffs’
Motion to Compel Compliance with Subpoena Duces Tecum is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiffs, as judgment creditors,
move to compel Judgment Debtor Craig Nobles to comply with a subpoena duces
tecum, and for sanctions. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 1987.1(a) states, in relevant part:


If a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of books, documents, or other things before a court,
or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the
court, upon motion . . . may make an order . . .  directing compliance with it upon those terms
or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders. In
addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect
the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable
violations of the right of privacy of the person.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1987.1(a).) There is no
meet and confer requirement in section 1987.1. There is also no requirement for
a separate statement when no response has been provided to the request for
discovery. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(b)(1).) The moving party need not
show good cause for production of documents in connection with a deposition
subpoena. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2020.510(b); Terry v. SLICO (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 352, 358.)
 
Analysis
 
            Judgment
Creditors served Judgment Debtor Craig Nobles with a subpoena duces tecum for
financial records via personal service on October 22, 2023. (Declaration of
Robert S. Crowder ISO Mot. ¶¶ 2-3, Exhs. A-B.) Judgment Creditors state that
the Judgment Debtor produced certain documents but did not make a complete
disclosure. However, Judgment Creditors have not provided a Separate Statement,
as is required where there has been a response to a request for discovery. (See
Cal. Rules of Court 3.1345(b)(1).) In fact, Judgment Creditors do not provide
any indication of what has been produced and what has not been produced beyond
the arguments in their Memorandum of Points and Authorities, which are entirely
unsupported by documentary evidence or sworn statements by any individual with
personal knowledge. (See Motion p.8:10-20.) This is not a sufficient showing to
demonstrate what further compliance should be ordered by the Court. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance with Subpoena Duces Tecum is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
//
 
//
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
