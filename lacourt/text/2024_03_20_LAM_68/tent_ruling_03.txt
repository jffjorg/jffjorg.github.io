Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. A secont Three Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was

Warranty of Habitability (Violation of Civil Code § 1941.1), Breach of Warranty
of Habitability (Health & Safety Code § 17920.3), Breach of Warranty of

RULING: Denied.
Plaintiff Marc Bensemhoun moves to compel further responses
to special interrogatories (set one), numbers 1-72, 75-133, 139-141, 151, and
159-162. Defendant ROHCS Property Management Co. in opposition maintains the
motion is moot as the parties settled the instant action via a stipulated
unlawful detainer judgment. [Declaration of Benjamin Kiss, Ex. A.] ROHCS additionally
submits a separate statement in opposition reiterating the necessity of the
subject discovery given the settlement. Plaintiff in reply denies any
settlement agreement on the instant action; the agreement only applies to the
separate unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff selectively reiterates the basis
for discovery of certain items. 
 
The request was served on July 9, 2023; Responses were
served on August 24, 2023. [Declaration of Michael Yadegari.] The responses
consist of the following: 
 
“Responding party incorporates by reference each of his
general objections stated above. Responding party objects on the ground that
the Interrogatory seeks information neither relevant to the subject matter of
the action nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence and would subject Responding Party to oppression, harassment, and
undue burden and expense. Further, objects to the Interrogatory on the grounds
that the violates the Civil Discovery of 2004 in so much as it seeks information
that it is beyond the scope of permissible discovery. See also CCP section
2030.010. 
“Any investigation undertaken on behalf of the Defendant the
nature and scope of the investigation and the attendant work product, the
identity of any of my attorney’s agent(s) (prior to, if applicable, designation
as an expert witness pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2034) and the
identity of any individual (s) who may or may not have been contacted by my
attorneys or their agents is protected by privacy, work product and
attorney-client privileges as embodied in Article I, Section 1 of the California
Constitution, Code of Civil Procedure section 2018, Evidence Code section 950,
et seq, and case law including Soltani-Rastegar v. Superior Court (1989), 208
Cal. App3d 424, 256 Cal Rptr 255. 
“Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections,
responding party responds as follows: Defendant’s discovery and investigation
is ongoing and Defendant reserves his right to supplement, alter or change his
responses and/or objections to these requests.”
 
The motion lacks any separate statement, and otherwise only
offers a generalized statement regarding the lack of a good faith effort to
produce the information. (Cal. Rules Ct., rule 3.1345(a)(3), (c), (d).) The
court may proceed without a separate statement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (b)(3).)
 
The instant motion was filed on January 23, 2024, which is
more than 45 days from the August 24, 2023, date of service. The motion lacks
any proof of extension of the time to file the instant motion. The motion is
therefore untimely. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) The court denies
the motion on this basis.
 
Even if the court considers the motion on the merits, the
court cannot definitively determine the impacts of the settlement of the
unlawful detainer on the instant discovery. Plaintiff denies any impacts in
reply. The court declines to deny the motion on this basis. 
 
The court also declines to otherwise address each every of
the identified items—1-72, 75-133, 139-141, 151, and 159-162—for a
determination of the sufficiency of the responses simply based on the
conclusive argument regarding insufficient responses. 
 
Notwithstanding the procedural bar to the motion and partial
lack of cited, articulated support, the court finds the reliance on the
settlement agreement as a bar to responding to the current, remaining active
case constitutes a facially invalid response. Barring a showing of further
support, certain objections to items, seeking information such as the basis of
the answer, affirmative defenses, witnesses, lease terms, etc. may not withstand
future scrutiny. While the court cannot order further responses due to the
procedural bars on the motion, should these issues return to the court in a
different form, the court will consider imposing mandatory sanctions for
failure to respond. In addition to the possibility of sanctions, continued
multiple motions to compel further responses involving voluminous amounts of
items may also result in the setting of an OSC re: Appointment of Referee. The
court will not conduct any independent discovery conferences and orders the
parties to meet and confer.
 
Sanctions not rewarded in favor of
Plaintiff on the denied motion. The court also declines to impose sanctions in
favor of defendant in opposition. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.050, subd. (c), 2030.300,
subd. (a), (d).)
