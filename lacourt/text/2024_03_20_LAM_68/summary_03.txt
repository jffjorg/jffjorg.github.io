And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The motion was filed late, and the Judge finds that the Defendant's responses were sufficient. The Judge notes that the settlement agreement in the unlawful detainer action does not apply to the current case, and that the Plaintiff's claims of negligence, nuisance, and breach of contract are still pending. The Judge also declines to address each item on the list for sufficiency of responses, citing procedural bars. However, the Judge warns that future failure to respond may result in mandatory sanctions and sets a Case Management Conference for April 12, 2024.
