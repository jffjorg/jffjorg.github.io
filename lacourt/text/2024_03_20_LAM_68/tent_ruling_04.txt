agreed to a down payment of $18,000, with eight (8) monthly installments of
$17,875. Danco made the $18,000 down payment and six (6) installment payments.

RULING: Granted.
Defendant
Registrar of Contractors, Contractors State License Board (CSLB) moves for
leave to deposit the $27,500 contractors cash deposit with the court, and
discharge from the action. The motion is unopposed.
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 386 states in relevant part: 
 
A defendant, against
whom an action is pending upon a contract, or for specific personal property,
may, at any time before answer, upon affidavit that a person not a party to the
action makes against him, and without any collusion with him, a demand upon
such contract, or for such property, upon notice to such person and the adverse
party, apply to the court for an order to substitute such person in his place,
and discharge him from liability to either party, on his depositing in court
the amount claimed on the contract, or delivering the property or its value to
such person as the court may direct; ¿and the court may, in its discretion,
make the order; ¿or such defendant may file a verified cross-complaint in
interpleader, admitting that he has no interest in such amount or such property
claimed, or in a portion of such amount or such property and alleging that all
or such portion of the amount or property is demanded by parties to such action
or cross-action and apply to the court upon notice to such parties for an order
to deliver such property or portion thereof or its value to such person as the
court shall direct.  And whenever conflicting claims are or may be made upon a
person for or relating to personal property, or the performance of an
obligation, or any portion thereof, such person may bring an action against the
conflicting claimants to compel them to interplead and litigate their several
claims.  The order of substitution may be made and the action of interpleader
may be maintained, and the applicant or interpleading party be discharged from
liability to all or any of the conflicting claimants, although their titles or
claims have not a common origin, or are not identical but are adverse to and
independent of one another.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (a).)
 
A defendant who holds property to which a person or various
persons re assert claims, and where the defendant holds no interest other than
as stakeholder, the defendant may bring a motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 386. (Cantu v. Resolution Trust
Corp. (1992) 4 Cal. App. 4th 857, 875.) The moving party only need “file a
disclaimer relinquishing any purported claim to the stake.” (Ibid.) “Once the [party] admits liability and deposits the money with
the court, [the party] is discharged from liability and freed from the
obligation of participating in the litigation between the claimants.” (City of Morgan
Hill v. Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th
1114, 1122.)
 
Sunvalley Solar Tech, Inc. (Sunvalley) provided two cash deposits with the CSLB for a total of $27,500
($15,000 and $12,500), pursuant to Business and Professions Code section
7071.6. [Amended Declaration of Stephen Sventich.] The bond exists for the
benefit of persons harmed by a contractor’s actions. The contractors license of
Sunvalley was cancelled on May 31, 2023. 
 
CSLB moves for a court order in
order to allow disbursement instead of waiting for the statutory expiration
period. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7071.4; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 995.360, §
995.770.) The court finds no other basis of liability against CSLB, and
therefore grants the motion for deposit and discharge of all liability claims
on the bond. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (b).) Dismissal effective upon
deposit of the funds with the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.5.)
 
Defendant
CSLB to give notice.
