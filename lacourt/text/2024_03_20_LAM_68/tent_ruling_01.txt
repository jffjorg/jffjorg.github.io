Cause of Action: Negligence Per Se
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Javier Guerrero, a 17-year old with Down Syndrome at the relevant time of
school attendance, with defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD),
alleges the school district failed to ever provide any “formal assessment,” and
therefore never developed an Individualized Education Plan. 
 
On
February 20, 2019, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Unruh Civil Rights Act,
California Government Code section 11135, Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, Negligence, and Article I, Section 7(A) & Article IV, Section
16(A) of the California Constitution (19STCV06007). On March 11, 2019,
Plaintiff filed a preemptory challenge thereby leading to assignment to
Department 17. On August 27, 2019, the court found the later filed case was
related to a previously filed Petition on the Government Claim, 19STCV05995,
thereby leading to the assignment of all cases to Department 68.
 
On
October 16, 2019, the court sustained the demurrer of LAUSD to the later filed
case with 20 days leave to amend. The cases were subsequently removed to the Central
District Federal Court, where the federal claims were tried, and then the cases
were later transferred back to the LASC.
 
On
April 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for California Disabled
Persons Act, Cal. Civ. Code Section 54, et seq.; Violations of California
Education Code sections 200, 201, 220, 262.4, 56381; Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress; Violation of The Equal Protection Clause of the California
Constitution, Article I, Section 7(A) & Article IV Section 16(A);
Negligence; and, Negligence Per Se. On June 20, 2023, the court sustained the
demurrer to the entire first amended complaint without leave to amend. The
court entered judgment on July 5, 2023. 
 
On
September 13, 2023, the court entered an order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for
new trial, and sustaining the demurrer to the first amended complaint as to the
first, second, and third causes of action, and granting the motion to strike
the claim for attorney fees. On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a second
amended complaint for Violation of The Equal Protection Clause of the
California Constitution, Article I, Section 7(A) & Article IV Section 16(A);
42 U.S.C. section 1983 (Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment); Negligence;
and, Negligence Per Se. On November 14, 2023, pursuant to stipulation and order, Plaintiff filed
a third amended complaint for California Constitution, Article I, Section 7(A)
& Article IV Section 16(A); Negligence; and, Negligence Per Se.
 
Meanwhile,
on November 2, 2023, the court denied the petition for relief from the claim
filing requirement/leave to file a late claim. A notice of appeal was filed on
December 27, 2023.
 
RULING: Continued to
April 4, 2024, for Hearing on Demurrer
On
January 31, 2024, the court considered the demurrer of Los Angeles Unified
School District (LAUSD) to the Negligence Per Se cause of action in the third
amended complaint of plaintiff Javier Guerrero. The court inquired into any
potential impact from the pending appeal on the related case for petition for
relief from the claim filing requirements in 19STCV05995 following the
successful motion for new trial. Upon assuming the new assignment and the first
review of the action, the court was unable to determine whether the appeal
constituted a basis of stay for the scheduled demurrer, and requested
supplemental briefing. 
 
LAUSD maintains a position consistent with the
understanding of Plaintiff that the pending appeal on the related case
petition, 19STCV05995,
in no way impacts review of the subject action. The petition involves an issue
of “tenure” with a LAUSD school facility, while the subject action involves the
improper withholding of resources to a special needs student. LAUSD therefore
requests the court consider the demurrer to the third amended complaint. Plaintiff
in supplemental brief concurs with LAUSD.
 
The
court accepts the parties’ representation that the appeal on the order
regarding leave to file a late government claim on 19STCV05995 remains
decoupled from the adjudication of the negligence per se cause of action in the
lead case. The court will therefore hear the demurrer on April 4, 2023, as
previously reserved and scheduled. Again, the court deems the demurrer and
motion to strike fully briefed, and will not review any further briefs.
 
LAUSD to give notice.
