And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

On March 20, 2024, the court issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for a stakeholder deposit and discharge of stakeholder filed by the Registrar of Contractors. The motion is unopposed. The court finds that the Registrar of Contractors has no interest in the $27,500 contractors cash deposit and is seeking to deposit the funds with the court and discharge from liability.

The court also finds that CSLB has no other basis of liability against it and therefore grants the motion to allow disbursement of the bond instead of waiting for the statutory expiration period. Dismissal is effective upon deposit of the funds with the court.

The court's ruling is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 386, which allows a defendant to deposit a stake and be discharged from liability when there is no conflict between the parties and the stake is not disputed. The court has also considered the statutes and case law cited in the motion, including Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. and City of Morgan Hill v. Brown.
