  Case Number:  22STCV27553    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  26 The Court is inclined to grant Plaintiffs' ex parte applicaiton to continue the trial.  However, the Court notes that Plaintiffs in this action have reserved multiple hearing dates on the online Court Reservation System (CRS) for motions to compel further discovery responses to be heard on February 7, 2024, February 8, 2024, and February 15, 2024.  To date, moving papers have not been filed for some of the hearings reserved on CRS.  The parties’ reservation of unused hearing dates is exacerbating the congestion of the Court’s motion calendar. 
 
While waiting for the ex parte application to be called, the parties are ordered to meet and confer to attempt to resolve all pending discovery disputes. 
 
If the parties do not result all discovery disputes between them, the moving party should be prepared to address why this Court should not cancel unused CRS reservations within 10 days to make it possible for litigants in other actions to schedule hearings for their motions.
