properly redact personal identifying information is improper.  The California Rules of Court specify and require
that parties and their attorney’s must redact Social Security Numbers.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 1.201(a)(1), [“To
protect personal privacy and other legitimate interests, parties and their
attorneys must not include, or must redact where inclusion is necessary, the
following identifiers from all pleadings and other papers filed in the court's
public file, whether filed in paper or electronic form, unless otherwise
provided by law or ordered by the court: [¶] (1) Social security
numbers [¶] If an individual's social security number is
required in a pleading or other paper filed in the public file, only the last
four digits of that number may be used.”].)
