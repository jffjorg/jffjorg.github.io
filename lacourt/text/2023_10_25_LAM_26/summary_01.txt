And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is inclined to grant the Plaintiffs' ex parte application to continue the trial. However, the Judge notes that the Plaintiffs have reserved multiple hearing dates on the online Court Reservation System (CRS) for motions to compel further discovery responses, without filing moving papers for some of the hearings. This is causing congestion on the Court's motion calendar. The Judge orders the parties to meet and confer to attempt to resolve all pending discovery disputes. If the disputes are not resolved, the moving party must be prepared to address why this Court should not cancel unused CRS reservations, allowing other litigants to schedule hearings for their motions.
