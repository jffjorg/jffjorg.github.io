And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant CreditLink Corporation's motion to transfer the venue from Los Angeles County to San Diego County. The judge found that both Los Angeles County and San Diego County are proper venues under California Code of Civil Procedure section 395.5, as the alleged harm occurred in Los Angeles County and CreditLink Corporation has a principal place of business in San Diego County. The judge also found that Defendant CreditLink Corporation failed to show that the parties agreed to a choice of venue clause in a service agreement. The judge declined to award sanctions to Plaintiff Christina Development Corporation, as Defendant CreditLink Corporation did not act unreasonably or in bad faith in bringing the motion. The case management conference is continued to November 22, 2023, and Defendant CreditLink Corporation is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 10 days.
