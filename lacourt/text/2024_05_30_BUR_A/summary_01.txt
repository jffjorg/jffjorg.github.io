And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment and set aside the default. The motion was based on excusable neglect, which is defined as neglect that might have been the act or omission of a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances. The judge found that Defendant's failure to timely respond to the lawsuit was excusable neglect because Francis, the Responsible Managing Officer of Defendant, received the summons and complaint but forgot about it. The judge also found that Defendant exercised due diligence in discovering lawsuits filed against them and that Defendant promptly moved to set aside the default judgment once they were made aware of it. The judge noted that the six-month provision in Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) is a temporal restraint that allows for relief from default judgments. The judge also noted that the delay between the judgment and the motion to vacate was less than a month, which is not evidence of lack of diligence.
