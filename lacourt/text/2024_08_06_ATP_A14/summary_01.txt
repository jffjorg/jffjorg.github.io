```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Scott Carter, MD's Motion for Summary Judgment. The judge found that Carter has met his initial burden of proof for the First Cause of Action (Negligence) by presenting expert testimony that his treatment of Michael Balam was consistent with the standard of care. However, Carter did not address the Second Cause of Action (Loss of Consortium) and therefore did not meet his initial burden of proof for both causes of action. The judge also noted that the Plaintiffs' Opposition did not address the notice issue as to the Second Cause of Action nor provide arguments for the Second Cause of Action. As a result, summary judgment cannot be granted.
