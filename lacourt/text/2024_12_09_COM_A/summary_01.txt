Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The defendant had sought to have the plaintiff's claims terminated due to the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests, appear for deposition, and produce responsive documents. The court found that the defendant had been severely prejudiced in its ability to prepare its defense due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with its discovery obligations. However, the court did not find that the plaintiff's failure to comply with its discovery obligations was willful, as there was no credible evidence that the plaintiff was given notice of the court's orders. The court concluded that terminating sanctions were inappropriate under the circumstances and denied the defendant's motion.
