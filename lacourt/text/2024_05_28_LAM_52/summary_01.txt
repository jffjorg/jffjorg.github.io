And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgment and enter an amended judgment, including prejudgment interest. The plaintiff failed to serve the defendant with the motion and did not submit a proper proposed amended judgment. The plaintiff's proposed amended judgment was merely a table of figures from a spreadsheet, which does not meet the court's requirements. The judge has instructed the plaintiff to serve the defendant and file a renewed motion to amend the judgment, as well as a proposed amended judgment in the proper form, in order to proceed with the amendment.
