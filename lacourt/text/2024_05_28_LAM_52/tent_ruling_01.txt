  Case Number:  22STCV18057    Hearing Date:   May 28, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Danielle Schlichter’s Motion to Set Aside
Judgment
            Plaintiff Danielle Schlichter moves to set aside the
judgment and enter an amended judgment including prejudgment interest.  Plaintiff did not file any proof of service
of the motion on defendant The Skid Row Housing Trust.  Defendant is entitled to notice of the
motion.
            Plaintiff also did not submit a proper proposed amended
judgment.  Plaintiff’s proposed judgment
is merely a table of figures from a spreadsheet.  To obtain an amended judgment, plaintiff must
serve on defendant and file with the court (1) a renewed motion to amend the
judgment, and (2) a proposed amended judgment on Judicial Council Form JUD-100
with item 6.a(2)—the amount of prejudgment interest—filled out and with the amended
total in item 6.a(6).
            Plaintiff’s motion is denied without prejudice.
