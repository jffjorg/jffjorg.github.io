And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that defendants' motion to reopen discovery and compel a site inspection is granted. The defendants, Clan Co, Alison Wattles, Frank Wattles, and Marion Wattles, want to inspect the stairs at the subject property because they are alleged to be unsafe and the defendants refused to repair them. The defendants show minimal diligence in inspecting the stairs, but the judge finds good cause to reopen discovery solely for this purpose. The defendants will be allowed to inspect the stairs, and the parties must meet and confer to select a time and date for the site inspection.
