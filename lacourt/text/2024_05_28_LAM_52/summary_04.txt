The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The defendant's objections to the discovery requests are overruled, except for those based on attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. The defendant is ordered to serve further verified responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The court has also denied the defendant's motion to stay the action pending appeal, finding that the defendant cannot indefinitely delay its discovery obligations.
