  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT
  METRO’S DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT; 
 
DEFENDANT
  METRO’S MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT



 
Background
Plaintiff Jason Anderson
(“Plaintiff”) filed a “Complaint for Negligence” in this action on January 9,
2024 against Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(“Defendant”). 
Defendant demurred to
the Complaint. Defendant also moved to strike portions of the Complaint. Plaintiff
opposed both. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter, the Court notes that it issued an Order on June
7, 2024 continuing the hearing on the instant demurrer and motion to strike.
The Court’s June 7, 2024 Order provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“…Defendant’s counsel’s declaration in
support of the demurrer indicates, inter alia, that ‘[p]rior to
the filing of this Demurrer, Metro’s counsel sent a detailed correspondence
regarding this instant Demurrer. As of the date of the filing of Metro’s
demurrer, no agreement has been reached. Due to the responsive pleading
deadline, Metro was required to proceed with the instant Demurrer pending a
further meet and confer. If a stipulation or agreement is entered, the instant
Demurrer will immediately be taken off calendar.’ (Liu Decl., ¶ 2.) In
addition, Defendant’s counsel’s declaration in support of the motion to strike
provides, inter alia, that ‘[p]rior to the filing of this Motion,
Metro’s counsel made a good faith attempt to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s
counsel. As of the date of the filing of Metro’s Motion, no agreement has been
reached. Due to the responsive pleading deadline, Metro was required to proceed
with the instant Motion pending a further meet and confer. If a stipulation or
agreement is entered, the instant Motion will immediately be taken off
calendar.’ (Liu Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
The Court notes
that Defendant’s counsel’s declarations
do not demonstrate that the parties met and conferred in
person, by telephone, or by video conference, or that Defendant’s counsel attempted to do so.”
(June 7, 2024 Order at pp. 1:23-2:11.) 
The June 7, 2024 Order further provides that “Defendant is¿ordered
to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiff within 10 days of the date of this order.¿If
the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the parties are
otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Defendant is to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3) and Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5,
subdivision (a)(3) within
15 days of this order.¿” (June 7, 2024 Order at pp. 2:24-3:2.) 
The Court notes that Defendant has not filed any declaration setting
forth Defendant’s counsel’s efforts to meet and confer.¿¿   
Conclusion 
In light of the foregoing, Defendants’ demurrer and motion to strike
are taken off calendar.  
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.¿
