The judge notes that MAI's motion does not comply with California Rules of Court, specifically in terms of including a notice of motion and a memorandum in support of the motion. Additionally, MAI incorrectly stated the date of the complaint filing, which was actually March 7, 2019. The judge also notes that MAI acknowledged this mistake in its reply. The judge does not specify what order MAI is seeking, but notes that MAI does not dispute that the period of leave took place between September 2023 and the end of 2023.
