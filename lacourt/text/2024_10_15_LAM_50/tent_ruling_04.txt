[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:
 
VERIFIED
  APPLICATION OF SARAH CRAIG FOR ADMISSION PRO HAC VICE
 



 
Plaintiffs C&M Investment Group, Ltd. and
Karlin Holdings Limited Partnership (jointly, “Plaintiffs”) apply for an order
granting the verified Application of Sarah Craig of the law firm Kirkland &
Ellis LLP to appear as counsel pro hac vice on behalf of Plaintiffs. The
Application is unopposed.  
In the Court’s tentative for the hearing on
October 14, 2024, the Court noted that pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subdivision (d)(2), “[t]he application must
state:…(2) The courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice
and the dates of admission.” In her supporting declaration, Sarah Craig stated
that she is admitted to practice in “Illinois State Court (2017)” and “U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (2018).” (Craig Decl., ¶ 4.)
Although certain years were listed next to the subject courts, the dates of
admission were not specified. 
In addition, Ms. Craig stated that “I have
previously been admitted pro hac vice in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of California, Minnesota State Court, US District Court,
WDPA, US District Court, DUT, US District Court, DDE and US District Court,
EDVA. I have not filed any application to practice pro hac vice in these courts
that has been denied.” (Craig Decl., ¶ 6.) However, “[t]he application must
state:…(5) The title of each court and cause in which the applicant has
filed an application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this
state in the preceding two years, the date of each application, and whether or
not it was granted.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40,
subd. (d)(5).) Ms. Craig’s declaration did not specify the “[t]he title of
each…cause in which the applicant has filed an application to appear as
counsel pro hac vice in this state,” or “the date of each
application.” (Ibid.) 
The hearing was continued to this date and Ms.
Craig filed and served a supplemental corrected Declaration that complies with
the requirements. Consequently, the Court grants the application.
