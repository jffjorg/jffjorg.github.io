Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement, finding that the settlement between the Plaintiffs and Defendants was made in good faith. The judge considered the Tech-Bilt factors, including the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement amounts among plaintiffs, and the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendant. The judge found that the settlement amount of $44,000,000 is within the reasonable range of the settling defendant's proportional share of comparative liability for the plaintiff's injuries. The judge also noted that the settlement was reached in good faith as an arm's length transaction and that the party asserting the lack of good faith has the burden of proof on that issue. The judge's ruling bars any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution or partial or comparative indemnity based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.
