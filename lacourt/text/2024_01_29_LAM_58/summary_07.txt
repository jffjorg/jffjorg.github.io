Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to consolidate three habitability cases. The defendants, Nadlan 3100 Bellevue LLC and R&E Management, had sought to consolidate the cases, citing common questions of law and fact and the potential for unnecessary costs and delay. However, the judge found that the cases are not related and that each case involves separate and distinct issues, including different tenants, units, and evidence. The judge also cited procedural requirements and local rules that prohibit consolidation of cases not in the same department. As a result, the motion to consolidate is denied.
