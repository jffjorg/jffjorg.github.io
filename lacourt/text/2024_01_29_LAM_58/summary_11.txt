And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on the demurrers and motions to strike filed in this case. The demurrers were filed by the defendants, PM Andy's Liquor, Inc., Harbinder Singh, and Melissa Aurora Singh, against the cross-complaints filed by Jane Suong Tran-Bresler and Eric Nhan Tran.

The court has sustained the demurrers to the cross-complaints in their entirety, meaning that the cross-complaints have failed to state valid claims for relief. Specifically, the court has found that the cross-complaints fail to state a claim for breach of contract, fraud, and promissory estoppel. The court has also found that the cross-complaints fail to allege sufficient facts to support claims for declaratory relief.

The court has also granted the motions to strike as to punitive damages, meaning that the plaintiffs cannot seek punitive damages in this case. The court has ruled that the request for punitive damages is not supported by sufficient allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice.

The court has given the plaintiffs leave to amend their pleadings and has set a deadline of February 23, 2024, for the filing and service of amended pleadings. The court has also suggested that the plaintiffs file a single cross-complaint to simplify the litigation.
