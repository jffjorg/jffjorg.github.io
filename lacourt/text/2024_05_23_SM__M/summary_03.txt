And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the settlement between the plaintiff and Intext Design & Construction Inc. was made in good faith. The judge evaluated the settlement based on the Tech-Bilt factors, including the amount paid in settlement, the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, and the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants. The judge found that the settlement sum of $150,000.00 was reasonable and within the range of the defendant's potential liability. The judge also found that there was no evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed at injuring the interests of the non-settling defendants. Therefore, the motion for a good faith determination was granted.
