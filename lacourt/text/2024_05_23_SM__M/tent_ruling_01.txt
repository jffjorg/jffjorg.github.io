Legal
Standard
 
“Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16, subdivision (c), any SLAPP defendant who brings a successful
motion to strike is entitled to mandatory attorney fees. The fee-shifting
provision was apparently intended to discourage such strategic lawsuits against
public participation by imposing the litigation costs on the party seeking to
chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and
petition for the redress of grievances. The fee-shifting provision also
encourages private representation in SLAPP cases, including situations when a
SLAPP defendant is unable to afford fees or the lack of potential monetary
damages precludes a standard contingency fee arrangement.” (Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.)¿ 
 
“It is well established that
the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to
the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the
absence of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk v. Robledo
(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A]
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin
v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing
factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) Such an approach anchors
the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the
attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id.
at 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining the modification of the
lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) 
 
In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence.¿(Premier Medical Management Systems,
Inc. v. California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,
564.)¿General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice. (Ibid.) 

 
Analysis
 
Cross-Defendants 1239 23rd Street
Homeowners Association and Camila Arnold move for an award against
Cross-Complainant Denise Kurtzer. Cross-Defendants request $6,473.77 in
attorney's fees and $120 in costs incurred in connection with its successful
Special Motion to Strike and this motion. 
 
In opposition, Cross-Complainant
argues that their cross-complaint did not arise from a petitioning activity and
that the court cannot now rule on the mooted anti-SLAPP. The Court is not
ruling on the moted anti-SLAPP. Instead, it is ruling on a proper request for
attorneys’ fees in light of their successful anti-SLAPP motion, which caused
Cross-Complainant to dismiss the action prior to hearing on the motion. 
 
Moreover, Cross-Complainant’s cited
authority recognizes the Court’s jurisdiction to award costs and statutory
attorney fees following a dismissed SLAPP suit. (Law Offices of Andrew L,
Ellis v. Yang (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 869, 878-879; Catlin Ins. Co. v.
Danko Meredith Law Firm, Inc. (2022) 73 Cal.App.5th 764.) Here, the first
cause of action arose from protected petitioning activity within the meaning of
the anti-SLAPP statute. The first cause of action alleged that the HOA violated
Civil Code § 5930 by filing the underlying enforcement action in the Superior Court
without first making any attempt to resolve the dispute. (CC ¶¶ 10-12.)
Plaintiffs did not present any opposition, and therefore failed to show a
probability of success on the merits. Accordingly, attorneys’ fees are owed.
 
Cross-Defendants demonstrate that
they incurred a total of $6,473.77 in fees. Counsel charges $500.00 per hour.
Counsel provides verified invoices, reflecting professional services and costs
incurred in connection with the anti-SLAPP and attorneys’ fees motion. (Shapero
Decl., Ex. A.) The invoices evidence approximately 14.9 hours of attorney time
on the underlying motion. In light of the verified invoices, and with no
specific objections from Cross-Complainant regarding the reasonableness of the
fees incurred, the Court finds the fee request to be reasonable.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED
in the noticed amount of $6,473.77 in fees and $120.00 in costs.
