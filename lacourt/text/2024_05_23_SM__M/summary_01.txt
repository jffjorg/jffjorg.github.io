And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $6,473.77 and $120.00 in costs. The court finds that the fees incurred by Cross-Defendants are reasonable and necessary in connection with the anti-SLAPP motion and attorneys' fees motion. The court notes that the burden is on the challenging party to point to specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. The court concludes that the fee award is proper in light of the successful anti-SLAPP motion and the failure of Cross-Complainant to show a probability of success on the merits.
