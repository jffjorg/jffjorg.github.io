MOTION:                  Motion
to Determine Good Faith Settlement
HEARING DATE:   5/23/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
In an action in which it is alleged that two or more
parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a contract debt, a party to
that action may file a motion seeking a determination from the court that the
settlement between the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more alleged
tortfeasors or co-obligors was made in good faith. (CCP § 877.6(a).) The notice
of motion or application for good faith determination must list each party and
pleading or portion of pleading affected by the settlement and the date on
which the affected pleading was filed. (CRC Rule 3.1382.) 
 
The California Supreme Court in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v.
Woodward-Clyde & Assoc. (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, established the
standard for determining whether a settlement was made in good faith. Under Tech-Bilt,
the following factors are considered: (1) a rough approximation of plaintiff’s
total recovery and the settlor’s proportionate liability; (2) the amount paid
in settlement; (3) the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs; (4)
a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he
were found liable after a trial; (5) the financial conditions and insurance
policy limits of settling defendants; and (6) the existence of collusion,
fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of the non-settling
defendants. (Id. at 498-501.) Additionally, the evaluation must
be made based on the information available at the time of settlement. (Id.
at 599.) 
 
Where good faith is contested, the moving party must make a
sufficient showing of all the Tech-Bilt factors, which can be made in
the moving papers or in counter-declarations filed after the nonsettling
defendants have filed an opposition. (City of Grand Terrace v. Superior
Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261-62.) “Once there is a showing made
by the settlor of the settlement, the burden of proof on the issue of good
faith shifts to the non-settlor who asserts that the settlement was not made in
good faith.” (Id. at 1262; CCP § 877.6(d).) In other words, the
nonsettling defendant should demonstrate “that the settlement is so far ‘out of
the ballpark’ in relation to the [Tech-Bilt] factors as to be
inconsistent” with a settlement made in good faith. (Id. at 500.) 
 
However, where good faith is uncontested, a “barebones
motion which sets forth the ground of good faith, accompanied by a declaration
which sets forth a brief background of the case, is sufficient.” (City of
Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261 [holding
that when no one objects to a motion for good faith determination, a barebones
motion that sets forth the ground of good faith, accompanied by a declaration
that set forth a brief background of the case was sufficient in action where
motion only discussed two of the Tech-Bilt factors, settlement amount
and policy limits and declaration only gave a brief background of the case].) 
 
If the court makes a good faith determination, the court
may dismiss the settling party from comparative indemnity claims if the
settling party has made such a request at the time of making the good faith
motion. (CCP §§ 877, 877.6(c); CRC 3.1382.) 
   
ANALYSIS 
 
The instant motion is opposed. Therefore, the Cross-Defendant Hegoas
must make a sufficient showing of the Tech-Bilt factors. Hegoas
demonstrates that the proffered $150,000.00 settlement sum was made in good
faith under the Tech-Bilt analysis. Indeed, Intex’s own hypotheticals
show that the settlement sum is well within the reasonable range of Hegoas’s
potential liability. The parties both cite $654,922.19 as defendants’ potential
liability after trial. Hegoas’s offer of $150,000.00 is a substantial recovery
on this figure. The Court must recognize that the settlor should pay less in
settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial. Paying
$150,000.00 on a potential $650,000.00 liability is reasonable to avoid the
risks and costs of trial. Such a settlement is not so far “out of the ballpark”
in relation to the Tech-Bilt factors as to be inconsistent with a
settlement made in good faith. 
 
Furthermore, there is no evidence of any collusion, fraud, or
tortious conduct aimed at injuring the interests of the non-settling
defendants. The Court therefore finds the settlement was made in good faith.
(CCP § 877.6(a).) Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.
