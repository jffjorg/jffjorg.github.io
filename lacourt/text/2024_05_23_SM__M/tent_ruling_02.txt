CASE NO.:                24SMCV01815
MOTION:                  Motion
for Trial Preference
HEARING DATE:   5/23/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
36 provides in part, “[a] civil action to recover damages for wrongful death or
personal injury shall be entitled to preference upon the motion of any party to
the action who is under 14 years of age unless the court finds that the party
does not have a substantial interest in the case as a whole. . . .” (CCP, § 36(b).)
Priority is mandatory; the trial court has no discretion to refuse the minor's
request for early setting. (Peters v. Superior Court (1989) 212
Cal.App.3d 218, 223-224.) However, early trial setting may violate a
defendant's due process rights if there is inadequate time to prepare for
trial. (Id. at 227.)  Moreover,
the court has the general discretionary power to grant priority to any case
upon a showing of good cause, i.e. “that the interests of justice will be
served by granting this¿preference.” (CCP § 36(e).) 
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiffs
MSK (age 8) and AK (age 6), through their mother and appointed guardian ad
litem Sanaz Afsar, move for mandatory trial preference under CCP § 36(b).
Plaintiffs demonstrate that they are entitled to mandatory trial preference, as
they are minor children with a substantial interest in the case as a whole. Plaintiffs
suffered personal injuries as a result of the subject fire, including smoke
inhalation and emotional distress. (See Kashani Decl.) Accordingly, the unopposed
motion is GRANTED.  
 
The Court will set a trial date at
the hearing.
