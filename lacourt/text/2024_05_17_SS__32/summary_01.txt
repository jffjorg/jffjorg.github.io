And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff's counsel claims that he failed to serve verified responses to discovery due to a mistake caused by an email being directed to his "spam" folder and trial preparation. However, the court finds that the counsel's mistake was not excusable and that he failed to show diligent efforts in conducting discovery. The court also notes that the counsel failed to provide verified responses to the discovery underlying the terminating sanctions motion.
