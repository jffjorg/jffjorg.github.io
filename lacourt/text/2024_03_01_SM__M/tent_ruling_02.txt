Discovery Sanctions
 
If a party fails to obey a court
order compelling it to provide a discovery response, “the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction . . . In lieu of or in addition to
this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction . . ..” (CCP §§
2030.290(c), 2030.300(e), 2031.300(c), 2031.320(c).) Misuse of the discovery
process, which includes disobeying a court order to provide discovery, is
conduct subject to sanctions. (CCP § 2023.010(g).) Possible sanctions are:
 
(a) [A] monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process,
or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct….
 
[…]
 
(e) [A] contempt
sanction by an order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a
contempt of court.
 
(CCP § 2023.030, emphasis added.)
 
The party seeking to impose
sanctions need only show the failure to obey earlier discovery orders. (Puritan
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 877, 884 [interpreting
former statute dealing with “refusal” to comply].) However, numerous cases hold
that severe sanctions (i.e., terminating or evidentiary sanctions) for failure
to comply with a court order are allowed only where the failure was willful.
(See R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th
486, 495; Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) The burden of
proof then shifts to the party seeking to avoid sanctions to establish a
satisfactory excuse for his or her conduct. (Corns v. Miller (1986) 181
Cal.App.3d 195, 201; Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1227.)
 
Sanctions for Contempt
 
Contempt is any act, in or out of court,
“which tends to impede, embarrass or obstruct the court in the discharge of its
duties.” (In re Shortridge (1893) 99 Cal. 526,
532.) Particular acts constituting contempt are enumerated by statute,
including:¿ “(d)isobedience of any lawful ... order, or process of the court”;¿
“(d)isobedience of a subpoena duly served”; “refusing to ... answer as a witness”;¿
“(d)isorderly, contemptuous, or insolent behavior toward the judge while
holding the court, tending to interrupt the due course of ... trial.”  (CCP
§§ 1209(a), 1991; see Pen. Code, § 166
[misdemeanor].) In addition, courts have inherent power to punish acts
that interfere with the orderly conduct of proceedings. (CCP § 128(a)(3).) Any
person who commits a contemptuous act, including attorneys, may be punished for
contempt.  (Hallinan
v. Superior Court (1925) 74 Cal.App. 420, 426.)
 
Contempt
committed in the immediate view and presence of the Court may be punished
summarily, but contempt committed outside the Court’s presence requires an
affidavit presenting the facts constituting the contempt. (CCP § 1211(a).)
“When the contempt is not committed in the immediate view and presence of the
court, or of the judge at chambers, an affidavit shall be presented to the
court or judge of the facts constituting the contempt, or a statement of the
facts by the referees or arbitrators, or other judicial officers.” (Arthur
v. Superior Court (1965) 62 Cal.2d 404, 407-408.) The declaration need
only make a prima facie showing of the following elements: “(1) the
making of the order; (2) knowledge of the order; (3) ability of respondent to
render compliance; and (4) willful disobedience of the order.” (People v.
Superior Court (1965) 239 Cal.App.2d 99, 104.)
 
Civil contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature
because of the penalties which may be imposed. (In re Kreitman (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 750, 754; People v. Gonzalez (1996) 12 Cal.4th 804, 816.) The
contemnor may answer the charge by
counteraffidavits, declarations, or entirely orally at the hearing.  (CCP
§ 1217.) Thus, “guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.” (Ross
v. Sup. Ct. (1977) 19 Cal.3d 899, 913.) The punishment for contempt is
up to five days' imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $1,000 for each contempt.
(CCP § 1218(a).) 
 
Sanctions under CCP § 177.5
 
CCP section 177.5 provides the court authority to sanction
parties for violations of court orders as follows:
 
A judicial
officer shall have the power to impose reasonable money sanctions, not to
exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500), notwithstanding any other provision of
law, payable to the court, for any violation of a lawful court order by a
person, done without good cause or substantial justification.  This power
shall not apply to advocacy of counsel before the court.  For the purposes
of this section, the term “person” includes a witness, a party, a party’s
attorney, or both. Sanctions pursuant to this section shall not be imposed
except on notice contained in a party’s moving or responding papers; or on the
court’s own motion, after notice and opportunity to be heard.  An order
imposing sanctions shall be in writing and shall recite in detail the conduct
or circumstances justifying the order. 
 
(CCP§
177.5.) “The
imposition of monetary sanctions under section 177.5 ‘is within the discretion
of the trial court.’”  (People v. Ward (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1518,
1527 “‘That discretion must be exercised in a reasonable manner with one of the
statutorily authorized purposes in mind and must be guided by existing legal
standards as adapted to the current circumstances.’”  (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendants Kasra Mizban and Nasser
Mizban move for monetary and/or contempt sanctions against Plaintiff Gabriel
Sanchez. Specifically, Defendants request orders holding that Plaintiff and/or
Plaintiff’s counsel of record, Peter Hakim and/or Downtown LA Law Group, are:
 
1.    
to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,970.00
for Plaintiff’s failure to appear and/or submit to a mental examination with
Dr. Ari Kalechstein for the second time;
2.    
to be held in contempt of court for failing to comply
with the Court’s Order from April 25, 2023, when the Court ordered Plaintiff
and Plaintiff’s counsel of record to pay $705.00 in monetary sanctions to
Defendants’ counsel within 30 days;
3.    
to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,520.00
for the reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs related to having to bring this
motion for contempt sanctions pursuant to CCP § 1218(a); and
4.    
to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500.00,
payable to the Court pursuant to CCP §177.5.
 
            On May 31,
2023, the Court ordered that Plaintiff attend a second-session neuropsychological
examination to be conducted by Dr. Ari Kalechstein. On June 19, 2023,
Defendants served a notice of the Second Session of Independent Medical
Examination of Plaintiff, setting the date of the examination for August 25,
2023. (Kang Decl., ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. A.) The notice provided Dr. Kalechstein would
charge a no show/late cancellation fee of $2,970.00 to Plaintiff if Plaintiff
failed to appear. Plaintiff did not serve a response to the demand, or any
objection. (¶ 7.) Plaintiff failed to appear for the second session with Dr.
Kalechstein. (¶ 8.) Counsel met and conferred on the issue, but Plaintiff
refused to pay the full cancellation fee. (¶ 9.) The parties were unable to
agree to the amount that Plaintiff should pay for not appearing for the
examination for the second time. (¶ 10.)
 
Plaintiff argues that the request
for attorneys’ fees/costs is unreasonable, and the motion is moot. Plaintiff
asserts that the motion is moot because the second session of his exam with Dr.
Kalchstein is scheduled for March 25, 2024. (Hakim Decl., ¶ 4.) However, the
motion is not moot by the rescheduling of the exam. Plaintiff still failed to
appear at the exam as noticed, justifying sanctions. Plaintiff further contends
that the Court has already declined to assess the doctor’s nonappearance fee when
it denied sanctions as to the motion in May. However, this would not determine
the outcome here. Plaintiff’s further failure to appear justifies increased
sanctions, including the cancellation fee incurred by his conduct. 
 
Critically, Plaintiff does not
explain why he failed to appear at the exam or otherwise justify his
non-appearance. Plaintiff also does not contend that he should pay any cancellation
fee, but only that the $2,970.00 fee is unreasonable without any argument or
reasoning. Plaintiff needs to explain why such costs should not be shifted to
Plaintiff. Plaintiff failed to attend the noticed and court-ordered exam, wasting
counsel and Dr. Kalchstein’s time, and thereby incurring costs. Sanctions are
entirely appropriate to remedy the costs created by discovery abuse. 
 
Plaintiff’s refusal to appear and
pay the non-appearance fee caused Defendants to incur additional attorneys’
fees. Counsel for Defendants state that they have expended 12 hours meeting and
conferring on the nonappearance fees and sanctions, preparing the instant
motion, reviewing Plaintiff’s Opposition to the Motion, preparing the Reply
brief in response to Plaintiff’s Opposition, and preparing for and attending
the hearing of this Motion at a rate of $210.00 per hour, along with costs of
$60.00. (Kang Decl., ¶ 16.) Thus, Defendants request reimbursement of their attorneys’
fees and costs of $2,580.00. The Court finds much of the time claimed to be
unreasonable. Aside from the sanctions related to Plaintiff’s failure to attend
the noticed IME, the sanctions noticed by this motion are without merit. Plaintiff
presents evidence that the outstanding monetary sanctions have been paid. Thus,
the motion for contempt substantively fails. In any event, a contempt sanction
would not be appropriate sanction for the mere failure to pay monetary
sanctions. Such sanctions are a money judgment and are subject to the typical
statutory methods of collection of such judgments. Thus, the Court would not
issue an OSC re: contempt, and decline to issue sanctions per section CCP § 177.5.
Therefore, much of the time spent on this motion was not reasonably spent. The
Court is inclined to award a reasonable fee of $1,050.00, plus costs, for
having to bring this motion.
 
Accordingly, the motion for
monetary sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of 
$4,080.00 against Plaintiff and his counsel of record.  Sanctions are to be paid within 30 days.
