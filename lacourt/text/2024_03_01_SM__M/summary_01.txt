And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to add a judgment debtor, Alejandro Corral, to a judgment against Corral 360 Inc. The motion was filed by Emiliano Calemzuk, the plaintiff, who claims that Corral 360 is a shell corporation controlled by Alejandro Corral. The judge notes that Corral 360 is suspended by the Secretary of State and that Alejandro Corral is the sole officer, director, and agent of service of process for the corporation.

The judge concludes that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a unity of interest between Alejandro Corral and Corral 360 Inc. sufficient to warrant piercing the corporate veil. While the judge notes that there are some factors that might suggest a unity of interest, such as Alejandro Corral's control of the corporation, his promises to pay the judgment, and his payment of some of the judgment amount, the judge concludes that more evidence is needed to establish a unity of interest.

The judge also concludes that there is no evidence of an inequitable result if Corral 360 is treated as a separate entity. The judge notes that the plaintiff has attempted to collect against Corral 360 via post-judgment collection methods, but that Corral 360 has impeded the collection process by failing to appear and pay the judgment.

The judge denies the motion without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can refile the motion if it can present additional evidence to support its claims.
