Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sanchez v. Mizban, et al., granting the motion for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $4,080.00 against Plaintiff Gabriel Sanchez and his counsel of record. The sanctions are for the plaintiff's failure to appear and/or submit to a mental examination with Dr. Ari Kalechstein, as well as his failure to comply with a court order to pay monetary sanctions.

The court finds that the plaintiff's conduct constitutes discovery abuse and is subject to sanctions. The court awards a reasonable fee of $1,050.00, plus costs, for having to bring the motion.

The court declines to issue an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re: contempt, as the sanctions noticed by the motion are not appropriate for the mere failure to pay monetary sanctions. The court also declines to issue sanctions under CCP ยง177.5, as the motion is not substantively meritorious.

The plaintiff is ordered to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
