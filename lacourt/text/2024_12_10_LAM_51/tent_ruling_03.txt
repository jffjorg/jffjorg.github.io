The court has reviewed the documents submitted by Plaintiffs in support of this
motion even though Plaintiffsâ€™ filings well exceed the 15-page limit pursuant
to CRC 3.1113. The court exercised its discretion pursuant to the Judicial
Canons to ensure Plaintiffs received a full opportunity to be heard. (Cal. Code
Jud. Ethics, canon 3B(8).) However, the court need not exercise this discretion
in the future.
