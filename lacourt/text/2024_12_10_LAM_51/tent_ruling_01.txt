LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The court GRANTS S&F’s request for judicial notice.
 
Leave to Amend
 
California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 473,
subdivision (a)(1) provides, in relevant part: “The court may, in furtherance
of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any
pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by
correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect;
and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer.¿ The court
may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon
any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.”¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“This discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments,
for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same
lawsuit.”¿ (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court¿(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)¿ Ordinarily, the court
will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a
motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike are
premature.¿ The court, however, does have discretion to deny leave to amend
where a proposed amendment fails to state a valid cause of action as a matter
of law and the defect cannot be cured by further amendment.¿ (See¿California Casualty General Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court¿(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281 (overruled on other grounds
by¿Kransco¿v. American Empire Surplus
Lines Ins. Co.¿(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Under California Rules of Court Rule (CRC), rule 3.1324,
subdivision (a), a motion to amend a pleading shall (1) include a copy of the
proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are located;
and (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading,
if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional
allegations are located.¿¿  
 
Under
California Rule of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivision (b), a separate declaration
must accompany the motion and must specify (1) the effect of the amendment; (2)
why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to
the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request
for amendment was not made earlier.
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff contends leave to amend is warranted because
Plaintiff discovered specific facts supporting alter ego liability against
current and new defendants as well as supporting new theories of liability and
causes of action. Plaintiff further contends that there will be no prejudice to
Defendants. S&F argue Plaintiff’s request is flawed for several reasons,
including, it is an attempt to combine the two complaints from this and the
consolidated action and Plaintiff failed to explain why they delayed in requesting
this amendment.
 
Here, leave to amend is not warranted. First, the motion does
not include a redlined copy of the proposed amended pleading indicating the new
allegations and any deleted allegations. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) Second,
the attorney declaration in support is incomplete. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b).) It
does not include the effect of the proposed amendment or reasons why the
amendment was not sought sooner. The court declines to analyze prejudice to
Defendants at this time.
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for
leave to file a Second Amended Complaint without prejudice.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
