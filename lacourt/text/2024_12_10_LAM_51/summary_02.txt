And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge denies the Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the prior dismissal of their Complaint and denial of ADA Accommodations. The Plaintiffs had filed multiple amended complaints, and the Defendants had filed demurrers to the Second Amended Complaint, which were sustained with leave to amend. The Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration was filed almost a year after the Complaint was struck and the demurrers were sustained, and the Judge finds it untimely. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiffs appear to be seeking reconsideration of the denial of their accommodation requests from December 2023.
