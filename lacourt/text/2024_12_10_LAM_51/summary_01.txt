```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint without prejudice. The plaintiff sought to add new defendants and causes of action, alleging alter ego liability and new theories of liability. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that it was an attempt to combine the two complaints from this and the consolidated action and that the plaintiff failed to explain why they delayed in requesting the amendment.

The judge found that the motion was flawed because it did not include a redlined copy of the proposed amended pleading indicating the new allegations and any deleted allegations, and the attorney declaration in support was incomplete. The judge declined to analyze prejudice to the defendants at this time and instead denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to refile the motion if the defects are corrected.
