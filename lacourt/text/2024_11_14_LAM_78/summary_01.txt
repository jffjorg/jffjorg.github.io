The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant General Motors' motion to tax costs. The judge found that the costs claimed by the Plaintiffs were reasonable and necessary, and that Defendant had not met its burden to show that the costs were unnecessary or unreasonable. The judge specifically denied Defendant's attempts to tax costs related to jury fees, deposition costs, service of process, and other costs. The judge's ruling is based on California law and court rules, and is intended to be a tentative order that may be subject to change after the parties have had an opportunity to review and object to it.
