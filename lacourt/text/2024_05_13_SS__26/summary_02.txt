The Petitioner, Princess Cruise Lines, Ltd., filed a petition on January 8, 2024, seeking an order on the unlawful use of personal identifying information. The limited jurisdiction court lacks jurisdiction to issue the relief sought in the petition.

The Petitioner is ordered to pay the reclassification fee within 10 days. All hearing dates in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse are vacated.
