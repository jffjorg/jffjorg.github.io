And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion by Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (Plaintiff) for leave to file a first amended complaint. The original complaint alleges causes of action for breach of contract, open book account, account stated, and reasonable value related to Defendant's alleged failure to pay insurance premiums owed to Plaintiff's assignor, State Compensation Insurance Fund. The Plaintiff seeks to add treble damages to the prayer for damages based on Defendant's failure to complete a physical audit for the 2021 insurance policy. The judge finds that the Plaintiff's motion is supported by a declaration explaining what new evidence was discovered and why the amendment was not made earlier. The judge also finds that the motion complies with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. The judge grants the motion and orders the Plaintiff to file and serve the first amended complaint within 20 days of the order.
