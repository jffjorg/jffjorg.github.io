                                    (2) MOTION
TO INTERVENETENTATIVE RULING:

ANALYSIS:
 
On January 8, 2024, Petitioner Princess Cruise Lines, Ltd.
(“Petitioner”) filed the instant
“Petition Pursuant to Cal Civ Code 1798.201 for Order on Unlawful Use of
Personal Identifying Information.” The limited jurisdiction court lacks
jurisdiction to issue the relief sought in the Petition. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 85, 86.) 
 
Therefore,
the case is reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the
Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of fees and reassignment of the
case to an Independent Calendar Court. Petitioner is ordered to pay the
reclassification fee within ten (10) days.
