Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kevin C. Brazile in a case filed by Elias Garcia against American Group Contrax, AGX LLC, and DeAndre B. Wells. The plaintiff is seeking a default judgment for unpaid wages, minimum wage liquidated damages, wage statement penalties, waiting time penalties, civil penalties, and emotional distress damages. The court has denied the request without prejudice. The reasons for denial include: 1) lack of evidence to support the plaintiff's hourly wage claim, 2) improper reliance on Labor Code § 1194, 3) failure to show that the defendants prevented the plaintiff from disclosing the violation, 4) excessive damages claimed for emotional distress, and 5) lack of evidence to support the plaintiff's claim of lost wages.
