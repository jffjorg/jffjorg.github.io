And here is a summary of the English text:

The Judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Alfred Landegger and Alysha Zapata, who represent Moores Daycare Preparatory School Inc. (erroneously sued as "Moores Daycare Inc."). The movants seek to withdraw as counsel due to a breakdown in communication with the client, which has resulted in the deterioration of the attorney-client relationship. The Judge finds that the movants have complied with the mandatory requirements of California Rules of Professional Conduct and Court rules. The Judge notes that the fact that the corporate defendant will be without representation is not a basis for denial of the motion. The Judge cites a Court of Appeal decision that allows an attorney to withdraw from representing a corporate client without offending the rule against corporate self-representation. The Judge grants the motion and orders the movants to give notice.
