## English Summary

The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on PGG's Motion for Summary Judgment to December 19, 2023. This is because Orion's counsel, Adam Zaffos, provided a declaration outlining how further discovery will reveal essential facts needed to oppose the motion. The Judge found good cause for the continuance based on Orion's explanation and the importance of allowing for adequate discovery. 

The hearing was originally scheduled for October 4, 2023, but has been pushed back to allow Orion to complete its discovery responses and submit a supplemental opposition to the motion.
