Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff ODK Capital, LLC, a Utah limited
liability company filed a request for entry of default judgment against
Defendants 6C LLC, a limited liability company and Feng Li, an individual on August
17, 2023. Plaintiff requests a judgment of $32,256.41, consisting of (1) $30,350.88
in damages; (2) $605.00 in costs; and (4) $1,300.53 in attorneys’ fees. 
 
The Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s default
judgment package and the following items are sufficient for entry of default
judgment:
 
·       Plaintiff used the mandatory CIV-100 form. 
·       Item #2 of the CIV-100 form is properly filled
out with the amount of damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees being requested.
·       Item #7 of the CIV-100 form consists of
memorandum of costs that are allowable under CCP § 1033.5(a)(1). 
·       Item #8 of the CIV-100 form properly declares
the Defendant’s nonmilitary status. 
·       Plaintiff filed a proposed form of judgment
using the JUD-100 form.
·       Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal properly
dismissing DOES 1 through 10. 
·       Plaintiff filed a declaration from their
custodian of records with exhibits attached to support its request for damages.

·       Plaintiff filed a declaration from counsel of
record to support request for attorney fees in compliance with Local Rule
3.214. 
 
          However, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s
default package is deficient for the following reason:
 
·       Plaintiff did not file a brief summary of the
case identifying the parties and the nature of their claim as required under
Cal. Rules of Court (CRC), rule 3.1800(a)(1). 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff ODK Capital, LLC’s request
for entry of default judgment against Defendants 6C LLC, a limited liability
company and Feng Li, an individual is CONTINUED to October 16, 2023 at 8:30
a.m. to allow Plaintiff to file a summary of the case as required under CRC,
rule 3.1800(a)(1).
