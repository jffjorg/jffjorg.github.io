2. **Interest Rate:** The Plaintiff's proposed 18% interest rate was challenged on the mechanic's lien claim, as it may exceed legal limits.

The Judge has continued the hearing on the default judgment to November 15, 2023, requiring the Plaintiff to revise its proposed judgment and address these concerns.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's request for default judgment and has denied the request without prejudice. The court has continued the hearing on the request to November 15, 2023.

The plaintiff seeks to recover damages, interest, costs, and attorney fees from the defendants in the amount of $39,264.26, $4,162.40, $946.03, and $1,567.92, respectively. The plaintiff alleges that it furnished and delivered materials to Defendant Union, but Defendant Union failed to pay for the materials.

The court has identified several deficiencies in the plaintiff's request. First, the proposed judgment is duplicative and does not explain how the award is not duplicative. Second, the plaintiff has not provided a satisfactory explanation for the difference in its proposed rates of interest. The court is concerned that the 18% per annum interest rate is not enforceable as to the first cause of action, which is based on a mechanic's lien.

The court has ordered the plaintiff to submit a revised proposed judgment that is not duplicative and reflects legal interest rates. The court also requests that the plaintiff provide persuasive argument justifying the 18% per annum interest rate on the lien.
