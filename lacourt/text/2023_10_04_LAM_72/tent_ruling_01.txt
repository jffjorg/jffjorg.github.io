RULING ON MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 4, 2023
 Calendar
  Number:  1



 
 
Plaintiff Orion Precious Metals, Inc. (Orion) filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against defendant Halt Gold Group,
LLC dba Patriot Gold Group, LLC (PGG) on November 23, 2021 alleging causes of
action for: (1) false advertising under California Business and Professions
Code, Section 17500; (2) unfair competition pursuant to California Business and
Professions Code, Section 17200; (3) intentional interference with contractual
relations; and (4) intentional interference with prospective economic relations.
 
          On January 10, 2023, PGG moved for
summary judgment. On September 20, 2023, Orion opposed.
 
A party opposing
a motion for summary judgment may file a declaration to continue the motion on
opposition or by ex parte motion before
the opposition to the motion is due. (Code Civ. Proc., section 437c, subd. (h);
Ambrose v. Michelin North America, Inc. (2005) 134 CA4th 1350, 1353.)
The party must request the continuance through affidavits or declarations
stating facts to justify opposition may exist. (Code Civ. Proc., section 437c,
subd. (h).) “To be entitled to a continuance, the party opposing the motion for
summary judgment must show that its proposed discovery would have led to facts
essential to justify opposition.” (Scott v. CIBA Vision Corp. (1995) 38
CA4th 307, 325-326.) 
 
Where a
declaration fails to meet the above requirements, the court has discretion to
grant the continuance if it finds that the party requesting the continuance has
established good cause for it. (Lerma v. County of Orange (2004) 120
CA4th 709, 716.) Generally, courts exercise discretion in favor of continuances
because “the interests at stake are too high to sanction the denial of a
continuance without good reason.” (Frazee v. Seely (2002) 95 CA4th 627,
634, 115 CR2d 780, 784.) 
 
          The court ordered PGG to provide Orion
with further responses to two different sets of discovery on September 21,
2023, and October 3, 2023, respectively. Deadlines to comply with those orders
have not arrived as of the hearing of this motion.
 
          Orion’s counsel, Adam Zaffos, submitted
an eight-page declaration detailing the reasons why the proposed discovery will
lead to essential facts. Orion has established good cause for a continuance
 
          Based on Code of Civil Procedure
section 437, subdivisions (h) and (i), the Court CONTINUES the hearing on
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment to December 19, 2023, with Orion to
file a supplemental opposition, and PGG a reply, according to the ordinary
briefing schedule.
