And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted West Idaho, LLC's motion for summary judgment as to Zhang's cross-complaint. The court has determined that West Idaho has met its initial burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court has found that West Idaho did not engage in extreme or outrageous conduct, and that Zhang has not established a question of material fact regarding the intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, or conversion. The court has also found that West Idaho did not commit a forcible detainer, as Zhang voluntarily vacated the premises prior to West Idaho changing the locks.
