Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a Third Amended Complaint. The Plaintiffs are seeking to amend their complaint to substitute Fox Sports and Fox Corporation (Fox Corp.) in for Doe Defendants and add a fifth cause of action for failure to prevent discrimination.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs did not delay in filing their motion and that the addition of Fox Corp. and Fox Sports will not prejudice the Defendants. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs have shown that Fox Corp. may be liable as an "employer" and that the declaration supporting the amendment is sufficient.

The Judge sustains leave to amend for the additional cause of action and grants the Plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint. The Judge orders that the Plaintiffs give notice of the amendment.

The ruling addresses several issues, including the legal standard for allowing amendments, the timeliness of the motion, the potential prejudice to the Defendants, and the sufficiency of the supporting declaration. The Judge cites several California court cases to support their ruling.
