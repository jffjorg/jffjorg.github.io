The court has granted Defendant Bird Rides, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff Monique Reymond's claims. The court found that the parties have an arbitration agreement that covers Reymond's claims, which arose from her use and operation of a Bird scooter on September 2, 2022. The court noted that public policy favors arbitration as an efficient and less expensive means of resolving private disputes, and that the moving party bears the initial burden of showing the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. The court also found that the Bird Rental Agreement, which includes an arbitration clause, is valid and binding. The court has stayed the entire action pending the completion of the arbitration and has set a status conference for December 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
