And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nation v. Capital One (Case Number: 23SMCV01403). Capital One has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the complaint does not state a cause of action against them. The Judge agrees, finding that the complaint is vague and lacks jurisdiction. The Judge grants the motion, but offers leave to amend if the Plaintiff can provide facts supporting liability against the Defendant. The Plaintiff had alleged that Capital One's use of texting and lack of in-person service was negligent and led to the loss of "trillions of dollars monthly". However, the Judge found that the complaint does not state a cause of action and that the regulation cited by the Plaintiff only applies to Licensed Clinical Social Workers, not banks.
