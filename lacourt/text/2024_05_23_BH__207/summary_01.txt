And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22SMCV01121, a motion for summary adjudication filed by Plaintiffs Brittany Perrineau, Harold Perrineau, and Joon Productions, Inc. against Defendants Patrick McKenna, Leslie Gornik, Palisades Capital Fund 7, LLC, and others.

The Court denies summary adjudication on both Issues 1 and 2. Issue 1 pertains to whether the Defendants are liable on the 8th cause of action, and the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Defendants are alter egos of each other.

Issue 2 pertains to the outstanding amount owed on the promissory notes, and the Court finds errors with Plaintiffs' counsel's calculations regarding the balance due on both promissory notes. The Court also finds that the calculation of the interest accrual is incorrect.

The Court denies summary adjudication on both Issues 1 and 2, and Plaintiffs shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service.

The Court's decision is based on the following: the Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Defendants are alter egos of each other; the Plaintiffs' counsel's calculations regarding the balance due on both promissory notes are incorrect; and the calculation of the interest accrual is incorrect.
