BACKGROUND
 
On February 10, 2023, Plaintiffs Brittany Perrineau, Harold Perrineau,
and Joon Productions, Inc. (“Plaintiffs”) filed the operative second amended
complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants Patrick McKenna; Leslie Gornik; Palisades
Funding, Inc.; Palisades Capital Management LLC; Palisades Development Company,
Inc.; Pali Cap Management 9, LLC; Palisades Capital Fund 4, LLC; Palisades
Capital Fund 8, LLC; and Palisades Capital Fund 7, LLC (“Defendants”), alleging
eleven causes of action for (1) material misrepresentations and misleading
statements in the sale of a security; (2) sale of unqualified securities; (3) joint
and several liability pursuant to Corporations Code § 25504; (4) joint and
several liability pursuant to Corporations Code § 25504.1; (5) breach of
fiduciary duty; (6) violation of California Business and Professions Code §§
17200; (7) constructive fraud; (8) breach of written contract; (9) breach of written
contract; (10) common counts; and (11) declaratory relief.  
 
Plaintiffs now move for summary adjudication on the following issues:
 
Issue One: Plaintiffs are entitled to summary
adjudication on the 8th Cause of Action in the Second Amended Complaint because
the Undisputed Material Facts (“UMFs”) set forth in Plaintiffs Separate
Statement demonstrate, as a matter of law, that there is no defense to
Plaintiffs’ Second Cause of Action against Defendants for their failure to pay,
despite demand therefor, all amounts due under the two Promissory Notes held by
Plaintiffs in the principal sums of $75,000.00 and $150,000.00 (the “Notes”).
 
Issue Two: That as of the hearing date on the
instant Motion for Summary Adjudication on the 8th Cause of Action in the
Second Amended Complaint the total balance due on both Notes, after giving
credit for all payments made, is $366,375.00, plus attorney fees and costs of
collection, and that interest continues to accrue at the rate of $3,281.25 per
month until payment is made.
 
            Defendants oppose the motion and Plaintiffs
reply.

LEGAL STANDARDS – MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION
 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]
There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would
allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.”
¿(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850
(hereafter Aguilar).) ¿“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an
initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence
of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production,
he causes a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of
production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue of material fact.” ¿(Ibid.; Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474 [summary judgment standards held by Aguilar
apply to summary adjudication motions].)  
 
Further, “the trial court
may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose
version is more likely true.  Nor may the
trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of
credibility.”  (Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th. at p. 840 [cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department
of Transportation (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for
summary judgment or summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must
instead view it in the light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all
reasonable inferences in favor of that party”].)  
 
A party may move for
summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action, affirmative defenses,
claims for damages, or issues of duty if that party contends that there is no
merit to the cause of action, defense, or claim for damages, or if the party
contends that there is no duty owed.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).)  “A motion for summary adjudication shall be
granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative
defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”  (Ibid.)  A cause of action has no merit if: (1) one or
more elements of the cause of action cannot be separately established, even if
that element is separately pleaded, or (2) a defendant establishes an
affirmative defense to that cause of action. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (n); Union Bank v. Superior
Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 583.) 
Once the defendant has shown that a cause of action has no merit, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact
exists as to that cause of action.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (o)(2); Union Bank v. Superior Court, supra, 31 Cal.App.4th at p.
583.)  Additionally, in line with Aguilar,
“[o]n a motion for summary adjudication, the trial court has no discretion to
exercise.  If a triable issue of material fact exists as to the challenged
causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable issue of
fact, the motion must be granted.”  (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise Corp.
v. Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320.) 
 
DISCUSSION

 
1.     Issue
1: Defendants’ Liability on the 8th Cause of Action
 
Plaintiffs seek summary
adjudication of the eighth cause of action, on the grounds that two separate
promissory notes signed by Defendant Palisades Capital Fund 7 (“PCF7”),
for $75,000 and $150,000, were defaulted upon.
 
The promissory note for the $75,000 loan was effective June 27, 2019,
and provided for monthly payments of $1,041.67, representing only the 12.5%
annual interest on the loan for the nine months from the effective date to the
maturity date of May 1, 2020[1] when
the entire $75,000 principal balance would come due.  (Ex. 2 at sections 1.1-1.6.)  
 
The promissory note for the $150,000 loan was effective August 19,
2019, and provided for monthly payments of $1,500, representing only the 12.5%
annual interest on the loan from the effective date to the maturity date of May
1, 2020 when the entire $150,000 principal balance would come due.  (Ex. 5 at sections 1.1-1.6.)
 
Plaintiffs contend that Defendants paid the monthly interest-only
payments until April 2020, after which Defendants failed to make any additional
payments.  (UMF 10-11.)  The property was sold in October 2021 for
less than anticipated, after which Defendants paid Plaintiffs $24,000.  
 
Defendants argue that only PCF7 signed the promissory notes, and
although Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are alter egos of each other,
Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that they are alter egos, and in fact,
despite the notice of motion indicating Plaintiffs seek summary adjudication
against “Defendants” the body of the motion concedes, “However, for the
purposes of this Motion, Plaintiffs only seek an adjudication of the sums
Palisades Capital Fund 7, LLC owes Plaintiffs under the 8th Cause of Action in
the Second Amended Complaint.”  (Motion
at p. 7.)  
 
The Court agrees that Plaintiffs have not provided evidence
demonstrating that Defendants are alter egos of each other, and therefore
summary adjudication is not appropriate as to Issue 1.    
 
2.     Issue
2: Outstanding Amount Owed
 
As set forth above, the Court has sustained the evidentiary objections
advanced by Defendants regarding the Stein Declaration, paragraph 5, and
Exhibit 15 for insufficient foundation for the calculations regarding the
balance due under both promissory notes. 
 
Moreover, Defendants argue that the simple interest calculation
provided by Plaintiff’s counsel is inadmissible because counsel is not a
qualified expert to opine on the interest rate calculation damages.  Plaintiffs counter in reply that these are
simple interest calculations that do not require an expert, and Defendants have
not pointed out any errors in the calculation.
 
In determining whether Plaintiffs have set forth sufficient foundation
for the interest calculations, the Court first analyzed the appropriateness of
applying the $24,000 October 2021 payment to the outstanding interest balance
only, or whether applying some or all of it to the principal balance is
appropriate.
 
Both notes provide for a default interest rate of 17.5%, and a late
fee of 5% due for each payment not made by the 5th of each
month.  (Exs. 2 & 5 at section
2.1.)  Plaintiffs argue that, pursuant to
the terms of the promissory notes, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover the
default annual interest rate of 17.5%, from the maturity date, until the full
amount has been paid in full, plus a 5% late charge for every delinquent
payment, minus the $24,000 payment that was made in October 2021, which
Plaintiffs have deducted from the outstanding interest only, and not the
principal balance.  
            
            With regard to application of the
$24,000 payment, the promissory notes provide:
 
1.4  Application
of Payments.  If at any time Lender
receives, from Borrower or otherwise, any amount appliable to the Indebtedness
which is less than all amounts due and payable at such time, Lender may apply
the amount received to amounts then due and payable in any manner and in any
order determined by Lender in their discretion. 
Borrower agrees that neither Lender’s acceptance of a payment from
Borrower in an amount that is less than all amounts then due and payable nor
Lender’s application of such payment shall constitute or be deemed to
constitute either a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and satisfaction.
 
(Exs.
2 & 5 at section 1.4.)
 
As of October 1, 2021, the principal balances totaling $225,000
($75,000 + $150,000) were overdue by 18 months. 
Therefore, the 17.5% default interest due as of October 1, 2021 was
$59,062.50 (17.5% annual interest rate * 1.5 years * $225,000 outstanding
principal balance.)  As such, the $24,000
payment, applied to the outstanding interest first, did not reach any of the
outstanding principal balance. 
 
Therefore, the Court agrees that in general, it was proper for
Plaintiffs to deduct the $24,000 payment from the outstanding interest owed as
of October 1, 2021, it did not reduce the principal balance, and therefore the
interest is capable of being calculated by way of simple arithmetic.
 
Notwithstanding, the Court finds errors with Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
calculation.  In particular, counsel
treats each month after May 2020 as a day “payment is due” and enhances the
monthly default interest (calculated at an annual rate of 17.5, prorated
monthly), by an additional 5% each month. 

 
The promissory notes provide:
 
(b) Late Payment Fee.  Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that
Lender will incur additional costs in connection with the processing of any
payment that is not paid when due (including the payment of all outstanding
Principal Balance and accrued interest on the Maturity Date) which additional
costs are difficult to ascertain. 
Borrower further agrees that a reasonable estimate of such costs and
expenses is five percent (5.0%) of the amount of the delinquent payment
(including the payment of all outstanding Principal Balance and interest on the
Maturity Date) which fee shall become due and payable on the fifth (5th)
calendar day after a payment is due.
 
(Exs.
2 & 5 at section 2.1.)
 
Therefore, by the terms of the notes, the full payment of the loans were
due on May 1, 2020.  While Plaintiffs may
be entitled to a 5% late fee on the entire principal balance not paid as of May
1, 2020, there is nothing in the agreement providing that Plaintiffs may continue
to charge an additional 5% on the pro-rated 17.5% default interest rate each
month after May 2020 that the principal remains unpaid. In other words,
pursuant to the terms of the notes, May 1, 2020 was the last day a payment
became due, to which the 5% late fee provision may apply.
 
As such, the Court denies
summary adjudication as to Issue 2.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Because Issue 1 is drafted with respect to all Defendants, yet
Plaintiffs have provided no evidence demonstrating that Defendants are alter
egos of each other, and because the Court finds insufficient foundation for Plaintiff’s
counsel’s calculations regarding the balance due on both promissory notes, the
Court denies summary adjudication as to both Issues 1 and 2.  
 
Plaintiffs shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service.
