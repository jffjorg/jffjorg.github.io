Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is ruling on a motion for summary judgment brought by the City of Los Angeles, which is seeking to dismiss the claims brought by the Plaintiffs (Pink Selkin, Lodie Pollard, Luna Skyy Pollard, Donna Hill, and Jayden Devaughn Carter) arising from a fire that occurred on April 14, 2018, at 3779 Cahuenga Blvd, Studio City, California.

The Plaintiffs are alleging that the City failed to prevent the fire by not inspecting the property for building code violations. The City is arguing that it is immune from liability under Gov. Code ยง 818.6 for its failure to inspect the property.

The judge has concluded that the City is indeed immune from liability under Gov. Code ยง 818.6 and that its failure to inspect the property does not constitute a breach of a mandatory duty. The judge has further held that the City's actions were within the scope of its governmental immunity.

As a result, the City's motion for summary judgment is granted, and the Plaintiffs' claims are dismissed with prejudice.
