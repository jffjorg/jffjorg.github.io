And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions filed by the Defendant, Vermont City Lights LP, regarding expert designations, fees, and discovery. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs failed to include expert witness declarations for nine witnesses, which renders those witnesses unavailable for testimony at trial. The Court grants the Defendant's motion to exclude these improperly designated experts.

Regarding the motion to set expert fees, the Court denies it due to procedural defects, as the experts were not properly noticed of the motion. However, the Court notes that the fees appear to be excessive on their face.

The Court also denies the motion to extend time for expert discovery without prejudice, as the Defendant failed to provide any argument or analysis on this point.

In conclusion, the Court grants the Defendant's motion to exclude improperly designated experts and denies the motion to set expert fees and extend time for expert discovery without prejudice.
