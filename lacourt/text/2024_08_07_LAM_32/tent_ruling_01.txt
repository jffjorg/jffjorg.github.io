BACKGROUND
            On August 30, 2021, Plaintiffs Liana
Gabrielyan and Sona Simonyan filed this action against Defendants BMW of North
America, LLC (BMW NA) and Finchey Corporation of California, asserting two
causes of action under the Song-Beverly Act. BMW NA is the only remaining
Defendant. On February 28, 2022, this Court granted BMW NA’s motion to compel
arbitration. The parties thereafter initiated arbitration with JAMS, but subsequently
stipulated to return to court. 
            On April 17, 2024, BMW NA filed the
instant motion for summary judgment or adjudication in the alternative.
Plaintiffs’ filed their opposition on July 24, 2024. BMW NA filed its reply on
July 31, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
            Plaintiff’s objection is overruled. 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION
I. The Rodriguez Case 
The Court of
Appeal has held that the Song-Beverly Act’s definition of “new motor vehicle”
only applies to vehicles that have not previously been sold. (Rodriguez v.
FCA US, LLC
(2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209, 219-20,
review granted, 512 P.3d 654 (2022).) This may include “previously driven but
not previously sold vehicles, such as a demonstrator or loaner, where the
warranty was issued with the sale.” (Ibid.) But the court held that the provision does
not apply to “previously owned vehicles with a balance remaining on the
manufacturer's express warranty.” (Ibid.) The vehicle in Rodriguez was not covered
under the definition of “new motor vehicle” because it was purchased from a
used car dealership and had at least one prior consumer owner.  
            The
plaintiffs in Rodriguez had argued that a “new motor vehicle” includes any vehicle sold with a
balance remaining on the warranty because the definition includes “other motor
vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty.” (Rodriguez, supra, 77
Cal.App.5th at pp. 219-20.) The court rejected this construction based on the
context of the entire statute. (Ibid.) Specifically, the Act defines “new motor vehicle” to include “a
dealer-owned vehicle and demonstrator,” which is a narrow class of vehicles that
have been “used” in the literal sense but are “basically new” because they are
sold with the same manufacturer’s warranty that accompanies new cars. (Id. at p. 220.) The
court held that the catchall phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a
manufacturer's new car warranty” similarly refers to “vehicles that have never
been previously sold to a consumer and come with full express warranties.” (Ibid.) 
II. The Stiles
Case
            Recently,
the Court of Appeal in Stiles v. Kia
Motors America, Inc. (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 913, review granted, 2024
WL 3532507 addressed the same issue but reached the opposite conclusion. The
complaint in Stiles alleged that “[a]t the time Stiles purchased the car, some of Kia's
original warranties were still in effect, including the basic and drivetrain
warranties.” (Id. at p. 916.) The court held that this plainly constituted “a ‘motor
vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty’” and was therefore a “new
motor vehicle” within the definition of the Act. (Id. at p. 917.) The court disapproved of Rodriguez as “add[ing] words to the statute” because the statute “contains no
such limitation as vehicles that have never been previously sold to a consumer
and come with full express warranties.” (Id. at p. 919.)  
III. Plaintiffs’ Vehicle
On March 16,
2019, Plaintiffs leased a 2019 BMW X5 from the dealership Pacific BMW. (Def.’s
Undisputed Facts (UF) 1-2.) The lease identified the vehicle as “used” with
3,201 miles on the odometer. (UF 3.) The vehicle had been used as a loaner by
the dealer. (UF 4.) When the vehicle was initially sold to Pacific BMW on
December 19, 2018 (Plntf.’s Additional Facts (AF) 8), it came with a
manufacturer’s warranty for 50,000 miles or four years (UF 5-6). The warranty’s
effective date was December 19, 2018, and its expiration date was December 19,
2022. (Foote Decl., Ex. B (Leyva Depo.) 113:10-14; Ex. C (Vehicle Statement of
Facts); Ex. D (Warranty Vehicle Inquiry).) 
The warranty
states that “[c]overage begins on the date of first retail sale or the date the
vehicle is first placed into service as a sales demonstrator, Aftersales
Mobility Program (AMP) Vehicle or company vehicle, whichever is earlier.”
(Bravo Decl., Ex. B.) Here, the vehicle was placed into service as a company
vehicle before the first retail sale to Plaintiffs. (See UF 4.) When Plaintiffs
leased the vehicle in March 2019, the only warranty attached to the vehicle was
the balance of the manufacturer’s warranty. (Leyva Depo. 113:16-115:6.)
Plaintiffs were given a “Buyers Guide” informing them that “MANUFACTURER’S
WARRANTY STILL APPLIES. The manufacturer’s original warranty has not expired on
some components of the vehicle.” (Bravo Decl., Ex. A.) 
Plaintiffs do
not base their claims on any warranty other than the manufacturer’s warranty. Plaintiffs
argue that there is a triable issue over when the vehicle’s warranty actually
began, suggesting that the vehicle may have come with the full manufacturer’s
warranty when Plaintiffs leased it in March 2019. However, the facts establish
that the warranty began on December 19, 2018—when Pacific BMW first purchased
the vehicle and before Plaintiffs purchased it—and expired on December 19, 2022
or at 50,000 miles. The evidence cited by Plaintiffs does not raise a material
dispute on this issue, i.e., does not raise an inference that the warranty began at any time other
than December 19, 2018, when it was put into service by Pacific BMW as a
company vehicle. 
Under the
“Warranties” section of the lease, it states that “[i]f the Vehicle is new, the
Vehicle is subject to the standard manufacturer's new vehicle warranty.” (Foote
Decl., Ex. A, § 16.) Below that, there is a selectable option stating: “Remainder
of the standard manufacturer's new vehicle warranty if the Vehicle is not a new
vehicle.” The box for that option is unchecked. (Ibid.) This reveals nothing about when the warranty began running and does
not refute BMW NA’s evidence that the warranty began on December 19, 2018.   
The Vehicle
Statement of Facts confirmed that the manufacturer warranty would expire on
December 19, 2022 or at 50,000 miles. (Foote Decl., Ex. C.) The Buyer’s Guide
confirmed that at the time of Plaintiffs’ purchase, “[t]he manufacturer’s
original warranty ha[d] not expired on some components of the vehicle.” (Bravo
Decl., Ex. A.) This also does not refute the start date of the warranty and
merely confirms that the expiration date was December 19, 2022 and that at the
time of Plaintiffs’ purchase, at least some portion of the warranty had not yet
expired. This is consistent with BMW NA’s evidence that the manufacturer’s
warranty began on December 19, 2018 and expired on December 19, 2022 or at
50,000 miles. 
Thus,
Plaintiffs leased the vehicle in March 2019 with at most a balance on the
manufacturer’s warranty. 
 
 
IV. Stay
The viability
of a Song-Beverly claim under these circumstances depends on the Supreme
Court’s review of Rodriguez. Stiles has also been placed under review pending the resolution of Rodriguez. (Stiles v. Kia Motors America (Cal., July 24, 2024, No. S285433) 2024 WL 3532507, at *1.) Because
the facts are undisputed, the only dispositive issue is the one under review by
the Supreme Court. Therefore, a stay is warranted to avoid duplication or
unnecessary litigation. (See Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489 [courts have “the inherent power to stay proceedings in
the interests of justice and to promote judicial efficiency”].)[1]    
CONCLUSION
The Court
hereby stays the case in its entirety.   
      
BMW NA’s motion
for summary judgment is continued to February 7, 2025. The current trial date
of October 29, 2024 is vacated. Trial Setting Conference is set for February 7,
2025.
