 Case Number:  23NWCV01753    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  C Moran v. Carrasco, et al.
 
Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application for an Injunction
Restraining Defendant Angela Carrasco from pursuing her Unlawful Detainer
actions against Plaintiff Charles Moran, 23NWUD01936, and Luis Mata,
23NWUD01923, is GRANTED. “Where there exists two or more actions involving the
same subject matter or the same facts or principles, restraint is necessary to
prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings. [Citation.] Restraint is also
necessary to avoid unseemly conflict between courts that might arise if they
were free to make contradictory decisions relating to the same controversy.” (Rynsburger
v. Dairymen's Fertilizer Coop, Inc. (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 269, 279, citing Scott
v. Industrial Acc. Commission (1956) 46 Cal.2d 76, 81-82; see also CCP §
526(a)(6).) Here, Plaintiff filed a Complaint on June 8, 2023 for quiet title
of the real property commonly known as 13647 Busby Drive, Whittier 90605.
Defendant’s Unlawful Detainer Actions filed on September 15, 2023 seek
possession of the same property. The eviction action should be stayed pending
the resolution of the action challenging title. (Asuncion v. Superior Court
(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 141, 146.) A bond is required to obtain such injunction.
(Id. at 147.) Thus, to prevent multiplicity of judgments, Plaintiff is
enjoined from proceeding with her unlawful detainer actions until this action
for Quiet Title has resolved. Plaintiff is to post bond in the amount of
$38,400.00 within 14 days of this Order. Plaintiff to give NOTICE.
