And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application for an Injunction, restraining the Defendant from pursuing her Unlawful Detainer actions against the Plaintiff and another party. The Judge finds that there is a need to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings and avoid unseemly conflict between courts, as the same subject matter or facts are involved in multiple actions. The Plaintiff had filed a Complaint for quiet title of a real property, while the Defendant filed Unlawful Detainer Actions seeking possession of the same property. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to post a bond in the amount of $38,400.00 within 14 days to obtain the injunction, and requires the Plaintiff to give notice. The Judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 526(a)(6) and relevant case law, including Rynsburger v. Dairymen's Fertilizer Coop, Inc. (1968), Scott v. Industrial Acc. Commission (1956), and Asuncion v. Superior Court (1980).
