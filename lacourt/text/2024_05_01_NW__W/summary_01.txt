And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a contractual fraud action filed by Osvaldo Martignoni and Claudia Martignoni against Arash Majlessi and others. The Plaintiffs seek to add a new cause of action for negligence against Bank of Hope. The court has reviewed the motion and finds that it is procedurally and substantively defective. The court has continued the motion for the Plaintiff to comply with the rules of court, specifically California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. The court notes that the Plaintiff failed to submit a declaration and copy of the proposed amendment, as required by the rule. The court also finds that the Plaintiff's motion prejudices the defendant, Bank of Hope, by not allowing them to determine whether the Plaintiff is alleging a special relationship beyond the scope of the borrower-lender relationship.
