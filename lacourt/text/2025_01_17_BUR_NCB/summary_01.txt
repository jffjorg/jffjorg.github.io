And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Thelma Rosas as the plaintiff and Target Corp. and others as the defendants. The defendants had served discovery requests on June 14, 2024, but the plaintiff failed to respond by October 2, 2024. The defendants granted extensions to October 7, 2024 and then October 11, 2024, but still received no responses. The defendants then filed motions to compel discovery responses and requested sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel. The judge granted the motions to compel and ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days. The judge also granted the sanctions request, but reduced the amount from $1,086.65 to $820. The plaintiff and her counsel are jointly and severally ordered to pay the monetary sanctions of $1,004.95 to the defendants within 20 days.
