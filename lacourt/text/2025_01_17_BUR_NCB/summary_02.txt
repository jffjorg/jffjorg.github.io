And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling is in response to IKEA's motion to compel Plaintiff Nancy Ruiz's responses to its Requests for Production of Documents and to deem IKEA's Requests for Admission. The Plaintiff failed to provide responses to the discovery requests, despite multiple extensions and attempts by IKEA to meet and confer. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's objections are not specific and are not justified, and therefore grants IKEA's motions. The Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified, further code compliant responses to the Requests for Production of Documents and Requests for Admission within 20 days of notice of this order.
