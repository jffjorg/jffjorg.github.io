  No.: 24BBCV00107
 
  Hearing Date:  January 17, 2025
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to compel discovery responses; requests for sanctions
 



 
On October 31,
2024, Defendant Target Corp. (“Defendant”) filed 3 motions to compel initial responses
from Plaintiff Thelmas Rosas (“Plaintiff”) for: (1) Form Interrogatories
(“FROG”), set one; (2) Special Interrogatories (“SROG”), set one; and (3) Request
for Production of Documents (“RPD”), set one.  
On June 14, 2024,
Defendant served the discovery requests on Plaintiff.  The responses to the requests were originally
due on July 14, 2024.  Defendant had not
received any responses from Plaintiff by October 2, 2024, so Defendant’s
counsel reached out to Plaintiff’s counsel and offered an extension to respond
to October 7, 2024.  On October 3, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel responded and asked for an extension to October 11,
2024.  Defendant’s counsel granted this
extension.  Defendant did not receive any
responses on October 11, 2024, and as of the date of filing these motions, Defendant
had not received any responses.  
Defendant’s unopposed
motions to compel responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD are granted pursuant to
CCP §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300.  Plaintiff is
ordered to provide verified responses to Defendant’s discovery
requests, without
objections, within 20 days of notice of this order.    
Defendant requests
sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel of record in the amount of $1,086.65
for each motion (= 3 hours to prepare the motion + 2 anticipated hours to
prepare the reply and attend the hearing at $205/hour, plus $61.65 in filing
fees).  The requests are granted but in
the reasonable amount of $820 total for these relatively simple and identical
motions that were unopposed, plus $184.95 in filing fees.  Plaintiff and her counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to
pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,004.95 to Defendant, by and through
counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Defendant shall provide
notice of this order.
