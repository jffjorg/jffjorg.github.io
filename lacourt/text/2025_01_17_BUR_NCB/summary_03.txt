And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Counsel, Omid Khorshidi, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, Derek Andrew Henriquez. Counsel seeks to withdraw from representing the Plaintiff due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, as the Plaintiff has refused to communicate or cooperate with Counsel. Despite providing substitute counsel forms, the Plaintiff did not respond. The judge has found that there is sufficient time for the Plaintiff to obtain new counsel, as there are upcoming status conferences and a jury trial scheduled. The order will become effective once a proof of service is filed with the court.
