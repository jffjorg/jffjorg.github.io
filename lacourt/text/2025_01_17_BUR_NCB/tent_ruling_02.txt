Case
  No.:  24BBCV00187
 
  Hearing Date:  January 17, 2025
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
IKEA’s motion to compel REQUEST FOR production
  of documents; MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTs FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
According to the complaint, Plaintiff
Nancy Ruiz (Plaintiff) went to the IKEA in Burbank and slipped on some type of
liquid that was on the floor in a heavily trafficked area of the restaurant.
(Compl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff claims she was injured as a result. 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendants IKEA US Retail, LLC (IKEA) and Linda Pelser-Braun
(Pelser-Braun), alleging causes of action for (1) Negligence - Premises and (2)
Negligence – General. 
B.    
Motion
on Calendar
On December 2, 2024, IKEA filed the
instant motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
Request for Production of
Documents, set one (RFPDs) and to deem IKEA’s Requests for Admission, set one
(RFAs). 
            No opposition to either motion has been filed.
DISCUSSION 
            IKEA is moving to compel Plaintiff’s
responses to its RFPDs and moving to deem its RFAs that were served upon
Plaintiff admitted, or in the alternative, compel further responses. 
            IKEA served discovery requests,
including its RFPDs and RFAs, upon Plaintiff on June 25, 2024. (Lee Decl. ¶ 3.)
Thus, the deadline for Plaintiff to have served responses to both IKEA’s RFPDs
and RFAs was July 29, 2024, which includes the additional two court days for
electronic service. (Id. ¶ 4.) IKEA has provided Plaintiff’s counsel
multiple extensions, including an extension until August 15, 2024, another one
until August 30, 2024, another one until September 30, 2024, and another one
until November 4, 2024. (Ibid.) November 4, 2024 was the date of the
hearing for Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel, and on that
date, Plaintiff’s counsel only served identical objections to IKEA’s discovery
requests, including the RFPDs and RFAs. (Id., Exhibit 3.) Plaintiff’s
counsel motion to relieve as counsel was granted, and on November 14, 2024,
IKEA’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff to Plaintiff’s
provided address to meet and confer on further responses. (Id. ¶ 5,
Exhibit 4.) On November 22, 2024, IKEA’s counsel attempted to reach Plaintiff
by phone at around 10:24 a.m., but received the following message: "The
number you are calling is temporary unavailable." (Id. ¶ 6.)
Under California law, objections must be
specific, “boilerplate” objections and “nuisance objections” are inappropriate
and even sanctionable. (Korea Data Systems Co., Ltd. v. Superior Court,
(1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516; Standon Co., Inc. v. Superior Court,
(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 898, 902-903.) Plaintiff also bears the burden of
justifying its objections in response to a motion to compel. (Fairmont Ins.
Co. v. Superior Court, (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 355.) Plaintiff has failed to
provide justification for its objections because no opposition was filed. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            IKEA’s motions
to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Requests for Production, set one and to deem
IKEA’s Requests for Admission, set one are both GRANTED. 
Plaintiff
is to serve verified, further code compliant responses to RFPDs without objection – except attorney client
privilege/work product and privacy – within 20 days of notice of this order.
Plaintiff is
to serve verified, further code compliant responses to RFAs without objection with 20 days notice of
this order.
            
Moving party shall provide notice of this
order.
