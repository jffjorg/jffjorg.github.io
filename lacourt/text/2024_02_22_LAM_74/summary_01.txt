And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by 4PX Express USA. The court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and has preserved all evidentiary objections.

The court grants the motion for summary adjudication of the second cause of action (retaliation in violation of Government Code section 12940), the fourth cause of action (failure to provide meal and rest breaks), and the seventh cause of action (retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 1102.5).

The court defers its ruling on the first cause of action (wrongful termination in violation of public policy) until the hearing, as the plaintiff must come to the hearing prepared to cite the specific regulations or provisions in the Governor's Executive Order N-60-20 that support his claim.

The court finds that the defendant has met its prima facie burden to show that there is no triable issue of material fact, and that the plaintiff has not met its burden of creating a triable issue of material fact.
