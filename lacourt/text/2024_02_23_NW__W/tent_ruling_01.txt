[TENTATIVE]
RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Plaintiff requests this
court take judicial notice of the Deed of Trust on the property commonly known
as 4511 Dulcinea Court, Woodlands Hills, CA 91364 (the “DOT”) securing the Loan
Agreement between Defendant Belle Maison Partners, Inc. (“Belle”) and Plaintiff
in the Official Records of Los Angeles County with Recorder Number 20180415419.
(RJN, Exh. 4.) 
 
The court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff moves the court for summary judgment on the complaint
against Defendant Belle Maison Partners, Inc. and Robert Brard upon the ground
there is no triable issue of material fact. 
 
¿A party seeking summary judgment has the burden of
producing evidentiary facts sufficient to entitle him/her to judgment as a
matter of law. (CCP § 437c(c).) The moving party must make an affirmative
showing that he/she is entitled to judgment irrespective of whether or not the
opposing party files an opposition. (Villa v. McFerren (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 733, 742- 743.) Thus, “the initial burden is always on the moving
party to make prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material
fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519
(citing Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.).
When a plaintiff seeks summary judgment, he/she must produce admissible
evidence on each element of each cause of action on which judgment is sought.
(CCP § 437c(p)(1).) The moving party’s “affidavits must cite evidentiary facts,
not legal conclusions or ‘ultimate’ facts” and the courts must construe the
evidence in support of the opposing party, resolving any doubts in favor of the
opposing party. (Hayman v. Block (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 629, 639; Scalf,
128 Cal.App.4th at 1519; Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389.)  
 
The opposing party on a motion for summary judgment is
under no evidentiary burden to produce rebuttal evidence until the moving party
meets his or her initial movant’s burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance
Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 840.) Once the initial movant’s burden
is met, then the burden shifts to the opposing party to show, with admissible
evidence, that there is a triable issue requiring the weighing procedures of
trial. (CCP § 437c(p).) The opposing party may not simply rely on his/her
allegations to show a triable issue but must present evidentiary facts that are
substantial in nature and rise beyond mere speculation. (Sangster v. Paetkau
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 162.) Summary judgment must be granted “if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
Plaintiff presents evidence a contract was made between
Defendant Belle Maison Partners, Inc. (“Belle”) and third-party Arch CBT SPE,
LLC on April 25, 2018 (the “Loan Agreement”). (UMF 1.) Defendant Brard signed a
Guaranty Agreement on behalf of Defendant Belle. (UMF 2.) The Loan Agreement
was secured by a Deed of Trust on certain real property. (UMF 3.) Arch
disbursed $1,068,000.00 to Defendant Belle pursuant to the Loan Agreement. (UMF
4.) Thereafter, Arch assigned its interest under the Loan Agreement and DOT to
Plaintiff on December 10, 2019. (UMF 5.) By virtue of the assignment,
Defendants Bella and Brard became indebted to Plaintiff in the amount owed
under the Loan Agreement and Guaranty. (UMF 6, 7.) Pursuant to the agreement, Defendant
Belle was to make 12 equal payments of $10,680.00 between June 1, 2018 and May
1, 2019 and Defendant Belle was to pay back the entirety of the remaining loan
balance (“Balloon Payment”) on May 1, 2019. (UMF 8, 9.) Payments made by
Defendants are reflected in the written payment history. (UMF 10.) 
 
Plaintiff further presents evidence that Defendants
breached the Loan Agreement and Guaranty by failing to make the Balloon Payment
and failing to date to pay the outstanding amounts owed under the Loan
Agreement. (UMF 11, 12.) After crediting payments to Defendant Belle’s account,
there remains a balance of $510,257.63 which has not been paid, not including interest.
(UMF 13.)  Plaintiff has met its burden
of proof.  
 
Defendants initially presented no evidence to oppose
the motion for summary judgment.   In a separate untimely filing on February 13,
they submit a single piece of evidence, the declaration of  Robert Brard. 
That declaration cryptically states that prior to the loan, Brard set up
a limited liability company.   The declaration does not properly authenticate
an equally cryptic text message attached to his declaration, nor explain how
this fragment of information negates any of the evidence set forth in the
moving papers.  Plaintiff does not
present any evidence in its opposition to the separate statement.   Based on this incomplete and inscrutable
declaration, plaintiff argues that Belle was created solely for the purposes of
acquiring title to the Property and executing the promissory note, the proceeds
of which funded Belle’s acquisition of the Property. Defendants contend Belle
had and has no other business except for its obligations to Plaintiffs and the
related Loans; except for the Property, Belle had and has no other assets and
no other liabilities; Belle has never generated any income or revenue; the
Property has never generated any rental income or other revenue; any funds in
the Belle bank account were deposited as the result occasional loans made to
the company; Belle is and was exclusively controlled by Defendants; Belle has
no employees or other depository accounts; Belle never conducted any other business;
Plaintiffs knew the subject property was owner occupied. Defendants contend
taken all together, these factors lead to the reasonably conclusion that
Defendants were not “true guarantors” of the note but rather, were the principal
obligors.  As such, the Guaranty is a sham.
As the defacto borrowers, Defendants are entitled to the protections of
California’s anti-deficiency statutes and usury laws and those statutes
necessitate dismissal of the Complaint. None of these arguments are supported
by evidence and so cannot create a triable issue of fact.  In  the
separate statement, “[c]itation to the evidence in support of each material
fact must include reference to the exhibit, title, page, and line numbers.”
(Cal. R. Ct., 3.1350(d)(3); see also Zimmerman, Rosenfeld, Gersh & Leeds
LLP v. Larson (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1477 [“if it is not set forth in the
separate statement, it does not exist.”'].) Failure
to cite to evidence in the opposing separate statement is grounds for granting
summary judgment. (Kojababian v. Genuine Horne Loans, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal. 3
App.4th 408.) Under CRC 3.1350(f)(2) citation to the evidence in support of the
position that a fact is controverted must include reference to the exhibit,
title, page, and line numbers. 
Defendants have utterly failed to comply with these requirements.
 
Defendants separately raise argument that Plaintiffs
seek damages from Defendants to which they are not legally entitled under
California law. Defendants contend an interest rate in excess of 10% is
usurious, and if a lender negotiates a loan at a usurious rate absent a qualified
exemption, the agreement shall be void and the lender will have no action at
law to recover any interest. (Civ. Code § 1916-2.) The Loan Agreement here references
the loan as a “Promissory Note (Business Purpose Loan).”  Plaintiff has  presented undisputed evidence that plaintiff
is a private money lender whose loans are exempt because arranged by a licensed
California real estate Broker.   Defendants
do not present any evidence to counter this information.   The court finds that the loan is not
usurious as a matter of law.   
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
