Summary in English:

The tentative ruling is in favor of the plaintiff, NPI Debt Fund I, LP, in its motion for summary judgment against defendants Robert Brard, et al. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants entered into a loan agreement with Arch CBT SPE, LLC, and that the defendants defaulted on the loan. The plaintiff claims that it is entitled to summary judgment because it has presented evidence that shows there is no triable issue of material fact and that the defendants are liable for the outstanding debt.

The defendants argue that the loan agreement is a sham and that Robert Brard was the true guarantor, but they fail to provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. The court finds that the loan agreement is not usurious and that the defendants are not entitled to the protections of California's anti-deficiency statutes and usury laws.

As a result, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and orders that the defendants are liable for the outstanding debt.
