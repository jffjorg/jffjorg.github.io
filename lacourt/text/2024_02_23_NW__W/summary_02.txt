And here is the English summary:

The Judge, W. Kimberly Davis, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to partially quash a deposition subpoena for production of business records to Yahoo, Inc. filed by Defendant Paige Hemmis. The subpoena was issued by Plaintiffs Kimberly Davis and Jonathan Davis in connection with their lawsuit against Defendant Hemmis and others. The lawsuit alleges that Defendant Hemmis and others entered the Plaintiffs' property without permission, forged a lease, and engaged in other wrongful conduct. The Plaintiffs are seeking discovery of various documents, including IP address information, in order to establish their claims.

The Judge has granted the motion to partially quash the subpoena, finding that the scope of the subpoena goes beyond the Plaintiffs' allegations and is overly broad. The Judge has also denied the request for sanctions, finding that both parties' positions were substantially justified.

The case involves several complex legal issues, including the scope of discovery, the admissibility of evidence, and the application of various statutes and case law. The Judge's ruling highlights the importance of careful pleading and the need to tailor discovery requests to the specific allegations of the case.
