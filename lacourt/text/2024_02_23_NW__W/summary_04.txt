And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add "Ady Gil World Conservation" as a defendant in place of the fictitious name "DOE 1". The plaintiff seeks to add this entity as a defendant after discovering its involvement through depositions. The defendants argue that the plaintiff knew the identity of Ady Gil World Conservation as early as April 9, 2018, and that the real reason for the motion is to avoid the Doe amendment procedure. The judge finds that leave to amend is generally liberally granted, provided there is no statute of limitations concern, and that the defendants have not presented any evidence of prejudice from the proposed amendment. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff's complaint will be amended to add Ady Gil World Conservation as a defendant.
