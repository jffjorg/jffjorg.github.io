And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on a demurrer to a Cross-Complaint and a motion to strike portions of the Cross-Complaint. The Cross-Complaint was amended, but the amended pleading was not filed in a timely manner. The judge notes that the parties did not object to the amended pleading or file declarations as ordered. As a result, the judge concludes that the amended pleading is now the operative pleading, and the demurrer and motion to strike are moot. The hearing scheduled for December 18, 2023, is continued to February 22, 2024. The judge orders the parties to give notice of this order.
