AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



            
Background
Plaintiffs Maria Luisa
Trevejo (“Trevejo”) and MLT World, LLC (“MLT”) filed this action on January 17,
2023 against Defendant Stephen Belafonte (“Belafonte”). Trevejo and MLT filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint on July 14, 2023, alleging causes of
action for (1) breach of fiduciary duty, (2) intentional misrepresentation, (3)
negligent misrepresentation, (4) conversion, (5) accounting, and (6) violation
of usury laws. 
On August 15, 2023,
Belafonte filed a Cross-Complaint against Trevejo and MLT (jointly,
“Cross-Defendants”), alleging causes of action for (1) breach of written
contract, (2) breach of implied contract, (3) defamation, (4) intentional
interference with prospective economic advantage, (5) negligent interference
with prospective economic advantage, (6) money had and received, (7)
accounting, (8) for account stated, and (9) for open book account. 
Cross-Defendants demurred
to the first, second, fourth fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of
action of the Cross-Complaint. Cross-Defendants also moved to strike portions
of the Cross-Complaint. No opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike was
filed.  
On December 14, 2023,
Belafonte submitted a First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”).[1]
Discussion 
As
an initial matter, on December 18, 2023, the Court issued a minute order in
this action providing, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“As an
initial matter, the Court notes that Code of Civil Procedure section 472,
subdivision (a) provides that ‘[a] party may amend its pleading once without
leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike
is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the
demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and
served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or
motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by the
parties. The time for responding to an amended pleading shall be computed from
the date of service of the amended pleading.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1005, subdivision (b), ‘[a]ll papers opposing a motion so noticed shall
be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at least nine court
days…before the hearing.’ 
 
Cross-Defendants’
demurrer to the Cross-Complaint and motion to strike portions of the
Cross-Complaint were filed on September 28, 2023, and noticed for hearing on
December 18, 2023. Belafonte did not file or serve the FACC at least nine court
days prior to the December 18, 2023 hearing. Rather, Belafonte submitted the
FACC on December 14, 2023, two court days before the December 18, 2023 hearing.
The proof of service attached the FACC shows that it was also served on
December 14, 2023.
 
The docket for
this action does not yet show that Cross-Defendants have filed any objection to
the FACC on the foregoing grounds. Thus, the Court will provide the parties
with the opportunity to demonstrate whether they stipulated to Belafonte’s
filing of the FACC. As set forth above, ‘[a] party may amend the pleading after
the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon
stipulation by the parties.’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).).” (December
18, 2023 Minute Order at pp. 1-2.) 
The Court’s December 18, 2023 minute order further provides that “Cross-Defendants
may file and serve a declaration addressing the foregoing on or before January
22, 2024. Belafonte may file and serve a response thereto on or before January
29, 2024. On the Court’s own motion, the Hearing on Demurrer - with Motion to
Strike (CCP 430.10) scheduled for 12/18/2023 is continued to 02/22/2024…” 
The Court notes that the docket for this action does not show that any
declarations were filed regarding the foregoing. In light of Cross-Defendants’ failure
to file any objection to the FACC and the failure of the parties to file any
declarations in accordance with the Court’s December 18, 2023 minute order, the
Court concludes that the FACC is now the operative pleading and the demurrer
and motion to strike are moot. 
Cross-Defendants are ordered to give notice
of this order.¿
