And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' request for a special setting of the hearing on their motion for summary judgment. The defendants had requested a hearing date within the next 30 days, but the court does not have any available dates. However, the judge has granted the defendants' alternative request to continue the trial, which was set for September 30, 2024. The trial date is now continued for approximately 30 days. The judge has also reset the final status conference and all deadlines based on the new trial date. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the new trial date.
