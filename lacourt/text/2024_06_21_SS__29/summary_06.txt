And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to appear for and submit to a physical examination without prejudice. The defendant had served two demands for an independent medical examination, which the plaintiff failed to respond to or appear for. The defendant filed a motion to compel the physical examination, but failed to submit a meet and confer declaration as required by law. The judge notes that the defendant's request for an order dismissing the case was made for the first time in the reply papers and was not properly served on the plaintiff. The judge also notes that the reply was served electronically, which is not proper service on a pro per plaintiff.
