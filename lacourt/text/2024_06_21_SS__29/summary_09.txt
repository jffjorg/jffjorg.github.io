And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the motion to quash service of summons filed by Honda Motor Company, Ltd. The motion was filed on May 23, 2024, and the opposition was filed on May 31, 2024. The plaintiff, Deborah Joe and Kenneth Mack, argue that they properly served Honda Motor Company, Ltd through service on American Honda Motor Company, Inc, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary and distributor of Honda vehicles in the United States. However, the court finds that there is no evidence in the record to support this claim, and therefore cannot resolve the motion. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of the continued hearing, at which the parties will be able to present evidence in support of or in rebuttal to the currently unsupported factual assertions in the opposition.
