And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel the defendant to testify and produce documents at a deposition. The motion was filed after the defendant failed to produce witnesses at a previous deposition. The judge notes that the defendant has since produced witnesses for certain topics, but not for all of the topics listed in the deposition notice. The judge has scheduled an informal discovery conference for the morning of the hearing to resolve the remaining dispute. The judge is continuing the hearing on the motion for approximately 30 days to allow the parties to resolve the issue further.
