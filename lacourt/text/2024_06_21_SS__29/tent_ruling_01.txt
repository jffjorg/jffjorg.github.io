  Case Number:  20STCV14480    Hearing Date:   June 21, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment, filed by Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On April
15, 2020, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Danny Esparza and Juan Esparza (collectively “Defendants”) for
subrogation. On June 30, 2020, Defendants filed an answer.
 
On
September 1, 2022, a notice of settlement was filed in this matter.
 
On March
19, 2024, Plaintiff this motion to vacate dismissal and enter judgment against
Defendant Danny Esparza (“Esparza”). No opposition has been filed.
 
On October 31,
2022, Plaintiff and Esparza entered into a written stipulation for the entry of
judgment, which would be discharged upon the payment of $30,000. (Exh. A.) 
 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
provides that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  In ruling on a motion to enter judgment, the
court acts as a trier of fact.  The court
must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement.  To do so, the court may
receive oral testimony in addition to declarations.  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
“[W]here the plaintiff has filed a voluntary
dismissal of an action …, the court is without jurisdiction to act further …,
and any subsequent orders of the court are simply void.” (Paniagua v. Orange
County Fire Auth. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 83, 89, (internal quotes
omitted).) The result is different where a signed, written settlement agreement
(or oral settlement before the court) states the court retains jurisdiction to
enforce the settlement because that agreement could be enforced under C.C.P. §
664.6. (See Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 439-440; Khavarian
Enterprises, Inc. v. Commline, Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 310, 326—court
had continuing jurisdiction to consider attorney fees and costs motions after
dismissal where settlement agreement provided court retained jurisdiction to
enforce agreement pursuant to CCP § 664.6.)) 
C.C.P. § 664.6(a) states: “If requested by
the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement.” Counsel may sign the request on behalf of their clients (C.C.P. §
664.6(b)(2) (added eff. 1/1/21)). The request should be made while the court
still has jurisdiction. (Wackeen v. Malis, supra, 97 CA4th at
433; see Sayta v. Chu (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 960, 962.)
Discussion
On September 24,
2022, Plaintiff and Esparza entered into a written stipulation for the entry of
judgment, which would be discharged upon the payment of $30,000. (Reese Decl.,
¶ 2; see also Exh. A.) An initial payment of $5,000 was to be made by Progressive
Insurance, followed by $200 monthly payments from October 2022 to October 2024,
at which time the payments were to increase to $250. (Exh. A, ¶ 2.)
 
The
Stipulation Agreement appears to have been executed, with signatures from the
two parties. (Exhibit A.) As such, there is a valid agreement.
 
On October
31, 2022, the stipulation was filed with the Court to allow the Court
jurisdiction to enforce the stipulation. (Exhibit A, ¶ 3.) The Order for
Dismissal and Court Retaining Jurisdiction was signed on October 31, 2022.
Therefore, the Court has jurisdiction to enforce this Stipulation Agreement.
 
Plaintiff
contends Esparza’s insurance carrier made a onetime $3,240 payment, and that Esparza
failed to may any monthly payments. (Reese Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5.) Esparza owes $27,260,
which includes filing fee, service fee, and motion fee. (Id, ¶ 8.)

 
The Court finds Plaintiff has established that
there was a valid agreement between the parties, that the Court retains
jurisdiction, and that there is a need to set aside the dismissal and enter
judgment against Esparza.
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to set
aside the dismissal and enter judgment against Esparza.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS the motion to set aside the
dismissal. Judgment is entered against Danny Esparza for $27,260.00. 
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
