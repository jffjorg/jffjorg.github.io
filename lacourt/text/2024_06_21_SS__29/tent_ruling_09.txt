 Case Number:  22STCV37586    Hearing Date:   June 21, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Quash
filed by Specially Appearing Defendant Honda Motor Company, Ltd.
Tentative
The hearing on
the motion is CONTINUED.
BACKGROUND
On November 30,
2022, Deborah Joe and Kenneth Mack (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a
complaint against Lillian Swanson; American Honda Motor Company, Inc.; North
American Honda; Honda Motor Company, Ltd; and Does 1 through 50 for negligence
stemming from an automobile accident occurring on December 30, 2020.
On April 30,
2024, Plaintiffs filed with the Court proof of service of summons on Honda
Motor Company, Ltd by personal service on “Koy Saechao – CSC Agent for Service –
Person Authorized to Accept.”  
On May 23, 2024, Specially
Appearing Defendant Honda Motor Company, Ltd. (“HMC”) filed this motion to
quash service of summons. Plaintiffs filed an opposition on May 31, 2024. No
reply has been filed.
Also on May
23, Defendant American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (“AHMC”) filed an answer to
the complaint.  The next day, on May 24,
AHMC filed an amended answer.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Proper service of a summons on each defendant
is a constitutional and statutory requirement in all civil actions.  Without proper service (or, for example,
consent or waiver), a court does not acquire jurisdiction over a defendant, and
in general any judgment rendered against the defendant is void.  (E.g., Kremerman v. White (2021) 71
Cal.App.5th 358, 371; County of San Diego v. Gorham (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 1215, 1231.)
A corporate entity may, in general, be served
through its designated agent for service of process; any other person
authorized to accept service; its chief executive officer, chief financial
officer, president, vice president, secretary or assistant secretary, treasurer
or assistant treasurer, or controller; or its “general manager.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 416.10, subds. (a) &
(b).)
The Code of Civil Procedure provides for
service on a defendant within the State of California by four basic methods:
(1) personal service; (2) substitute service; (3) service by mail and
acknowledgement of receipt; and (4) service by publication.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 415.10, 415.20,
415.30, 415.50.)  
For a defendant located outside of California
but within the United States, service may be made using any of these methods,
any method authorized by the law of the place where the person is served, or by
certified mail with a return receipt. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 413.10, subd. (b) & 415.40.)
For a defendant located outside of the United
States, the rules are slightly more complicated.  The United States and more than 80 other
countries are signatories to the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial
and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, November 15, 1965,
20 U.S.T. 361, T.I.A.S. No. 6638 (the “Hague Service Convention”).  Where the Hague Service Convention applies, it
preempts state law with regard to service of process, and the parties must
comply with the procedures for service set forth in the Convention.  (Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v.
Schlunk (1988) 486 U.S. 694, 699, 705; Rockefeller Technology
Investments (Asia) VII v. Changzhou Sinotype Technology Co. (2020) 9
Cal.5th 125, 137-138; Code Civ. Proc., § 413.10, subd. (c).)
Where the Hague Service Convention does not
apply, service may be made using any of the four methods for service in
California, or by certified mail with a return receipt.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 413.10, subd. (c)
& 415.40.)  Alternatively, service
may be made “as directed by the court in which the action is pending,” or by any
method authorized by the law of the place where the person is served “if the
court before or after service finds that the service is reasonably calculated
to give actual notice.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 413.10, subd. (c).)
A defendant may challenge service through a
motion to quash service of the summons filed under Code of Civil Procedure
section 418.10.  “When a defendant
challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service
of process the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of
jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective
service.”  (Summers v. McClanahan
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413; see also, e.g., Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210
Cal.App.4th 1154, 1163.) 
DISCUSSION
HMC moves to quash service of the summons,
arguing that service was improper because it is a Japanese company, that it has
not designated an agent for service of process in California, and that any
service on it must be through the Hague Convention.  
(Notably, HMC does not present any facts in
support of this motion (not even admissible evidence that it is based in
Japan), but Plaintiff does not challenge HMC’s factual assertions, and, in any
event, Plaintiff has the burden of showing the facts to establish proper
service.) 
Plaintiff argues that it properly served
HMC through service in California on AHMC. 
When a foreign corporation is properly served through its local subsidiary
or agent, the service is valid and effective, and the Hague Convention
procedures do not apply.  (Volkswagenwerk, supra, 486
U.S. at pp. 707-708.)  Under California
law, both before and after the Volkswagenwerk decision, a local
subsidiary of, or distributor for, a foreign company is deemed to be the
foreign company’s “general manager,” and proper service on the local subsidiary
is treated as valid service on the foreign company.  (Cosper v. Smith & Wesson Arms Co. (1959)
53 Cal.2d 77, 83-84; Yamaha Motor Co. v. Super. Ct. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 264, 274; see also Falco v. Nissan North America (C.D. Cal. 2013)
987 F.Supp.2d 1071, 1076-1078 [applying California law]; 1 Weil & Brown,
California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2023), ¶ 4:320.)
Plaintiff asserts that AHMC is a “wholly
owned subsidiary of” HMC.  (Opp. at 4:20-21.)  Plaintiff asserts that AHMC is “the exclusive
distributor of all Honda vehicles … in California and throughout the United
States.”  (Id. at 4:21-23.)  And Plaintiff asserts that it is “undisputed
that [AHMC] is the exclusive distributor of all Honda products in the United States.”  (Id. at 5:3-4.)  But saying it is so does not make it so.  Plaintiff has the burden of proof on this
motion, and there is no evidence of any of this in the record.
If in fact AHMC is a subsidiary or
distributor for HMC, and if Plaintiff served HMC through service on AHMC,
Plaintiff might well have a strong case for the Court to deny HMC’s
motion.  Absent evidence, however, the
Court cannot resolve this motion.
Accordingly, the Court CONTINUES the
hearing on this motion so that the parties can present evidence to the Court in
support of, or in rebuttal to, the currently unsupported factual assertions in
Plaintiff’s opposition.
CONCLUSION
The Court
CONTINUES the hearing on this motion.
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice.
