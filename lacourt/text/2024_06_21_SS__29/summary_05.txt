And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to continue the trial date to January 2025 filed by Defendant MV Transportation, Inc. The court has already granted a continuance of the trial date to August 27, 2024, and the parties have agreed to mediate through the Resolve Law LA program. The defendant's third reason for the continuance, to file a motion for summary judgment, is not sufficient basis for another continuance. The court finds that the defendant has had sufficient opportunity to conduct discovery and gather evidence to support its defenses. The motion is denied, and the request for sanctions is also denied.
