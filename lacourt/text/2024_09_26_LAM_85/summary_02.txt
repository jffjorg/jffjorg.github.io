And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case regarding the applicability of the Housing Accountability Act (HAA) to a housing development project. The Plaintiff (Petitioners) argue that the HAA applies throughout the entire application process, while the Defendant (City of Los Angeles) argues that it only applies after a local agency makes a "final merits" decision.

The Judge notes that the HAA requires a local government to make a written determination of project consistency within 30 or 60 days after an application is accepted as complete, and that the HAA applies to certain CEQA decisions that necessarily occur before a final merits decision. The Judge also recognizes the project's decade-old vesting rights and interprets the HAA to give full weight to the approval of housing.

The Judge also addresses the issue of the City's incompleteness determination, finding it to be invalid. The Judge notes that the City's Third Incompleteness Letter requested the results of the BOE investigation, which need not be completed until after the application is accepted as complete, and that the letter also requested the signature of the City's staff on one of the application forms, which is not "incomplete" information that the applicant can provide.

The Judge also addresses the issue of whether the local government can end the cycle of resubmissions within 90 days, finding that the court need not decide this issue. The Judge also notes that the City's staff report's disclaimer that staff was not recommending disapproval of the Project does not make it so, as the City Council's vote was a substantive decision regarding whether the applicant was eligible for ED1 vesting.
