Yes In My Back Yard,
Sonja Trauss, Bedrock Properties Group, and 8217 Winnetka v. City of Los
Angeles and City Council of Los Angeles, 24STCP00070

Tentative decision on petition
for mandamus:   granted 



 
Petitioners Yes In My
Back Yard (“YIMBY”), Sonja Trauss (“Trauss”), Bedrock Properties Group
(“Bedrock”), and 8217 Winnetka, LLC (“Winnetka”) seek mandamus compelling
Respondents City of Los Angeles and its City Council (collectively, “City”) to set aside the City Council’s decision for the
Project and to carry out its required duties
pursuant to state law.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply,[1]
and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1. Petition
            On
January 9, 2024, Petitioners filed the Petition against the City alleging
causes of action for administrative mandamus and/or traditional mandamus and
declaratory relief. The verified Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Petitioner
Bedrock proposes to build 360 new rental units to be constructed on Winnetka
Avenue in Canoga Park (the “Project”), all of which meet the definition of
“affordable housing” under state law.  Pet., ¶2.  Rather than following its own recently enacted
expedited procedure for approving affordable housing projects, the City blocked
the Project.  Pet., ¶2.  In so doing, the City abandoned its avowed
commitment to housing, ignored the law, and cited demonstrably false and
pretextual reasons for its decision to disapprove the project.  Pet., ¶2.  The City’s actions violated state housing laws
and City ordinances, executive orders, and regulations.  Pet., ¶3. 
            After
initially accepting Bedrock’s application and identifying the Project as
eligible for expedited approval under the City’s new Executive Directive 1
(“ED1”), the City reversed this decision.  Pet., ¶4.  The City claimed that the Project is
ineligible for the streamlined ED1 approval process because ED1 had been
recently amended to exclude multi-family housing developments, such as the
Project, that are situated in single-family zones.  Pet., ¶5.  However, state law provides that a developer’s
rights vest at the time the application for a development is submitted, meaning
that the Project was “locked in” to the rules in effect at the time, including
ED1 eligibility.  Pet., ¶5. 
The City contends that its own executive orders do not
qualify as an enforceable policy upon which a developer could rely and that
state vesting rights did not apply to ED1.  Pet., ¶5. As a result, the City informed
Bedrock that it would be required to complete the ordinary, non-streamlined
entitlement process.  Pet., ¶6. 
            Following
the City’s actions, the State issued an opinion letter that ED1 did constitute
an ordinance, standard, and/or policy in which a developer can obtain vesting
rights. Pet., ¶7. The City eventually reasoned that Bedrock’s ED1 rights vested
but its application had expired because the City’s own staff had failed to sign
the updated application form.  Pet., ¶9. 
            Petitioners
contend that the City’s actions conflict with the Permit Streamlining Act
(“PSA”), the Housing Crisis Act (“HCA”), and the Housing Accountability Act
(“HAA”).  Pet., ¶¶ 12-15. Tthe City violated
the PSA by failing to acknowledge that Bedrock’s Affordable Housing Referral
Form (“AHRF”) application was complete and then misapplied the HCA when it determined
that its ED1 rights had not vested.  Pet., ¶24.  The City’s failure to provide a lawful basis
to disapprove the Project and its decision to impose policies not in effect at
the time the preliminary application was submitted also constitute violations
of the HAA.  Pet., ¶24.
Petitioners pray for (1) a writ of mandate commanding the
City to declare the City Council’s October 13, 2023 denial of the PSA appeal
void, review and process the Project application pursuant to the PSA’s and
HAA’s provisions, and order the City’s Planning Department (“Planning”) to
accept and process the development application within 60 days, with the court
to retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance; (2) a writ of mandate commanding the
City to comply with the HAA, deem the Project compliant, and approve the Project
within 60 days due to the City’s bad faith actions pursuant to Government Code[2] section
65589.5; (4) a declaration that the City violated section 65589.5(d) by failing
to process and accept the Project application, that the City Council violated
section 65589.5(d) by failing to grant the appeal and direct staff to process
the application, that the City’s denial of vesting rights for the Project while
granting such rights to similarly situated projects was arbitrary, capricious,
and devoid of merit or evidentiary support, and that the City’s actions
constituted bad faith as defined by section 65589.5(l); (5) costs of suit and
attorney fees under CCP section 1021.5; (6) fines and penalties under section
65589.5; and (7) for any other relief the court deems just and proper.
 
2. Course of
Proceedings
            On
January 9, 2024, Petitioners filed the Petition. 
            On
March 21, 2024, Respondents filed their Answer. 
 
            B.
Governing Law
1. The Permit Streamlining Act
The PSA (§§ 65920-964) states that there is a statewide need
to ensure a clear understanding of the specific requirements which must be met
for the approval of development projects and to expedite decisions on such
projects.  §65921.  The PSA requires that each agency maintain lists that “specify in detail the information
that will be required from any applicant.” 
§65940. 
Once a development project application has been submitted, the
agency must make a written determination whether the application is complete within
30 calendar days, or else “the application together with the submitted
materials shall be deemed complete.”  §65943(a).   Agencies have “30 days, and 30 days only” to
determine that an application is incomplete.  Orsi v. City
Council of Salinas, (1990) 219 Cal. App. 3d 1576, 1584.
When the agency makes an incompleteness determination, it must
provide “an exhaustive list of items that were not complete” which is limited
to those items required on the agency’s submittal requirement checklist.  §65943(a).  Upon any resubmittal, a new 30-day review period
begins during which the agency shall determine completeness, but the agency
“shall not request the applicant to provide any new information that was not
stated in the initial list of items that were not complete.”  §65943(a).
If the application is determined to be incomplete, the
agency must provide a right to appeal that determination.  §65943(c).  There shall be a final written determination
on the appeal no later than 60 calendar days after receipt of the written
appeal.  Id.  If a final written determination is not made
within that 60-day period, “the application with the submitted materials shall
be deemed complete.”  Id. 
Deemed complete does not necessarily mean deemed
approved.  See §65950 (agency shall approve or disapprove
project within specified time limits).  The
PSA does not create an exception to the well-established law requiring
hierarchical consistency of land use permits, zoning ordinances, and general
plans.  Land Waste Management v.
Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors, (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 950,
960.  Hence, the PSA does not require
that a permit application be deemed approved if not acted on within the
statutory period when the permit application would require a legislative change
in the applicable zoning ordinance, general plan, or other controlling land use
legislation.  Id. at 961.  
A local agency’s actions under the PSA are reviewed as
traditional mandate.  §65943(c).  
 
2. Housing Crisis Act 
            In
2019, the Legislature enacted the HCA, declaring a temporary housing emergency
statewide in order to preserve existing housing, enhance protections for
occupants, and increase certainty in the development review process.  See
SB 330 §2(b).  Among other limitations, the law ensures housing
production is not stymied by precluding an affected county or city – including
charter cites and the electorate – from either reducing existing residential
intensities or imposing a limitation on housing development within all or a
portion of an affected city without first making a finding of an “imminent
threat” to public health and safety. §§ 66300(a)(1)(B)(3), (b)(1)(A),
(b)(1)(B)(i), 65589.5.  The HCA prohibits an affected city: 
  
“…from enacting a
development policy, standard, or condition, as defined, that would have the
effect of (A) changing the land use designation or zoning of a parcel or
parcels of property to a less intensive use or reducing the intensity of land
use within an existing zoning district below what was allowed under the general
plan or specific plan land use designation and zoning ordinances of the county
or city as in effect on January 1, 2018….”  §66300(b)(1) (emphasis
added).   
    
An “affected county” or “affected city” includes the
electorate of an affected county or city exercising its local initiative or
referendum power, whether that power is derived from the California
Constitution, statute, or the charter or ordinances of the affected county or
city.  §66300(a)(3).  “Reducing the intensity of land use” includes
reductions to height, density, or floor area ratio, new or increased open space
or lot size requirements, new or increased setback requirements, minimum frontage
requirements, or maximum lot coverage limitations, or any other action that
would individually or cumulatively reduce the site’s residential development
capacity.  §66300(b)(1)(A).  These prohibitions apply to any land use
designation amendment or change adopted on or after January 1, 2020, and any
change as of that date is void.  §66300(b)(2). 
To maximize the development of
housing within this state, section 66300 should be broadly construed and any
exception thereto narrowly construed, including an exception for the health and
safety of occupants of a housing development project.  §66300(f)(2). 
 
            3. The
Housing Accountability Act 
            a. Legislative
Findings and Intent
            The
Legislature recognizes the lack of housing as a critical problem that threatens
the economic, environmental, and social quality of life in California.  §65589.5(a)(1)(A).  It adopted the HAA in 1982 to “significantly
increase the approval and construction of new housing for all economic segments
of California’s communities by meaningfully and effectively curbing the
capability of local governments to deny, reduce the density for, or render
infeasible housing development projects and emergency shelters.”  §65589.5(a)(2)(K).   To date, the goal remains
unfulfilled.  Id.
            The HAA reflects the
Legislature’s findings that “the availability of housing is of vital statewide
importance,” and that providing the necessary housing supply “requires the
cooperative participation of government and the private sector in an effort to expand
housing opportunities and accommodate the housing needs
of Californians of all economic levels.” 
§65580(a)-(b).  
            Effective
January 1, 2018, the Legislature significantly amended the HAA to strengthen
its provisions, expand its applicability, and increase local governments’
liability for violations.  The HAA found that California is in a housing
crisis that is “partially caused by activities and policies of many local governments
that limit the approval of housing, increase the cost of land for housing, and
require that high fees and exactions be paid by producers of housing”.  §65589.5(a)(1)(B).  The consequences of those actions include
discrimination against low-income and minority households, lack of housing to
support employment growth, imbalance in jobs and housing, reduced mobility,
urban sprawl, excessive commuting, and air quality deterioration.  §65589.5(a)(1)(C).
            Many local governments do not give
adequate attention to the economic, environmental, and social costs of
decisions that result in disapproval of housing development projects, reduction
in density of housing projects, and excessive standards for housing development
projects.  §65589.5(a)(1)(D).  The state’s
homeownership rate was at its lowest level since the 1940s and ranks 49 out of
the 50 states.  §65589.5(a)(2)(E). 
The lack of supply and rising costs are compounding inequality and limiting
advancement opportunities for many Californians.  §65589.5(a)(2)(F).
            The HAA should be “interpreted and implemented in a
manner to afford the fullest possible weight to the interest of, and the
approval and provision of, housing.” 
§65589.5(a)(2)(L). 
            It
is the intent of the Legislature that the conditions that would have a
specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety under either section
65589.5(d)(2) and 65589.5(j)(1) arise infrequently.  §65589.5(a)(3).
            It
is the policy of the state that a local government not reject or make
infeasible housing development projects that contribute to meeting the need
determined pursuant to the HAA without a thorough analysis of the economic,
social, and environmental effects of the action and without complying with
section 65589.5(d).  §65589.5(b).
 
            b. Project Approval Based on Vested
Rights
            Section
65589.5 is referred to colloquially as the “anti-NIMBY law.”  Schellinger Brothers v. City of Sebastopol,
(2009) 19 Cal.App.4th 1245 1253, n. 9.  Subject to certain exceptions, a housing
development project shall be subject only to the ordinances, policies, and
standards adopted and in effect when a preliminary application which included
all the information required by section 65941.1(a) was submitted.  §65589.5(o)(1).
Section 65941.1(d)(1) provides
that the applicant must submit an application that includes all necessary
information within 180 days after submitting the preliminary application.  The plain language of the provision sets a
180-day deadline.  Section 65941.1(d)(2)
provides that, if the agency determines that the application is incomplete pursuant
to section 65943, the applicant shall submit the missing information within 90
days and the failure to do so will mean the application has expired.  In turn, section 65943 provides that the
agency must make a written determination on the completeness of an application
within 30 days of submittal, or it will be deemed complete.  §65943(a). 
Upon receipt of “any resubmittal of the application, a new 30-day period
shall begin, during which the public agency shall determine the completeness of
the application.”  Id.  
A housing
development project “shall be deemed consistent, compliant, and in conformity
with an applicable plan, program, policy, ordinance, standard, requirement, or
other similar provision if there is substantial evidence that would allow a
reasonable person to conclude that the housing development project or emergency
shelter is consistent, compliant, or in conformity.” §65589.5(f)(4). 
            Section
65589.5(j)(1) provides: 
 
“When a proposed housing development project complies with
applicable, objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and
criteria, including design review standards, in effect at the time that the
housing development project's application is determined to be complete, but the
local agency proposes to disapprove the project or to impose a condition
that the project be developed at a lower density, the local agency shall
base its decision regarding the proposed housing development project upon written
findings supported by a preponderance of the evidence on the record that both
of the following conditions exist: 
(A) The housing development project would have a specific,
adverse impact upon the public health or safety unless the project is
disapproved or approved upon the condition that the project be developed at a
lower density. As used in this paragraph, a “specific, adverse impact” means a
significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on
objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or
conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete. 
(B) There is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate
or avoid the adverse impact identified pursuant to paragraph (1), other than
the disapproval of the housing development project or the approval of the
project upon the condition that it be developed at a lower density.” (emphasis
added). 
 
If a permitting agency considers a proposed housing
development project to be inconsistent with “an applicable plan, program,
policy, ordinance, standard, requirement, or other similar provision,” it must
provide the applicant with written documentation identifying and explaining the
claimed inconsistency within either 30 or 60 days of the submittal of a
complete application, depending upon the size of the project.
§65589.5(j)(2)(A). Absent timely notice, the project is deemed to be in
compliance with all applicable standards as a matter of law.
§65589.5(j)(2)(B).¿¿ 
Section 65589.5(j) applies to market rate housing as well as
affordable housing.  Honchariw v.
County of Stanislaus, (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1066, 1070. The HAA applies to
all residential housing developments and takes away the agency’s ability to
deny residential projects based on subjective development policies. Id.
at 1072-77. 
            “Disapprove
the housing development project” includes any instance in which a local agency
“votes on a proposed housing development project application and it is
disapproved”, “fails to comply with the timer periods specified in Section
65950” or fails to meet the time limits specified in section 65913.3.  §65589.5(h)(6).
            If the court finds that an agency acted in bad faith in
disapproving a project in violation of the HAA, the appropriate remedy is an
“order or judgment directing the local agency to approve the housing
development project.” §65589.5(k)(1)(A)(ii).  “Bad faith” “includes, but
is not limited to, an action that is frivolous or otherwise entirely without
merit.” §65589.5(l).  
The local jurisdiction bears the
burden of proving that its decision conforms to the conditions specified in
section 65589.5.  §65589.6.   
 
            c. The Builder’s Remedy
            A local agency shall
not disapprove a housing development project for very
low, low-, or moderate-income households, or an emergency shelter, or condition
approval in a manner that renders the housing development project infeasible
for development for the use of very low, low- or moderate-income households,
including through the use of design review standards, unless it makes written
findings, based upon a preponderance of the evidence in the record, for one of five
 conclusions: 
            (1) the local jurisdiction
has adopted a housing element in substantial compliance with the Housing
Element Law and has met or exceeded its share of the regional housing need
allocation pursuant to section 65584 for the planning period for the income
category proposed for the housing development project, provided that any
disapproval or conditional approval shall not be based on any of the reasons
prohibited by section 65008. 
§65589.5(d)(1).
            (2) the proposed
housing development would have a specific, adverse impact on the public health
or safety that cannot be feasibly mitigated without rendering the project
unaffordable or infeasible.  A specific,
adverse impact on public health or safety does not include inconsistency with
the zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation.  §65589.5(d)(2)(A); 
            (3) denial of the
project is required to comply with specific state or federal law, and there is
no feasible method to comply without rendering the project unaffordable or
infeasible; 
            (4) the proposed
land for the project is zoned for, and surrounded on at least two sides by,
agriculture or resource preservation purposes; or 
            (5) the housing
development project or emergency shelter is inconsistent with both the
jurisdiction’s zoning ordinance and general plan land use designation as
specified in any element of the general plan as it existed on the date the
application was deemed complete, and the jurisdiction has adopted a revised
housing element in accordance with section 65588 that is in substantial
compliance with the Housing Element Law. 
§§ 65589.5(d)(1)-(5).  
            Section 65589.5(d)(5)
means that, when the local government does not have a housing element in substantial
compliance with the Housing Element Law, it cannot disapprove an applicable
project based on inconsistencies with the jurisdiction’s zoning ordinance or
general plan land use designation.  This
is colloquially referred to as the “builder’s remedy.”  
            A “housing
development project” includes any mixed-use development consisting of
residential and nonresidential uses with at least two-thirds of the square
footage designated for residential use. 
§65589.5(h)(2).  “Housing for very
low, low-, or moderate-income households” includes buildings where 20% of the
units are sold or rented to lower income households.  §65589.5(h)(3).  
            “Deemed complete”
means the applicant has submitted a preliminary application pursuant to section
65941.1 or, if the applicant has not submitted a preliminary application, has
submitted a complete application pursuant to section 65943.  §65589.5(h)(5).  
            “Disapproval of a
housing development project” includes whenever a local agency votes on a
proposed housing development project application and the application is
disapproved, including any required land use approvals or entitlements
necessary for the issuance of a building permit.  §65589.5(h)(6)(A).
            A
“specific, adverse impact” is a “significant, quantifiable, direct, and
unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or
safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the
application was deemed complete.” §65589.5(j)(1)(A).  The Legislature’s
intent is that conditions that would have a specific, adverse impact upon the
public health and safety should arise infrequently. 
§65589.5(a)(3).  
 
C. Standard of Review
1. The HAA
Actions to enforce the HAA are brought as administrative
mandamus.  §65589.5(m); Honchariw v.
County of Stanislaus, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at 1072.  Although a court
would normally defer to an agency’s interpretation of its own ordinances, “land
use decisions under the HAA are different,” and “it is inappropriate for
[courts] to defer to the City’s interpretation.” California Renters Legal
Advocacy & Education Fund v. City of San Mateo, (“CARLA”), (2021)
68 Cal.App.5th 820, 844. Thus, courts must engage in a “more rigorous
independent review . . . in order to prevent the City from circumventing what was
intended to be a strict limitation on its authority.” Ruegg & Ellsworth
v. City of Berkeley, (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 277, 299.
HAA cases are governed by a
“reasonable person” standard that favors project approval, under which a court
must determine whether “substantial evidence . . . would allow a reasonable
person to conclude that the housing development project” complies with
applicable standards.  §655589.5(f)(4).  Additionally, the local agency bears the
burden of proof to demonstrate that its decision conformed to the HAA.  §65589.6.  Finally, the HAA must “be interpreted and
implemented in a manner to afford the fullest possible weight to the interest
of, and the approval and provision of, housing.”  §65589.5(a)(2)(L). 
The City argues that the
reasonable person standard only applies to deciding whether the Project
complies with a local “applicable plan, program, policy, ordinance, [or]
standard” for a final merits decision and the City has
not made a merits decision disapproving the Project.  §65589.5(f)(4), (j).  Similarly, the City argues that it does not
bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence under section
65589.6 because the City Council did not make a final decision on the Project
merits.  Opp. at 13.
The HAA’s reasonable person
standard applies to any action to enforce the HAA, including the determination
whether a housing development project “is consistent, compliant, or in
conformity” with applicable standards.  §655589.5(f)(4).
 The HAA also broadly defines “disapproval”
as any instance in which an agency “[v]otes on a proposed housing development
project application and the application is disapproved.” §65589.5(h)(6).  Nothing limits the HAA solely to a final
merits decision.  
The agency’s decision must be based on the evidence
presented at the hearing.  Board of
Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860,
862.  The decision-maker is only required
to issue findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine
whether, and upon what basis, to review the decision.  Topanga Ass’n for a Scenic Community v.
County of Los Angeles, (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  Implicit in CCP section 1094.5 is a
requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap
between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Id. at 515.
 
2. The PSA
Actions under the PSA are governed by traditional
mandamus.    §65943(c).  A petition for traditional mandamus is
appropriate in all actions “to compel the performance of an act which the law
specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or
station....”  CCP §1085.  A traditional writ of mandate is the method
of compelling the performance of a legal, ministerial duty required by
statute.  See Rodriguez v.
Solis, (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 495, 501-02. 
Generally, mandamus will lie when (1) there is no plain, speedy, and
adequate alternative remedy, (2) the respondent has a duty to perform, and (3)
the petitioner has a clear and beneficial right to performance.”  Pomona Police Officers’ Assn. v. City of
Pomona, (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 583-84 (internal citations
omitted).  Whether a statute imposes a
ministerial duty for which mandamus is available, or a mere obligation to
perform a discretionary function, is a question of statutory
interpretation.  AIDS Healthcare
Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Public Health, (2011) 197
Cal.App.4th 693, 701.
 
3. Overlap of the HAA and
PSA
Issues under the PSA cannot be
viewed in isolation, separate from the HAA’s more favorable standards of
review.  Rather, these overlapping laws
must be construed together to carry out the Legislature’s directive that the
law be interpreted to favor housing.  The
question “whether an application is complete for purposes of the PSA is also
relevant under the HAA, which incorporates by reference the PSA’s definition of
a complete application.”  Save Lafayette
v. City of Lafayette, (“Save Lafayette”) (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 842,
851.  The court is “not dealing with the
PSA in a vacuum, but rather in its relation to the HAA”.   Id. at 855.  Insofar as it is evaluating a HAA claim, the
factual issues concerning the PSA determinations are governed by the reasonable
person standard.  
 
            D. Statement of Facts[3]
            1. The Mayor’s ED 1 and
Guidelines
            On December 12, 2022, Mayor Karen Bass
issued a Declaration of Local Emergency (“Declaration”) in response to the
City’s ongoing housing and homelessness crisis. AR1581-86. The Declaration
directed City agencies to provide “[r]egulatory relief . . . to create
flexibility to address the crisis.” AR1585. 
On December 16, 2022,
Mayor Bass issued ED1 which directed applications for 100% affordable housing
projects to be exempt from discretionary review so long as they do not require
a zoning change, variance, or general plan amendment, and which further directed
City departments to provide a streamlined ministerial application review
process for 100% affordable housing projects.  AR 1588-90. 
On February 9, 2023,
City departments issued implementing guidelines for ED1 (“Guidelines” or “ED1
Guidelines”) that outlined the eligibility criteria and general procedures for
any project seeking ministerial ED1 approval. AR1592-605. The Guidelines excluded
from the definition of 100% affordable project those projects with fewer than
five units, any project that required a legislative action, any project that
required a deviation from development standards, any project that required a
subdivision map or coastal development permit, and any project proposing
for-sale units. AR1593. The Guidelines informed applicants of vesting rights
available under the HCA, stating that “housing projects qualify to submit an
optional HCA Vesting Preliminary Application, which ‘locks in’ local planning
and zoning rules at the time the complete application is submitted.” AR1605.
 
            2. The Project Preliminary Application
            Petitioner Bedrock held a pre-application meeting with the
City’s Planning Department (“Planning”) to discuss the Project, an affordable
housing project at 8217 N. Winnetka Avenue.  SAR 01-06.  Staff informed Bedrock that the Project would
be eligible for ED1 and to work with Planning’s Affordable Housing Services
Section (“AHSS”) to determine the precise requirements. SAR 08-11. 
            On March 22,
2023, Bedrock submitted a preliminary application for the Project of 360 affordable
units at a site zoned RA-1 and RD2-1 designated for Low Medium II Residential
land use. AR 1542. In these zones, two-family dwellings are not permitted
by-right.  Multifamily development is not
permitted in the RA zone and RA zones limit height to 30 feet.  AR 1542.
            On April 18, 2023, Bedrock submitted to AHSS an Affordable
Housing Referral Form (“AHRF”), which Planning staff signed on June 15, 2023.  AR 353-65.  The purpose of the AHRF “is to confirm the Project’s consistency with regulations”
related to, inter alia, issues of affordable housing.  AR1540.  AHSS staff signed off on Bedrock’ AHRF form,
which identified the Project as eligible for ED1 ministerial processing.  AR 353.  City staff signed the form affirming that it
was complete and checked the box identifying the Project as eligible for ED1.  AR 105.
            
            3. The First Amended ED1  
            On June 12, 2023, Mayor Bass issued
a revised ED1 (“First Amended ED1”).  AR
1639-41.  The First Amended ED1 was largely
the same, except that it excluded any 100% affordable housing project “located
in a single family or more restrictive zone.” AR 1639.
 
            4. The Project Application
            On June 23, 2023, Bedrock submitted to
Planning a development application (“Application”) under the PSA. AR 200-05.  
 
The Incompleteness
Letter
Shortly thereafter, on
June 30, 2023, Planning an incompleteness letter to Bedrock (“Incompleteness
Letter”) outlining how the Application was incomplete. AR1736-47. The Incompleteness
Letter explained that the Application was incomplete for the following reasons:
(1) the preliminary application was inconsistent with the Application in its
number of units, parking spaces, and square footage; (2) the Application was
missing bicycle parking information; (3) it was missing rear-yard reduction
information; (4) there were inconsistencies in open space reduction amounts
between the Application and the AHRF; (5) the Application was missing
landscaping information; (6) the Application and AHRF had inconsistent unit,
parking, setback, rear-yard reduction, and height proposals; (7) the
Application was missing a letter from the City’s Bureau of Engineering (“BOE”)
relating to dedication and improvement requirements; (8) the Application was missing
a Preliminary Zoning Assessment form and architectural plans stamped by the Plan
Check division of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (“LADBS”); (9) the
submitted papers could not be read; and (10) it failed to disclose information
about on and off site trees. AR 1736–46. The City sought a correct AJRF form
(AR 1740) and explained that the missing Application items must be submitted by
Bedrock within 90 days, or by September 28, 2023. AR 1736.
 
            The Disapproval Letter
            On July 6, 2023, Planning sent
Bedrock a disapproval letter (“Disapproval Letter”) stating that the Project
was no longer eligible for ED1 processing pursuant to Mayor Bass’s First Amended
ED1 issued on June 12, 2023. AR 423. The Disapproval Letter explained that
projects located in single-family or more restrictive zones are not eligible
for ED1 processing and that there were other entitlement options available for
Bedrock’s Project. AR 423. 
 
            The Second Incompleteness
Letter
            On August 4, 2023, the City sent
Bedrock another incompleteness letter (“Second Incompleteness Letter”) explaining
why the Application was still incomplete. AR 1751-54.  The letter informed Bedrock that, because the Project
does not qualify  for ED1 processing as
stated in the Disapproval Letter, the Application will be considered converted
as of July 6, 2023 to a regular entitlement process that will proceed on a
discretionary review process.   AR
1751.  The existing case number was being
to a new case number that reflects that (1) the Project does not qualify for
ED1 processing, (2) a change in the administrative review process, and (3) the
Project remains vested in other LAMC provisions and land use plans besides
ED1.  AR 1751.  The City would require Planning Commission
approval and environmental review, a new set of application materials, and
$35,000 in additional fees. AR 1751-52.  The
Second Incompleteness Letter added that the Application materials remained
incomplete for the same reasons stated in the City’s June 30, 2023, letter to
Bedrock. AR 1752. 
Bedrock immediately
inquired how to appeal the refusal to process under ED1.  AR 1998.
            
            3. The Ethel Project 
            A project at 5511 North Ethel
Avenue (“Ethel Project”) was also deemed ineligible to vest in ED1’s
provisions, and that determination was also appealed.  
Before the City acted on
the Ethel Project appeal, the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (“HCD”), sent the City a letter stating: “The central question
between the City and the Applicant is as follows: Is an executive directive one
of the rules, regulations, requirements, and policies that vest upon submission
of a complete Preliminary Application? The answer is ‘yes.’” AR 1853-55.  HCD’s letter explained that “ED1 is not
excluded from the expansive HAA definition of ‘ordinances, policies, and
standards’ and is therefore eligible for vesting.” AR 1854. 
The City Council’s
Planning and Land Use Management (“PLUM”) Committee granted the Ethel Appeal
and determined that the Ethel Project vested in ED1’s ministerial process, a
decision upheld by the City Council on September 26, 2023.  Pet. RJN, Ex. A.
 
            4. Bedrock’s Appeal 
            On August 14, 2023, Bedrock timely
appealed the City’s conversion of the Application from an ED1 ministerial
process to a discretionary path.  AR 478-88.
The appeal explained that “as a matter of State law the HCA Preliminary
Application filed for the Project grants vesting protections that require the
City’s continued ED1 processing….” AR 479. 
Planning submitted its
report on Bedrock’s appeal on September 28, 2023.  AR 1536. 
Planning’s appeal response did not dispute that the preliminary
application’s completeness before the First Amended ED1 was issued. AR 1550.
Instead, Planning’s response argued that ED1 “is not the equivalent of an
ordinance, policy, standard, planning rule, or zoning rule,” and there is no
ability to “vest” in ED1’s ministerial process. AR 1550.  Planning concluded that vesting in ED1 “is
beyond the authorization” of the HAA.  AR
1550.  Planning added that, “[a]s of the
date of this Report, City Planning has not received further submission from [Bedrock]
that would go toward completing or processing the original ADM Application or
the converted CPC Application and ENV cases.” AR 1542.  
Also on September 28,
2023, Bedrock supplemented the Application with some of the missing items. AR 1370–535.

 
The HCD Email
Bedrock’s appeal came
before the PLUM Committee on October 3, 2023. AR 2144.  Just before the hearing, the HCD sent the PLUM
Committee an email directed at the question of whether the Project vested in
the ED1. AR 972-93. The HCD stated that the Project and the Ethel Project
“address the same question” and urged “the City to apply the law evenly across
all ED1 projects and allow projects vested by the preliminary applications to
be processed under the ‘ordinances, policies, and standards’ in effect when the
complete preliminary application was submitted.”  AR 972-93.  
At the PLUM Committtee
hearing, City Councilperson Katy Yaroslavsky asked whether the HCD had weighed
in on the vesting issue:
 
“MS.
YAROSLAVSKY: So this is a question for planning. Uh, was this project ever
issued a vesting letter?
MS.
LAMB: Uh, this is Blake Lamb with the Planning Department. Yes. This project
did receive a vesting preliminary application per the Housing Crisis Act.
MS.
YAROSLAVSKY: Uh, did HCD issue a letter specific to this project?
MS.
LAMB: I believe that HCD did issue a letter on this issue, and I believe it
was specific to the project on Ethel. But let us look at the letter and
confirm for you.”  AR 2187-88 (emphasis
added).[4]
 
The PLUM Committee
recommended denial of the appeal. AR 2156, SAR 0182–90.  
The HCD formalized its position
for the City Council appeal by issuing an October 12, 2023 letter of technical
assistance stating that HCD “already issued technical assistance on this
matter,” and to the extent “any other ED1 projects address the same question
raised by the project located at 5501-5511 N. Ethel Avenue, the technical
assistance provided in HCD’s September 14, 2023, letter applies.” AR 2025-26.
At the October 13, 2023 City
Council appeal hearing, Planning argued that the Project’s vesting rights expired
on September 29, 2023 because Bedrock did not respond to the first Incompleteness
Letter within 90 days. SAR 185-86. Planning acknowledged that Bedrock had responded
to the Incompleteness Letter and submitted the requested information within 90
days. SAR 187. The City claimed that Bedrock submitted the information at
“approximately 2:30 or 3:00 p.m.” on the last day of the deadline, and
therefore AHSS staff did not have adequate time to review and sign Bedrock’s
AHRF.  SAR 187.  Planning staff stated: “Had we gotten this
form even 1 or 2 days in advance of the September 28th deadline, we could have
expedited the review.”  SAR 187.  
The City Council denied Bedrock’s
appeal. 
 
5. Post-Appeal Incompleteness
Letters
On October 27, 2023,
following City Council’s decision to deny Bedrock’s appeal, the City sent Bedrock
a Third Incompleteness Letter explaining that the Project Application remained
incomplete. AR 1009. The letter explained that, while Bedrock believes the
proper entitlement path is ED1, Planning’s position is that it is a Density
Bonus under LAMC’s Priority Housing Program. 
AR 1009.  At the time of the Third
Incompleteness Letter, Bedrock was still missing the updated AHRF concerning the
73.2% open space reduction and the BOE letter relating to dedication and
improvements.  AR1008-10.   The Letter
listed these two items required for completeness and hastened to add that “this
communication is not a disapproval of the project….” AR 1009.  
On January 25, 2024, after
filing this lawsuit, Bedrock responded to the Third Incompleteness Letter by
providing the two required items.  AR 1157–60.
On February 22, 2024, Planning
sent Bedrock a Fourth Incompleteness Letter stating that the Application
remained incomplete because Bedrock had not submitted an Environmental
Assessment form and documents with related fees.  AR 1162.
 
6. The Second Amended ED1
On July 1, 2024, Mayor
Bass issued a third ED1 (“Second Amended ED1”), stating that any project that
has submitted “a Housing Crisis Act Vesting Preliminary Application Form to the
Department of City Planning prior to the effective date of this revised
Executive Directive shall be deemed eligible to proceed under the regulations
of the July 7, 2023, version of this Executive Directive.” Pet., RJN, Ex. C.
 
E. Analysis
Petitioners seek mandamus compelling the City to carry out its duties pursuant to the PSA and HAA, accept Bedrock’s development application as complete, and approve the Project
within 60 days.
 
1. Violation of the HAA
            The City bears the burden of proving that its decision
conforms to the conditions specified in section 65589.5. 
§65589.6.   
 
a. Vesting Rights Under
ED1
The Legislature enacted the HCA in 2019 to prohibit what the
Senate Floor Analysis described as “the most egregious practices” by local
governments that prevent the development of new housing.  Pet. RJN, Ex. B, p. 7.  Specifically, the HCA added a new
“preliminary application” process designed to “stop[] them from changing the rules on builders who are in the midst of
going through the approval process.”  Id.

            Under
the HAA, a project associated with a complete preliminary application under section 65594.1 “shall be
subject only to the ordinances, policies, and standards adopted and in effect
when a preliminary application . . . was submitted.”  §65589.5(o).  A project application is reviewed against
zoning ordinances, land use plans, and standards in effect “at the time” or “on
the date the application was deemed complete.” 
§§ 65589.5(d)(5),
(h)(5), (j)(1).  Thus, section 65941.1 allows a housing developer to submit a preliminary
application, which under the HAA vests the “ordinances, policies, and standards”
in effect at the time a complete preliminary application is submitted.  § 65589.5(o)(1).  The HAA defines “ordinances, policies,
and standards” broadly to include “general plan, community plan, specific plan,
zoning, design review standards and criteria, subdivision standards and
criteria, and any other rules, regulations, requirements, and policies of a
local agency….”  §65589.5(o)(4).  
Bedrock submitted a preliminary application
for the 100% affordable 360-unit housing Project on March 15, 2023, when ED1
was still in place and prior to the issuance of the First Amended ED1 in June
2023.  AR 105-14, 1588-90, 1639-41.  Initially, the City concluded that Project
vested in ED1 and so informed Bedrock and Property owner Winnetka.  AR 353.  On July 
6, 2023, the City told them that the Project was no longer eligible for
ED1 processing. AR 423.  
Petitioners contend that this was
an error because the Project qualified for ED1.  Nor is there any question that Bedrock
submitted a complete preliminary application and obtained vesting rights before
ED1 was amended, as Planning confirmed.  AR
1550.   The only question this court needs to
decide is whether ED1 fits within the HAA’s broad definition of “ordinances,
policies, and standards.”  The answer is
clearly yes, as HCD repeated to the City multiple times and the City recognized
by granting vesting rights in ED 1 for the Ethel Project.  Pet., Op. Br. at 12-13.
            According to Petitioners, the plain
language of the HAA demonstrates that the Legislature intended the HAA’s
vesting provision to apply to more than just legislatively enacted development
standards. Section 65589.5(o) broadly defines the items eligible for vesting as
“ordinances, policies, and standards”, but also includes “any other rules,
regulations, requirements, and policies of a local agency….”[5]
This phrase necessarily means something more than just legislatively enacted
general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards.  Courts must “reject interpretations that
render particular terms of a statute mere surplusage, instead giving every word
some significance.” MacIsaac v. Waste Management Collection & Recycling,
Inc., (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1082; see also People
v. McCart, (1982) 32 Cal.3d 338, 342-43 (“significance should be given to
every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative
purpose”).  The phrase “any other rules,
regulations, requirements, and policies” must include policies beyond
legislatively enacted ordinances.  The
stated purpose of the vesting provision is to stop jurisdictions from changing
the rules on builders in the midst of the approval process in a manner that
would impact the feasibility of projects and ED1 clearly falls within that
category.  Pet., Op. Br. at 13-14.
            The City argues that Petitioners have
no vested rights under ED1 because executive directives are not zoning or land
use ordinances, policies, or standards within the meaning of state law or the
LAMC.  §§ 65589.5, 65941.1.  There can be no vesting in any version of ED1
because ED1 was issued by the Mayor in furtherance of her Declaration of a
local state of emergency on homelessness. 
Pursuant to City Charter section 231(i), the Mayor has the power
and duty to “declare a local emergency and coordinate the City’s emergency
response activities in accordance with procedures established by ordinance, and
supervise emergency preparedness activities in the various departments and
offices, including the Mayor’s office, in a manner consistent with City
policy.”  Opp. at 14.
            A mayoral directive is distinct from
a City policy.  Under LAAC section 8.29: 
 
“During
the period of a local emergency, and with respect to emergency preparedness and
response activities, the Mayor shall be the Director of the Emergency
Operations Organization, and all powers and duties herein conferred upon the
Board or any officer or chief of a division shall be exercised subject to the
direction and approval of the Mayor. The Director is authorized to promulgate,
issue and enforce rules, regulations, orders and directives which the
Director considers necessary for the protection of life and property.”  City’s RJN, Ex. A (emphasis added).  
 
            LAAC sections 8.27 and 8.31,
consistent with section 8630,
make clear that an emergency declaration is limited in duration.  Upon the termination of an emergency “by
operation of law, such rules, regulations, orders, and directives shall
terminate and be of no further force or effect.”  LAAC §8.31. 
City RJN, Ex. A.  Opp.  at 14.
            A mayoral directive with such a
limited timeline and scope does not equate to the type of zoning policies in
which an applicant traditionally vests. 
Nor is it the type of local policy that is within the scope of vesting
described in the HAA.  The policies
vested by a preliminary application are those planning and zoning policies
adopted through a process reviewed by the City Planning Commission and City
Council and determined to be consistent with the City’s general plan, among
other findings.  See City Charter
§558 (requirements for zoning).  This administrative
process provides the time to consider the City’s long- and short-term policies,
provides a more robust administrative record, and involves greater public
involvement and debate than a mayoral directive issued on an emergency basis.  Opp. at 14.
            The City concludes that the HAA’s
reference to “ordinances, policies, and standards” is intended to vest projects
against changes in long-term substantive requirements, not the temporary
emergency processing schedules referenced in ED1.  ED1 provides an expedited process, but
it does not change the land use and zoning ordinances, policies, and standards
that impact the scope and substantive requirements for a project.  See City Charter §231(j).  Opp. 
at 15.
            The
City makes good policy arguments about the hurried and less thoughtful crafting
of mayoral directives, but ultimately that policy does not affect the plain
meaning interpretation of both the HAA and ED1. 
In fixating on whether ED1 is an “ordinance policy or standard” under
the HAA, the City ignores the language in section 65589.5(o) that expresses the
Legislature’s intent to apply the vesting rule broadly.  The HAA extends the vesting rule to general
plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and “any other rules,
regulations, requirements, and policies of a local agency…” (§ 65589.5(o)
(emphasis added).  Section 65589.5(o)
clearly states that vesting applies to all rules and policies, not just traditional
general plan/zoning ordinances and enactments.
            City
Charter section 231(i) provides that the Mayor may establish procedures and
implement policies not inconsistent with the City Charter or an ordinance
through issuance of mayoral directives that are binding on all departments,
commissions, appointed officers and employees of the City.  City RJN Ex. A.  ED1 is just such a policy and there is no
evidence or argument that it was inconsistent with any City Charter provision
or ordinance.  It therefore is within the
scope of section 65589.5(o) for vesting.
 
            b.
The Second Amended ED1  
            Petitioners
persuasively argue that the City admitted that ED1 is subject to the HAA’s
vesting rights provision in its most recent Second Amended ED1.  Under the City’s
ED1 Guidelines, applicants are informed that the submission of a preliminary
application “locks in” the local planning and zoning rules.  AR 1605.  On July 1, 2024, Mayor Bass issued the
Second Amended ED1, which states that any project submitting “a Housing Crisis
Act Vesting Preliminary Application Form to the Department of City Planning
prior to the effective date of this revised Executive Directive shall be
deemed eligible to proceed under the regulations of the July 7, 2023 version
of this Executive Directive.”  Pet., RJN,
Ex. C, p. 7 (emphasis added).  In other
words, the Second Amended ED1 explicitly authorizes the vesting of a
preliminary application under section 65941.1 based
on the First Amended ED1.  Pet., Op. Br.
at 14; Reply at 4-5.
            The City does not respond to
this argument.  The City cannot pick and
choose which version of ED1 is subject to state vesting.  Any project that submits a preliminary
application is granted vesting rights, and those vesting rights extend to all existing
local rules, regulations, requirements, and policies – including the version of
ED1 in place at the time.  
 
            c.
The HCD Letter
            The HCD has agreed that ED1 is a rule or policy supporting
vesting upon submission of a complete preliminary application under section
65589.5(o), both in connection with the Project as
well as the Ethel project.  AR 972-93,
1853-55.  
The deference and the weight given to an
agency’s interpretation is situational and dependent on the presence or absence
of factors supporting the merit of the interpretation.  Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Board of
Equalization, (“Yamaha”) (1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 7-8, 12.  Some deference is warranted where there are
"indications of careful consideration by senior agency officials" or
"the agency 'has consistently maintained the interpretation in question.’”  Id. at 13.  An administrative construction of a statute
is only entitled to as much deference as is warranted by “the thoroughness
evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency
with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it
power to persuade, if lacking power to control”.  Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. Franchise Tax
Bd., (2001) 25 Cal.4th 508, 524.  
The City argues that the HCD’s opinion is not
binding on the City Council or this court. 
See, e.g., Interinsurance
Exch. of the Auto. Club v. Superior Court, (2007) 148 Cal. App. 4th 1218,
1236 (no deference need be granted to state agency’s letter opinion
regarding the term “premium”).  While HCD
can opine on the proper interpretation of the Government Code, the issue of
what constitutes a City rule or policy rests with the City Charter, LAAC, LAMC,
and City Council, not HCD.  See Yamaha, supra,
19 Cal. 4th at 14–15.  Opp. at
18.
Moreover, the HCD technical
assistance letters are not persuasive because the City is a charter city and has
the authority to govern and manage its municipal affairs, adopt mayoral
emergency directives, zone land, and to adopt general plans, zoning ordinances,
and related development standards.  Cal. Const. art. XI, § 5, 7.  Neither the Legislature nor a state agency
may “interfere in the government and management of the municipality.”  Ex Parte Braun, (1903) 141 Cal.
204, 209.  Municipal land use and
zoning regulations are municipal affairs. 
Committee of Seven
Thousand v. Superior Court, (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 491, 511.  This constitutional power extends to the
power to interpret its zoning regulations and development standards and to
determine what constitutes planning and zoning ordinances and policies.  See, e.g., City of Walnut Creek,
(1980) 101 Cal. App. 3d 1014, 1021 (“The construction placed on a piece of
legislation by the enacting body is of very persuasive significance. Also,
construction of a statute by officials charged with its administration must be
given great weight”).  The “fundamental
rule [is] that interpretation of the meaning and scope of a local ordinance is,
in the first instance, committed to the local agency….”  Friends of Davis v. City of Davis,
(2000) 83 Cal. App. 4th 1004,
1015.  Accordingly, the court should
not treat HCD’s opinion of ED1 as persuasive or instructive.  Opp. at 18-19.
It is true that
the HCD’s technical assistance letter for the Ethel project, and its email and
technical assistance letter for the Project, are not binding.  It is also true that the City may interpret
its own Mayoral directive without interference from HCD.  However, no City decision-maker or authority has
purported to interpret ED1. Only Planning has done so as art of its advocacy
before the City Council.   AR 1550. 
An agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statute consisting
only of the agency's litigating position is entitled to no deference.  Culligan Water Conditioning, Inc. v. State
Bd. of Equalization, (1976) 17 Cal. 3d 86, 92-93.  The HCD’s technical
letter for the Ethel project is well-reasoned, conforms to a straightforward
reading of section 65589.5(o), and expresses a
view consistent with its view for this Project. 
The HCD opinions supporting Petitioners’ position are entitled to
some weight.  
            
            d. The First Amended ED1 Did Not Purport to Clarify ED1
The
City argues that Mayor Bass’s ED1 was meant to apply to multi-family zones, as
evidenced by the fact that it expedited the 31 pending 100% affordable projects
in multi-family zones that were languishing in the City’s pipeline at the time.
 AR 1540; City RJN Ex. B.  The referenced 31 projects are only located
in zones that allow multi-family uses.  
The
City always retains authority to exercise its police powers which are the basis
for zoning decisions.  DeVita v. County of Napa,
(1995) 9 Cal. 4th 763, 782.  Thus,
the First Amended ED1 may be applied retroactively to projects where, as here,
there is evidence that retroactive application is necessary to trigger the
application of ordinances, policies and standards that are necessary to protect
public health and welfare.  See, e.g.,
§65589.5(o)(2); LAMC §12.26.A.3 (identifying
exceptions to vesting).  See generally
Davidson v. County of
San Diego, (1996) 49 Cal. App. 4th 639, 649.  This is consistent with the Mayor’s authority
under LAAC section 8.29 as the Director of the Emergency Operations
Organization.  City RJN, Ex. A.  Opp. at 16.
The
City argues that its interpretation of its Mayor’s executive directives is
“entitled to great weight unless [] clearly erroneous or unauthorized.” Symons Emergency Specialties
v. City of Riverside, (2024) 99 Cal. App. 5th 583, 600 (2024)
(“deference is appropriate even if the language of the ordinance is susceptible
to more than one reasonable interpretation”). 
The court should defer to the City’s interpretation regarding the
purpose of ED1 because it has discretion over the interpretation of the limits
and breadth of ED1—a processing schedule that was faster than required by state
housing statutes.  See generally §§ 65913.4, 65950(a)(4-5).  See also People v. Continola, (1993)
15 Cal. App. 4th Supp. 4th 20, 24–25 (although mayor’s emergency
curfew order was silent on the issue, ordinance making it a crime to violate
the order did not apply to homeless persons who did not perform an act to
imperil lives or property).  The City is
entitled to greater deference because Planning and the Mayor have relevant
expertise, and the ED1 text is “entwined with issues of fact, policy, and
discretion” as disclosed by the ED1 record. 
Yamaha, supra,
19 Cal. 4th at 10–12.  Opp. at 15-16.
            The court
agrees that the City has authority to interpret its own directives and that the
Mayor has authority to clarify a directive. 
The problem is that nothing in ED1 indicates that it is restricted to multi-family
zones.  AR 1588-90,1592-605.  The First Amended ED1 added this restriction
without any reference or suggestion that it was clarifying the intent of ED1.  AR 1639-41. If ED1 was intended to prohibit
projects in single-family zones, there at least should have been some clarifying
language in the First Amended ED1.  There
is none.  “The courts will not infer that
the Legislature intended only to clarify the law unless the nature of the
amendment clearly demonstrates that this is the case [citation] or the
Legislature itself states in a particular amendment that its intent was to be
declaratory of the existing law.”  Medina
v. Bd. of Ret., (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 864, 869–70.[6]  
As Petitioners correctly note (Reply
at 6), even if the City’s reading of ED1 was plausible, in interpreting
the HAA, the court does not defer to the City’s
interpretation of its own rules and regulations.  Although a court would normally defer to an
agency’s interpretation of its own ordinances, land use decisions under the HAA
are different precisely because the HAA cabins the discretion of local
agencies. CARLA, supra, 68 Cal.App.5th at
844.  The court must engage in a
“more rigorous independent review…in order to prevent the City from
circumventing what was intended to be a strict limitation on its
authority.”  Ruegg & Ellsworth v.
City of Berkeley, (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 277,
299.  The court must independently apply
section 655589.5(f)(4) to determine whether substantial evidence would allow a
reasonable person to conclude that the Project complies with ED1.  Id. at 845. 
Nothing in the First Amended ED1
shows that it was intended to clarify ED1 and therefore the court can only look
to ED1’s plain language.  The fact that Planning
confirmed that the Project complied with ED1 is substantial evidence that it
was not limited to multi-family zones. 
AR 353-65.

The Doctrine of Estoppel does Not Apply
The
City argues that Petitioners essentially seek estoppel, and it is well settled
that the City cannot be estopped from applying its zoning laws.  “A party ‘faces daunting odds in establishing
estoppel against a governmental entity in a land use case. Courts have severely
limited the application of estoppel in this context by expressly balancing the
injustice done to the private person with the public policy that would be
supervened by invoking estoppel to grant development rights outside of the
normal planning and review process. 
Golden Gate Water Ski Club
v. County of Contra Costa, (2008) 165 Cal. App. 4th 249, 259
(citations omitted).  Indeed, the
“doctrine of equitable estoppel will not be invoked as a matter of law even
where a property owner relies on a permit issued by the public entity but the
permit violates a zoning ordinance.”  Id. at 260.  Opp. at 17.
Allowing
Bedrock’s preliminary application to vest due to an error in ED1 application
would effectively estop the City from applying its zoning code.  The City is entitled to correct its initial
erroneous processing of the Project’s preliminary application because estoppel
arguments against government agencies are disfavored.  See generally Feduniak v. California
Coastal Commission, (2007) 148 Cal. App. 4th 1346, 1372–77 (reversing order
estopping Coastal Commission from enforcing an easement and permit
restrictions); Childhelp
v. City of Los Angeles, (2023) 91 Cal. App. 5th 224.  See
also Consaul v. City of San Diego,
(1992) 6 Cal. App. 4th 1781, 1794 (city cannot be estopped from enforcing
laws); Fontana v. Atkinson, (1963) 212
Cal. App. 2d 499, 509 (“The mere fact that, without more, city officials
fail to enforce a zoning ordinance against a violator will not estop the city
from subsequently enforcing it against him.”). 
Opp. at 16-18.
The
City relies (Opp. at 17) on Pettitt v. City of Fresno, (“Pettitt”) (1973) 34
Cal. App. 3d 813, 816, in which the Pettitts purchased a building spanning
two addresses—one residential, one retail—to open a beauty salon.  The city’s planning department sent the
Pettitts’ agent a letter representing that both addresses had a non-conforming
right allowing retail commercial use in an area zoned single family
residential.  Id.  The Pettitts purchased the building, obtained
a building permit, and spent substantial remodeling costs to turn the entire
building into a beauty salon.  Id. at 816–17.  The city revoked the building permit after
the work was done and denied the Pettitts’ efforts to obtain a permit or
variance.  Id. at 817–18.  The court of appeal rejected the Pettitts’ estoppel
argument, explaining that “estoppel will not be invoked against a government
agency where it would defeat the effective operation of a policy adopted to
protect the public.”  Id. at 822.  
The
City argues that, while ED1 did not expressly carve out single-family zoned
areas, the clarified First Amended ED1 corrected that error just months
later.  The City’s zoning did not change
by virtue of ED1 and the First Amended ED1, nor could it.  See City Charter §558 (City’s RJN, Ex.
A) (zone change procedures).  That the
City made an error by accepting Bedrock’s preliminary application does not
estop the City from applying the procedural zoning requirements that exist for
the greater public’s health and welfare. 
Pettitt, 34
Cal.App.3d 813, 819 (application of estoppel would “nullify ‘a strong rule
of policy, adopted for the benefit of the public….’”).  An applicant cannot take advantage of the
City’s error to obtain an entitlement that was not intended to be available,
and at a cost to the general public.  Opp.
at 18.
The City’s argument suffers
from the defect that there is no evidence the First Amended ED1 clarified ED1
to reflect its purpose.  The rule
disfavoring the application of estoppel against local governments has no
bearing on Petitioners’ claim that the City violated state housing laws. The
HAA explicitly applies to charter cities and courts have confirmed that the HAA
does not violate a charter city’s municipal authority.   §
65589.5(g); CARLA, supra, 68 Cal.App.5th at 851. As CARLA
explained: “[T]he HAA does not wrest control from local governments so much as
require them to proceed by way of clear rules adopted in advance, rather than
by ad hoc decisions to accept or reject proposed housing.”  Id. 
See Reply at 6-7.  Estoppel
does not apply to the application of ED1 to vest Bedrock’s rights under section
65589.5(o)(1).
 
f. Bedrock’s Vesting Rights Did Not Expire
Under the PSA 
The
purpose of the PSA is “to expedite decisions”
on development projects.  The PSA is solely
designed to gather information about the project being proposed, not to
determine whether a project is zoning compliant. Once a development project
application has been submitted, an agency must first determine whether the
application is complete and provide an exhaustive list of incomplete items.  §65943(a).[7]  
In SB 330, the
Legislature added a provision to the PSA preliminary application process
specifically for housing development projects, the purpose of which is to secure
vesting rights and lock into place existing development standards.  §65941.1. 
To maintain vesting rights, an applicant must submit a development
application within 180 days of submitting a preliminary application.  §65941.1(d). 
Additionally, if an agency makes an incompleteness determination “pursuant
to Section 65943”, the applicant must submit the information needed to complete
the application within 90 days or the preliminary application expires.  Id.  Once an applicant resubmits an application in
response to an agency’s incompleteness determination, a new 30-day period begins
wherein the agency must make another completeness determination. §65943(a).
An incompleteness
determination “pursuant to Section 65943” includes both an initial completeness
determination and any subsequent determination made in response to a
resubmittal.  In other words, each time a
new written completeness determination is made pursuant to section 65943, an
applicant has 90 days to respond in order to maintain vesting rights.  
The City argues that an applicant does not
have 90 days to respond each time an incompleteness determination is made.   The developer
has 180 days after submitting a preliminary application to submit “all of the
information” required for a complete application.  §65941.1(d)(1).  If there is an incompleteness determination,
the developer “shall submit” the information for completion in 90 days.  §65941.1(d)(2).  A failure to do so means that “the
preliminary application shall expire and have no further force or effect.”  Id. 

According to the City, there is no basis for
an applicant to obtain an infinite number of 90-day opportunities to complete
its project application and get 90 days to respond “each” time a new
completeness determination is made.  The
plain language of section 65941.1
indicates the 90-day provision is designed to cut off vesting rights.  Petitioners’ interpretation would
impermissibly interpret the 180-day and 90-day time periods out of existence. Select Base Materials, Inc.
v. Bd. of Equalization, (1959) 51 Cal. 2d 640, 645, 647 (statutes are
“construed with reference to the whole . . . so that all may be harmonized and
have effect” and to avoid rendering “nugatory important provisions of the
statute.”)  Opp.
at 20.
The City
notes that it has discretion to set the application completeness
requirements.  §65940. 
Bedrock’s Project Application was not complete (AR 1541–42, 1008–10)
and its preliminary
application vesting rights expired on September 28, 2 023, 90 days after the
City issued its June 30, 2023 Incompleteness Letter.  §65941.1(d).  The City’s October 27, 2023 Incompleteness Letter
explained how the Project Application still was incomplete even under an ED1
processing theory based on Bedrock’s September 28, 2023 attempt to supplement
its application.  AR 1008–10.  Opp. at 20.
Since Bedrock did not complete its Application
prior to its appeal, the City Council agreed with Planning’s determination that
the Application was incomplete under the PSA.  The
City possesses discretion to take or reject an incomplete application and no
writ may issue requiring the City to accept an incomplete application.  See Hutchinson v. City of San Francisco, (1993) 17 Cal. App. 4th
791, 796; County of San Diego v. California,
(1998) 164 Cal. App. 4th 580, 593 (traditional writ of mandate may not issue
where agency is required to exercise discretion or judgment).  Opp. at 19-20.[8]
Thus, the City
argues that an applicant must achieve a complete application within 90 days of
the initial incompleteness determination made pursuant
to section 65943, reading the PSA’s iterative process out of the
statute.  MacIsaac, supra, 134
Cal.App.4th at 1082 (courts must interpret statutes to “giv[e] every word some
significance”).  In other words, even if
an applicant timely responds to an initial incompleteness determination within
90 days, under the City’s theory the applicant does not get another opportunity
to respond to a second incompleteness determination made “pursuant to Section
65943,” and the preliminary application will expire. The City does not explain
why an applicant only gets 90 days to respond from the first incompleteness
determination made pursuant to section 65943, and not a subsequent
incompleteness determination.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 14-15.
The City
incorrectly interprets the PSA.  Section
65941.1(d)(1) provides that the applicant must submit an application that
includes all necessary information for processing within 180 days after
submitting the preliminary application. 
The plain language of the provision sets a 180-day deadline.  Section 65941.1(d)(2) provides that, if the
agency determines that the application is incomplete pursuant to section 65943,
the applicant shall submit the missing information within 90 days and the
failure to do so will mean the application has expired.  In turn, section 65943 provides that the
agency must make a written determination on the completeness of an application
within 30 days of submittal, or it will be deemed complete.  §65943(a). 
Upon receipt of “any resubmittal of the application, a new 30-day period
shall begin, during which the public agency shall determine the completeness of
the application.”  Id.  
The relationship
of section 65941.1(d)(1) and (2) is that if an applicant fails to submit an application
within 180 days after the preliminary application, the 180-day deadline in
section 65941.1(d)(1) bars it from doing so. 
If, on the other hand, an applicant submits an application within 180
days, it is timely even if it is incomplete. 
This is true despite the language in section 65941.1(d)(1) that the
application must include “all of the information required to process the
development application”.  An incomplete
application submitted within 180 days is still timely under section
65941.1(d)(1).
The incompleteness
issue is dealt with by section 65941.1(d)(2). 
The City contends that the applicant receives a single 90-day period to
cure the incomplete application.  If the
information submitted does not complete the application, then the preliminary
application expires and is no further force and effect.  §65941.1(d)(2).  
Not so.  There may be multiple iterations of this
90-day submission and 30-day evaluation process.  So long as an applicant meets the 90-day
deadline, there is no bar.  Multiple
iterations of the 90-day submission/30-day review are permissible under section
65941.1(d)(2).  Section 65941.1(d)(2)
expressly refers to completeness pursuant to section 65943.  In turn, section 65943(a) refers to “any
subsequent review of the application determined to be incomplete”, “any
resubmittal of the application”, and “a new 30-day period.”  The use of the words “any” and “new” in
section 65943(a) indicate that multiple resubmissions of an application may be
made.  The statute supports Petitioners’
reading that the submission and completeness evaluation for an application is
an iterative process with no limit on the number of submissions.
The court’s
conclusion is supported by the fact that the court is “not dealing with the PSA
in a vacuum, but rather in its relation to the HAA,” and the Legislature has
mandated the HAA must be interpreted to “afford the fullest possible weight to
the interest of, and the approval and provision of, housing.”  Save Lafayette, supra, 85
Cal.App.5th at 855  (refusing to
interpret the PSA to treat a multi-year delay as a resubmittal that terminated
earlier vesting rights and instead recognizing the project’s decade-old vesting
rights in part because the HAA’s policy that favors housing).[9]  The City’s
interpretation makes it more difficult for applicants to maintain vesting
rights and directly conflicts with the Legislature’s clear mandate to interpret
its provisions in favor of housing development.[10]
As Petitioners
argue, Bedrock responded to the City’s incompleteness determination[11] within 90 days as required.  Bedrock’s preliminary application and
associated vesting rights therefore did not expire.  Pet., Op. Br. at 15.
Petitioners are
correct that the City’s failure to recognize their vesting rights is a
violation of the HAA.  The HAA
states that a local agency commits a violation of the HAA if it “required or
attempted to require a housing development project to comply with an
ordinance, policy, or standard not adopted and in effect when a preliminary
application was submitted.”  §65589.5(k)(1)(A)(i)(III)
(emphasis added).   The City confirmed
that the Project was consistent with ED1, only to change course and issue a letter
stating that the Project was no longer eligible “[p]er the [First Amended ED1]
issued by Mayor Karen Bass on June 12, 2023”. 
AR 423.  The First Amended ED1 was
not in effect when the preliminary application for the Project was
submitted on March 15, 2023. AR 423. The City’s attempt to require the Project
to comply with policies not in effect when the preliminary application was
submitted is a violation of the HAA.  Pet.,
Op. Br. at 16.[12]
 

g. The City Disapproved the Project Under the HAA
It is undisputed that the Project meets the definition of
“housing for very low, low-, or moderate-income households” under the HAA.  §65589.5(h)(3).  The HAA prohibits a
local government from disapproving an affordable housing project unless it
makes written findings based on a preponderance of the evidence in the record
as to one of five specifically enumerated findings. §65589.5(d).  The
HAA does not limit disapprovals only to final decisions on entitlements, but
rather defines disapproval to mean any instance in which an agency “[v]otes on
a proposed housing development project application and the application is
disapproved, including any required land use approvals or entitlements
necessary for the issuance of a building permit….”  §65589.5(h)(6). 
The City argues that no decision was made to approve or deny
the Project.  Under the Brown Act, the
City Council could not have voted to disapprove the merits of the Project
Application because the merits were not on the City Council agenda.  §54954.2(a)(1), (a)(3), (b)
(actions limited to agenda items). 
Instead, the City Council found the Application was not complete under section 65943, the item
actually on its agenda.  Id.  As the staff report explains: “This report
does not make a recommendation regarding the merits of any of the referenced
Development Project Applications (i.e., the ADM Application and CPC
Application); and no decision-maker has approved, conditioned, or disapproved
the referenced applications either.”  AR 1539.  The question of Project approval or
disapproval was not before City Council. 
See AR 2144–45 (agendizing for PLUM Committee Bedrock’s appeal
from Planning’s determination of application incompleteness under the PSA); AR 2243–44
(agendizing for the City Council the PLUM Committtee’s recommended action to sustain
Planning’s determination of incompleteness under the PSA).  Opp. at 20-21.
The City argues that there is no text in the HAA or the PSA
that equates a decision on a PSA incompleteness appeal with a disapproval of
the merits of a development application subject to the HAA.  Compare § 65589.5(d)(5), (h)(6)
(HAA definition of “disapprove” references the “approvals or entitlements” for
a building permit); §§ 65925-65934,
65940, 65941.1, 65943 (PSA provisions). 
Equating these actions would impermissibly nullify a city’s ability to
enforce its list of application requirements. §§ 65940, 65943; Select Base Materials,
supra, 51 Cal. 2d 640, 645, 647 (statutes are harmonized to avoid
rendering “nugatory important provisions of the statute.”)  This is because every decision enforcing the
application requirements would be considered a disapproval under the HAA.  Opp. at 21.
HAA disapproval does not have to be the disapproval of an entitlement
for a building permit. The HAA defines “disapproval” to mean any instance in
which a local agency “[v]otes on a proposed housing development project
application and the application is disapproved, including any required
land use approvals or entitlements necessary for the issuance of a building
permit.” § 65589.5(h)(6) (emphasis added). The term “including” is a “term of
enlargement rather than limitation” and that “including” certain actions does
not “place thereon a meaning limited to the inclusions.” Flanagan v.
Flanagan, (2002) 27 Cal. 4th 766, 774. Thus, while the HAA definition
expressly applies to “approvals or entitlements,” it is not exhaustive.  Additionally, the definition applies to any “land
use approvals or entitlements necessary for the issuance of a
building permit,” not just to approvals and entitlements for building permits.  This includes preliminary approvals leading up
to the approval of a building permit.  Any
vote that is necessary for an applicant to obtain a building permit and begin
construction is governed by the HAA and a determination of application
completeness is a necessary step in obtaining a building permit.  Reply at 9-10.
Not all incompleteness
decisions will qualify as HAA disapprovals, and the issue is a factual
one.  As Petitioners argue, the City’s
argument that PSA completeness determinations can never be disapprovals under
the HAA is overbroad.  The Legislature
defined disapproval broadly to prevent local government tactics to prevent
housing development.  Reply at 10.  
The City Council’s decision on completeness for the Project application
qualifies as a disapproval.  Planning sent Bedrock a Disapproval Letter stating that the project
was ineligible for ED1 and that Bedrock’s ministerial application was being
converted to a discretionary application. 
AR 1749.  The City’s Second
Incompleteness Letter confirmed the conversion to a discretionary process and
required the submittal of a discretionary application and additional fees.  AR 425-26. 

Bedrock appealed the determination
of ED1 ineligibility and the conversion to a discretionary project.  AR 478-88.  Planning’s staff
report for the appeal argued that the Project was not eligible for ED1 (AR
1550, 1552, 1556) and the City Council adopted the staff report’s rationale.  AR 1537. 
While the City Council purported to vote only on whether the Application
was complete, its vote disapproved the Project because Planning staff cancelled
the ministerial application, converted it to a discretionary approval, issued a
new application case number, and required Bedrock to submit a new application
and $35,000 in additional permit fees.  AR
425-26.  Planning staff confirmed during
the appeal hearing that the only missing items were those needed for a discretionary
application.  AR 2189.  The City’s cancellation of the ministerial
application fit within the HAA’s broad definition of disapproval based on the determination
that the Project was not vested under ED1. 
See Pet. Op. Br. at 16-17.[13]
Petitioners’ vesting rights did
not expire, and the City’s refusal to recognize them violated the HAA.
 
2. The City Violated the
PSA
The PSA provides specific
procedures that a local agency must follow when an application is submitted. An
agency must first determine whether the application is complete and provide an exhaustive
list of incomplete items.  §65943(a).  In any subsequent review of an application resubmittal,
the agency shall not request any new information not stated in the
initial list of incomplete items.  Id.  Pet., Op. Br. at 17.
The HCD has explained that a
code-compliance comment “cannot be used as a basis for determining the
completeness of the application” and that when “a local jurisdiction improperly
characterizes comments as incomplete items, the jurisdiction impermissibly raises
the bar to achieving a complete application, in violation of the PSA.”  Pet. RJN, Ex. D.  The HCD’s conclusion is bolstered by (1) section
65944, which prohibits an agency from requesting the applicant “clarify,
amplify, correct, or otherwise supplement the information” submitted until “[a]fter
a public agency accepts an application as complete” and (2) HAA section
65589.5(j)(2), which provides that the local agency’s determination whether a
project is “inconsistent, not in compliance, or not in conformity with an
applicable plan, program, policy, ordinance, standard, requirement, or other
similar provision” shall occur within 30 to 60 days after the “date that the
application for the housing development project is determined to be complete.”  Pet. Op. Br. at 17. 
The City Council’s decision was
about whether the Project complies with ED1. 
See AR 1550, 1552, 1556.  The
City’s incompleteness determination was impermissibly based on its
determination that the Project was ineligible for ED1 rather than any
incomplete information.  Planning’s Fourth
Incompleteness Letter confirms that the City has all the information for the
ED1 application but refuses to approve the application due to the City Council’s
vote.  The letter explains that Planning “finds
that the project is inconsistent, because the filing path needs to be corrected….”
 AR 1163.  In other words, the City is treating
the ministerial Application as though it no longer exists because the City Council
voted to disapprove it and converted it to a discretionary application.  Whether Bedrock could submit a different application
to secure approval of the Project is irrelevant under
the PSA.
Moreover, the City’s second
incompleteness letter demanded new discretionary application materials that
were not included in the initial list of incomplete items, which is prohibited
by the PSA.  Cf. AR 410-21 and
425-26.  City staff confirmed during
the appeal hearing that the only “missing” items in the application were those
related to discretionary approvals, which were not identified in the initial
list of incomplete items.  AR 2189.  This also violated the PSA.  §65943(a).
 
3. Bad Faith
If the
court finds that an agency acted in bad faith in disapproving a project in
violation of the HAA, the appropriate remedy is an “order or judgment directing
the local agency to approve the housing development project.”
§65589.5(k)(1)(A)(ii).  “Bad faith” “includes, but is not limited to, an
action that is frivolous or otherwise entirely without merit.”
§65589.5(l).   A claim is “legally frivolous”
if it is “not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument….”  Peake v. Underwood, (2014) 227 Cal. App.
4th 428, 440.  Bad faith can also be
established based on actions that were taken for an improper purpose, such as
for political reasons.  Trujillo v.
City of Los Angeles, (1969) 276 Cal. App. 2d 333, 338; Smith v. Selma
Cmty. Hosp., (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 1, 34 (bad faith established if
action is motivated by any purpose other than the faithful discharge of legal
duties).  If an agency is found to have
disapproved a project in bad faith, a court must order the local government to
approve the project within 60 days.  §65589.5(k)(1)(A)(ii).
Petitioners note that the HCD sent
the City a technical assistance letter in connection with the Ethel Project confirming
that a housing project can vest in ED1’s ministerial approval process, urging
the City to follow the law and approve the Project.  AR 1853-55. 
The City Council heeded this directive and approved the Ethel
Project.  Mere weeks later, the City
faced the same situation for the Project. When the City Council asked staff
whether the HCD’s prior guidance only applied to the Ethel Project, staff
responded that the letter was specific to the Ethel Project but “does depict
and describe basically the situation the Project is in that’s before you
today.”  AR 2188-89.  Despite recognizing that the two projects
raised identical issues, and even though it had approved the Ethel Project just
weeks earlier, the City Council voted to disapprove the Project.  Pet., Op. Br. at 18.
Petitioners argue that this disparate
treatment of the Project alone demonstrates the frivolous basis for disapproval.  Worse, the HCD
emailed City staff and Councilmembers shortly before the City Council voted to
disapprove the Project, explaining that the Project and the Ethel
project “address the same question” and urging the City “to apply the law
evenly across all ED1 projects and allow projects vested by the preliminary
applications to be processed under the “ordinances, policies, and standards” in
effect when the complete preliminary application was submitted.”  AR 2025-26. 
Petitioners argue that Planning ignored the HCD email and misinformed the City Council that the HCD had not weighed in on the Project.
 AR 2188-89.  Pet. Op. 
Br. at 18-19.
Petitioners contend that the only
discernible difference between the two projects was their location in different
council districts. The Ethel Project is located in Council District 4,
represented by Councilmember Nithia Raman. 
The City Council followed Councilmember Raman’s lead and approved the
Ethel project. The Project is in Council District 3, represented by
Councilmember Bob Blumenfield, who openly expressed opposition to affordable
housing projects in single family zones, writing a letter to his constituents
urging them to submit comments in opposition to affordable housing in their
neighborhoods.  AR 1866-67.  Pet. Op. Br. at 19.
The City’s inconsistent conduct
shows it is motivated by political considerations rather than a good faith
interpretation of the law.  The City
agreed with the HCD that ED1 carried vesting rights for the Ethel project then came
to the opposite conclusion for the Project.  The City initially said the Project was vested
in the ED1 approval process but later reversed course.  The City now argues that ED1 does not qualify
for vesting under HAA but the Second Amended ED1 issued in July 2024 explicitly
says it does.  Reply at 7.
Petitioners conclude that the City’s politically motivated
actions are precisely why California continues to suffer from a housing crisis
despite the Legislature’s attempts to ensure fair play. As CARLA explained,
the HAA was designed to “hold local governments to a standard of objectivity in
their decisionmaking” and “require them to proceed by way of clear rules
adopted in advance, rather than by ad hoc decisions to accept or reject
proposed housing.”  68 Cal.App.5th at 850.  The City thumbed its nose at the HCD, the
Legislature, and the law when it disapproved a 100% affordable housing project
for no other reason than one of its councilmembers did not want one in his back
yard. That disapproval was clearly an act of bad faith.  Pet. Op. Br. at 19.
The City has not acted in bad faith.  The principal issues in this case are whether
ED1 was intended to create vesting rights within the meaning of section 65589.5(o)
and whether ED1 includes multi-family zones. 
There are no published appellate decisions on either issue and the City
took good faith positions on both.  Petitioners’
arguments support the reasons why they should prevail but do not show bad
faith.
While Petitioners claim that the City Council’s decision was
politically motivated, that claim is conjecture.  It is clear that the City Council was trying
to follow the law.  It approved the Ethel
project, showing that it fully supports low-cost housing development in
compliance with the HAA.  It then disapproved
the Project but not because it was opposed philosophically to low const housing
development.
Petitioners somewhat misconstrue Councilmember Blumenfield’s
letter to his constituents, which only explained that he supports ED1
generally, that ED1 had been clarified to state the Mayor’s intent that it not
apply to single family zoned lots, and that residents should submit a public
comment to the PLUM Committee if they are concerned about large apartment
buildings next to single family homes. 
AR 1866–67.  
City staff also did not mislead the PLUM Committee about the
HCD’s position on the Project.  At the
time of the PLUM Committee hearing, the HCD had issued an email for the Project
but not a letter of technical assistance. 
During the hearing, Councilmember Yaroslavsky asked Planning staff about
the HCD’s “letter.”  Planning staff
responded: “I believe that HCD did issue a letter on this issue, and I
believe it was specific to the project on Ethel. But let us look at the
letter and confirm for you.”  AR 2187-88
(emphasis added).  Planning staff was
correct that the HCD’s letter concerned the Ethel project and staff’s failure
to refer to the HCD’s email for the Project was not misleading.  
Finally, it was not bad faith for the City to disagree with the
HCD.  As Petitioners point out, the City
was between a rock and a hard place facing a lawsuit either by a developer or a
community group seeking to set aside the approval of a 100% affordable
development.  Opp. at 22.  The City did not act in bad faith under the
HAA.
            
F. Conclusion
The Petition is granted
but the City did not act in bad faith.  A
judgment and writ shall issue directing the City to set aside its disapproval
of the Project application as incomplete and take such further action consistent
with this decision as permitted by the PSA and HAA.
Petitioners’ counsel is
ordered to prepare a proposed judgment and writ, serve them on the City’s
counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days after service for any
objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then submit the
proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the existence/non-existence
of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re:
judgment is set for November 7, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
