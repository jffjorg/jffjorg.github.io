Petitioners’ 16-page opening brief and 11-page reply violate the respective
15-page and ten-page limits of CRC 3.1113(d). 
Petitioners’ counsel is admonished that a signature page counts as part
of the page limits.

All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise
stated.

Petitioners request the court to take judicial notice of (1) a Planning and
Land Use Management Committee (“PLUM”) Report and Official Action of the Los
Angeles City Council regarding an appeal of a determination of incompleteness
under the PSA for the properties located at 5501 and 5511 North Ethel Avenue (the
“Ethel Project”) (Pet. RJN Ex. A); (2) the Senate Floor Analyses of SB 330 (Pet.
RJN Ex. B); (3) a Third Revised Executive Directive No. 1 (Pet. RJN Ex. C); (4)
a June 8, 2023 notice of violation issued by the HCD to the City of La Canada Flintridge
and an August 24, 2023 HCD letter of technical assistance to the City of
Fillmore (Pet. RJN Ex. D); and (5) a certified transcript of a September 26,
2023 City Council meeting for the Ethel project (Pet. RJN Ex. E).  RJN Exhibits A and C-D are official acts and
Exhibit B is legislative history, and all of them are judicially noticed.  Evid. Code §452(b), (c).  Exhibit E is a transcript not subject to
judicial notice for the Project in this case and the request is denied. 
The City requests the court to take judicial notice of
(1) portions of the City Charter, Los Angeles Administrative Code (“LAAC”), and
Los Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) (City RJN Ex. A) and (2) a December 16,
2022, Statement Accompanying Mayor Bass’s Signing of ED1 (City RJN Ex. B).  The requests are granted, although Exhibit B
is judicially noticed for its existence, not the truth of its content.  Evid. Code §452(b), (c).


[4]
Petitioners contend that Ms. Lamb’s statement was false.   See post.


            [5] Petitioners
point out that other provisions of the HAA only apply to legislatively
enacted development standards.  A local
agency is required to identify project inconsistencies only for “general plan,
zoning, and subdivision standards and criteria, including design review
standards.”  §65589.5(j)(1); see also
§65589.5(k)(1)(A)(i)(II).  Similarly, a
local agency may disapprove an affordable housing project only where it is inconsistent
with a “jurisdiction’s zoning ordinance and general plan land use
designation.”  §65589.5(d)(5).  Pet. Op. Br. at 13. 


[6]
The City also cites the Declaration (AR 1581-86), ED1 (1588-90), the ED1 Guidelines
(1592-605), and the First Amended ED1 (AR 1639-41).  Opp. at 8. 
Other than the First Amended ED1, none makes any reference to a
limitation to multi-family housing zones.


[7] The HAA provides a separate
process to determine zoning code compliance after an application is accepted
as complete.  For projects with fewer
than 150 units, the written compliance determination shall be provided
“[w]ithin 30 days of the date that the application for the housing development
project is determined to be complete.” §65589.5(j)(2).  


[8] The loss
of vesting rights also means the loss of a section 65589.5(d) builder’s
remedy.  The HAA
prohibits a local government from applying development standards that were not in
effect at the time a preliminary application is submitted.  §65589.5(o). 
The HAA states that is a violation to require, or even attempt to
require, a project to comply with an ordinance, policy, or standard not adopted
and in effect when a preliminary application was submitted. §65589.5(k)(1)(A)(i)(III).  If vesting rights under the preliminary
application expire, then the builder’s remedy – which applies only when the local government does not have a housing element in substantial
compliance with the Housing Element Law – would not apply because the City has
a compliant housing element.  


[9] In Save Lafayette,
petitioners argued that a project application submitted in 2011 lost its PSA
vesting rights when the applicant submitted an alternative proposal in 2014 and
subsequently “revived” the 2011 application in 2018.  Id. at 846.  The court explained that although the PSA
could be interpreted to treat this multi-year delay as a resubmittal that
terminated the 2011 vesting rights, the court recognized the project’s
decade-old vesting rights in part because the HAA’s policy favoring housing
weighed against interpreting the PSA in a manner that would eliminate vesting
rights.  Id. at 855.
The City
argues that Save Lafayette is inapposite and unpersuasive on the
issue of the 90-day rule because the case applies the plain language of the HAA
and PSA to reject the argument that there is a “deemed disapproved” consequence
to the PSA’s timelines where there was no statutory text to support the
argument.  If anything, Save Lafayette supports the City’s position
because there is no statutory text to support
Petitioner’s argument of endless 90-day periods to complete the project application.  Opp. at 20. 
Perhaps, but the salient point remains that the PSA and HAA must
be interpreted to give full weight to the approval of housing.  


[10] Can the local government ever end the cycle of
resubmissions within 90 days?  Probably by
relying on the 180-day period in section 65941.1(d)(1), but the court need not
decide this issue.


[11] In
reply, Petitioners argue that Bedrock did provide a complete and legible
application within 90 days, and the City’s incompleteness determination was
invalid.  AR 1370. While the City’s Third
Incompleteness Letter concluded otherwise, the only incomplete item was a minor
discrepancy on the plans where one page stated that the Project sought a 65%
reduction in open space while another page listed a 73.2% open space reduction
– an issue that a planner could easily determine by independently calculating
the correct reduction percentage.  AR 1008–10.  Reply at 8.
The Third Incompleteness
Letter also requested the results of the BOE investigation, which, as Bedrock explained,
need not be completed until after the application is accepted as complete and was
not included on the City’s application checklist.  AR 1374, 2131.  The Third Incompleteness Letter also
requested the signature of the City’s staff on one of the application forms,
which is not “incomplete” information that the applicant can provide.  Reply at 8, n. 3.
This issue of completeness is raised for the first
time in reply and is waived.   Regency Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina Lances, Inc.,
(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333.


[12] The City argues that the HAA
does not apply at all until a local agency makes a “final merits”
decision.  Those words appear nowhere in
the HAA.  To the contrary, the HAA
applies throughout the entire application process.  The HAA requires a local government to make a
written determination of project consistency within 30 or 60 days after an
application is accepted as complete. 
§65589.5(j)(2).  The HAA applies
to certain CEQA decisions that necessarily occur before a final merits
decision.  §65589.5(h)(6)(D).  Reply at 9.


[13] The City staff report’s disclaimer that staff was not
recommending disapproval of the Project does not make it so.  The City Council’s vote was a substantive
decision regarding whether the applicant was eligible for ED1 vesting.
