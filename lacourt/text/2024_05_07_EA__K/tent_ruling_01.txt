  Case Number:  23PSCV03818    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff Engineered Products’ Application
for Right to Attach Order and Order for Issuance of Writ of Attachment is GRANTED.
The court will issue a writ for $259,299.03 and order an undertaking of
$10,000.00.  Background   Plaintiff Engineered Products (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:Plaintiff
is in the business of designing and providing turnkey storage systems for
warehouses. Ask Logistics, Inc. (“ALI”) and Carrystar Supply Chain Management
Inc. (“CSCM”) (together, Defendants”) are believed to be the same company or
CSCM is ALI’s successor. On March 1, 2023, Defendants sought a project quote
from Plaintiff. Plaintiff provided a proposal to Defendants in the amount of
$262,525.18 (“March Proposal”). The March Proposal, though presented to ALI and
Sergio Bayardo Pena (“Pena”), was accepted and signed on behalf of CSCM. On
April 11, 2023, Defendants sought an additional quote from Plaintiff for
additional services and materials for the project. Plaintiff provided a second
proposal in the additional amount of $77,956.41 (“April Proposal). The April
Proposal, though presented to ALI and Pena, was accepted by “Pena/CEO.”  On
April 13, 2023, CSCM executed a credit application with Plaintiff for the cost
of the materials to be provided and the services to be rendered ("Credit
Application"). The "Terms of Sale" section of the Credit
Application provided that payments were to be made “Net 15 days" and
"[u]pon default of payment, applicant agrees to pay all collection costs
and reasonable attorney fees that may be incurred." The Credit Application
identified Pena as the CEO of CSCM. Plaintiff's "New Customer Account
Form" was also filled out on behalf of CSCM ("Account Form").
Plaintiff performed the services and materials as per the March and April
Proposals. Plaintiff is still owed $309,299.03.On December
8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against ALI, CSCM and Does 1-25 for:1.                 
Breach of
Contract2.                 
Unjust
Enrichment On January 30, 2024, ALI’s default was
entered. On March 7, 2024, CSCM’s default was entered.A Case Management Conference is set for May
7, 2024.DiscussionPlaintiff applies for a right to attach order and writ of
attachment against Defendants. The amount to be secured by the attachment is $259,299.03,
which includes estimated costs of $0 and estimated allowable attorney fees of $0.Analysis“Attachment is a prejudgment remedy which requires a court
to make a preliminary determination of the merits of a dispute. It allows a
creditor who has applied for an attachment following the statutory guidelines
and established a prima facie claim to have a debtor's assets seized and held
until final adjudication at trial.” (Lorber
Industries, Inc. v. Turbulence, Inc. (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 532, 535.) “A
purpose of the attachment statutes is to confine attachments to commercial
situations and to prohibit them in consumer transactions. The language, ‘trade,
business or profession,’ in section 483.010, subdivision (c) fulfills that
purpose by limiting the use of attachments to ‘commercial transactions’ and
precluding them in ‘consumer transactions.’” (Kadison, Phaelzer, Woodard, Quinn
& Rossi v. Wilson (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 [citation omitted].)Attachment is
governed by Attachment Law, Title 6.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, sections
481.010-493.060. “[A]ttachment procedures are solely creatures of
statute and . . . such statutes must be strictly construed.” (Arcata Publications Group v. Beverly Hills
Publishing Co. (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 276, 279.)Procedural Considerations: “Upon the filing of the complaint or
at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply…for a right to attach order and
a writ of attachment by filing an application for the order and writ with the
court in which the action is brought.”
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 484.010, 485.210, subd. (a).) “No order or writ shall be
issued. . . except after a hearing. At the times prescribed by subdivision (b)
of Section 1005, the defendant shall be served with all of the following:
(a) A copy of the summons and complaint. (b) A notice of application and
hearing. (c) A copy of the application and of any affidavit in support of the
application.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
484.040.)On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof
of service, which reflected that ALI had been personally served with the
summons and complaint on December 15, 2023. On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff
filed another proof of service, which reflected that CSCM had been substitute
served with the summons and complaint on January 7, 2024.On January 11, 2024, the instant application
and supporting documents were filed and served via mail. The court, then, determines that adequate
notice has been provided.Substantive Considerations: “At the hearing, the court shall
consider the showing made by the parties appearing and shall issue a right to
attach order, which shall state the amount to be secured by the attachment
determined by the court in accordance with Section 483.015 or 483.020, if it
finds all of the following:1.         The claim upon which the attachment is
based is one upon which an attachment may be issued.2.         The plaintiff has established the
probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based.3.         The attachment is not sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.4.         The amount to be secured by the
attachment is greater than zero.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.090, subd. (a).)“The court's
determinations shall be made upon the basis of the pleadings and other papers
in the record; but, upon good cause shown, the court may receive and consider
at the hearing additional evidence, oral or documentary, and additional points
and authorities, or it may continue the hearing for the production of the
additional evidence or points and authorities.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.090, subd. (d).) “The court has the power
to determine disputed facts on the basis of a preponderance of the
evidence as disclosed in the affidavits and declarations… [Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 80…].” (Weil & Brown,
et al., CAL. PRAC. GUIDE:  CIV. PRO.
BEFORE TRIAL (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 9:948 (emphasis theirs).)“The following
property of the defendant is subject to attachment: (a) Where the defendant is
a corporation, all corporate property for which a method of levy is provided by
Article 2 (commencing with Section 488.300) of Chapter 8. (b) Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, all partnership
or association property for which a method of levy is provided by Article 2
(commencing with Section 488.300) of Chapter 8. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §
487.010.)Plaintiff must
provide a statement that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than
the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based, a statement that
the applicant has no information or belief that the claim is discharged in a
proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy) or that the
prosecution of the action is stayed in a proceeding under Title 11 of the
United States Code (Bankruptcy). (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.020, subds. (c) and
(d).) Plaintiff has complied with these requirements.Plaintiff must also
provide a description of the property to be attached under the writ of
attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is informed and believes that
such property is subject to attachment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.020, subd.
(e).) “Where the defendant is a corporation, a reference to ‘all corporate
property which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of
Civil Procedure Section 487.010’ satisfies the requirements of this
subdivision. Where the defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated
association, a reference to ‘all property of the partnership or other
unincorporated association which is subject to attachment pursuant to
subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010’ satisfies the
requirements of this subdivision. Where the defendant is a natural person, the
description of the property shall be reasonably adequate to permit the
defendant to identify the specific property sought to be attached.” (Id.)
Plaintiff has sufficiently complied with this requirement.CLAIM:“[A]n attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim
or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or
implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and
attorney's fees.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
483.010, subd. (a) [emphasis added].)“An attachment may
not be issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property
arising from agreement, statute, or other rule or law . . . [h]owever, an
attachment may be issued where the claim was originally so secured but, without
any act of the plaintiff or the person to whom the security was given, the
security has become valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount
then owing on the claim . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010, subd. (b).) “If the
action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a claim which arises
out of the conduct by the defendant of a trade, business, or profession.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 483.010, subd. (c).)The claim is for
money, and based upon a contract, whose total sum is more than $500. The money
due and the claims based are commercial in nature and are not based on the sale
or lease of property, a license to use property, the furnishing or services, or
the loan of money where any of the foregoing was used primarily for personal,
family, or household purposes. (Salman Decl., ¶ 14).Probable Validity:“A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely
than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on
that claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
481.190.) “In determining the probable validity of a claim where the defendant
makes an appearance, the court must consider the relative merits of the
positions of the respective parties and make a determination of the probable
outcome of the litigation.” (Loeb & Loeb v. Beverly Glen Music, Inc.
(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1110, 1120.)The court determines that Plaintiff has shown
the probable validity of the claim upon whichthe attachment is based. “[T]he
elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are (1) the existence of
the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s
breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)  Plaintiff’s
President and authorized representative, David Salman (“Salman”), represents as
follows: Plaintiff did business with CSCM and ALI (together, Defendants”) as if
they were one and the same. (Salman Decl., ¶ 4). Signatures were provided and
payments were made between the two entities interchangeably; as such, he
understands the entities to be one and the same or CSCM to be the successor to
ALI. (Id.) Defendants, which are both in the logistics business,
identify the same warehouse space and location as their principal place of
business and share chief executive officers. (Id., ¶ 4). On March 1, 2023,
Defendants sought a quote from Plaintiff, the objective of which was to
“[p]rovide purchaser with a fully integrated, turnkey storage system including
all necessary new materials, installation and structural calculations . . . to
complete this project.” (Id., ¶ 5). Plaintiff provided a Proposal to
Defendants and the quote was for $262,525.18 for the materials and services to
be provided (“March Proposal”). (Id., ¶ 5, Exh. B.) Although the March
Proposal stated that it was being presented to ALI and Sergio Bayardo Pena
(“Pena”), the quote was accepted and signed on behalf of CSCM. (Id.) On
April 11, 2023, Defendants sought an additional quote from Plaintiff for
additional services and materials for its project, which resulted in Plaintiff
providing a second Proposal for an additional amount of $77,956.41 (“April
Proposal”). (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. C.) On April 13, 2023, in connection with
the March and April Proposals (together, the “Proposals”), CSCM filled out and
executed a credit application with Plaintiff for the cost of the materials to
be provided and services to be rendered (“Credit Application”). (Id., ¶
7, Exh. D.) The Credit Application identified Pena as CSCM’s CEO. (Id.)
Plaintiff’s “New Customer Account Form” reflects that it was also filled out on
behalf of CSCM. (Id.)Plaintiff rendered
the services and provided the materials required under the Proposals. (Id.,
¶ 8). On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff issued an invoice for services rendered and
materials provided under the April Proposal (“May Invoice”). The invoice
reflected that CSCM had paid $31,182.56, leaving a balance of $46,773.85. (Id.,
¶¶ 9 and 10, Exhs. F and G). On August 22, 2023, Plaintiff issued an invoice
for services rendered and materials provided under the March Proposal (“August
Invoice”). (Id., ¶ 11, Exh. H). On December 1, 2023, ALI paid $50,000.00
to Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 12). As of December 2, 2023, the full amount of
the May and August Invoices have not been paid and Plaintiff is owed the total
principal balance of $259,299.03. (Id., ¶ 13).The court finds that Plaintiff has shown that
its claim has probable validity. Defendants are bothin default; as such, the application is
unopposed. Plaintiff’s application, then, is granted.UNDERTAKING:“Before issuance of
a writ of attachment, . . . the plaintiff shall file an undertaking to pay the
defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful attachment by
the plaintiff in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 489.210.)“Except as provided
in subdivision (b), the amount of an undertaking filed pursuant to this article
shall be ten thousand dollars ($10,000).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 489.220, subd.
(a).) “If, upon objection to the undertaking, the court determines that
the probable recovery for wrongful attachment exceeds the amount of the
undertaking, it shall order the amount of the undertaking increased to the
amount it determines to be the probable recovery for wrongful attachment if it
is ultimately determined that the attachment was wrongful. (Code Civ. Proc., § 489.220, subd. (b).)RULING:All the requirements
have been satisfied. Accordingly, the application is granted. The court will issue a writ for $259,299.03 and order an undertaking of
$10,000.00.
