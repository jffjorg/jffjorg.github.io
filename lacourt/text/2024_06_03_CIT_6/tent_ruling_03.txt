   [1] Cross-Defendants  indicate that they attempted to file the anti-SLAPP motion on March 29, 2024, but  it was rejected due to a filing error, and then successfully refiled on April  2, 2024. (Reply, 1:12-19.) The Court notes this to explain why MEG’s opposition  predates the anti-SLAPP motion.   [2] The Court  notes that Cross-Defendants refer to “Xchange” without specifying whether they  mean Xchange USA, Inc. or Xchange Logistics Corporation. (Motion, 19:27-20:3.)   [3] Plaintiffs  do not specify which plaintiff exercised this right, but the Court presumes  they meant Xchange USA, since that was the only plaintiff when this action was  filed. (See Opp., 5:1-2; Compl., ¶ 4.)   [4] Plaintiffs  again fail to specify which plaintiff they mean here. (See Opp., 5:10-11.)   [5] Plaintiffs  do not specify whether this is referring to Xchange USA or Xchange Logistics. (See  Opp., 5:11-15.) The Court admonishes Plaintiffs to be clear in their documents  filed with the Court which Plaintiff they are referring to, given the  similarities between their names.
