English-text summary: The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Cross-Defendant Ibrahim Mobarak's motion to strike portions of the cross-complaint without leave to amend. The Court finds that Ibrahim's motion to strike is well taken, as the cross-complaint's indemnification and apportionment of fault claims are duplicative of affirmative defenses in the answer to the complaint. The Court also finds that the cross-complaint's declaratory relief claim raises the same issues as the affirmative defenses asserted in the answer.
