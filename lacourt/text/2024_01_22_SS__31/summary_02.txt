And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to continue the trial date, which was filed by the defendants Amrit Raj and Astha Raj. The defendants sought to continue the trial date by approximately 8 months to allow them to file a motion for summary judgment before the trial. The plaintiff, Peter Wierzba, opposes the motion. The judge finds that the defendants have not established good cause for continuing the trial date, as they have not filed a motion for summary judgment and have not shown that they have been diligent in conducting discovery. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer to reach a stipulation to continue the trial date and to provide notice of the ruling.
