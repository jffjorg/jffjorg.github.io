 Case Number:  21STCV40027    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  ROMERO BRIGARDE, ET AL., Plaintiff(s),  vs.  FELIX TRINIDAD, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 21STCV40027  [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  January 22, 2024  I. Motion to Compel¿ Plaintiff Romero Brigarde (“Brigarde”) propounded request for production of documents (“RPDs”), set two, on Defendant Team MPE, Inc. (“MPE”) on December 27, 2022. (Mot. Decl. Saidian ¶ 3.) On February 9, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed MPE’s counsel regarding the outstanding responses, and Plaintiff’s counsel granted MPE’s counsel’s request to provide responses by March 29, 2023. (Id. at ¶¶ 4-5.) To date, MPE has not served responses. Plaintiff Brigarde therefore seeks an order compelling MPE to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Any opposition was due on or before January 8, 2024; none was filed.  For a motion to compel discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)     Therefore, because the evidence shows MPE was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, Plaintiff Brigarde’s motion is GRANTED.  MPE is ordered to serve verified responses to Plaintiff Brigarde’s RPDs, set two, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (CCP § 2031.300(a),(b).)  II. Sanctions¿ Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(c).)¿MPE did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded even though no opposition was filed pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $860 for the motion.  However, Plaintiff’s counsel does not provide his rate, and how the “reasonable amount” of $800 for drafting the motion was calculated aside from declaring two hours spent alongside two other motions. The Court will not award unspecific requests for monetary sanctions and therefore declines to award sanctions here.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 19th day of January 2024      Hon.
