And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' unopposed motions to compel and deem requests for admission admitted. The plaintiff, Melissa Jimenez, failed to serve responses to the defendants' discovery requests, including form interrogatories and requests for admission. The defendants granted an extension to serve responses, but the plaintiff has still not served responses. The court finds that the plaintiff has waived any objections to the discovery requests and orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses within 15 days. The court also deems the defendants' requests for admission admitted against the plaintiff. Finally, the court declines to award monetary sanctions to the defendants, despite their request for $500.46.
