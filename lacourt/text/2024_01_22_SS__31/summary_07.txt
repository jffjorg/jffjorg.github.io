And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where plaintiff Roberto Frausto Acevedo's attorney, Albert Abkarian, seeks to be relieved as counsel due to trouble communicating with the plaintiff. The judge notes that the proof of service provided only shows that the motion was served on October 12, 2023, and that it is unclear whether the declaration and proposed order were also served. The judge orders counsel to furnish proof of service that the declaration and proposed order were also served on October 12, 2023 before the hearing, and will deny the motion without prejudice if this is not done. The judge also notes that counsel filed multiple forms together and requests that they be re-filed separately. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and advises them to submit any objections to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person at the hearing.
