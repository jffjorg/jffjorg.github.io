SUMMARY
OF ACTION 
Plaintiff
Law Offices of L.A. Law Inc. alleges Defendant Shahrzad Shahili failed to pay
for outstanding legal services rendered in association with a marital
dissolution. Plaintiff alleges an outstanding balance of $32,555.57. 
 
On
July 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Contract, Quantum
Meruit for Services Rendered, Account Stated, Book Account, and Fraud.
Defendant answered the complaint on October 17, 2022, and filed a
cross-complaint against F. Bari Nejadpour, Susan Winchester, and Law Offices of
L.A. Law, Inc. on October 18, 2022, for Professional Negligence Legal
Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach of Contract,
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Negligent Infliction of
Emotional Distress. 
 
On
December 15, 2022, the court denied the motion to
strike the one day after the answer filed cross-complaint. On January 30, 2023,
the court sustained the demurrer to the cross-complaint with leave to amend. A
first amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach
of Contract, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress, was filed on February 27, 2023. 
 
On April 20, 2023,
the court struck the demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint. On May 30,
2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint.
 
On June 20, 2023,
the second amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach
of Contract, and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress was filed. On
September 21, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer to the third and fourth
causes of action, and sustained the demurrer to the second amended
cross-complaint for the first, second and fifth causes of action. 
 
On November 20,
2023, the third amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, and Breach
of Contract, was filed. On January 16, 2024, the court sustained the demurrer
to the Professional Negligence Legal
Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and Breach of Contract, causes of action
without leave to amend, and overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of
action for fraud and deceit. Cross-Defendants answered the third amended
cross-complaint on February 15, 2024. 
 
RULING:
Granted in Part/Denied in Part.
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant,
Law Offices of L.A. Law Inc. presents a
motion for sanctions or in the alternative to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories (set one) from Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Shahrzad Shahili. Counsel
only submits a declaration attesting to health problems, then challenging the
motion as untimely, and maintaining the the sufficiency of the responses. The
declaration also denies any meet and confer effort. Plaintiff in reply
acknowledges the lack of any meet and confer on grounds that because the motion
leads with a sanctions request, no meet and confer is required.
 
The
motion for sanctions appears as part of the request for discovery sanctions,
rather than a separate motion for issue, evidentiary or terminating sanctions.
The court disagrees with the argument that the sanctions provisions in Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.050 somehow relieves compliance with any
provisions, especially since the section references motions to compel
production of documents, rather than special interrogatories. Section 2023.020
only addresses sanctions themselves and also otherwise lacks any basis of
authority regarding compelling further response. The court therefore considers
the motion to compel further responses under the applicable standard.
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) Moving party admits to an absolute denial of any
effort to meet and confer, but submits proof of an attempt notwithstanding the
admission to the subsequent lacking effort. [Declaration of William
Silverstein, Ex. L.] The motion was timely filed 44 days later on March 6,
2024.
 
On the merits of the motion, it
appears moving party only addresses one of the four items actually within the
subject matter of the propounded discovery. The introduction to the motion,
points and authorities, and separate statement identifies numbers 15.1 and 17.1,
but the corrected declaration of William Silverstein and attached exhibits with
the propounded discovery and responses in fact only shows that
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant propounded Form Interrogatories (set two) with checked
the boxes for numbers 1, 2.5, 12.1, and 15.1. [Silverstein Decl., Ex. H.]
Responses to the four identified items were provided by mail on January 22,
2024. [Id., Ex. J, Proof of Service.] 
 
The
responses to numbers 1, 2.5, and 12.1, appear unchallenged in the instant
motion. The court declines to address any argument to compel further responses on
number 17.1, as there is a lack of proof any such discovery was propounded. 
 
On
number 15.1, Responding Party improperly references the answer to the complaint
and cross-complaint in response to the request for information in support of
affirmative defenses. The response constitutes an improper factually
incomplete answer. Responding Party may not refer to prior discovery. (Deyo
v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783–784 [“Answers must be complete
and responsive. Thus, it is not proper to answer by stating, ‘See my
deposition’, ’See my pleading’, or ‘See the financial statement’”].)
The motion is therefore granted as to number 15.1 only. Responding
is ordered to serve responses in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.220.
 
The request for sanctions is DENIED. Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant,
a law firm, is a party to the action and self represents itself in the instant
motion. Counsel presents no proof of actual payment or even identification of
other outside counsel referred, and otherwise fails to provide a separate
breakout of costs. The court therefore denies any recovery of sanctions as a
form of recovery of legal fees expended on the instant motion. (Trope v.
Katz (1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 292; Kravitz v. Superior Court (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1015, 1020; Argaman v. Ratan (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1180.) Notwithstanding, the
court can award costs, and grants the request for the $89.89 filing fees on the
motion and reply. [Silverstein Decl., ¶¶ 27-28.] Defendant and counsel are
ordered to joint and severally reimburse Plaintiff the filing fee within 30
days of this order.
