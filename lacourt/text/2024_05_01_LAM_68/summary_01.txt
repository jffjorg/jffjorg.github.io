And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants in part and denies in part the motion for sanctions or in the alternative to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories (set one) from Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Shahrzad Shahili. The court finds that the responses to numbers 1, 2.5, and 12.1 appear unchallenged in the instant motion. The court grants the motion as to number 15.1 only, finding that the response constitutes an improper factually incomplete answer. The court denies the request for sanctions, finding that Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, a law firm, is a party to the action and self-represents itself in the instant motion. The court awards costs, granting the request for the $89.89 filing fees on the motion and reply. The court orders Defendant and counsel to jointly and severally reimburse Plaintiff the filing fee within 30 days of this order.
