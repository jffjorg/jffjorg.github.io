Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Plaintiff Bryan Guino's motion to compel further responses to requests for production set one from Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. is GRANTED. The court finds that American Honda's objections are without merit and that they failed to provide a privilege log. The court also agrees to narrow the scope of the requests to focus on the 2020 Honda Accord and the symptoms experienced by the plaintiff. The court also denies the request for sanctions against American Honda and its attorneys.
