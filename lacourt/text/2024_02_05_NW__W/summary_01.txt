English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant/Cross-Complainant Eliezer Appel's application to reconsider and revoke the order lifting the stay and to modify the order with leave to refile an amended cross-complaint. The judge found that Appel did not show grounds for reconsideration, as the new facts and circumstances presented were not sufficient to warrant a change in the original ruling. Specifically, the judge ruled that Appel's failure to present new evidence and a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time was not sufficient to justify reconsideration. The judge also noted that Appel's arguments were not new or different from those presented at the original hearing. As a result, the application is denied.
