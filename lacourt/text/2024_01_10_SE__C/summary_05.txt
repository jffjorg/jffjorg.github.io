Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Gloria Chavira's motion to compel further responses to Requests Nos. 45-46 in part. The requests were overbroad and sought documents related to vehicles worldwide, which is not justified. The judge has limited the requests to 2020 Honda Pilots sold in California and ordered Defendant American Honda Motor Co. to provide further responses. The judge has also awarded sanctions in the amount of $890.00 to Plaintiff for Defendant's failure to provide sufficient justification for its discovery responses. The sanctions are to be paid within 30 days of the order.
