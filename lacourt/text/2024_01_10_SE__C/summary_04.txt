```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend her first amended complaint to add Caroline Terrazone as a defendant. The motion is procedurally defective because the declaration attached to the motion fails to state why the amendment is necessary and proper and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge notes that the defendants have provided evidence that the plaintiff knew of Terrazone's involvement in the case when the lawsuit was filed, making the motion's procedural requirements even more important.
