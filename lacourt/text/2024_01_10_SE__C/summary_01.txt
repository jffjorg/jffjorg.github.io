And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied an ex parte application filed by Vicki Lee Gibson, a third party creditor, to stay the sale of property and grant leave for the creditor to file a suit. The judge found that Gibson lacks standing to seek ex parte relief since she is not a party to the action, and no Motion for Leave to Intervene has been filed. Additionally, the ex parte hearing was improperly noticed, and the application is procedurally defective. The judge cited California Rules of Court Rule 3.1204 in support of the ruling. The court clerk is to provide notice of the denial.
