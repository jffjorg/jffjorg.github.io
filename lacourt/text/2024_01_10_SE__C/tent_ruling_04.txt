Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Amend is
DENIED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Barbara Romero (Plaintiff) moves for
leave to amend her First Amended Complaint to add Caroline Terrazone as a
Defendant.
Background
Plaintiff
filed a Complaint against Defendants Alexander Mendez, PIH Health, Inc., and
PIH Management Corp. for negligence. Plaintiff amended her Complaint on June 7,
2023 to add PIH Health Physicians. 
Legal
Standard
“A
separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify:
(1) The effect of the
amendment;
(2) Why the amendment is
necessary and proper;
(3) When the facts giving
rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and
(4) The reasons why the
request for amendment was not made earlier.”
(California
Rules of Court (CRC), Rule 3.1324.)
Discussion

The Declaration attached to the Motion fails to
state why the amendment is necessary and proper and the reasons why the request
for amendment was not made earlier. These procedural requirements are
especially necessary here, where Defendants have provided evidence that
Plaintiff knew of Caroline Terrazone’s involvement in the case when the lawsuit
was filed. (Opp., p. 4.) Thus, Plaintiff’s Motion is procedurally defective.
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Amend is DENIED.
