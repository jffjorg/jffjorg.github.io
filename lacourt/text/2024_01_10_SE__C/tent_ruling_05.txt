Plaintiff
Gloria Chavira’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production
is GRANTED in part.  Sanctions are awarded in the amount of
$890.00.  
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Gloria Chavira (Plaintiff) move to
compel Defendant American Honda Motor Co.’s (Defendant) further response to
Request for Production (set one) pursuant to CCP § 2031.310.
Background
On November 14, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendant for violations of the Song-Beverly Act for failure
to repair or repurchase Plaintiff’s vehicle.
Legal Standard
CCP § 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further answers to document requests if it finds that the response
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  The motion
shall be accompanied with a meet and confer declaration.  (CCP § 2031.310(b).)  
Meet and Confer
The Court finds that the parties adequately met
and conferred.
Discussion
Plaintiff
seeks to compel further responses to Requests Nos. 19-23, 25-30, and 45-46. 
Defendant
has produced documents as to Requests Nos. 19-23 and 25-30. Thus, Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses as to Requests Nos. 19-23 and 25-30 is
denied as moot.
Requests
Nos. 45-46 seek documents related to similar vehicles and customer complaints: 
Request
No. 45: All DOCUMENTS evidencing complaints by owners of 2020 Honda Pilot
vehicles regarding any of the complaints that the SUBJECT VEHICLE was presented
to YOUR or YOUR authorized repair facilities for repair during the warranty
period.
Request
No. 46: All DOCUMENTS evidencing warranty repairs to 2020 Honda Pilot vehicles
regarding any of the components that YOU or YOUR authorized repair facilities
performed repairs on under warranty.
These
requests are overbroad because they seek documents related to vehicles
worldwide. Therefore, these requests will be limited to repairs and customer
complaints concerning 2020 Honda Pilots sold in California. Defendant is
ordered to provide further responses to Requests Nos. 45 and 46 as to 2020
Honda Pilots sold in California. 
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
Here,
Defendant failed to act with substantial justification. Defendant has failed to
provide sufficient justification for it providing discovery responses only
after Plaintiff filed her Motion. Plaintiff seeks $2,739.00 in sanctions
against Defendant and its counsel of record, consisting of 3.6 hours drafting
the motion, two hours reviewing the opposition and drafting a reply, and one
hour preparing for and attending the hearing at a rate of $415.00 per hour and
the $60.00 filing fee. Because Plaintiff has filed a boilerplate motion, the
Court awards sanctions in the reasonable amount of $890.00 for two hours of
attorney’s fees and costs.  
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED in part with the
limitations set forth above. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED and
imposed against Defendant and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, in
the amount of $890.00. This sanction is to be paid within thirty days of this
Order.
