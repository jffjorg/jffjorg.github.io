And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to change the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to San Bernardino County. The judge finds that the main relief sought in the complaint is local in nature, as it involves the determination of real property interests and the rescission of fraudulent transfers. The judge also notes that at least one of the subject properties is located in Los Angeles County, which means that venue is proper there under CCP section 392(a). The judge rejects the defendants' argument that venue is proper in San Bernardino County under CCP section 392(a), as the main relief sought is not solely related to real property rights. The judge's ruling is consistent with long-standing caselaw discussing venue involving multiple parcels of land across different counties.
