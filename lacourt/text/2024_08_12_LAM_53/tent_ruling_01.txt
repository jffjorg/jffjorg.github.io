(1)   Order
to Show Cause why the “Verified Answer of James Jones to the Complaint of The
Law Firm of Fox and Fox, a General Partnership Composed of Frank O. Fox and
Claire S. Fox,” filed May 31, 2022, Should Not be Stricken Because it was Filed
on Behalf of Defendant James Jones Without Authority

Jones is in the Matter of the Conservatorship of James J. Jones (Case No.
20STPB06813), (2) During What Periods of Time the “Durable Power of Attorney
for Management of Property and Personal Affairs” signed by James Jones, Dated
October 30, 2017, Has Been Valid and in Effect, and Whether it is Presently
Valid and in Effect, and (3) Whether Claudia Moody Jones, as Conservator of the
Estate of James Jones, Leslie Bushnell, or Some Other Person or Attorney is the
Proper Party to be Given Notices of Trial, Hearings, and Other Matters on
Behalf of Defendant James Jones in this Action
 
The court considered the following papers filed in connection with the
two pending Orders to Show Cause: (1) “Plaintiff’s Response to Court’s OSC re
Status of James Jones’ Conservatorship and Other Orders,” filed by plaintiff
The Law Firm of Fox and Fox, a General Partnership Composed of Frank O. Fox and
Claire S. Fox (“Plaintiff”) on June 17, 2024, and   (2) “Leslie Bushnell’s (Agent for Defendant)
Response to the Order to Show Cause re James Jones Status of Conservatorship
and Other Orders,” filed by Leslie Bushnell (“Bushnell”) on July 24, 2024.
DISCUSSION
On June 13, 2024, the court issued a minute order stating, inter
alia, that it appeared to the court that (1) at the time the answer to the
Complaint was filed on behalf of defendant James Jones (“Defendant”) in this
action, Claudia Moody Jones had been appointed as conservator of Defendant’s
estate, but the answer was not filed by or on behalf of the conservator and
therefore was filed without authority and is subject to being stricken as
improper, and (2) since the Probate Court issued an order appointing Claudia
Moody Jones as conservator, notice of the Final Status Conference, trial, and
other matters in this action might not have been properly given to Bushnell on
behalf of Defendant since she might not have been authorized to receive notices
in this action on his behalf.  (June 13,
2024 Minute Order, pp. 2-3.) 
Thus, the court, in its June 13, 2024 minute order, set the following
two Orders to Show Cause for hearing on August 7, 2024: (1) Order to Show Cause
why the “Verified Answer of James Jones to the Complaint of The Law Firm of Fox
and Fox, a General Partnership Composed of Frank O. Fox and Claire S. Fox,”
filed May 31, 2022, Should Not be Stricken Because it was Filed on Behalf of
Defendant James Jones Without Authority, and (2) Order to Show Cause (i) What
the Status of the Conservatorship of the Estate of James Jones is in the Matter
of the Conservatorship of James J. Jones (Case No. 20STPB06813), (ii) During
What Periods of Time the “Durable Power of Attorney for Management of Property
and Personal Affairs” signed by James Jones, Dated October 30, 2017, Has Been
Valid and in Effect, and Whether it is Presently Valid and in Effect, and (iii)
Whether Claudia Moody Jones, as Conservator of the Estate of James Jones,
Leslie Bushnell, or Some Other Person or Attorney is the Proper Party to be
Given Notices of Trial, Hearings, and Other Matters on Behalf of Defendant
James Jones in this Action.  (June 13,
2024 Minute Order, p. 3.)  
The clerk gave notice of the court’s June 13, 2024 minute order to
Plaintiff, April Loraine Bayonne (the attorney who signed Defendant’s May 31,
2022 answer), Andrew J. Knez (Defendant’s previous attorney, substituted in as
counsel to replace April L. Bayonne in this action pursuant to a Substitution
of Attorney form filed by Bushnell), Claudia Moody Jones, Bushnell, and James
Bohm, Esq.  (June 13, 2024 Minute Order,
p. 4; June 13, 2024 Certificates of Mailing; Def. Answer, p. 1 [signed by April
Bayonne]; June 29, 2022 Substitution of Attorney, MC-050, ¶¶ 1-2, 4.)  Thereafter, on August 7, 2024, the court
issued a minute order continuing the hearing on the Orders to Show Cause to
August 12, 2024.  (Aug. 7, 2024 Minute
Order, p. 1.)  The clerk served a copy of
the August 7, 2024 minute order on Plaintiff, Andrew J. Knez, and Bushnell on
that date.  (Aug. 7, 2024 Certificate of
Mailing, p. 1.) 
First, the court discharges the Order to Show Cause why the “Verified
Answer of James Jones to the Complaint of The Law Firm of Fox and Fox, a
General Partnership Composed of Frank O. Fox and Claire S. Fox,” filed May 31,
2022, Should Not be Stricken Because it was Filed on Behalf of Defendant James
Jones Without Authority.
In response to the Order to Show Cause, the parties have submitted
evidence showing the following. 
On October 30, 2017, Defendant executed a “Durable Power of Attorney
for Management of Property and Personal Affairs,” in which Defendant appointed
Bushnell as Defendant’s attorney in fact and granted her the authority to, inter
alia, “take any actions with respect to any claim that [Defendant] may have
or that has been asserted against [Defendant] and with respect to any legal
proceeding in which [Defendant] ha[s] an interest when this Power is executed,
or in which [Defendant] later acquire[s] an interest . . . and, perform any
other acts described in California Probate Code §4459.”  (Bushnell Decl., Ex. A, Durable Power of
Attorney, ¶¶ 1.A, 2.A, subd. (10).) 
On August 7, 2020, Bushnell filed a petition to invalidate certain
amendments to the James W. Jones Revocable Trust executed by Defendant (Case
No. 20STPB06627).  (Bushnell Decl., ¶¶
12, 14.)  In December 2020, Bushnell, on
the one hand, and Defendant, Claudia Moody Jones (“C. Jones”), and Nicholas Jones
(“N. Jones”), on the other hand, executed a Settlement Agreement to resolve the
claims asserted in that action. 
(Bushnell Decl., ¶ 15.)  
The Settlement Agreement provided that (1) the parties agreed that C.
Jones was to become Defendant’s legal conservator, and, to effectuate that
agreement, C. Jones shall petition the court to apply for the conservatorship
of the person and estate of Defendant under Probate Code section 1800, et seq.,
within 30 days of the date of the agreement, and (2) the parties agreed that (i)
any rights and powers assigned to Bushnell and, in the alternative, N. Jones in
Defendant’s 2017 Durable Power of Attorney regarding Defendant’s finances are
invalidated upon the execution of the agreement and upon the appointment of C.
Jones as conservator to Defendant, except (ii) the remaining rights and powers
assigned to Bushnell and N. Jones in the alternative pursuant to the 2017
Durable Power of Attorney “will hereby be limited to only those necessary for
[Bushnell and N. Jones] to act on behalf of [Defendant] in any litigation,
arbitration, and probate matters upon the execution of this Agreement by all
parties.  (Bushnell Decl., Ex. J, ¶¶ 1,
subds. (a)(i), (a)(ii), 2, subds. (b)(i), (b)(ii).)  Bushnell executed the Settlement Agreement on
December 8, 2020, and Defendant, N. Jones, and C. Jones executed the Settlement
Agreement on December 21, 2020. 
(Bushnell Decl., Ex. J, p. 9.) 
Bushnell attests, under penalty of perjury, that the Settlement Agreement
was approved by the Probate Court on June 17, 2021.  (Bushnell Decl., ¶ 15.)  
On April 21, 2021, the Probate Court entered an “Order Appointing
Probate Conservator of the Person [and] Estate,” in which the court appointed
C. Jones as the conservator for Defendant. 
(Fox Decl., Ex. A, Order Appointing Conservator, ¶¶ 1, 4, 18.)  The court further granted to C. Jones, “in
addition to the powers granted by law . . . [,] powers under Probate Code
section 2355, specifically, that [C. Jones] has the exclusive authority to make
health care decisions for [Defendant] that [C. Jones], in good faith and based
on medical advice, determines to be necessary.” 
(Fox Decl., Ex. A, Order Appointing Conservator, Attachment No. 29.)  The Letters of Conservatorship were issued on
March 10, 2022.  (Fox Decl., Ex. B,
Letters of Conservatorship.) 
On May 19, 2022, the court issued an order setting aside the default
and default judgment entered against Defendant in this action.  Thereafter, on May 31, 2022, Defendant filed
the “Verified Answer of James Jones to the Complaint of The Law Firm of Fox and
Fox, a General Partnership Composed of Frank O. Fox and Claire S. Fox,” which was
verified by Bushnell as attorney in fact for Defendant.  (May 31, 2022 Answer, p. 8.) 
On January 30, 2024, the Probate Court issued a minute order granting
the Petition to Terminate Conservatorship filed on November 13, 2023 by C.
Jones.  (Bushnell Decl., Ex. M, Jan. 30,
2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  
Based on the evidence presented, it is not clear that Defendant’s
answer was filed without authority because, as set forth above, Bushnell has
(1) submitted a copy of the Settlement Agreement executed by Bushnell,
Defendant, C. Jones, and N. Jones, in which the parties agreed that Bushnell
(or, in the alternative, N. Jones) would retain the rights and powers assigned
to her in the 2017 Durable Power of Attorney, limited to those necessary to act
on behalf of Defendant in any litigation, and (2) attested, in her declaration,
that the Probate Court approved the Settlement Agreement in Case No.
20STPB00627 on June 17, 2021.  (Bushnell
Decl., Ex. J, Settlement Agreement, ¶ 2, subd. (b)(ii); Bushnell Decl., Ex. A,
Durable Power of Attorney, ¶ 2.A, subd. (10); Bushnell Decl., ¶ 15.)  The court therefore (1) discharges the Order
to Show Cause, and (2) does not strike Defendant’s answer as being improperly
filed without authority.
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has submitted all the documents
ordered by the court in its June 13, 2024 minute order.  (June 13, 2024 Minute Order, pp. 3-4
[ordering Plaintiff to file a response to the Orders to Show Cause, including a
conformed copy of any Letters of Conservatorship of Estate of Defendant]; Fox
Decl., Ex. A [Order Appointing Conservator]; Fox Decl., Ex. B [Letters of
Conservatorship].)  
The court therefore discharges the Order to Show Cause (i) What the
Status of the Conservatorship of the Estate of James Jones is in the Matter of
the Conservatorship of James J. Jones (Case No. 20STPB06813), (ii) During What
Periods of Time the “Durable Power of Attorney for Management of Property and
Personal Affairs” signed by James Jones, Dated October 30, 2017, Has Been Valid
and in Effect, and Whether it is Presently Valid and in Effect, and (iii)
Whether Claudia Moody Jones, as Conservator of the Estate of James Jones,
Leslie Bushnell, or Some Other Person or Attorney is the Proper Party to be
Given Notices of Trial, Hearings, and Other Matters on Behalf of Defendant
James Jones in this Action.
            The court directs the clerk to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
