[tentative]
  Order RE:
 
motion to be relieved as counsel for

MOVING PARTY:                 Christopher W. Decker and
Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart, P.C.           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant
Christopher W. Decker and Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak &
Stewart, P.C. (“Defendant’s Counsel”) filed the pending motion to be relieved
as counsel of record for defendant Prime Comms. Retail, LLC (“Defendant”) on
July 15, 2024. 
On July 31, 2024, Defendant filed its “Substitution of Attorney –
Civil” on Judicial Council form MC-050, stating that Defendant was substituting
Janine M. Braxton in as counsel to represent Defendant in place of Defendant’s
Counsel.  (MC-050, ¶¶ 1-2.)  The court therefore finds that Defendant’s
Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant is moot.  
Thus, the court orders that Christopher W. Decker and Ogletree,
Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart, P.C.’s motion to be relieved as counsel of
record for defendant Prime Comms. Retail, LLC is taken off calendar as moot.
 
            The court directs the clerk to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  August 12, 2024
