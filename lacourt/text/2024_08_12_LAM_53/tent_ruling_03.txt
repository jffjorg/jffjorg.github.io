  Order RE:
 
petition for approval of compromise of claim
  for minor claimant anthony guadalupe gutierrez
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Petitioner Yahaira Gutierrez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Minor Claimant Anthony
Guadalupe Gutierrez
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this petition.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Petitioner Yahaira Gutierrez (“Petitioner”) seeks court approval of
the settlement made on behalf of minor claimant Anthony Guadalupe Gutierrez
(“Minor Claimant”) in this action.
The compromise of a minor’s disputed claim for damages is valid only
after it has been approved, upon the filing of a petition, by the court.¿
(Prob. Code, § 3500.)¿ The petition must be verified by the petitioner, must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the
reasonableness of the compromise, and must be prepared on Judicial Council form
MC-350.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿ 
Defendants Mar Vista Fund, LLC, Mar Vista Entitlement Fund, LLC,
Manuel Cara Edralin, Jr., individually and as trustee of the Edralin Manuel C
2005 Trust, J&S Properties Enterprises, Inc., and Beach City Capital
Management, LLC have agreed to pay a total of $2,000,000 to settle this action,
of which $48,368.23 is allocated to Minor Claimant.  (MC-350, ¶¶ 10-11, Attachment 11b(5).)  Of the $48,368.23 allocated to Minor Claimant,
$12,092.06 will be paid to counsel for attorney’s fees, and $890.83 will be
paid to counsel for litigation costs. 
(MC-350, ¶¶ 13, 16.)  The
remaining $35,385.34 will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity,
subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  (MC-350, ¶ 18, subd. (b)(3).)
The court has reviewed the petition and finds the settlement to be
fair and reasonable, and in the best interest of Minor Claimant.  The court further finds that the declaration
of David Campbell Smith is sufficient to support the request for attorney’s
fees in the amount of $12,092.06, representing 25 percent of the total
$48,368.23 settlement.  (Smith Decl., ¶¶
1, 3, 8-9.)  The court therefore grants
Petitioner’s petition. 
ORDER
            The court grants petitioner Yahaira
Gutierrez’s petition for approval of compromise of claim on behalf of minor
claimant Anthony Guadulupe Gutierrez.
            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re: proof of purchase of annuity (as to minor claimant Anthony Guadulupe
Gutierrez) for hearing on October 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders petitioner Yahaira
Gutierrez to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  August 12, 2024
