And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for cost of proof sanctions/attorney's fees, which sought $150,236.42 in damages based on the Defendant's failure to admit certain Requests for Admission (RFA's) regarding causation and damages. The judge found that the Defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that they would prevail on the issues of causation and damages, citing several facts that supported this conclusion, including the slow speed of the impact, the diagonal direction of the impact, and the lack of injuries reported by the Plaintiff and the driver. The judge also ruled that the Plaintiff had waived its right to compel further responses from the Defendant, as it did not bring a motion to compel after the Defendant objected to the RFA's.
