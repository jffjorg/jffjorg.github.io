And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiffs seek to add a new cause of action for breach of contract and remedy "typographical errors" in the original Complaint. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiffs have been dilatory and that the proposed amendment will cause unnecessary delay and prejudice. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs' delay was not in bad faith and that the amendment will not cause undue prejudice to the defendant. The court also notes that the proposed amendment does not raise any substantive issues and that the defendant has not demonstrated any prejudice. Therefore, the court grants leave to amend the Complaint, but requires that a standalone First Amended Complaint be filed and served to all current parties within 10 days.
