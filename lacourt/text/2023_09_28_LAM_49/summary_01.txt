And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiffs seek to add a new cause of action for breach of contract and remedy "typographical errors" in the original Complaint. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiffs have been dilatory and that the proposed amendment will cause unnecessary delay and prejudice. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs' delay was not in bad faith and that the amendment will not cause undue prejudice to the defendant. The court also notes that the proposed amendment does not raise any substantive issues and that the defendant has not demonstrated any prejudice. Therefore, the court grants leave to amend the Complaint, but requires that a standalone First Amended Complaint be filed and served to all current parties within 10 days.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the plaintiffs to file a First Amended Complaint. The motion seeks to add a new cause of action for breach of contract and to remedy certain "typographical errors" in the original complaint. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the dispute has been in litigation for over nine months and that the proposed amendment would necessitate further discovery and potentially delay the trial.

The judge grants the motion, finding that the policy favors liberally granting leave to amend so that all disputed matters between the parties may be resolved. The judge notes that the action has only been pending for three months and that the plaintiffs' failure to discover the potential claims earlier was not in bad faith. The judge also notes that the defendant has not demonstrated any prejudice that would result from granting the motion.

The judge orders that a standalone First Amended Complaint must be filed and served to all current parties within 10 days of the ruling. The judge also notes that the proposed amended complaint should omit a cause of action for bad faith denial of the existence of a contract, which the defendant had attacked as defective.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint. The Plaintiffs, Nancy Brusegaard Johnson, Paul Rogus, and Jorge Lira, seek to add a new cause of action for breach of contract and to remedy typographical errors in the complaint. The Defendant, Cooperative of American Physicians, Inc., opposes the amendment, arguing that the Plaintiffs have been dilatory and that the amendment would prejudice the Defendant.

The court also finds that the policy of liberally granting leave to amend favors granting the motion. The court grants the motion and orders the Plaintiffs to file a standalone First Amended Complaint within 10 days. The Defendant is not reasonably prejudiced by the amendment, and the court exercises its discretion to grant the motion. The ruling is consistent with the policy of allowing amendments at any stage of the proceeding to dispose of cases on their substantial merits.
