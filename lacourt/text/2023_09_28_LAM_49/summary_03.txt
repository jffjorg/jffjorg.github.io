Significant Statements:
  - "Defendant's objections are immaterial to the disposition of this motion, and therefore, the court declines to rule on them."
  - "Summary judgment is granted when, after the Court's consideration of the evidence set forth in the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."
  - "The doctrine of promissory estoppel is not premised upon the existence of an enforceable contract."
  - "Promissory estoppel is an alternative theory of recovery to contract law that enforces promises because the promisee has justifiably and foreseeably relied on the promise and equity demands enforcement to avoid injustice."
