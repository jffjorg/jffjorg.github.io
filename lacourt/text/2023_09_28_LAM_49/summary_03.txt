And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Defendant, Farmers New World Life Insurance Company, moved for summary judgment, arguing that the trial court's findings on the promissory estoppel claim are binding on the remaining claims for breach of contract, bad faith, and punitive damages. The Plaintiff, Judy Randle, opposed the motion, arguing that the two claims are separate and distinct.

The trial court held a bench trial on the promissory estoppel claim and found that no promise was made to Plaintiff. The Court of Appeal reversed the summary adjudication of Plaintiff's remaining claims, and the trial court was ordered to vacate its prior order and deny summary adjudication.

The Defendant argued that the findings on promissory estoppel are binding on the remaining claims, citing cases such as Nwosu v. Uba and Rincon EV Realty LLC v. CP III Rincon Towers, Inc. However, the Plaintiff argued that the two claims are distinct and that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not premised on the existence of an enforceable contract.

The court denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the Defendant failed to meet its initial burden to negate an essential element of the claim or establish a defense thereto. The court also held that the Plaintiff's remaining claims for bad faith and punitive damages are not dependent on the breach of contract claim.
