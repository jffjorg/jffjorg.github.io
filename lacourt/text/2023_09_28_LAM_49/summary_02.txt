And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for a preliminary injunction in part. The court has ordered all defendants to permit and cooperate with a reasonable inspection of the Tamir defendants' deck and adjacent common areas. This includes allowing direct access through the Tamir defendants' unit as may be reasonably necessary to conduct the inspection. The inspection is to take place within 21 days of the ruling or as may be otherwise agreed to by the parties.

The court has also ordered the Tamir defendants to cease preventing plaintiffs and/or En Ville Owners Association from gaining access to the deck and common areas to investigate the cause of the leaks and to take all steps necessary to repair the leak into plaintiffs' unit.

The court has concluded that the likelihood of the plaintiff's success on the merits of its case at trial appears high. The court has also considered the balance of the harms and concluded that the balance strongly shifts in favor of granting the motion for a preliminary injunction.
