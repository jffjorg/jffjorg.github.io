And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for a preliminary injunction in part. The court has ordered all defendants to permit and cooperate with a reasonable inspection of the Tamir defendants' deck and adjacent common areas. This includes allowing direct access through the Tamir defendants' unit as may be reasonably necessary to conduct the inspection. The inspection is to take place within 21 days of the ruling or as may be otherwise agreed to by the parties.

The court has also ordered the Tamir defendants to cease preventing plaintiffs and/or En Ville Owners Association from gaining access to the deck and common areas to investigate the cause of the leaks and to take all steps necessary to repair the leak into plaintiffs' unit.

The court has concluded that the likelihood of the plaintiff's success on the merits of its case at trial appears high. The court has also considered the balance of the harms and concluded that the balance strongly shifts in favor of granting the motion for a preliminary injunction.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for a preliminary injunction in part. The court has ordered Defendant En Ville and Defendant Tamirs to permit and cooperate with a reasonable inspection of the Tamir Defendants' deck and adjacent common areas. This inspection is to take place within 21 days of the ruling, or as may be otherwise agreed to by the parties. The court has denied the other requests for relief without prejudice.

The court's decision is based on its finding that the likelihood of success on the merits of the case is high, and that the balance of harms favors granting the preliminary injunction. The court notes that the Plaintiffs' unit has been significantly damaged by a water intrusion originating from the Tamir Defendants' balcony, and that the damage has forced the Plaintiffs to vacate the unit with their young children. The court also notes that Defendant En Ville has a duty to maintain the common areas, and that Defendant Tamirs have a duty to maintain their own balcony.

The court's ruling is subject to modification or reversal at the hearing on September 28, 2023.
