  Case No.:  22STCV09767
  Hearing Date:  September 27, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  response 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Jennifer Linares filed
this action against Toluca Lake Collective, Inc. on March 21, 2022. Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint on November 3, 2022, asserting wage
violations and Labor Code penalties, as well as a PAGA claim on behalf of other
aggrieved employees.  
            On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel a further response to Form Interrogatory No.
201.3. Defendant filed a belated opposition on September 18, 2023. Plaintiff
replied on September 19, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate; (3)
An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
MEET AND CONFER
Motions to compel further responses must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to resolve
the issue informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2031.310(b)(2), 2033.290(b)(1).)
The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirement. (See
Gutierrez Decl.) 
DISCUSSION
FROG No. 201.3 asked Defendant to explain
each adverse employment action taken against Plaintiff and to identify
pertinent witnesses and documents. Defendant responded that “[d]iscovery is
ongoing and responding party will amend this response pending same.” (Gutierrez
Decl., Ex. B.) During meet and confer back in July, Defense counsel indicated
they were “working on” supplemental responses to various discovery including
FROG No. 201.3. (Id., Ex. H, J.) However, Defendant did not provide any
supplemental response to FROG No. 201.3 in its August 25, 2023 production. (Id.,
¶ 14, Ex. L.)  
Defendant argues that the motion is moot
because Defendant has provided supplemental responses to various discovery
requests. However, the only discovery request at issue in this motion is FROG
No. 201.3, which Defendant did not respond to until September 18, 2023, after this
motion was filed and on the same day as its late opposition. (See Hodge Decl.,
Ex. E.) Defendant’s delay still necessitated this motion, which warrants
sanctions. 
Defendant also argues that the motion is
improper because Defendant had already agreed to provide supplemental responses.
However, the parties also agreed that the deadline for a motion to compel was
August 31, 2023. (Gutierrez Decl., Ex. H.) As discussed above, Defendant did
not respond to FROG No. 201.3 until September 18, 2023. Plaintiff is not
required to wait indefinitely after Defendant promises to provide responses. 
A party “is entitled to demand answers to
its interrogatories, as a matter of right . . . [and] the burden of justifying
any objection and failure to respond remains at all times with the party
resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th
531, 541.) Defendant has been “working on” responses since July and has not
provided any substantial justification for failing to respond to one simple FROG.
Sanctions are warranted in the amount of $660. (See Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 28.)
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
is GRANTED. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant and its counsel in the
amount of $660, to be paid within 30 days.
