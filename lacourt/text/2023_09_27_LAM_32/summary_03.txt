And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, LEE NEWSON, in his Pitchess motion. The plaintiff is seeking records related to investigations into himself, including a DUI arrest and allegations of illegal recording of a conversation. The plaintiff alleges that these investigations were used as pretext to prevent his promotion to detective and as retaliation for his protected activity.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has established good cause for the discovery of these records, which are relevant to the subject matter of the pending litigation. The records may contain evidence of discriminatory intent, and the "me too" evidence from other investigations into similar complaints against the same decisionmakers is also relevant.

The judge grants the plaintiff's Pitchess motion and orders the production of the complete investigation files for the requested records. The production will be subject to a protective order, and the judge will conduct an in-camera review of the records in accordance with statutory requirements.
