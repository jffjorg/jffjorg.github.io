     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to form interrogatories 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Dominique Peatry filed
this action against Toluca Lake Collective, Inc. on September 29, 2022. Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint on March 24, 2023, various wage and
hour violations.   
            On August 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories.
Defendant filed a belated opposition on September 19, 2023. 
LEGAL STANDARD
On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate; (3)
An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
MEET AND CONFER
Motions to compel further responses must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to resolve
the issue informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2031.310(b)(2), 2033.290(b)(1).)
The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirement. (See
Gutierrez Decl.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
FROG Nos. 215.1 and 215.2
FROG Nos. 215.1 and 215.2 ask for
information on individuals who were interviewed or provided a statement
regarding the adverse employment actions taken against Plaintiff. (Gutierrez
Decl., Ex. A.) Defendant responded with a variety of boilerplate objections and
then referenced 200 pages of documents without context or explanation. (Ibid.)

Referencing separate documents is not
proper just because the answer may be found somewhere within the production. Rather,
a responding party may only rely on a reference to documents if responding to
the interrogatory would require a compilation or summary of the documents, and
the burden and expense of preparing the compilation would be substantially the same
for both parties. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230.) Additionally, in referencing
documents, a responding party must provide “sufficient detail to permit the
propounding party to locate and to identify, as readily as the responding party
can, the documents from which the answer may be ascertained.” (Ibid.)
Defendant’s response does not satisfy the prerequisites for Section 2030.230.
FROG Nos. 215.1 and 215.2 request basic witness information, which does not
require a compilation, nor is the reference sufficiently detailed for Plaintiff
to identify the information sought.    
II.
FROG No. 216.1
            FROG No. 216.1 asks for facts,
witnesses, and documents supporting Defendant’s denials and affirmative
responses. (Gutierrez Decl., Ex. A.) Defendant responded with a variety of
boilerplate objections and then referenced the same 200 pages of documents
without context or explanation. (Ibid.)
            Defendant’s response is inadequate
for the same reasons discussed above. The improper reference to documents is
further demonstrated by the fact that Defendant references the same 200 pages
for two different interrogatories. 
III.
Late Opposition
            Defendant’s late opposition argues
that the motion is moot because Defendant previously agreed to provide supplemental
responses and did provide supplemental responses. Defendant contends that
despite this, Plaintiff filed the motion without meeting and conferring.
However, Defendant acknowledges that Plaintiff sent meet and confer
correspondence on August 11, 15, and 24. (Hodge Decl. ¶¶ 7-11.) On August 23, Defendant
made clear that it would not provide further responses to FROG Nos. 215.1,
215.2, and 216.1. (Id., Ex. E.) Plaintiff replied on August 24, responding
to Defendant’s arguments and indicating her intent to file the motion to compel
because it was clear that Defendant would not provide a further response. (Id.,
Ex. G.) Therefore, Defendant’s own evidence shows that Plaintiff properly met
and conferred and that Defendant refused to provide further responses, thus necessitating
this motion.  
            Defendant eventually provided supplemental
responses on September 19, 2023, after this motion was filed and on the same
day as its late opposition. This does not moot the motion or provide
substantial justification for the delay. Sanctions are still warranted, in the
amount of $900. (See Gutierrez Decl. ¶¶ 21-22.)  
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
is GRANTED. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant and its counsel in the
amount of $900, to be paid within 30 days.
