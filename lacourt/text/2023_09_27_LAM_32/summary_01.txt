And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further response to Form Interrogatory No. 201.3 filed by plaintiff Jennifer Linares against defendant Toluca Lake Collective, Inc. The plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant to provide a complete response to the interrogatory, which asks for explanations of adverse employment actions taken against the plaintiff and identification of pertinent witnesses and documents. The defendant responded to the interrogatory in an incomplete manner and did not provide supplemental responses despite promises to do so. The court finds that the plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirement and that the defendant's delay in responding to the interrogatory warrants sanctions. The court grants the motion to compel further response and awards sanctions against the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $660 to be paid within 30 days.
