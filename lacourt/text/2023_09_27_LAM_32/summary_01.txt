The plaintiff, Jennifer Linares, has filed a motion to compel a further response to Form Interrogatory No. 201.3 from the defendant, Toluca Lake Collective, Inc. The defendant failed to provide a supplemental response to this interrogatory despite agreeing to do so and has only provided a response after the motion was filed.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel a further response and orders the defendant to pay the sanctions within 30 days.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion to compel further response to Form Interrogatory No. 201.3. The Defendant, Toluca Lake Collective, Inc., had failed to provide a substantial response to the interrogatory, and the Plaintiff, Jennifer Linares, had filed a motion to compel further response. The Judge found that the Plaintiff had satisfied the meet and confer requirement and that the Defendant's delay in providing supplemental responses to discovery requests necessitated the motion. The Judge also found that the Defendant's argument that the motion was moot was without merit, as the only discovery request at issue was FROG No. 201.3, which the Defendant did not respond to until after the motion was filed. The Judge awarded sanctions against the Defendant and its counsel in the amount of $660, to be paid within 30 days. The Judge cited the case of Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, which held that a party is entitled to demand answers to its interrogatories as a matter of right, and that the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond remains with the party resisting the interrogatory.
