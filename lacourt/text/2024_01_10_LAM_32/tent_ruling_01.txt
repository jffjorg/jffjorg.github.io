  Case No.:  22STCV10963
  Hearing Date:  January 10, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees,
  costs, and interest 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 30, 2022, Plaintiffs Juan
Carlos Soria and Rudy Mananteau filed this action against Defendants Maureira
Construction, Inc. and Claudio Maureira, alleging (1) breach of contract, (2)
common count, (3) accounting, and (4) unjust enrichment. The action stems from Defendants’
failure to pay for Plaintiffs’ shareholder interest in Maureira Construction, Inc.
despite an agreement. 
            On July 15, 2022, Plaintiffs
obtained a judgment against Defendants in the amount of $71,704.29. On November
1, 2023, Plaintiffs obtained a partial satisfaction of the judgment in the
amount of $48,000. 
            On November 17, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a Memorandum of Costs After Judgment (MOC), claiming a total of $6,365.72
in post-judgment costs. On the same day, Plaintiffs also filed the instant
motion for an order awarding the costs claimed in the MOC, with an additional $840
for this motion, and $144.73 in interest. Defendants have not filed an
opposition. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
“The judgment creditor is entitled to the
reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment. Attorney’s fees
incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs collectible under
this title unless otherwise provided by law. Attorney’s fees incurred in
enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under this title if the
underlying judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to the judgment
creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section
1033.5.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.040.) 
“The judgment creditor may claim costs
authorized by Section 685.040 by noticed motion. The motion shall be made
before the judgment is satisfied in full, but not later than two years after
the costs have been incurred.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080(a).) “The notice of
motion shall describe the costs claimed, shall state their amount, and shall be
supported by an affidavit of a person who has knowledge of the facts stating
that to the person’s best knowledge and belief the costs are correct, are
reasonable and necessary, and have not been satisfied.” (Id., § 685.080(b).)
“The court shall make an order allowing or disallowing the costs to the extent
justified under the circumstances of the case.” (Id., § 685.080(c).)  
LEGAL STANDARD
            The costs claimed by Plaintiffs,
including attorneys’ fees, are reasonable based on supporting evidence. (See Tokar
Decl.) The Court finds that the costs are justified under the circumstances of
the case. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080(c).) Additionally, Defendants did not
challenge the costs claimed in the MOC within 10 days. (See id., §
685.070(d) [“If no motion to tax costs is made within the time provided in
subdivision (c), the costs claimed in the memorandum are allowed”].) Defendants
also do not oppose this motion. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for fees, costs,
and interest is GRANTED.
