And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiffs' motion for monetary sanctions against Defendant Mashcole Property Management, Inc. in the amount of $1,660. The Defendant failed to properly respond to discovery after a court order and did not produce supplemental responses within 10 days as ordered. The Court finds that the Defendant's actions were a dereliction of their discovery obligations and that the monetary sanctions are warranted to protect the interests of the Plaintiffs. The Court declines to impose issue or evidentiary sanctions at this stage, as they would be disproportionate and would essentially preclude the Defendant from contesting liability.
