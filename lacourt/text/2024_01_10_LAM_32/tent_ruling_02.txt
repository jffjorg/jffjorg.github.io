  Case No.:  22STCV00186
  Hearing Date:  January 10, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            This action was initiated on January
3, 2022 by thirty-four individual Plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief and
damages for allegedly uninhabitable conditions in rental units maintained by Defendants.
The Defendants each allegedly owned or managed the property at various times
throughout Plaintiffs’ tenancy. The operative Third Amended Complaint was filed
on June 7, 2023. The action now involves sixty-one Plaintiffs. 
            On November 27, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion for sanctions against Defendant Mashcole Property
Management, Inc. based on Defendant’s failure to properly respond to discovery
after a court order. Defendant filed its opposition on December 27, 2023.
Plaintiffs filed their reply on January 2, 2023. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The discovery statutes evince an
incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination. If a lesser sanction
fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of
the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the
sanction is reached that will curb the abuse. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors,
Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “The penalty should be appropriate
to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Wilson v.
Jefferson (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 952, 959.)
DISCUSSION
            On March 29, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiffs’ motions to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests
for production. The Court ordered supplemental responses within 10 days and
sanctioned Defendant. Defendant did not produce further responses within 10
days. (Smith Decl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiffs granted an extension to the end of October
2023, after which Defendant still failed to produce responses. (Id., ¶¶ 9-10.)
Defendant served supplemental responses on December 27, 2023, after this motion
was filed. (Day Decl. ¶ 3.) 
            Plaintiffs seek monetary, issue, and
evidence sanctions. Plaintiffs request the Court to deem certain allegations
from the complaint as established. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(b).) These
allegations would establish that Defendant Mashcole was responsible for
maintaining the premises in a habitable condition but failed to do so. (Compl.
¶¶ 75, 82, 93-99.) Plaintiffs further seek to preclude Defendant from
introducing the following evidence: (i) evidence supporting any denial of a
material allegation or any special or affirmative defense; (ii) evidence showing
that the property defects were caused by any person or entity other than Defendant;
(iii) evidence showing that Defendant incurred expenses in remediating the
defects; and (iv) evidence showing that Defendant obtained permits to complete repairs
or modifications to the property.  
            Plaintiffs request issue and evidentiary
sanctions that would essentially preclude Defendant from contesting liability,
which is tantamount to a terminating sanction. To preclude Defendant from
supporting any denial or defense asserted in its answer would be equivalent to
striking the answer. As Plaintiffs themselves acknowledge, a terminating
sanction is disproportionate at this stage. (See Mtn. at p. 2, fn. 1.) Plaintiffs’
reply does not respond to Defendant’s argument that the requested issue and
evidence sanctions are not tailored to the discovery being deprived. (See Opp.
4:24-7:20.) Additionally, this is the first instance of Defendant failing to abide
by a court order. For these reasons, the Court declines to impose issue or
evidentiary sanctions at this stage.
            However, monetary sanctions are
warranted. Defendant did not serve the ordered supplemental responses until
December 27, 2023, the same day as its opposition to this motion. In other
words, Plaintiffs had to file this motion in order to induce Defendant to finally
serve the responses. No justification is provided for why Defendant did not
produce the supplemental responses within 10 days as the Court ordered, or even
by the extension Plaintiffs granted. The reasonable amount is $1,660, representing
4 hours at $400 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.   
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions is
GRANTED as to monetary sanctions only. The Court sanctions Defendant Mashcole
Property Management, Inc. and its counsel in the total amount of $1,660, to be
paid within 30 days.
