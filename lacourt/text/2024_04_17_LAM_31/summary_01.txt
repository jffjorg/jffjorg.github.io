And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"Based on the briefing, the court rules as follows:

1. The Christiansburg standard applies to FEHA claims with respect to awarding costs.
2. The Christiansburg standard does not apply to Labor Code section 1102.5 claims with respect to awarding costs.
3. The court will hear from the parties on the relevance of discovery regarding the allegedly altered e-mail as to the merits of Plaintiff's FEHA claim.

The court will grant AHF's discovery requests regarding the email, as Evans does not rely on the email to support his argument that the FEHA claim was not frivolous. The court will hear from the parties on the relevance of discovery regarding the allegedly altered e-mail as to the merits of Plaintiff's FEHA claim."
