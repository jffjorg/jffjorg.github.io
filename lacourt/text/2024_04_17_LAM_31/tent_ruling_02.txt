[1] Plaintiff analyzes a fourth issue:
If the FEHA claim is not frivolous, but the Labor Code § 1102.5 claim is
frivolous, can Defendant be awarded its costs? 
AHF maintains this issue was not raised by the court at the IDC.  This issue is not relevant to the key issue
presented by these discovery motions which is whether the FEHA claim is
frivolous.  
 


[2] Evans frames the issue slightly differently.  In his view, the court asked: If the FEHA
claim and Labor Code § 1102.5 claim are inextricably intertwined, can discovery
be had on the Labor Code § 1102.5 claim in the case?  Regardless of how they are framed, the court
comes to the same conclusion.


[3] Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)
