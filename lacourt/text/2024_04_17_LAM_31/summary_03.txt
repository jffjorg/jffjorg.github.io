And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has sustained the demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint (TAC) filed by Defendant Jaime Morales, LAPD Officer, without leave to amend. The Court finds that the TAC suffers from the same defects as the previously filed complaint, including lack of clarity and uncertainty. The Court agrees with Morales that the TAC does not clearly state a cause of action and does not apprise him of the nature of Plaintiff's claims. The Court has granted leave to amend previously, but Plaintiff has not clarified her allegations and has not filed an opposition to the demurrer.
