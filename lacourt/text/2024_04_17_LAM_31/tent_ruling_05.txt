MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               John A.
Axtell, Marh & Associates
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On February 20, 2024, John A. Axtell, counsel for Defendant J
& Dong Fashion, Inc. (“Defendant”), filed this Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel.  
 
The Motion is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
John A. Axtell seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for
Defendant for the following reasons: “Client is styled in this case as
defendant.  Without waiving
attorney-client privilege, under Rule of Professional Conduct 1.16, withdrawal
is mandatory because continued representation by counsel would violate the Rules
of Professional Conduct, including rules governing conflicts of interest, Rule
of Professional Conduct 1.7.  In this
case Defendant’s counsel represents all three defendants, J & Dong Fashion,
Inc., John huh, and Hee Yeon Dong.  John
Huh and Hee Yong Dong are now divorced and Hee Yeon Dong has made a decision to
withdraw her consent to be jointly represented with J & Dong Fashion, Inc.
and John Huh.  John Huh has consented to counsel
withdrawing and will sign a substitution of attorney.  J & Dong Fashion, Inc. has also consented
to counsel withdrawing but is not in a position to retain new counsel at
present and cannot appear pro per, hence, Counsel is making this motion.”  (Form MC-052.) 
 
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
 
Upon review, the court finds the Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.   
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            Accordingly,
the unopposed Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED and effective
upon the filing of the proofs of service of this signed order upon
Defendants.¿ 
The court sets a Status Conference
re: Status of Counsel for Defendant J & Dong Fashion, Inc. for June 6, 2024
at 9:00 a.m.   
            Defense
Counsel to give notice.  


Dated:   April 17, 2024
