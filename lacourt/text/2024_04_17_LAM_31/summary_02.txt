This tentative ruling addresses the issue of whether the defendant can be awarded costs if the plaintiff's FEHA claim is not frivolous but the Labor Code § 1102.5 claim is frivolous. The court concludes that the claims are inextricably intertwined and that discovery on the Labor Code § 1102.5 claim cannot be had. The court notes that a prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right, as stated in Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b).
