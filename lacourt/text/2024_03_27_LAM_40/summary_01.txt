Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Cetera Advisor Networks LLC's motion to seal portions of its complaint in interpleader. The complaint arises from a dispute between defendants John Richard Jackson and Kimberly Tuminello over who has the authority to manage Jackson's accounts. The court finds that an overriding interest in sealing the record exists because the information at issue (specifically, the amount Jackson withdraws from his accounts and his medical information) is private and sensitive. The court also finds that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and that no less restrictive means exist to achieve the protection of Jackson's right to privacy. The motion is granted, and the portions of the complaint sought to be sealed will be redacted.
