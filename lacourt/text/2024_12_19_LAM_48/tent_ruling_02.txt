  JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 19, 2024



 
On
May 23, 2023, Plaintiff G.B. filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant
Los Angeles Unified School District, alleging negligence and negligent hiring, retention,
and supervision.
On
April 29, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment.
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
Defendant’s
evidentiary objections are overruled.
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
G.B.
asks the Court to take judicial notice of the fact that Eric Clapton’s song “After
Midnight” was released on October 9, 1970. 
The request is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
FACTS
Norbert
Volk, an employee of Defendant at George Washington Carver Junior High School (“Carver”),
sexually abused and assaulted G.B. beginning in the fall of 1966 into 1968, but
it stopped in 1969.  (Undisputed Material
Facts “UMF” 1-3; see Additional Material Facts “AMF” 1, 13, 18.)  The abuse occurred at Volk’s home.  (UMF 4; AMF 7-9, 11-16.)
No
adults saw G.B. get into Volk’s car at school, and from 1966 to 1968, G.B. never
told anyone about the abuse.  (UMF 5-7.)  In 1980, G.B. first told his then-girlfriend about
the abuse.  (UMF 8.)
The
first time anyone told any District personnel about Volk’s abuse was in either 1968
or 1969, when non-party O.B. told his P.E. teacher in either his eighth grade year
(1968-1969) or his ninth grade year (1969-1970).  (UMF 9; see AMF 41-42.)
LEGAL
STANDARD
For
each claim in the complaint, the defendant moving for adjudication must satisfy
the initial burden of proof by showing that one or more elements of a cause of action
cannot be established or that there is a complete defense to a cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520 (Scalf).)  Then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf,
supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1520.)  To establish a triable issue of material fact,
the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial responsive evidence.”  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
151, 162-163 (Sangster).)
DISCUSSION
Defendant
moves for summary judgment on the grounds that it cannot be liable for common law
negligence, it had no notice of Volk’s abuse, and it is immunized from liability
for off-campus abuse.
A.        There is No Triable Issue of Material
Fact Regarding Defendant’s Lack of Knowledge of the Abuse.
A
public entity is not liable for an injury arising out of an act or omission by the
public entity or its employees, unless provided by statute.  (Gov. Code, § 815, subd. (a).)  There is “no relevant case law approving a claim
for direct liability based on a public entity’s allegedly negligent hiring and supervision
practices,” and “a direct claim against a governmental entity asserting negligent
hiring and supervision, when not grounded in the breach of a statutorily imposed
duty owed by the entity to the injured party, may not be maintained.”  (de Villers v. County of San Diego (2007)
156 Cal.App.4th 238, 252, 255-256.)
However,
“claims against school districts premised on their own direct negligence in hiring
and supervising teachers may be pursued.” 
(Virginia G. v. ABC Unified School Dist. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1848,
1854-1855.)  “[A] public school district may
be vicariously liable under section 815.2 for the negligence of administrators or
supervisors in hiring, supervising and retaining a school employee who sexually
harasses and abuses a student.”  (C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 879 (William
S. Hart).)
“A
defendant does not owe a legal duty to protect against third party conduct, unless
there exists a special relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff.  [Citation.] 
In that circumstance, “[i]n addition to the special relationship . . ., there
must also be evidence showing facts from which the trier of fact could reasonably
infer that the [defendant] had prior actual knowledge, and thus must have
known, of the offender’s assaultive propensities.  [Citation.]’ 
[Citation.]  In short, the third party’s
misconduct must be foreseeable to the defendant.”  (Doe v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Children
& Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 675, 682-683.)
“[A]
district’s liability must be based on evidence of negligent hiring, supervision
or retention, not on assumptions or speculation.  That an individual school employee has committed
sexual misconduct with a student or students does not of itself establish, or raise
any presumption, that the employing district should bear liability for the resulting
injuries.”  (William S. Hart, supra,
53 Cal.4th at p. 878.)
Defendant
argues that Volk’s abuse was unforeseeable, so it cannot be liable for negligent
hiring, retention, or supervision.  (Motion
at pp. 5-11.)
It
is undisputed that Volk abused G.B. from the fall of 1966 to January 1968.  (UMF 3.) 
Volk’s abuse of G.B. stopped in the first semester of his ninth grade year
in 1968, and it had completely stopped by 1969. 
(G.B. Depo. at p. 56.)  It is undisputed
that G.B. did not tell anyone about the abuse until he told his then-girlfriend
in 1980.  (UMF 6-8.)
Non-party
O.B. first met Volk for his eighth grade year in 1968 to 1969, and he was abused
through eighth and ninth grade.  (O.B. Depo.
at pp. 36-37.)  It is undisputed that the
first time anyone told any District personnel about Volk’s abuse was O.B.’s report
to Mr. Davis and Mr. Johnson.  (UMF 9.)  Johnson began working at the school in the fall
of 1969.  (Johnson Depo. at pp. 25, 28.)  The only inference, then, is that O.B.’s report
of the abuse to Mr. Davis and Mr. Johnson occurred no sooner than the fall semester
of 1969—after G.B’s last possible date of fall 1968.  (See G.B. Depo. at p. 56.)
Defendant
has met its initial burden of showing that it had no prior knowledge of Volk’s abuse
of G.B. and that Volk’s abuse was unforeseeable.
G.B.
argues, without citations to evidence, that “Defendant had been on notice of Volk’s
pedophilia and sexual abuse of students during the same time Plaintiff was a student.”  (Opposition at p. 11.)
G.B.’s
other argument is that the abuse continued into 1970, after Defendant’s knowledge
from O.B.  G.B. responded to some of Defendant’s
UMFs with, “Disputed for the inference that Volk’s abuse of Plaintiff ceased in
1969 and did not continue as late as October 1970, when Eric Clapton’s ‘After Midnight’
was first released.  During the evenings that
Plaintiff spent the night at Volk’s house, Volk would usually play the Eric Clapton
song ‘After Midnight,’ a song that was not released until October 1970.”
In
fact, G.B. testified, “And then this song was playing, every night, every time I
spent the night seemed like this song would play, ‘After Midnight.’”  (G.B. Depo. at p. 53.)  After describing the abuse, he was asked, “Did
that conduct by Mr. Volk whereby he did this to you at his house, did that occur
in the 1967, the second semester of your 7th grade year?”  (Id. at pp. 55-56.)  G.B. responded, “Yeah.  And I was always going to his house.  And it—and he would get a[n] urge, you know.  It—it was never during the daytime.  It was always at night.  And—and it went on a few times in ‘67, ‘68.  But ‘69, it stopped.”  (Id. at p. 56.)
G.B.
did not initially testify that it was a song by Eric Clapton, and G.B.’s own sources
for its RJN of the song’s release date state that the song was first released by
another musician in 1966.  Only later in his
deposition did G.B. say that he wanted to forget the abuse but remembered it when
he heard “After Midnight,” and he only commented, “I think it was Eric Clapton who
sung the song.”  (G.B. Depo. at p. 78.)  This speculation about which artist sang the song
is not “substantial responsive evidence” that establishes a triable issue of material
fact.  (See Sangster, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th
at pp. 162-163.)  “[R]esponsive evidence that
gives rise to no more than mere speculation cannot be regarded as substantial, and
is insufficient to establish a triable issue of material fact.”  (Id. at p. 163.)
Moreover,
abuse extending into October 1970 (after O.B.’s report of abuse) is contradicted
by G.B.’s own direct testimony that the abuse stopped in the first semester of his
ninth grade year in 1968, and it had stopped by 1969.  (G.B. Depo. at p. 56.)  He confirmed the timing as “[t]he first semester,
because we were getting ready for graduation and programs.”  (Ibid.)  After G.B. graduated from Carver in 1969 at the
end of ninth grade, he attended Thomas Jefferson High School.  (See G.B. Depo. at pp. 19, 45, 56.)  G.B. went back to Carver “a couple of times, you
know, to see [Volk] at Carver.  You know,
see how he was doing and—you know, because I only lived about a 10-minute walk from
there, you know.  And I would stop by and
say hello to him and—and that’s about it, you know.”  (Id. at pp. 69-70.)
Based
on G.B.’s unequivocal testimony about the abuse stopping in 1969 and having only
limited interactions with Volk after graduating and attending a different school,
there can be no inference that Volk’s abuse of G.B at his home continued until October
1970, and no triable issue about the abuse ending in 1969.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
G.B.
has not shown the existence of a triable issue of fact regarding the foreseeability
of Volk’s abuse and Defendant’s prior knowledge of Volk’s abuse.
Summary
judgment is granted on this ground.
B.        Defendant is Immune From Liability for
Volk’s Off-Campus Abuse.
No
school district is liable for the conduct or safety of any student when the student
is off school property “unless such district, board, or person has undertaken to
provide transportation for such pupil to and from the school premises, has undertaken
a school-sponsored activity off the premises of such school, has otherwise specifically
assumed such responsibility or liability or has failed to exercise reasonable care
under the circumstances.”  (Ed. Code, § 44808;
see Motion at p. 11.)  In other words, section
44808 provides that school districts are not responsible for the safety of students
outside school property absent a specific undertaking by the school district and
direct supervision by a district employee. 
(LeRoy v. Yarboi (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 737, 743.)
It
is undisputed that Volk abused G.B. at his home and not on campus.  (UMF 4.) 
G.B’s opposition argument is based on Defendant’s “actual and constructive
notice regarding Volk’s sexual abuse of students” and its breach of its duty to
supervise its employees and its students while they were on campus.  (Opposition at pp. 12-13.)  For the reasons discussed above, there is no evidence
to support this and no triable issue of fact.
Summary
judgment is also granted on this ground.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
Defendant
is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within 5 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
