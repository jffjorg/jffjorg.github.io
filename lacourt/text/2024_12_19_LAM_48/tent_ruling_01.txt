  CASE NO.: 22STCV38383
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING APPLICATION FOR
  ADMISSION PRO HAC VICE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 19, 2024



 
On
November 15, 2024, Evan M. Oshan filed an ex parte application to be admitted pro
hac vice to represent Plaintiffs Yael Sima Wintner and Tova Fagan in this action.  Counsel noticed a November 18, 2024 hearing.
On
November 18, 2024 counsel filed another ex parte application to be admitted pro
hac vice, noticing a November 19, 2024 hearing. 
Counsel also filed a verified application for admission pro hac vice.
At
the November 18, 2024 hearing (on the November 15, 2024 ex parte application), the
Court ordered counsel to file a proper application and to pay the $500.00 filing
fee.  The Court continued the hearing to December
10, 2024.
At
the November 19, 2024 hearing (on the November 18, 2024 ex parte application), the
Court denied the ex parte application and reiterated its order to pay the $500.00
filing fee.
At
the December 10, 2024 hearing (continued from November 18, 2024), the Court identified
the deficiencies in counsel’s application, continued the hearing, and permitted
counsel to file an amended, complete application no later than December 16, 2024.
On
December 16, 2024, counsel filed an amended application.
An
attorney in good standing in another jurisdiction who is not a resident of California,
regularly employed in California, or regularly engaged in substantial business,
professional, or other activities in California may apply to appear as counsel pro
hac vice in California.  (California Rules
of Court, rule 9.40(a).)  The attorney must
a verified application together with proof of service by mail of a copy of the application
and notice of hearing on all parties who have appeared in the case and on the State
Bar of California at its San Francisco office. 
(California Rules of Court, rule 9.40(c).)  The applicant must also pay a $50.00 fee to the
State Bar of California.  (California Rules
of Court, rule 9.40(e).)
The
application must state (1) the applicant’s residence and office addresses; (2) the
courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice and the dates of admission;
(3) that the applicant is a member in good standing in those courts; (4) that the
applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court; (5) the title of
each court and cause in which the applicant has filed an application to appear as
counsel pro hac vice in this state in the preceding two years, the date of each
application, and whether or not it was granted; and (6) the name, address, and telephone
number of the active member of the State Bar of California who is attorney of record
in the local action.  (California Rules of
Court, rule 9.40(d).)
The
application complies with most requirements. 
However, it still does not include the address of counsel’s residence as
required and as the Court pointed out in the December 10, 2024 order.  The declaration provides only counsel’s office
address.
The
Hearing on Ex Parte Application of Counsel Evan M. Oshan, Esq. to Appear as Counsel
Pro Hac Vice is DENIED.
If
counsel files any future motions for pro hac vice admission, he must reserve a new
hearing date.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
