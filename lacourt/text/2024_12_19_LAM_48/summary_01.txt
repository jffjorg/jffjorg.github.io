The judge is denying the application of counsel Evan M. Oshan to be admitted pro hac vice to represent the Plaintiffs Yael Sima Wintner and Tova Fagan. Counsel had filed multiple ex parte applications and an amended application, but the judge found that the application was still incomplete and deficient. Specifically, the application did not include the address of counsel's residence, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d). The judge ordered counsel to pay the $500.00 filing fee and denied the application.
