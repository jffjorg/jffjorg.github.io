And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Thomas D. Long, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for summary judgment filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (Defendant). The case involves a claim of negligence and negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against the Defendant by plaintiff J.A., who was sexually abused and assaulted by Norbert Volk, an employee of the Defendant, in 1967.

The Defendant argued that it had no prior knowledge of Volk's abuse and that Volk's abuse was unforeseeable. The Judge found that the Defendant had met its initial burden of showing that it had no prior knowledge of Volk's abuse and that Volk's abuse was unforeseeable. J.A. failed to show the existence of a triable issue of fact regarding the foreseeability of Volk's abuse and Defendant's prior knowledge of Volk's abuse.

As a result, the motion for summary judgment is granted, and the Defendant is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within 5 days.
