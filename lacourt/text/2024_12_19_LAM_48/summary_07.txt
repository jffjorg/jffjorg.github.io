The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, United Broadway Real Estate Company LLC, granting their motions to compel responses to discovery requests and to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted.

The judge has ordered the defendant to provide verified responses to these requests within 30 days, without objections. The defendant's failure to serve timely responses has waived any objections they may have had to the requests, including those based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. The judge has also deemed the RFAs admitted by the defendant. The requests for sanctions are denied.
