And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the demurrer and has scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Striking Complaint Under CCP 436(b) and Dismissing Action For Failure to State a Claim for February 18, 2025. The parties are ordered to brief the issue of whether this action is barred by res judicata and to address the merits of the Complaint's second cause of action. The judge has also noted that the Complaint fails to state a valid cause of action and that the demurrer was sustained for failure to establish a cause of action, which is a judgment on the merits.
