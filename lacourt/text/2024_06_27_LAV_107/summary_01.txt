```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the cross-defendants' motion for summary judgment on the defendant's cross-complaint and has made the following ruling:

* The court denies the motion as to the first cause of action for financial elder abuse because the cross-defendants have not shown that the defendant cannot establish his claim by showing that he does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, the necessary evidence.
* The court grants the motion as to the second cause of action for fraudulent deceit because the defendant has not shown the existence of a relationship between himself and the cross-defendants that gives rise to a duty to disclose the alleged misrepresentations.
* The court grants the motion as to the third cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty because the defendant has not shown the existence of a fiduciary relationship between himself and the cross-defendants.
* The court denies the motion as to the fourth cause of action for identity theft because the defendant has alleged that the cross-defendants obtained a post office box in his name without his knowledge or authorization, and the cross-defendants have not shown that this was authorized or that they did not sign his name on checks received at the post office box.

The court has reviewed the evidence presented and has concluded that the cross-defendants have met their burden of showing that the defendant cannot establish his claims for fraudulent deceit and breach of fiduciary duty, and that the defendant has not shown the existence of a fiduciary relationship or a triable issue of fact as to these claims.
