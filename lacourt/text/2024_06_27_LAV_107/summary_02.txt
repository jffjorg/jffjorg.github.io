The Judge, Eric Harmon, has issued a tentative ruling regarding the Request for Default Judgment in the case of Ricardo Arroyo v. Razelee Fernando. The Request has been denied due to contradictions between the Plaintiff's declaration and the complaint, as well as a lack of evidence of damages. The Plaintiff's declaration claims ownership of 51% in certain businesses, but the complaint alleges uncertainty around ownership. Additionally, the Plaintiff failed to provide any evidence of damages, including the value of the business interests at issue or the amounts contributed to their purchase price. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to submit evidence of damages in order to proceed with the case.
