SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF
  CALIFORNIA
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES
NORTHWEST DISTRICT
 




Ricardo
  Arroyo,
Plaintiff.
 
       
   v.
 
Razelee
  Fernando,
 
Defendant.


 
   Case Number             Department
   107




 
 
COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: REQUEST
  FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The
Request for Default Judgment is Denied.
Reasons
 

Statements
     made in Plaintiff’s declaration contradict certain allegations of the
     complaint. For example, Plaintiff declares that he owns a 51% interest in
     certain businesses, but the complaint alleges that the ownership interest
     of each party in each of the businesses is uncertain, though “roughly
     equal.” 

 

Plaintiff
     must submit evidence of damages. Plaintiff provides no evidence for
     damages. There are no exhibits attached to Plaintiff’s declaration nor to
     the complaint that support Plaintiff’s claims of the value of the business
     interests at issue or of the amounts that Plaintiff contributed to their
     purchase price. There is no evidence that either party has an interest in
     the businesses at issue.

 

The complaint
     does not specify the damages claimed. 

 
 
The
Request for Default Judgment is therefore Denied. It is so ordered.
