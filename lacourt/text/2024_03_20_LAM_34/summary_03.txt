Dept: 34

Responding Party: Judgment Creditor Kavoos Rostami

Decisions:

  - Judgment Debtor's Request for Sanctions and Attorney's Fees is DENIED.

Background:
  - Judgment Debtor and Judgment Creditor have been in a dispute over a judgment for over a decade.
  - Judgment Debtor claims that the parties entered into an oral and written agreement in 2012 and 2013, respectively, to settle the judgment with a shipment of roses.

Analysis:
  - The Court finds that Judgment Debtor's claims of an oral and written agreement are not credible due to inconsistencies in the evidence presented.
  - The Court also finds that Judgment Creditor's testimony is somewhat credible, but his expert's opinion is highly credible.
  - The Court determines that the parties did not enter into either of the purported agreements, and therefore, there cannot be satisfaction based on these mere allegations.

Discussion:
  - The Court discusses the legal standards for an accord and satisfaction, including Civil Code sections 1524, 1525, 1526, and 1527.
  - The Court finds that the invoices did not create an accord or implied-in-fact contract that could have been satisfied by shipment of roses.

Conclusions:
  - The Court denies Judgment Debtor's motion to compel full satisfaction of the judgment.
  - The Court denies Judgment Debtor's request for sanctions and attorney's fees.
