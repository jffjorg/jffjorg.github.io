ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a
response from the party to whom form interrogatories, special interrogatories,
and demand requests are propounded within 30 days after service of the
requests, unless the time is extended by agreement of the parties. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a),
2031.270, subd. (a).) If a party fails to serve timely responses, "the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing to respond, the
offending party waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
For a motion to compel, all a propounding
party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the
time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were
directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Super. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed, "[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed]
to serve a timely response,' the trial court had authority to grant [opposing
party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko Healthcare Counseling,
Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 405.)
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel motions for
interrogatories or requests for production, unless the Court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A.      The Discovery Requests
 
Defendant moves the Court to compel responses to form interrogatories
(“FROGs”) that appear to have been served on December 1, 2023. (FROGs Motion,
p. 6:16–19; Decl. Leff, Exh. 1, p. 9.)
 
Plaintiff opposes the FROGs Motion, arguing that the request is moot
because responses to the FROGs were served on February 16, 2024. (Opposition,
p. 2:2, 2:22.) Plaintiff’s Counsel provides the responses to the FROGs, which
appear to have been verified on February 15, 2024 and served on Defendant on
February 16, 2024. (Decl. Clark, Exh. 1, actual pp. 23–24 of 48.)
 
        Defendant admits that the request for
responses is now moot. (Reply, p. 1:28.)
 
        The Court DENIES as moot the FROGs
Motion. 
 
B.      Sanctions
 
Defendant requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
Counsel in the amount of $1,145.15. (Motion, p. 6:15–19.)
 
Plaintiff argues that monetary sanctions are not appropriate because
Plaintiff served good faith responses to the FROGs, served wholly sufficient
amended responses, and should have had an informal discovery conference prior
to the filing of the FROGs Motion. (Opposition, p. 2:22–27.)
 
The Court does not have evidence before it that would indicate Defendant served
timely responses to the FROGs. Rather, the evidence before the Court indicates
that the responses to the FROGs were not served until more than two months
after the FROGs were served, and more than a week after the FROGs Motion was
filed. Because the Court does not have evidence before it that would indicate
there is substantial justification or other circumstances that would make the
imposition of a sanction unjust, the Court must impose a monetary sanction. 
 
Defense Counsel declares: (1) that they charge $245.00 per hour; (2)
that they incurred 4.3 hours for this motion; and (3) that they paid $61.65 in
costs. (Decl. Leff, ¶ 4.)
 
The Court finds that the hourly rate, number of hours spent, and costs
are all reasonable here. However, this amount adds up to $1,115.15, not
$1,145.15.
 
The Court AWARDS monetary sanctions for Defendant and against Plaintiff
and Plaintiff’s Counsel, jointly and severally, in the total amount of
$1,115.15. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The FROGs Motion is DENIED as moot. 
 
Monetary sanctions are AWARDED for Defendant and against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s Counsel, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $1,115.15.
