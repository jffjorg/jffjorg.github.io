Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion filed by the defendant, Carlos Sotelo, to compel responses to form interrogatories and request joint monetary sanctions. The motion is denied as moot because the defendant admits that the request for responses is now unnecessary.

The judge also awards monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, Sebastian Solano, and his counsel in the amount of $1,115.15. The judge found that the defendant incurred costs of $61.65 and spent 4.3 hours on the motion, and that the plaintiff's responses to the form interrogatories were not served in a timely manner.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires that parties respond to discovery requests within a certain timeframe. The judge also considered the fact that the defendant failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, which is considered a waiver of any objections to the requests.
