And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's initial responses to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff's initial responses were incomplete or inadequate, and the defendant has therefore been granted permission to compel the plaintiff to provide complete responses. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $600.00, payable to the defendant within 30 days from the date of notice of the ruling. The plaintiff is required to provide verified discovery responses within 30 days from the date of notice of the ruling. The judge's intention is to ensure that the parties have access to all relevant information and to avoid delays in the proceedings.
