against Defendant Mnatsakan Zohrabyan (“Defendant”)
and Does 1 to 10 inclusive for 1) Motor Vehicle Negligence for a vehicle

MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            On September
5, 2024, Defendant filed the following motions: 1) Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s
Initial Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Monetary
Sanctions; and 2) Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Initial Responses to Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions. 
 
Defendant argues
that they served Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Form
Interrogatories, Set One, on Plaintiff via electronic service on January 4,
2024. (Mot. RPD, Trostler Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. A; Mot. FROGS, Trostler Decl., ¶ 3;
Exh. A.) Defendant had allowed an extension to March 4, 2024. (Mot. RPD, Exh.
B; Mot. FROGS, Exh. B.) Plaintiff did not request an additional extension and
failed to provide responses. (Mot. RPD, Trostler Decl., ¶4-6; Mot. FROGS,
Trostler Decl., ¶4-6.)
 
On March 19,
2024, Defendant sent meet and confer correspondence to Plaintiff requesting
responses to the Requests for Production of Documents and Form Interrogatories without
objections by March 29, 2024, which included a 10-day extension. (Mot. RPD,
Trostler Decl., ¶5; Exh. B; Mot. FROGS, Trostler Decl., ¶5; Exh. B.) As the

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard & Discussion
A. Motion to Compel Responses to Requests
for Production of Documents
A party must respond to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of
documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party
may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or production of documents other than the cut-off
on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No meet and confer
efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)   
Here, Defendant served
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff via electronic
service on January 4, 2024. (Mot. RPD, Trostler Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. A.) As of the date this Motion was filed,
Defendant had not received any responses. (Mot. RPD, Trostler Decl., ¶6.)
Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. Thus, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff’s response
to the Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, without objections. 
B. Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories
Here, Defendant served Form Interrogatories, Set
One, on Plaintiff via electronic service on January 4, 2024. (Mot. FROGS,
Trostler Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. A.) As
of the date this Motion was filed, Defendant had not received any responses. (Mot.
FROGS, Trostler Decl., ¶6.) Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. Thus, Defendant is entitled to an order
compelling Plaintiff’s responses to the Form Interrogatories, Set One, without objections.
 
C. Request
for Sanctions – Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents and Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) 
 
Here, the Court finds Plaintiff’s
failure to respond to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One, a misuse of the discovery process. Plaintiff
has not opposed this motion and has provided no substantial justification or
other circumstances to make the imposition of a sanction unjust. Thus, the Court
imposes a monetary sanction on Plaintiff for their failure to respond to
Defendant’s discovery requests. 
 
The courts awards sanctions in the
reasonable amount of $600.  
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Defendant’s Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is
GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Requests for Production, Set One,
is GRANTED.
