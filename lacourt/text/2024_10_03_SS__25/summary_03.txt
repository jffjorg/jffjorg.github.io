Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant's motions to compel Plaintiff's responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, despite being served on January 4, 2024, and despite a 10-day extension granted by the defendant. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond is a misuse of the discovery process and imposes a monetary sanction of $600.00 on the plaintiff and their counsel. The plaintiff is ordered to provide verified discovery responses within 30 days, and the defendant is ordered to receive the sanctions within 30 days.
