[TENTATIVE] RULING ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
  MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 



 
            Petitioner John Doe petitions for a writ
of mandate directing respondent University of Southern California (“University”
or “USC”) to set aside a decision finding that petitioner engaged in sexual
misconduct and suspending petitioner for three years. 
 
I.       Factual Background[1]
 
A.        Interactions
Prior to the Events of September 5, 2021 
 
In fall 2021, both petitioner and non-party Jane Roe
were enrolled as first-year students in the University’s undergraduate program.
(AR 8, 729.) Petitioner and Roe met on an evening in mid-August 2021 during a
casual social event between their two friend groups. (AR 172-74, 729, 830.) At
the end of that night, petitioner spent the night in Roe’s bed. (AR 178-79,
730, 830.) 
 
On a few occasions prior to September 2, 2021, the
parties slept next to one another, and did “[make] out.” (AR 209, 302-04, 730.)
Both parties stated that, on the night of September 2, 2021, the parties
unsuccessfully attempted to engage in consensual penile-vaginal sexual
intercourse in Roe’s room. (AR 730, 829, 865.) 
 
B.        Roe’s Plans on September 5, 2021
 
Responding to petitioner’s September 5, 2021 text
message asking what Roe was doing, Roe said that she had work to do, that her
roommate was not in, and that she would be going to bed early. (AR 174, 179, 733-34,
833-34.) Petitioner responded that he was hoping to hang out with Roe that
night, to which Roe replied that she had to finish her work and would probably
be done around “10ish.” (AR 251, 733-34, 833.) Roe was surprised when petitioner
showed up because she did not receive any notice that petitioner would be
coming over. (AR 736, 833.) If she had, she said that she would have declined
due to work. (AR 833.) For his part, petitioner said that he decided to
surprise Roe with a “study break” and that, if she did not want to spend time
with him, he could go downstairs to socialize with one of their mutual friends.
(AR 274, 735, 910-11.) 
 
Petitioner arrived at Roe’s dorm room at
approximately 10:30 p.m. on September 5, 2021. (AR 733.) Once in her room, Roe
told petitioner she had work to finish, which petitioner downplayed, resulting
in him staying in her room. (AR 737.) Earlier, at 10:28 p.m., Roe had texted
her friend Saloni Jhawer and asked her to come hang out with Roe at her dorm
because they had made prior plans to hang out together that evening. (AR
231-32, 738, 841.) When Jhawer arrived, Roe informed Jhawer that petitioner was
present; Jhawer asked if she should leave, and Roe replied asking her to stay
because she was uncomfortable. (AR 738, 844-45.) After staying and speaking to petitioner
for some time, Jhawer told Roe that she was very uncomfortable and left. (AR
844-45.)
 
C.        Petitioner’s Actions on September 5,
2021
 
Although Roe had not planned to have sex with petitioner
that evening, she ultimately decided to give in to get him to leave. (AR 761.)
After about 10 to 15 minutes of having penile-vaginal sex, petitioner told Roe
to get into the “doggy style position,” to which Roe told petitioner it was not
the easiest position for her given Roe was “weirdly proportioned” due to her long
legs and higher hips. (AR 741, 839, 894-96.) Roe said that petitioner then used
both of his hands and penis to penetrate Roe’s vagina, which was very painful
for Roe. (838-39.) Petitioner did not say anything to Roe before he digitally
penetrated her. (AR 742, 838.) Petitioner acknowledged that he began
penetrating Roe’s vagina with his fingers, without engaging in any verbal or
non-verbal communication before doing so. (AR 896-97.) Petitioner stated that
he penetrated Roe’s vagina with his fingers shortly after he took his penis out
of Roe’s vagina in the “doggy” position, at which point petitioner’s penis was
flaccid, so he “tried to quickly improvise within that scenario,” thinking to
himself, “I’ll finger her a little bit as I’m trying to get another erection.”
(AR 741-42, 897.) 
 
Petitioner acknowledged not being able to see or
sense Roe’s reaction when he started digitally penetrating her instead of engaging
in sexual intercourse with his penis. (AR 897.) 
 
Roe stated that, when she bent forward in front of petitioner
on the bed, petitioner began to scratch Roe’s vagina with his nails. (AR 742,
870.) Roe described petitioner’s nails as long and stated that he was “jabbing”
his fingers into her vagina, scratching her and causing her pain. (AR 742,
785.) Roe stated petitioner also scratched her vagina as he opened her vagina
to insert his penis. (AR 742, 785.) Roe said “ow” two or three times and began
crying. (AR 742, 838-39.) Roe then heard petitioner laugh in response to her
exclamations. (AR 742-43, 839.) At that point, Roe pulled her hips away, got
off the bed, put her clothes on and grabbed her water bottle as an excuse to
leave to get water, and did not return. (AR 839, 898.) 
 
Petitioner stated that he did not hear Roe say
“ow,” tell him to “stop,” or otherwise perceive any signs that Roe wanted to
stop engaging in the sexual encounter. (AR 743, 897.) Petitioner also
acknowledged that he did not perceive any signs of Roe expressing pleasure or
enjoyment when he used his fingers to penetrate her. (AR 743, 897-98.)
Petitioner stated he did not recall ever laughing during the sexual encounter.
(AR 743, 898.) Petitioner stated he felt a lot of anxiety and humiliation
around the fact that he was having difficulties with an erection and proceeded
to sit down on the bed and take the condom off because he believed the sexual
encounter might be over. (AR 898.) Roe ended the sexual intercourse because petitioner’s
conduct had caused her excruciating pain, at which point Roe ran away crying,
without putting on shoes, and did not return. (AR 743, 839.)
 
D.        Roe’s
Response Following the Events of September 5, 2021
 
After leaving her bedroom, Roe first called her
friend Lauren Berthoumieux at 1:21 a.m., who did not answer the call. (AR 744,
878.) She then texted Berthoumieux, “R u up. I need u.” (AR 234, 744.) Roe then
immediately called Jhawer and Miles Bernstein. (AR 241, 744, 878.) After leaving
her room, Roe went to Jhawer and Alyse Saucedo’s room, started sobbing, and shared
with Jhawer and Saucedo that petitioner scratched her, as well as how bad and
the painful the experience was. (AR 194-96, 440-41, 744, 878.) She told Jhawer
and Saucedo that she missed her boyfriend from home and regretted having sex
with Petitioner. (AR 196, 744-45.) Roe also recalled describing a throbbing
pain in her vagina and feeling like it was “on fire.” (AR 185, 190, 764.) Roe
reported that later that week she saw scabbing on her genitals where the
scratching occurred and felt pain during urination. (AR 196, 744.) Roe stated
that she, together with Jhawer and Saucedo, then called Bernstein to ask for
his help getting petitioner to leave Roe’s room. Roe, Jhawer, and Saucedo told
Bernstein that petitioner was “very aggressive” and that he was putting his
fingers in her vagina but his nails were long such that he was scratching her
and causing lots of pain. Bernstein told Roe to pretend that she was helping
someone who was drunk, and Jhawer left to tell petitioner that Roe would not be
returning to her room. (AR 195-96, 199, 607-08, 745-46.) Roe then texted petitioner
at 1:45 a.m., stating: “Hey so sorry dealing with a problem. I’ll text u tmr.
Sorry again about the interruption.” (AR 233, 745.) When Roe returned to her
room three or four hours later, petitioner was gone. (AR 745, 879.) 
 
In addition to reporting the incident to Bernstein,
Jhawer, and Saucedo in the early morning of September 6 immediately following
it, Roe described the incident to Tomi Boyejo, Diya Patel, Berthoumieux, Taylor
Richter, Abigail Abramson, and Holden Kilbane—all of whom subsequently
confirmed in large part Roe’s reports of what she told them. (AR 197-98,
241-244, 341-42, 415-16, 542-44, 578-80, 669-72, 682-83, 746-749.) Later that
day, at 3:07 p.m., Bernstein texted Roe asking how she was doing and inquired if
she was feeling better, to which she replied affirmatively and stated “I still
don’t know what to do like talking to him. But that’s for later today to figure
out.” (AR 235.) Bernstein responded by instructing Roe not to communicate with
Petitioner, writing: “That shit is not cool… [y]ou do not need to talk to him…
Unless u don’t want to.” (AR 235.) Roe replied: “No I do. I feel scared.”  (AR 235.) 
Bernstein replied with “u are 100% justified in feeling scared. (AR 235.)

 
On September 7, 2021, shortly after midnight, Roe
texted petitioner: “Hi I’m sorry but I don’t think we should hook up anymore.”
(AR 230, 749-50.) Petitioner responded: “Damn it was that bad huh?” When Roe
did not immediately respond, he texted Roe’s name followed by two question
marks, to which Roe replied: “Yes.” Petitioner responded: “Yo can we talk. I’m
jus tryna understand everything. U good?”; Roe did not text any response. (AR 230,
749-50.) At 12:46 a.m., the petitioner and Roe spoke on the phone, during which
Roe said something to the effect of, “It was bad, let’s just leave it at that,”
to which petitioner replied, “It was bad for me, too.” (AR 241, 750, 900.)
Petitioner admits that Roe informed him that Roe did not want to “hook up” ever
again but said the two could remain friends. (AR 831, 899-900.) During a phone
call in which the parties discussed the events of September 5, petitioner
recalled Roe telling him: “Let’s just chalk it up to a bad night.” (AR 900.)
Petitioner said this confused him because “[their] relationship before the news
largely predicated on flirtation and touch.” (AR 831, 900.) 
 
On September 11, 2021, Roe left Richter a voice
message, to which Richter responded that she was “so sorry about that boy…
Being uncomfortable and upset is totally normal so no need to feel weird or
embarrassed at all. Just keep speaking for yourself and only do things that you
want to do because you matter most.” (AR 254.) Roe responded that she “felt so
pressured and the hook up was so painful and awful that [she] kinda don’t want to
ever be alone with him j in case he tries to get with me again.” (AR 255.) She
added that “[Roe] told [petitioner] that [they] should stop hooking up and [petitioner’s]
friend was like [petitioner] took it as we are keeping our thing on the low.
Like guys j hear what they want.” (AR 255.)
 
E.        Petitioner’s
Actions on September 17, 2021
 
On September 17, 2021,
Roe and her roommate Patel had a party in their dorm room. Earlier that
evening, at 6:08 p.m., Boyejo texted Roe that petitioner asked Boyejo if he had
plans that night and asked Roe how he should respond, to which Roe responded,
“U can tell him. I don’t mind,” because Roe did not want to be “mean” or
exclude people. (AR 236, 750-51.) During the party, although Roe tried to avoid
petitioner, petitioner repeatedly came “weirdly” close to her and touched her
on several occasions. For example, Roe recalled that, while she was in the
common area outside of her room using her phone, petitioner came to sit next to
her. When Roe got up after petitioner sat next to her, petitioner grabbed her
hip to pull her back. (AR 751, 800.) Petitioner stated that, at this point, he
was confused about his relationship with Roe, because Roe mentioned she wanted
to be friends, but their relationship had been mostly sexual up to that point. Petitioner
stated that, during the party, he was trying to “feel out that new dynamic” and
make sure nothing seemed “weird.” (AR 314, 751, 831.) 
 
Petitioner attempted to
dance with Roe but got the impression Roe did not want to dance with him, which
he understood to be an indication either that Roe felt stressed about hosting
the party or that Roe did not want anything to do with petitioner at that time.
(AR 752, 899.) Petitioner stated that, after he realized Roe did not want to
dance with him, he “gave her space for the rest of the night.” (AR 752,
899.) Bernstein observed petitioner attempting to touch Roe, get her attention,
or dance with her throughout the evening, and Roe was not reciprocating petitioner’s
efforts, moved away, and appeared “visibly uncomfortable.” (AR 603-04, 610-11, 752.)
Boyejo also observed petitioner “still touching [Roe] like they were in a
relationship,” including one instance in which petitioner touched or grabbed
Roe around her waist, even though Roe appeared as though she did not want to be
around petitioner. (AR 344, 752-53.) 
 
Petitioner stated that he
attended the party “unsure of how good of a friend [Roe] viewed [petitioner],”
but that he thought to himself, “if this girl did not want to see me and she
would tell me….” (AR 831.) Petitioner recalled observing Roe act “noticeably
colder towards [him] that night…[s]o [he] decided to get drunk and high and in
an effort to forget about her, [he] focused on talking to other people at that
party, but noticed that at one point [he] was uncomfortably nauseous.” (AR
753-54, 831-32.) Petitioner stated that he did not want to leave the party
abruptly because he thought that would look strange and so he tried to still
have fun with the people around him. (AR 832.) At the end of the night, when
the music had turned off and the lights were turned on, petitioner claims he
felt significantly more nauseous and, in an effort to calm himself down, rested
at the bottom of Roe’s bed, which he had seen others sit on before and didn’t
see any harm in being on. (AR 832.) Petitioner then sat up, took a few minutes
to “study himself,” and then made the “cold sobering walk home,” during which
he “swore to never let [himself] get that drunk and high ever again.” (AR 832.)
 
F.        Roe’s
Response Following the Events of September 17, 2021
 
On September 18, 2021, at
7:51 p.m., Roe requested to speak to petitioner. (AR 259, 755.) When they
spoke, Roe told him that his actions the night before were unacceptable and
that she heard from Bernstein that petitioner and his friend had made sexual
comments about her. Roe confirmed to Petitioner that they were not a “thing.”
(AR 223, 755.)
 
G.        The
University’s Investigation, Determination, and Sanctioning Process
 
1.           
Roe Formally Reports Sexual Misconduct to the
University EEO-TIX Office
 
On October 14, 2021, a
Resident Assistant (“RA”) informed the University’s Office for Equity, Equal
Opportunity, and Title IX (“EEO-TIX”) about a report of sexual assault made by
a resident of the RA’s building. (AR 158-60, 725.) Following an initial interview
with EEO-TIX, on December 14, 2021, Roe filed a Formal Complaint. (AR 165-68,
726.) Based on the allegations of the Formal Complaint, on January 14, 2022,
the University issued a Notice of Investigation to petitioner and Roe, along with a copy of the Policy
on Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation (“Policy”) and the Resolution
Process for Sexual Misconduct (“Resolution Process”), with links to supportive
resources.[2] (AR 144-57, 726, 832.)
 
2.           
The University Conducts a Seven-Month Investigation
into Roe’s Allegations
 
The investigation
consisted of interviews of Roe (on two occasions), petitioner (on two
occasions), and 11 witnesses. (AR 169-229, 263-313, 726-27.) The Investigator,
Abigail Woodruff, conducted individual interviews with the ten witnesses
identified by Roe and the three witnesses identified by petitioner. (AR
726-27.) The Investigator reviewed documentary evidence provided by the parties
and witnesses in the form of text messages, photographs, and videos. (See,
e.g., AR 373-82.) 
 
After this investigatory
fact-gathering, from April 22, 2022 to May 20, 2022, as part of the “Evidence
Review” stage, the Investigator gave the parties an equal opportunity to
inspect and review the evidence obtained, and the parties submitted related
responses to the Evidence Review on May 20, 2022. (AR 59-70, 727.) 
.
3.           
The University Provides the Parties with Access to
the Investigation Report, All Exhibits, and Notice of Hearing. 
 
Pursuant to the
University’s Resolution Process, the Investigator produced an Investigative
Report that summarized the relevant information gathered during the
investigation, which was made available to both parties prior to the hearing.
(AR 1-50, 1011, 1018.) The parties were provided with the opportunity to submit
a written response. Roe provided a written response, while Petitioner did not.
(AR 1018-19). 
 
4.           
The University’s Independent Hearing Officer
Conducts a Hearing and Issues a Written Decision
 
Following issuance of a
July 27, 2022 written Notice of Hearing, a live hearing was conducted via Zoom
on August 8-10, 2022. (AR 720-23, 821-986.) The parties, through their advisors,
were given the opportunity to question the other party and all witnesses who
participated in the hearing directly, verbally, and in real-time. (AR 728-29.)
After the hearing, the Hearing Officer, Amanda Norris Ames, issued a Confidential
Written Notice of Determination (“Decision”). (AR 724-69.) The Hearing Officer
found as follows:
 
With respect to the
events of September 5, 2021 (“First Incident”), both petitioner and Roe agreed
that petitioner digitally penetrated Roe’s vagina without any communication
(verbal or non-verbal) from Roe. (AR 762.) Neither party shared any clear
actions or words necessary to constitute Roe’s affirmative consent to a
different sexual activity.[3] (AR
763.) Petitioner reported that he decided to “improvise” with Roe by “pleasuring”
her with his fingers but was attempting to hide both the fact that his leg was
cramping and his penis was flaccid.[4] (AR
762.) Petitioner confirmed that Roe was facing away from him at the time, and
he could not see her face or her reaction to his actions. (AR 762.) 
 
With respect to the
events of September 17, 2021 (“Second Incident”), petitioner did not dispute
that, after Roe told petitioner that she only wanted to be friends, he
attempted to dance with Roe even though she did not seem interested. (AR 766.) Petitioner
reported that he did not want any friends at the party to ask questions about
the status of the parties’ relationship, so he wanted to “make everything seem
[like] it had always been.” (AR 766; see also AR 307-08.)
 
The Hearing Officer
determined that, by a preponderance of the evidence, petitioner had engaged in
Title IX Sexual Harassment (Sexual Assault), Title IX Sexual Harassment and
Sexual (Hostile Environment) Harassment, as well as certain SCampus violations.
(AR 763, 768-69),
 
5.           
The University’s Sanctioning Panel Issues a
Decision
 
On September 19, 2022,
the Associate Vice President and Deputy Title IX Coordinator for EEO-TIX provided
the Hearing Officer’s Decision to the parties, as well as the Sanctioning
Panel’s decision to expel petitioner. (AR 1111-17.) The parties were informed of
the right and procedure for appealing the findings and sanction. (AR 1111-14.)
The Sanctioning Panel’s written decision specified that it weighed the
following considerations: (1) the nature and severity of the conduct; (2) the
impact of the conduct on Roe; (3) the impact or implications of the conduct on
the community or University; (4) prior misconduct for which petitioner had been
found responsible; (5) whether petitioner had accepted responsibility for the
conduct; (6) maintenance of a safe and respectful environment conduct to
learning; (7) presence or absence of bias as a motivation for petitioner’s
conduct; (8) protection of the University community requiring extended
protective measures or other sanctions; and (9) any other mitigating,
aggravating, or compelling circumstances in order to reach a just an
appropriate resolution in the case. (AR 1115-17.) 
 
6.           
The University Reviews and Partially Grants
Petitioner’s Appeal of the Hearing Officer and Sanctioning Panel’s Written
Decisions 
 
On September 26, 2022, petitioner
submitted a written appeal of the Sanctioning Panel’s decision on the basis of
alleged bias by the Hearing Officer and Sanctioning Panel. (AR 1118-20.) Roe
submitted a response to petitioner’s appeal on October 3, 2022. (AR 1122-26.) 
 
On October 21, 2022, the Interim
Vice President for Student Affairs, designated with appellate Authority for the
appeal under the Policy and Resolution Process, issued a decision regarding petitioner’s
appeal to the parties. (AR 1132-52.) The appeal decision stated that petitioner’s
appeal did not support a finding of bias on the part of either the Hearing
Officer or the Sanctioning Panel. 
However, , however, indirectly identified a possible procedural
irregularity with respect to the Sanctioning Panel’s consideration of the
“nature and severity” of petitioner’s conduct. (AR 1133, 1136.) Accordingly,
the sanction of expulsion was modified to instead impose the following
sanctions: (i) a three-year suspension, (ii) exclusion from University property
during the period of suspension, (iii) an Avoidance of Contact directive that
instructs petitioner to have no contact with Roe, and (iv) a one-hour educational
coaching session specifically focusing on affirmative consent. (AR 1133, 1136.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
October 31, 2023, petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandate.
No answer has been filed. 
 
            On
November 18, 2022, the Court (Hon. Mitchell L. Beckloff) denied petitioner’s ex
parte application to stay the decision suspending petitioner. 
 
            On
September 18, 2023, petitioner filed an opening brief. On October 18, 2023,
respondent filed an opposition. On October 20, 2023, respondent filed an
amended opposition. On November 14, 2023, a hearing was held on the petition.
The Court granted petitioner’s oral request to continue and allowed petitioner
to file a reply before the hearing. On May 6, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. The
Court has received an electronic copy of the administrative record.[5] 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
(CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
 
 
 
A.          
Substantial Evidence
Review
 
Numerous Court of Appeal
cases have affirmed that student sexual misconduct proceedings at public and
private universities do not involve a fundamental vested right, and that the
substantial evidence standard applies in the trial court. (See, e.g., Doe
v. Occidental College (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 208, 220-221; Doe v. Allee
(2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1036, 1060; Doe v. University of Southern California
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 221, 238, 239, 248-49; Doe v. Regents of the
University of California (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1073-74; see also
Gurfinkel v. Los Angeles Community College Dist. (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 1, 6
[no fundamental right to a public college education].)
 
Substantial evidence is “relevant
evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a
conclusion” (California Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board (2002)
104 Cal.App.4th 575, 584-85), or evidence of ponderable legal significance
which is reasonable, credible and of solid value (Kuhn v. Department of
General Services (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1627, 1633). “Courts may reverse an
[administrative] decision only if, based on the evidence…a reasonable person
could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency.” (Sierra Club v.
California Coastal Com. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602, 610.)
 
“On substantial evidence
review, [the court] do[es] not weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of
witnesses, or resolve conflicts in the evidence or in the reasonable inferences
that may be drawn from it. The administrative agency’s findings come before
[the court] with a strong presumption as to their correctness and regularity.
[The court] do[es] not substitute [its] own judgment if the agency’s decision
is one which could have been made by reasonable people. Only if no reasonable
person could reach the conclusion reached by the administrative agency, based
on the entire record before it, will a court conclude that the agency’s
findings are not supported by substantial evidence.” (Doe v. Regents of
University of California (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1073, citations and
quotations omitted.)
 
B.          
Fair Hearing
 
“Generally,
a fair procedure requires ‘notice reasonably calculated to apprise interested
parties of the pendency of the action ... and an opportunity to present their
objections.’” (Doe v. University of Southern California (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 221, 240.) “A university is bound by its own policies and
procedures.” (Doe v. Regents of the University of California (2016) 5
Cal.App.5th 1055, 1078.) “Fair hearing requirements are ‘flexible’ and entail
no ‘rigid procedure.’” (Doe v. Allee (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1036, 1062,
disapproved of on other grounds by Boermeester v. Carry (2023) 15
Cal.5th 72, 96.) “To comport with due process …, university procedures must be
tailored in light of the matters at issue, to ensure that parties have a
meaningful opportunity to present their case.” (Id. at 1063-64.) As a
general rule, the accused usually “must be permitted to see the evidence
against him.” (Doe v. Regents of University of California (2018) 28
Cal.App.5th 44, 57.)
 
Procedural
errors, “even if proved, are subject to a harmless error analysis.” (Hinrichs
v. County of Orange (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 921, 928.) “The question is
whether the violation resulted in unfairness, in some way depriving [petitioner]
of adequate notice or an opportunity to be heard before impartial judges.” (Rhee
v. El Camino Hosp. Dist. (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 477, 497; see also
Thornbrough v. Western Placer Unified School Dist. (2013) 223 Cal.App.4th
169, 200.)
 
The
procedural fairness of an administrative proceeding is a question of law and
accordingly reviewed de novo. (Doe v. University of Southern California
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1212, 1231; Nasha L.L.C. v. City of Los Angeles
(2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470, 482.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Fairness
of Hearing
 
Petitioner
contends that the Hearing Officer was not neutral and failed to apply the
preponderance of the evidence standard. Petitioner argues the Hearing Officer deprived
him of a fair hearing because she (1) ignored the distinction between
reasonable belief in consent and actual consent and (2) failed to explain how
the conduct during the Second Incident on September 17, 2021 was unwelcome when
Roe accepted the conduct before and did not indicate the conduct was unwelcome
on the date of the Second Incident. 
 
1.           
Reasonable
Belief in Consent as Defense
 
With
respect to the first ground, the Policy requires each individual engaging in
sexual activity “to ensure they have the Affirmative Consent of the other(s) to
engage in each act of sexual activity.” (AR 92, emphasis in original.)
“Affirmative consent” is defined as “affirmative, conscious, and voluntary
agreement to engage in sexual activity.” (AR 92.) Affirmative consent “is
positive cooperation in act and attitude made with knowledge and agreement to
the nature of the act.” (AR 92.) 
 
Petitioner’s
assertion that the Hearing Officer ignored the distinction between reasonable
belief in consent and actual consent is incorrect. The Hearing Officer set
forth the portion of the Policy that indicates that reasonable belief in
affirmative consent is a defense to sexual assault. (AR 757-58; see also
AR 95 [portion of Policy regarding reasonable belief in affirmative consent].) The
Policy provides: “In evaluating whether a Respondent’s belief was plausible and
reasonable, the University will consider the totality of circumstances,
including information known to the Respondent, as well as information that
should reasonably have been known to the Respondent. The University will
evaluate whether the communication (through clear words and/or actions) between
the parties would be interpreted by a reasonable person (under similar circumstances
and with similar identities) as a willingness to engage in a particular sexual
act.” (AR 95.)
 
In
the Decision, the Hearing Officer explained, with respect to digital
penetration:
 
[N]either
party described any actions or words by Reporting Party related to this specific
sexual activity until Reporting Party stated that she began to say, ‘ow,’ and
indicate that she was in pain. While Respondent stated that he did not hear or
observe any negative response from Reporting Party, even if true, a lack of a ‘no’
is insufficient to indicate the presence of affirmative consent.
 
(AR
763, emphasis in original.) Because petitioner digitally penetrated Roe without
any communication from her, the Hearing Officer concluded: “[T]here is
sufficient evidence, by a preponderance of the evidence, to conclude that Respondent
digitally penetrated Reporting Party’s vagina without affirmative consent
during the First Incident.” (AR 763.) Based on the lack of communication by Roe
regarding digital penetration, petitioner could not avail himself of a defense
based on his reasonable belief. 
 
The
Hearing Officer thus properly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard
and the University’s Policy regarding affirmative consent. The petitioner fails
to demonstrate that the Hearing Officer was not impartial. 
 
2.           
Explanation
Regarding Why Contact During Second Incident was Unwelcome
 
With
respect to the second ground, the Policy defines Sexual and Gender-Based
Harassment to include “any sexual advance, request for sexual favors, or other unwelcome
conduct of a sexual nature, whether…physical…or otherwise” when the “conduct is
sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent that it has the purpose or effect
of unreasonably interfering with, limiting or depriving an individual from
participating in or benefiting from the University’s learning, working, or living
programs under both a subjective and objective perspective.” (AR 87.)
 
The
Hearing Officer found: “Considering the totality of the evidence, the Hearing
Officer finds that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that Respondent
subjected Reporting Party to unwelcome sexual contact when he touched her while
trying to dance and/or interact with her at the party.” (AR 766.) The Hearing
Officer also found that petitioner’s conduct during the Second Incident was “was
severe, pervasive, and offensive from both an objective and subjective
perspective.” (AR 767.)
 
Petitioner
argues that the Hearing Officer did not explain how petitioner’s conduct during
the Second Incident was objectively unwelcome when Roe accepted the conduct
before and did not indicate the conduct was unwelcome on the date of the Second
Incident. Petitioner is incorrect. The Hearing Officer noted that, before the
Second Incident, Roe told petitioner that she only wanted to be friends. (AR
766.) The Hearing Officer also explained that Roe, Bernstein, and Boyejo recounted
instances when petitioner grabbed Roe by the hip or touched Roe’s waist and
stomach. (AR 766.) The Hearing Officer described Bernstein and Boyejo’s
testimony in which observed Roe’s visible disapproval of petitioner’s actions.
(AR 766.) 
 
Based
on the foregoing, regardless of whether Roe accepted touching from petitioner
prior to the Second Incident, the Hearing Officer explained that Roe did not
welcome petitioner’s touching her during the Second Incident. The Hearing
Officer thus explained why petitioner’s touching was objectively unwelcome. The
Hearing Officer properly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard and
the University’s Policy regarding sexual harassment. The petitioner fails to
demonstrate that the Hearing Officer was not impartial.
 
B.          
Substantial
Evidence Supporting Hearing Officer’s Finding
 
1.           
First
Incident
 
With
respect to the finding that petitioner digitally penetrated Roe’s vagina
without affirmative consent, petitioner contends that the Hearing Officer did
not explain why petitioner’s perception of Roe’s consent was unreasonable when
the Hearing Officer found that petitioner did not sexually assault Roe through
penile-vaginal penetration. (AR 762.) 
 
Substantial
evidence supports the finding that petitioner digitally penetrated Roe without
affirmative consent. Roe testified during the hearing that petitioner did not
say anything to her before he began to digitally penetrate her. (AR 838.)
Petitioner was asked during the hearing, “[B]efore you started penetrating [Roe’s]
vagina with your fingers, did you have any communication, whether verbal or
non-verbal, about you starting to engage in that act?” (AR 897.) Petitioner
responded, “No,” explaining that while attempting to get another erection, he
“quickly improvise[d]” by deciding to “finger her.” (AR 897.) Because both
petitioner and Roe agreed that Roe provided no affirmative indication, either
through actions or words, that she consented to digital penetration, petitioner
could not avail himself of a defense based on his reasonable belief. 
 
In
the opening brief, petitioner argues that the Hearing Officer ignored his
testimony that he observed no signs or exclamations indicating that Roe
disapproved of the digital penetration. (AR 743, 897-98; Opening Br. at 8:26-9:11.)
However, the Policy states: “Consent cannot be inferred from silence,
passivity, or lack of verbal or physical resistance.” (AR 93.) Petitioner thus
cannot rely on any lack of express disapproval from Roe in arguing that his perception
of Roe’s consent was reasonable. 
 
In
the reply, petitioner argues that a reasonable inference of Roe’s agreement to
engage in sexual activity while in the “doggy style” position, i.e.
facing away from petitioner, “is that some form of penetration would continue.”
(Reply at 3:27-4:4.) Petitioner also argue that the Hearing Officer did not address
the issue of revocation of consent. (Reply at 7:7-12.) Petitioner’s arguments are
expressly contradicted by the Policy, which provides: “Consent to one form of
sexual activity does not imply or constitute consent to another form of sexual
activity.” (AR 93.) Accordingly, petitioner was not entitled to infer that
Roe’s consent to penile-vaginal intercourse constituted consent to digital
penetration. 
 
For
the foregoing reasons, substantial evidence supports the Hearing Officer’s finding
that petitioner was responsible for sexual assault by digital penetration. (AR
763.)
 
2.           
Second
Incident
 
With
respect to the finding that petitioner subjected Roe to unwelcome sexual
contact during the Second Incident, petitioner argues that Roe did not clearly
define her boundaries before the Second Incident and that she previously
accepted similar conduct before that night. 
 
Substantial
evidence supports the Hearing Officer’s finding that petitioner was responsible
for sexual harassment. (AR 765-68.) During the hearing, petitioner admitted
that Roe told him that she didn’t want to “hook up” again but said the two could remain
friends. (AR 831, 899-900.) Despite having been told that Roe no longer wanted
to have sex with petitioner, petitioner sat down next to Roe and grabbed Roe by
the hips after she stood up. (AR 213-15.) Petitioner touched her to “feel out that new dynamic,” i.e.,
them as friends, and to avoid questions from others regarding his status with
Roe. (AR 307-08.) Further, during the hearing, petitioner admitted that
he attempted to dance with Roe but got
the impression Roe did not want to dance with him. (AR 899.) Petitioner
recalled that Roe acted “noticeably colder towards [him] that night.” (AR 831.)
Petitioner thus understood his conduct toward Roe to be unwelcome. 
 
Further, Bernstein
observed petitioner trying to get Roe’s attention or dance with her throughout
the evening. (AR 603-04.) Bernstein testified that he
witnessed petitioner having his hands around Roe’s waist and touching her
stomach area, touching which she did not reciprocate. (AR 610-11, 923-24.)
Bernstein stated that Roe’s “facial expressions looked like that she was very
uncomfortable. You could tell that she wasn't touching him back.” (AR 924; see
also AR 603-04, 610-11 [investigatory interview of Bernstein].)
 
Bernstein also described how the incidents,
including both the First and Second Incidents, made Roe feel: “She described it
as being traumatizing, horrible. She’s scared to walk around campus. She’s
scared to be here in general. Being here just makes her scared. She had to go
home a bunch of times this year. She’s scared to go to class because fear of
seeing him, scared of going to the dining hall, and fear of seeing him. Scared
of leaving her dorm from the fear of seeing him…. [B]asically she felt like she
missed out on her whole freshman year because of this, it grew into her whole
freshman year because she wasn't able to interact with people socially,
properly after, missing events and stuff. She wasn’t able to make friends.” (AR
624.) Bernstein’s account is consistent with Roe’s statement to the
Investigator: “I can't be at USC if he’s here. I fully can’t. This place makes
me so sad. I want to be home right now because I’m scared to just walk
everywhere and to run into him. Before Thanksgiving, I ran into him. I turned
and almost ran into a building. I’d rather hurt myself running into a building
than running into him. I really can’t be here if he’s here.” (AR 205.)
 
Boyejo told the Investigator that he witnessed
petitioner “still touching [Roe] like
they were in a relationship,” including one instance in which petitioner
touched or grabbed Roe around her waist. (AR 344.) Boyejo perceived Roe as not
wanting to be around petitioner. (AR 344.) The Hearing Officer stated that
Boyejo’s observations occurred between September 5 and September 17. (AR 752.) The
date of Boyejo’s observations is unclear from the transcript of the
investigatory interview. When the Investigator asked Boyejo when he made these
observations, Boyejo replied that he was not sure but that by September 18,
2021, it was clear that petitioner was acting as if he and Roe were in a
relationship. (AR 344-45.) In the reply, petitioner notes that, after the
investigatory interview, Boyejo emailed the Investigator stating that he only
heard about the unwanted advances from Roe and that he did not witness the
advances. (AR 372.) Even though it is unclear whether Boyejo observed
petitioner’s touching of Roe during the Second Incident or at all, Boyejo’s
testimony is still evidence that petitioner’s touching of Roe was objectively
and subjectively unwelcome.
 
Based on the foregoing, notwithstanding whether Roe
accepted touching of a sexual nature prior to the Second Incident, Roe told
petitioner prior to the Second Incident that she no longer wanted a sexual
relationship. Petitioner nevertheless touched Roe, which was both subjectively
and objectively severe, pervasive, and offensive, particularly when considered
in conjunction with the First Incident. For
the foregoing reasons, substantial evidence supports the Hearing Officer’s finding
that petitioner was responsible for sexual harassment. 
 
C.          
Propriety
of Penalty
 
Petitioner
maintains that he had no notice that he faced expulsion or suspension as a
result of the violations of the University’s Policy. However, the Policy expressly
states that sanctions imposed upon students can include suspension or
expulsion. (AR 139.) Petitioner was provided the Policy when he was notified of
the investigation. (AR 157.)
 
            Petitioner also argues that that, based
on the initial decision to expel him, the Sanctioning Panel did not consider
the character reference letters he submitted. (AR 1090-1104.) However, the
Policy only allowed petitioner to submit and the Sanctioning Panel to consider
“a written statement explaining any factors that the Respondent believes should
mitigate or otherwise be considered in determining the sanctions(s) imposed.”
(AR 138.) The Sanctioning Panel considered the mitigation statement submitted
by petitioner. (AR 1105-06, 1109, 1115.) The Sanctioning Panel thus acted in
accordance with the Policy and reached the decision to expel petitioner. (AR 138-39,
1115-17.)
 
            Petitioner contends that the Sanctioning
Panel’s assertion that he failed to show remorse is inaccurate. The decision on
sanctions states that petitioner’s mitigation statement “did not appear to be
an acceptance of responsibility.” (AR 1116.) In the mitigation statement, petitioner
asserted that he should not be punished when the only evidence is conflicting
testimonies from petitioner and Roe and Roe’s story was “glaringly
inconsistent.” (AR 1105.) Petitioner never acknowledged having sexually
assaulted and harassed Roe. Further, in petitioner’s written appeal, petitioner
continued to assert that there was no concrete evidence and that Roe’s accounts
were inconsistent. (AR 1118.) While petitioner did not deny Roe experienced pain
or trauma, petitioner essentially apologized for the way Roe felt without acknowledging
that he was the cause of such feelings. Put simply, petitioner’s statement that
he is sorry Roe feels hurt is not an acceptance of responsibility. 
 
If
reasonable minds can differ with regard to the propriety of the disciplinary
action, there is no abuse of discretion. (County of Los Angeles v. Civil
Service Commission (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 620, 634.) With respect to the
impact on the reporting party, which is one of the factors to consider in
deciding an appropriate sanction (AR 138), Roe wrote in her impact statement:
 
The
night of september [sic] 5th and the sexual harassment that followed resulted
in me being hurting physically and mentally. I have been diagnosed by two
therapists with severe depression and PTSD. Additionally, my anxiety and stress
has impacted my physical health. In the past year I have had several flare ups
of my IBS and had to be hospitalized due to lower abdominal pain…. Being on the
same campus as the respondent and seeing him while walking to and from class
put me in a state of constant fear. Fear for my safety resulted in me having
panic attacks and not being able to sleep.
 
(AR
1088.) Based on petitioner’s impact on Roe, along with the nature and severity
of his conduct and his refusal to accept responsibility, the Court does not
find any abuse of discretion with respect to the imposition of a three-year
suspension. (See Lake v. Civil Service Commission (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d
224, 228.)
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The
petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), respondent University of
Southern California shall prepare, serve, and
ultimately file a proposed judgment.
