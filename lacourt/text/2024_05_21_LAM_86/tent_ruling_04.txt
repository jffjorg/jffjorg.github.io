having caused an accident by unsafely operating City equipment. (AR 399.) In
2008, petitioner served a five-working-day suspension for causing or
contributing to an accident by unsafely operating City equipment. (AR 399.)
In 2018, petitioner served a 20-working-day suspension for causing or

30-working-day suspension. (AR 402.)
