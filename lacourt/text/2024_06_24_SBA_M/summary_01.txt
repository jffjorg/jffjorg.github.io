And here is a summary in English text:

The Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka, Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, Southwest District, issued a tentative ruling on June 24, 2024, in the case of Carol Joyce Pleatman, et al. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, et al. (Case No. 21TRCV00136).

The defendants, Active Environmental Solutions, LLC, et al., moved to compel arbitration, alleging that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties. However, the court denied the motion, finding that the defendants failed to meet their burden to establish a valid arbitration agreement.

The court noted that the defendants did not provide sufficient evidence to show a refusal to arbitrate prior to filing the motion, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2. The court also found that the defendants did not provide evidence that the transaction involved interstate commerce, which would have brought the dispute within the purview of the Federal Arbitration Act.

As a result, the court denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and ordered the plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.
