Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to quash the service of the summons and complaint. The defendant argues that the service was not properly made because the person who allegedly accepted service, John Doe, is not a authorized agent for service of process. The plaintiff argues that the service was made by a registered process server and that there is a presumption of proper service. However, the court finds that the presumption was controverted by supporting evidence submitted by the defendant and that the plaintiff failed to meet her burden to prove the facts of effective service. The court notes that the proof of service only indicates personal service and does not provide sufficient evidence of substitute service. The defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint is granted.
