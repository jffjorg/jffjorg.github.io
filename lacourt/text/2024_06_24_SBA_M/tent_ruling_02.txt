            23TRCV02624
1.      4171
W. El Segundo Blvd. Inc.’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            4171 W. El Segundo Blvd. Inc.’s Motion to
Quash Service of Summons and Complaint is granted.  
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on August 15, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff
is a tenant at property owned or controlled by Defendant landlords. The
property suffers from numerous habitability issues. 
 
            Motion
to Quash 
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.10 states: 
            “A
summons may be served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the
complaint to the person to be served. Service of a summons in this manner is
deemed complete at the time of such delivery. The date upon which personal
delivery is made shall be entered on or affixed to the face of the copy of the
summons at the time of its delivery. However, service of a summons without such
date shall be valid and effective.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 416.10 states:
            “A
summons may be served on a corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and
the complaint by any of the following methods:
(a) To the person designated as agent for service of
process as provided by any provision in Section 202, 1502, 2105, or 2107 of the
Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to
6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976,
with respect to corporations to which they remain applicable).
(b) To the president, chief executive officer, or
other head of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant
secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief financial
officer, a general manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to
receive service of process.
(c) If the corporation is a bank, to a cashier or
assistant cashier or to a person specified in subdivision (a) or (b).
(d) If authorized by any provision in Section 1701,
1702, 2110, or 2111 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303,
inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in
effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which they remain
applicable), as provided by that provision.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.20 states, in relevant part: 
            “(a)
In lieu of personal delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint to the
person to be served as specified in Section 416.10, 416.20, 416.30, 416.40, or
416.50, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint
during usual office hours in his or her office or, if no physical address is
known, at his or her usual mailing address, other than a United States Postal
Service post office box, with the person who is apparently in charge thereof,
and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class
mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of
the summons and complaint were left. When service is effected by leaving a copy
of the summons and complaint at a mailing address, it shall be left with a
person at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof.
Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after
the mailing.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10 states, in relevant part: “(a) A defendant, on or before
the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the
court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one
or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”
 
            Substantial compliance requires a showing
of the following: there must be some degree of compliance, that the
circumstances show that it was highly probable that attempted service imparted
the same notice as full compliance, and that the attempted service provided
sufficient notice to Defendant to put on a defense. Carol Gilbert, Inc. v.
Haller (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 852, 865-66.
 
            Pursuant
to CCP § 418.10(a)(1), Defendant moves to quash service of the summons on the
grounds that it was not properly served with the summons and complaint under CCP
§ 416.10. The Court notes that the proof of service does provide some
information in paragraph 5b regarding substitute service. However, only
paragraph 5a was checked, not paragraph 5b. Thus, the proof of service
indicates personal service only – not substitute service.
 
            “Section
418.10, subdivision (a) (§ 418.10(a)), entitles a defendant to move to quash
“on or before the last day of [the movant's] time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow.” In re Marriage of
Obrecht (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 1, 16. “The notice shall designate, as the
time for making the motion, a date not more than 30 days after filing of the
notice. The notice shall be served in the same manner, and at the same times,
prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005. The service and filing of the
notice shall extend the defendant's time to plead until 15 days after service
upon him or her of a written notice of entry of an order denying his or her
motion, except that for good cause shown the court may extend the defendant's
time to plead for an additional period not exceeding 20 days.” Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 418.10(b).
 
            Plaintiff
argues that the motion was not timely filed and noticed to be heard. The face
of the proof of service indicates personal service on October 2, 2023. The
motion was filed on November 3, 2023 – not within the time to plead. In
addition, the motion was not set for a date no more than 30 days after filing
of the notice of motion in contravention of CCP § 418.10(b). However, as noted
above, the Court has discretion to extend these time frames upon a showing of
“good cause.” In addition, scheduling a hearing date beyond 30 days does not
invalidate the motion. Olinick v. BMG Entertainment (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th
1286, 1296. Further, the Court determines that good cause exists to hear this
motion when Defendant filed this motion only one day after the time to plead. 
 
            When
a Defendant challenges the Court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process the burden is on the Plaintiff to prove the facts
of effective service.” Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413. Plaintiff must meet this burden by a preponderance of the evidence.  See, Ziller Elec. Lab GmbH v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232. 
 
            The
proof of service indicates that, pursuant to paragraph 3b, personal service was
effectuated upon an authorized agent as follows: “John Doe, Reception 1, for
Agent Ritesh Desai, 25-39 years, weight - 165-195lbs, height - 5'2-5'8[.]” In
the declaration submitted by Defendant, Ritesh Desai declares: “I am the only
agent for service of process listed on the California Secretary of State
website for 4171 W. El SEGUNDO BLVD. INC. The agent's address is 2016 Riverside
Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90039. The JOHN DOE receptionist that was supposedly
served is not an employee, officer, manager, or designated agent for service of
process, nor other person authorized to accept service of process on behalf of
4171 W. EL SEGUNDO BLVD., INC.” (Decl., Ritesh Desai, ¶¶ 2-3.)
 
            Plaintiff
submitted no evidence to meet her burden to prove the facts of effective
service. Plaintiff argues for a presumption of proper service by a registered
process server. Evid. Code § 647 states: “The return of a process server
registered pursuant to Chapter 16 (commencing with Section 22350) of Division 8
of the Business and Professions Code upon process or notice establishes a
presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in
the return.” Here, however, the presumption of service was controverted by
supporting evidence submitted by Defendant. Plaintiff, however, submitted no
evidence to show that “John Doe” was, in fact, a person authorized to accept
service on behalf of the corporate Defendant.
 
            Therefore, Defendant’s motion to quash
service of summons and complaint is granted.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
