Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the Plaintiffs' Application for Default Judgment without prejudice. The court notes several defects in the application, including the failure to use the most current version of mandatory Judicial Council form CIV-100, the lack of a declaration from Plaintiff Lopez, and the fact that Plaintiff Hernandez's declaration is written in English without a translator's declaration. The court also queries Plaintiff Hernandez's entitlement to double damages under Probate Code § 859 and requests further briefing on this issue. The court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment as to all Defaulted Defendants for October 10, 2023.
