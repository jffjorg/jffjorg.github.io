  Case Number:  21PSCV00537    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2023    Dept:  K Plaintiffs Olivia
Hernandez’s and Sugey Lopez’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
This lawsuit
involves a Property Assessed Clean Energy (“PACE”)/Home Energy Renovation
Opportunity (“HERO”) loan. Plaintiffs Olivia Hernandez (“Hernandez”) and Sugey
Lopez (“Lopez”) (hereinafter collectively, “Plaintiffs”) contend that, in the
fall of 2018, Esmeralda de Vasquez (“de Vasquez”) and Aldo Manuel Perez
Martinez (“Perez”), acting as unlicensed agents for Danneco Construction
(“Danneco”), came to Hernandez’s home located at 569 La Seda Road, La Puente,
California 91744 (the “Property”) and represented to Hernandez that they could
build an extra dwelling unit on same for $55,000.00, that they could help her
obtain a loan for the project, that the loan would not take the form of a lien,
that she would not have to repay the loan until the unit was complete and that
rental income from the unit would pay for the loan.
Although Hernandez
was a Spanish speaker and the presentation was made in Spanish, the contracts
provided to Hernandez were in English. Lopez is a co-owner of the Property. The
total cost of the project was over $120,000.00 and the loan was ultimately recorded
as a municipal tax lien against the home. Perez forged or fraudulently
procedures Hernandez’s signature on a completion certificate before any work
had been performed.

Thanh Danh’s (“Danh”) default was entered. On October 5, 2021, Danneco’s
default was entered.
On January 3, 2022,

An Order to Show
Cause Re: Default Judgment as to all Defaulted Defendants is set for October
10, 2023.
Discussion
Plaintiffs’ Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
 
1.             Plaintiffs have failed to utilize the most current
version of mandatory Judicial Council form CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023]. 
2.             Plaintiff Lopez has failed to submit a declaration.
3.             It appears to the court that Plaintiff Hernandez does
not speak, read and/or write English (i.e., “Plaintiff Oliva Hernandez[] is a
Spanish-speaking senior citizen” [Case Summary, 4:10], “Ms. Hernandez does not
speak English, but the contracts. . . were provided in English. . .” [Id.,
5:16-17], “Ms. Hernandez is a native Spanish speaker and has limited
proficiency in spoken and written English” [Id., 6:2-3], “I am a
Spanish-speaking senior citizen” [Hernandez Decl., ¶ 1], “We spoke exclusively
in Spanish” [Id., ¶ 6], “None of the paperwork I signed for the project
was provided to me in Spanish and Defendants did not provide me with Spanish
copies of them” [Id., ¶ 10] and “Danh had me sign an English-language
paper document. . .” [Id., ¶ 18].) Plaintiff Hernandez’s declaration,
however, is written in English and is not accompanied by a translator’s
declaration. 
4.             Hernandez’s declaration reflects non-compliance with
Code of Civil Procedure § 2015.5.
5.             The court queries Plaintiff Hernandez’s entitlement to
Probate Code § 859 double damages and requests further
briefing in this regard. “The section 859 penalty is imposed when an interested
party establishes both that the property in question is recoverable under
section 850 and that there was a bad faith taking of the property.” (Estate
of Kraus (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 103, 112.) Plaintiffs have not
filed a probate action as per section 850.
