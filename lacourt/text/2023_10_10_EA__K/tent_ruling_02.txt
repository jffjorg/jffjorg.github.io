Discussion
Plaintiff applies for a writ of possession
after hearing pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 512.010 et seq.  Plaintiff seeks to recover the 2018
Chevrolet Silverado, VIN # 
3GCPCRECXJG139952
(“subject vehicle”) now in the possession of Defendant.
“Claim and
delivery is a remedy by which a party with a superior right to a specific item
of personal property (created, most commonly, by a contractual lien) may
recover possession of that specific property before judgment.” (Waffer Internat. Corp. v. Khorsandi
(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1271.)
Procedural Considerations: No writ of possession may issue,
except after a hearing on a noticed motion (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.020, subd. (a))
or by ex parte application satisfying the conditions of section 512.020,
subdivision (b).  Prior to the section 512.020
hearing, the defendant must be served with all of the following: (a) A copy of
the summons and complaint; (b) A Notice of Application and Hearing; (c) A copy
of the application and any affidavit in support thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.030,
subd. (a).) “If the defendant has not appeared in the action, and a writ, notice, order,
or other paper is required to be personally served on the defendant under this
title, service shall be made in the same manner as a summons is served under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10) of Title 5.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 512.030, subd. (b).) 
The "Notice of Application
and Hearing" must inform the defendant of all of the following: (a) A
hearing will be held at a place and at a time, to be specified in the notice,
on plaintiff's application for a writ of possession; (b) The writ will be
issued if the court finds that the plaintiff's claim is probably (not actually)
valid and the other requirements for issuing the writ are established; (c) If
the defendant desires to oppose the issuance of the writ, he must file with the
court either an affidavit providing evidence sufficient to defeat the
plaintiff's right to issuance of the writ or an undertaking to stay the
delivery of the property in accordance with section 515.020; (d) The notice
must contain the following statement: “If you believe the plaintiff may not be
entitled to possession of the property claimed, you may wish to seek the advice
of an attorney. Such attorney should be consulted promptly so that he may
assist you before the time set for the hearing.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.040.)
On October 2, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a proof of service, which reflected that Defendant had been
personally served with, inter alia, the summons, complaint, Notice of
Application for Writ of Possession and Hearing, Application for Writ of
Possession, and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff’s
Application for Pre-Trial Writ of Possession on September 19, 2023. Code of
Civil Procedure § 1005 (i.e., 16 court days’ notice) governs the written notice
under Code of Civil Procedure § 512.030. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd.
(a)(2)). Friday, September 22, 2023 was a court holiday and is thus excluded
from notice calculations.
The application, then,
is continued to November 20, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. on the basis of insufficient
notice.
