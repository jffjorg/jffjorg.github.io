And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing on Ally Bank's application for a writ of possession after hearing to November 20, 2023 at 8:30 am. Ally Bank alleges that Ivette Rodriguez, the defendant, failed to make payments under a retail installment sales contract for a 2018 Chevrolet Silverado. Ally Bank seeks to recover possession of the vehicle. The judge notes that procedural considerations require that the defendant be served with a notice of application and hearing, and that the notice must inform the defendant of the hearing date, time, and place, as well as the requirements for opposing the issuance of the writ. The judge also notes that the defendant must be served with a copy of the summons and complaint, and that the application for writ of possession must be made after a hearing on a noticed motion. The judge concludes that the application is continued due to insufficient notice.
