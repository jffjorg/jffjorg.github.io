And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Tentative Ruling is a decision by Judge Kerry Bensinger regarding a motion to relate two separate cases, 22STCV12440 and 24STCV02510. The cases involve separate attempts by two different plaintiffs to secure a mortgage loan from the same defendant, Castle Mortgage Corporation. The plaintiffs in each case allege that the defendant breached their contract and concealed its intent to only fund the loan if it was profitable. The court has previously denied the plaintiffs' request to dismiss the defendant in one of the cases. The court has also previously issued an order declining to relate the two cases. The motion to relate the cases is based on the similarity between the two cases, including the same defendant, similar claims, and similar witnesses. However, the court finds that the cases are not substantially similar and do not involve the same parties, transactions, or events. Therefore, the court declines to relate the cases and the motion is denied.
