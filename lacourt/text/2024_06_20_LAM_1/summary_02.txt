```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to relate the cases is GRANTED. The cases are related because they involve the same six causes of action and arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact. The judge finds that the cases are likely to require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges, and that judicial economy is best served by having a single judicial officer address the identical ICRAA issues raised by each case.
