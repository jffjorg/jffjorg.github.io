Complaint against Russell M. Frandsen, Christie Frandsen, Andre Berger, Tracy
Berger, Westside Pacific Estates, Inc., Wells Fargo Bank N.A., U.S. Bank,

of action for: (1) wrongful foreclosure (home); (2)) wrongful foreclosure
(condo); (3) set aside trustee’s sale; (4) cancellation of instruments; (5)
quiet title; and (6) declaratory relief.

Angeles, CA 90048. Defendants Russell M. Frandsen, Christie Frandsen, Andre
Berger, and Tracy Berger are the beneficiaries under the deeds of trust. The
SAC alleged the deeds of trust were created pursuant to a settlement agreement

account for Plaintiffs’ alleged set off claims and conducted the foreclosure
sale of the home and condo in a procedurally improper manner.

by Christie Frandsen, Andre Berger, Tracy Berger, Russell M. Framdsen, Westside

On February 9, 2024, Russell M. Frandsen, Christine
H. Frandsen, Andre Berger, and Tracy Berger filed 24VECV00579 against Alex
Foxman and Michal Janel Morey Foxman for unlawful detainer of real property

On
February 26, 2024, Alex Forman, et al filed a Notice of Filing of Notice of
Related Case involving 24VECV00579 and 19STCV00723. 
 
On
March 1, 2024, Judge Steve Cochran issued an order in 19STCV00723 finding
19STCV00723 and 24VECV00579 were not related within the meaning of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).

Motion 
 
On May 28, 2024, Plaintiffs Alex Foxman
and Michal Morey-Foxman filed the instant motion seeking to relate 23STCV19020
and 24VECV00579.   In opposition,
Defendants Russell M. Frandsen, Christine Frandsen, Andre Berger, Tracy Berger
and Westside Pacific Estates, Inc. argue the merits of the underlying
litigation and contend the motion must be denied because Plaintiffs failed to
file the Notice of Related Case in 23STCV19020. 
In a separately filed opposition, Russell Frandsen and Christie
Frandsen, as plaintiffs, contend the cases are not related under any of the
grounds enumerated in California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).
 
Judicial Notice
 
The requests for judicial notice of various court
documents, recorded documents, as well as the settlement agreement and
promissory note by the opposing parties are GRANTED. (Evid. Code §§ 452(c);
452(d).) 
 
Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The
Motion is Procedurally Improper
 
While the opposing parties’ arguments
regarding the merits of Plaintiffs’ “offset theory” are immaterial to the issue
of relation, (Def. Opp. at 5:4-15:2; Pltf Opp. at 7:22-16:25), Defendants also
note the “Foxmans never filed a Notice of Related Case in the present action,
Case No 23STCV19020.” (Def. Opp. at 15:5-6.)
 
A motion to relate in Department 1 is
only procedurally proper “[i]n the event that the judge designated under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)(B)(C) to make the decision, does
not order related any of the cases set forth in the Notice of Related Cases . .
.” (LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3). See also Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(h)(1)(D).) Plaintiffs did not file a Notice of Related Case in
23STCV19020. Plaintiffs also did not include 23STCV19020 as a case to be
related in Sections 1, 2, or 3 of the Notice of Related Case which was filed on
February 26, 2024 in 19STCV00723 and 24VECV00579. Consistent with this
omission, the March 1, 2024 order on the Notice entered in 19STCV00723 made no
reference to 23STCV19020. 
 
Plaintiffs have not properly filed a
Notice of Related Case involving 23STCV19020 and 24VECV00579 in 23STCV19020 and
have not provided the designated judicial officer a proper opportunity to
consider a Notice of Related Case involving these two cases. Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ motion to relate is DENIED as procedurally improper.
