The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing to allow the parties to provide supplemental information. The parties had filed an unopposed motion for judicial reference, but they failed to provide the required certification from the referee, as well as the name and telephone number of a person for the public to contact. They also failed to submit a proposed order. The judge has ordered the parties to provide the required information prior to the continued hearing date.
