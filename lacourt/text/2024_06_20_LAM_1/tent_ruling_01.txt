INVESTMENTS, LLC, et al. vs CALCULATED RISK ANALYTICS
Plaintiffs’ Unopposed Motion to Relate Cases
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is DENIED.  Clerk to give notice.  
Background
of 22STCV12440 NBZ Investments v.
Calculated Risk Analytics
 
On April 13, 2022, NBZ Investments, LLC, Neda Zaman, and
Behzad Zaman filed this action against Calculated Risk Analytics, LLC and
Castle Mortgage Corporation arising out of Plaintiffs’ attempts to secure a
mortgage loan from Defendants. 
 
On January 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended
Complaint (“TAC”) asserting causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2)
fraud and deceit: inducement; (3) fraud and deceit: concealment; (4)
intentional misrepresentation; (5) negligent misrepresentation; and (6) unfair,
unlawful, and fraudulent business practices under Section 17200 of California’s
Business and Professions Code. The TAC alleges Plaintiff NBZ Investments, which
is managed and owned by Plaintiffs Neda Zaman and Behzad Zaman, owns real
property located at 726 Foothill Road, Beverly Hills, CA 90210. Plaintiff NBZ
Investments alleges it engaged mortgage broker Bernard E. Cohen Investments
(“Bernard Cohen”) “to assist and find a lender for the refinance of a first and
second note for the total principal amount of $1,400,000.00 secured by the
Property.” (TAC ¶ 14.) Plaintiffs allege Defendants sent Bernard Cohen loan
approval documents in October of 2021 with an asserted “locked in” rate of
3.5%. In February of 2022, Defendants sent a second approval certificate, with
a rate of 3.625%. Defendants allegedly provided Plaintiffs a closing disclosure
detailing the terms of the loan on February 14, 2022, but thereafter failed to
fund the loan, sending a Statement of Credit Denial, Termination or Change
letter dated March 1, 2022. The letter indicated Plaintiffs had “insufficient
income for total obligations.” (TAC Ex. 4.) The complaint alleges Defendants
breached their contract to fund the loan, concealed that the loan would only be
funded if profitable to Defendants, and misrepresented that the rate was locked
in. 
 
On May 19, 2023, the court sustained Defendants’ demurrers
to the sixth cause of action without leave to amend. 
 
On November 14, 2023, the court entered Plaintiffs’ request
to dismiss Defendant Calculated Risk Analytics without prejudice. 
 
On January 31, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Related
Case involving 22STCV12440 and 24STCV02510 Basmajian v. Castle Mortgage.
 
On February 13, 2024, Judge Kerry Bensinger issued an order
providing, in relevant part, “[t]he Court finds that the following cases,
22STCV12440 and 24STCV02510, are not related within the meaning of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).”
 
This case is currently pending in Department 31 of the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse with trial set for June 2, 2025.
 
Background
of 24STCV02510 Basmajian v. Castle Mortgage
 
On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff
Gabriel Basmajian filed 24STCV02510 against Castle Mortgage Corporation
arising out Plaintiff’s attempt to secure a mortgage loan from Defendant. 
 
The complaint alleges Plaintiff owns real property located
at 10920 Hillhaven Avenue, Tujunga, CA 91042 and engaged mortgage broker
Bernard E. Cohen Investments (“Bernard Cohen”) “to assist and find a lender for
the refinance of a note in the principal amount of $620,000 to be secured by a
first deed of trust on the Property.” (Compl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff alleges
Defendant provided approval certificates for the loan on February 4, 2022 and
February 17, 2022 and provided a “Rate Lock” confirmation on February 7, 2024.
Defendant allegedly provided Plaintiff a closing disclosure detailing the terms
of the loan on February 23, 2022, but thereafter failed to fund the loan. In a
March 1, 2022 email, Defendant stated: “[g]iven the recent turmoil in capital
markets as a result of various extraordinary factors beyond the parties’
control (inflation, poor economic growth, a worldwide pandemic, the uncertainty
resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, etc.), it is commercially
impracticable at this time for Excelerate Capital to fund and close the
above-loan at 3.675%.” (Compl. Ex. 5.) The complaint alleges Defendant breached
the parties’ contract by not funding the loan and concealed its intent to only
fund the loan if it was profitable for Defendant. 
 
This case is currently pending in Department 15 of the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  
 
Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The
Court Declines to Relate the Cases at Issue
 
As
noted above, Judge Bensinger issued an order declining to relate 22STCV12440
and 24STCV02510. Accordingly, the motion is properly brought in Department 1.
(Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D), LASC Local Rule 3.3(f)(3).)   
 
Plaintiffs’
motion contends the cases should be related because “[t]he matters are
substantially similar, Plaintiffs are represented by the same counsel Thomas J.
Weiss and Shawn Zaman, the witnesses (such as Broker Bernard Cohen) are similar
in each matter, the Plaintiffs may be called witnesses in support of their
respective actions pursuant to Me Too evidence, the claims are similar . . .
the causes of action are similar, the Defendants are the same, the acts and
occurrences happened at substantially the same times, the matters require
determination of identical questions of law, and the matters will be handled
more efficiently under the same judge and the research attorneys/clerks who
have been involved an are familiar with the matter since inception (in
Department 31 of this Court).” (Mot. at 5:18-6:6.) 
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).) 
 
The
cases do not involve the same parties as the Plaintiffs are different in both
actions. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).) The cases do not arise from the same
or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact.
(Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(2).) While both cases involve attempted refinance
transactions with Castle Mortgage, the transactions involve different
Plaintiffs, are based upon different asserted grounds for denial, and require
determinations of law and fact unique to each Plaintiff including the contracts
at issue, the representations made, each Plaintiffs’ reliance thereon, and
potential damages. The individual questions of law and fact predominate and the
cases are not likely to involve a substantial duplication of judicial resources
if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(4).). Finally, the
cases do not involve the same property. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(3).) The
Court finds the cases are not related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300.
 
The Court declines to relate 22STCV12440 with 24STCV02510
and the motion is DENIED.
