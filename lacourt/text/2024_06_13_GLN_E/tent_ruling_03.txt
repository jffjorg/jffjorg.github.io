BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Alberto Devora, filed his verified complaint on
2/22/2024 alleging five causes of action for: (1) Violation of Civ. Code §
2923.5; (2) Violation of Civ. Code § 2923.7; (3) Violation of Civ. Code §
2924.9; (4) Violation of Civ. Code § 2924.10; and (5) Unfair Business
Practices, Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.
The instant action pertains to alleged violations pertaining
to a foreclosure.
 
MEET AND CONFER
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) “The parties
shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Defendant’s
counsel, Paula B. Hernandez, alleges that a meet and confer occurred but the
parties did not reach an agreement.
DEMURRER LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) The
court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,
but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….” (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)  
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter
of pleading … is that his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case
with reasonable precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the
defendant with the nature, source and extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard
v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727,
734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only
parts of causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose
of an entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v. Fremont General
Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”
(Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
Demurrer
– Uncertainty
A special demurrer for uncertainty,
CCP section 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained where the
pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or
what counts or claims are directed against him/her. (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
First Cause of Action – Violation of Civ. Code §
2923.5
Based
on the allegations in ¶¶ 20 and 22, Plaintiff appears to specifically be
alleging a violation of Civ. Code § 2923.5(a)(2). “SPS DEFENDANT failed to
satisfy the requirements of Civ. Code § 2923.5(a)(2) before recording a Notice
of Default, and violated this statute.” (Compl. ¶ 22.)
In particular, Plaintiff alleges, “On March 11, 2022,
SPS DEFENDANT recorded a Notice of Default on the Subject Property. PLAINTIFF
was staying in his home when the Notice of Default was issued, and received no
mail or messages. (Exhibit “D”).” (Compl. ¶ 21.)
Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not allege facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action for violation of Civ. Code § 2923.5.
The Court notes that 2923.5(a)(2) states 
A mortgage servicer shall contact the
borrower in person or by telephone in order to assess the borrower’s financial
situation and explore options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure. During the
initial contact, the mortgage servicer shall advise the borrower that he or she
has the right to request a subsequent meeting and, if requested, the mortgage
servicer shall schedule the meeting to occur within 14 days. The assessment of
the borrower’s financial situation and discussion of options may occur during the
first contact, or at the subsequent meeting scheduled for that purpose. In
either case, the borrower shall be provided the toll-free telephone number made
available by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) to find a HUD-certified housing counseling agency. Any meeting may occur
telephonically.
(Civ. Code §
2923.5(a)(2).)
Defendant argues that the
mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent only
needs to attempt to contact the borrower in accordance with the “due diligence”
efforts outlined in 2923.5(e).)
“A notice of default may
be recorded pursuant to Section 2924 when a mortgage servicer has not contacted
a borrower as required by paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) provided that the
failure to contact the borrower occurred despite the due diligence of the
mortgage servicer.” (Civ. Code § 2923.5(e).)
The Court notes that § 2923.5(e)(1)-(5)
defines the “due diligence” requirements.
Thus, Defendant’s
argument appears to be that the requirements of § 2923.5(a)(2) can be excused
when Defendant meets the due diligence requirements of § 2923.5(e)(1)-(5).
Defendant appears to be
arguing that based on Exhibit D that is attached to Plaintiff’s Complaint,
Defendant met the due diligence requirements. 
Exhibit D is the Notice
of Default and Election to Sell attached to Plaintiff’s verified complaint. In
relevant part of Exhibit D, it states, “On 10/20/2021 the due diligence efforts
were satisfied. No contact was made with the borrower despite the due diligence
of beneficiary or their authorized agent pursuant to California Civil Code §
2923.55(f).”
Defendant argues that the
mere existence of a declaration attesting compliance with Section 2923.5
disposes of Plaintiff’s claim unless there are specific factual allegations to
the contrary, and Defendant cites Maguca v. Aurora Loan Services (C.D.
Cal. Oct. 28, 2009) No. SACV 09-1086 JVS (ANx), 2009 WL 3467750 to support its
argument.
The Court does not find
Defendant’s argument availing for several reasons.
First, Plaintiff alleged
a violation of § 2923.5(a)(2), and the due diligence exceptions are outlined in
§ 2923.5(e).
The declaration attached
to Exhibit D references complying with the due diligence requirements of § 2923.55(f).
Further, with respect to
Defendant’s citation to Maguca, it is non-binding authority. Additionally,
Maguca stated, “The fourth cause of action, based upon California
Civil Code sections 2923.52 and 2923.53, is self-contradictory
because the FAC admits that Aurora and Chase are exempt from the statutes. (FAC
¶ 97.) The Court finds this admission sufficient to dismiss this cause of
action.” (Macuga at p. 2.)
Not only was Maguca
a federal case, it is not a reported case. Further, it doesn’t deal with § 2923.5(a)(2).
Even if the Court takes
judicial notice of Exhibit D, and even if the Court assumed that Defendant
complied with the due diligence requirements of § 2923.5(e) so that Defendant
does not have to comply with § 2923.5(a)(2), Defendant does not cite any
binding case law that Plaintiff had to allege that the § 2923.5(e) due
diligence requirements were not met. Or to phrase it differently, Defendant
does not come forward with any case law that Plaintiff had to allege both a
violation of § 2923.5(a)(2) and that the exceptions to § 2923.5(a)(2) do not
apply. Further, Plaintiff argues that regardless of the declaration in the
notice of default that Defendant attempted contact, Plaintiff argues none was
made. Thus, the Court fails to see how Defendant’s arguments are successful at
the pleading stage.
Defendant also cites the
following portion of Billesbach v. Specialized Loan Servicing LLC (2021)
63 Cal.App.5th 830, 837 to argue that the allegations establish that Defendant
subsequently cured any such violation:
[T]he HBOR creates liability only for
material violations that have not been remedied before the foreclosure sale is
recorded. A material violation is one that affected the
borrower's loan obligations, disrupted the
borrower's loan-modification **216 process, or otherwise harmed
the borrower. Based on these principles, we hold that where a
mortgage servicer's violations stem from its failure to communicate
with the borrower before recording a notice of default, the servicer may
cure these violations by doing what respondent did here: postponing the
foreclosure sale, communicating with the borrower about potential foreclosure
alternatives, and fully considering any application by the borrower for
a loan modification. Following these corrective measures, any
remaining violation relating to the recording of the notice of default is
immaterial, and a new notice of default is therefore not required to avoid
liability.
(Billesbach v.
Specialized Loan Servicing LLC (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 830, 837.)
Defendant then argues:
According to Plaintiff’s own allegations,
Defendant was in communication with Plaintiff after the NOD was recorded.
Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that he submitted the RMA to Defendant on
January 26, 2024, and again on February 9, 2024, and was thereafter in contact
with an SPS representative on January 30, 2024. (Compl, ¶ 15.) These
allegations establish that Defendant cured any alleged violation of Civil Code
Section 2923.5.
(Dem. p. 7.)
The Court does not find
this argument availing. 
First, Billesbach
was not a pleading case.
Second, the Court fails
to understand how Defendant’s arguments relate to the requirements of § 2923.5(a)(2).

TENTATIVE RULING
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Defendant’s
demurrer to the first cause of action is OVERRULED.
Second Cause of Action – Violation
of § 2923.7
“When
a borrower requests a foreclosure prevention alternative, the mortgage servicer
shall promptly establish a single point of contact and provide to the borrower
one or more direct means of communication with the single point of contact.”
(Civ. Code § 2923.7(a).)
Under § 2923.7(b), the
single point of contact shall be responsible for doing all of the following:
(1) Communicating the process by
which a borrower may apply for an available foreclosure prevention alternative
and the deadline for any required submissions to be considered for these
options.
(2) Coordinating receipt of all
documents associated with available foreclosure prevention alternatives and
notifying the borrower of any missing documents necessary to complete the
application.
(3) Having access to current
information and personnel sufficient to timely, accurately, and adequately
inform the borrower of the current status of the foreclosure prevention
alternative.
(4) Ensuring that a borrower is
considered for all foreclosure prevention alternatives offered by, or through,
the mortgage servicer, if any.
(5) Having access to individuals with
the ability and authority to stop foreclosure proceedings when necessary.
(Civ. Code §
2923.7(b)(1)-(5).)
Plaintiff’s Complaint
alleged:
25. On January 26, 2024, PLAINTIFF
submitted a Complete Loan Modification Application to SPS DEFENDANT , and
requested the appointment of a Single Point of Contact (“SPOC”). (See Exhibit
“F”) 
26. PLAINTIFF alleges that SPS DEFENDANT
failed to assign a “SPOC” within a reasonable time after receipt of the loan
modification application. 
27. PLAINTIFF continued to rely on the
fact that his application was being reviewed. 
28. This is a material violation of
Civ.Code §2923.7 because in failing to assign a SPOC, the entity has prevented
PLAINTIFF’S chances for a successful submission of the proper papers to
complete a loan modification package to save the Subject Property from
foreclosure, and the resultant loss of equity and a place to live for PLAINTIFF
and his dependents.
(Compl. ¶¶ 25-28.)
Defendant argues that it
is clear from Plaintiff’s allegation in ¶ 15 of the Complaint, Plaintiff was
able to communicate with a specific point of contact at SPS regarding the
status of his loan modification application. 
Paragraph 15 of the
Complaint alleged, “PLAINTIFF alleges that on January 30, 2024, NON-PROFIT
called SPS DEFENDANT and spoke to Saphire, who advised that they could not
review the file because it was too close to the sale date. It does not comply
to the 5 business day which was actually 4 business days.” (Compl. ¶ 15.)
Here, the Court does not
understand Defendant’s arguments. Defendant makes no argument as to what must
be alleged at the pleading stage, and the Court does not follow what Defendant
is trying to argue with respect to the allegations at ¶15 with respect to
2923.7.
Defendant also argues
that a violation of 2923.7 is actionable only when that violation is material.
Defendant then cites to Gillies v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2017) 7
Cal.App.5th 907 for the proposition that a material violation is one where the
alleged violation affected a plaintiff’s loan obligation or the modification
process. Defendant then argues that in Gillies the action was dismissed
where borrower’s allegations demonstrated that the servicer assigned a customer
servicer representative to process the loan modification application.
Again, the Court fails to
understand Defendant’s arguments.
Defendant also argues:
Moreover, SPS cannot have materially
violated Section 2923.7 when it never had an obligation to consider Plaintiff’s
late application to begin with. A mortgage servicer’s obligation to make a
written determination on a borrower’s application is only triggered if the
“borrower submits a complete application . . . at least five business days
before a scheduled foreclosure sale.” (See Civ. Code § 2923.6(c) [emphasis
added].) Plaintiff alleges that he submitted a complete loan modification
application on January 24, 2024, which was four (4) days prior to the original
trustee’s sale date of January 30, 2024). (Compl., ¶ 14 and Ex. D.) SPS, in
turn, correctly advised Plaintiff that he had submitted his application to
close to the trustee’s sale date. (Compl., ¶ 15.) If SPS did not have an
obligation to review a late application under HBOR, then Plaintiff’s alleged
violation of Section 2923.7 cannot be material.
Along the same lines, HBOR does not
require a loan servicer to provide a loan modification or any other type of
foreclosure avoidance option to borrowers. (See Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.4
[“Nothing in the act . . . shall be interpreted to require a particular result
of that process.”].) Therefore, the fact that Plaintiff was ultimately found
not to qualify for review does not establish a “material” violation.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to allege
sufficient facts to state a cause of action for violation of Civil Code §
2923.7.
(Dem. p. 8-9.)
Again, the Court fails to
understand Defendant’s argument.
TENTATIVE RULING
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
The
Court will hear argument. The Court tentatively plans to OVERRULE Defendant’s
demurrer to the second cause of action because it does not understand the
arguments that Defendant is making. Defendant is the one arguing that
sufficient facts are not alleged, but Defendant makes no attempt to cite cases
as to what must be alleged for this cause of action or present arguments that
the Court can understand.
Third Cause of Action – Violation
of Civ. Code § 2924.9
The
third cause of action alleges:
31. On March 11, 2022, SPS DEFENDANT
recorded a Notice of Default on the Subject Property. PLAINTIFF was staying in
his home when the Notice of Default was issued, and received no mail or
messages. (Exhibit “D”) 
32. SPS DEFENDANT failed to notify
PLAINTIFF of all foreclosure prevention alternatives within 5 business days
after Notice of Default recorded, as required by Civ.Code §2924.9. 
33. PLAINTIFF was living in the Subject
Property when the Notice of Default was recorded. PLAINTIFF did not receive any
phone calls or phone messages, and did not receive any pieces of mail that
referred to discussions about alternatives to foreclosure before it was
commenced. If PLAINTIFF did receive such contact and communication, they would
have taken action to avoid the foreclosure of the Subject Property with other
lending sources. 
34. PLAINTIFF is entitled to an injunction
prior to foreclosure, or civil and statutory penalties post-foreclosure against
SPS DEFENDANT in an amount to be proven at trial.
(Compl. ¶¶ 31-34.)
Under Civ. Code § 2924.9:
(a) Unless a
borrower has previously exhausted the first lien loan modification process
offered by, or through, his or her mortgage servicer described in Section
2923.6, within five business days after recording a notice of default pursuant
to Section 2924, a mortgage servicer that offers one or more foreclosure
prevention alternatives shall send a written communication to the borrower that
includes all of the following information:
(1) That the
borrower may be evaluated for a foreclosure prevention alternative or, if
applicable, foreclosure prevention alternatives.
(2) Whether an
application is required to be submitted by the borrower in order to be
considered for a foreclosure prevention alternative.
(3) The means and
process by which a borrower may obtain an application for a foreclosure
prevention alternative.
(b) This section
shall not apply to entities described in subdivision (b) of Section 2924.18.
(c) This section
shall apply only to mortgages or deeds of trust described in Section 2924.15.
(Civ. Code § 2924.9.)
Defendant still cites to Billesbach,
a case that was not at the pleading stage.
Defendant then argues:
This is still what the allegations and
exhibits to Plaintiff’s Complaint establish – that after recordation of the NOD
on March 11, 2022, Plaintiff had the opportunity to submit an application,
which he did, and the sale was not held, demonstrating that any alleged
violation was either cured and/or was not material. (Compl., ¶¶ 13 – 17.)
 
Moreover, Plaintiff has also failed to
state a claim for violation of Civil Code § 2924.9 because he does not allege
any additional facts in his Complaint showing that he were prejudiced in such a
way that it precluded him from obtaining relief which would have allowed him to
avoid foreclosure. Plaintiff has known since March 2022 that he was in default
on his Loan. Plaintiff was clearly aware of the means and process to submit an
application since he actually submitted an RMA on January 26, 2024. Moreover,
Plaintiff’s Complaint arguably implies that the foreclosure sale did not take
place on March 3, 2024, and Plaintiff does not allege that any new sale date
has been set. (See Compl. generally and Prayer For Relief, ¶ 3.) 
Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to
allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for violation of Civil Code
§ 2924.9.
(Dem. p. 10.)
Here, the Court continues
to fail to understand Defendant’s argument.
TENTATIVE
RULING  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
Defendant’s
demurrer to the third cause of action is tentatively OVERRULED. The Court will
hear argument.
Fourth Cause of Action – Violation
of Civ. Code § 2924.10
Plaintiff
alleges:
36. On January 26, 2024, PLAINTIFF
submitted a Complete Loan Modification Application to SPS DEFENDANT, and
requested the appointment of a Single Point of Contact (“SPOC”). (See Exhibit
“F”) 
37. SPS DEFENDANT failed to provide
written notice to PLAINTIFF of receipt of loan modification application within
5 business days of receipt.
38. The failure to advise PLAINTIFF if his
loan modification request was received by DEFENDANTS is a material violation of
the statute. This is because it jeopardizes PLAINTIFF’s right to submit a
timely loan modification package while a pending foreclosure is in process,
which could result in the loss of equity in the Subject Property, and the loss
of a place to live for PLAINTIFF and his dependents. 
39. PLAINTIFF is entitled to an injunction
prior to foreclosure or civil and statutory penalties post-foreclosure against
SPS DEFENDANT in an amount to be proven at trial.
(Compl. ¶¶ 36-39.)
Civ. Code § 2924.10
states:
(a) When a borrower
submits a complete first lien modification application or any document in
connection with a first lien modification application, the mortgage servicer
shall provide written acknowledgment of the receipt of the documentation within
five business days of receipt. In its initial acknowledgment of receipt of the
loan modification application, the mortgage servicer shall include the
following information:
(1) A description of
the loan modification process, including an estimate of when a decision on the
loan modification will be made after a complete application has been submitted
by the borrower and the length of time the borrower will have to consider an
offer of a loan modification or other foreclosure prevention alternative.
(2) Any deadlines,
including deadlines to submit missing documentation, that would affect the
processing of a first lien loan modification application.
(3) Any expiration
dates for submitted documents.
(4) Any deficiency
in the borrower’s first lien loan modification application.
(b) For purposes of
this section, a borrower’s first lien loan modification application shall be
deemed to be “complete” when a borrower has supplied the mortgage servicer with
all documents required by the mortgage servicer within the reasonable timeframes
specified by the mortgage servicer.
(c) This section
shall not apply to entities described in subdivision (b) of Section 2924.18.
(d) This section
shall apply only to mortgages or deeds of trust described in Section 2924.15.
(Civ. Code §
2924.10(a)-(d).)
TENTATIVE RULING
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
The
Court will hear argument. The Court continues to not understand several of the
arguments that Defendant is attempting to make.
TENTATIVE RULING
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Defendant’s
argument about the UCL claim is not entirely clear. It appears that Defendant
is arguing that since Plaintiff did not successfully allege violations of the
Civil Code, Plaintiff did not allege a violation of the UCL.
 “ ‘The “unlawful” practices prohibited by …
section 17200 are any practices forbidden by law, be it civil or criminal,
federal, state, or municipal, statutory, regulatory, or court-made. [Citation.]
It is not necessary that the predicate law provide for private civil
enforcement. [Citation.] As our Supreme Court put it, section 17200 “borrows”
violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices independently
actionable under section 17200 et seq.’” (South Bay Chevrolet v. General
Motors Acceptance Corp. (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 861, 880 citing Hewlett v.
Squaw Valley Ski Corp. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 499, 531-532.) “A plaintiff
alleging unfair business practices under these statutes must state with
reasonable particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of the
violation.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 619; “Demurrer was properly sustained as to this cause of action because
the second amended complaint identifies no particular section of the statutory
scheme which was violated and fails to describe with any reasonable
particularity the facts supporting violation.” (Id.).)
Here, Plaintiff’s
Complaint appears to at the very least successfully allege a violation of 2923.5(a)(2).
Further, the fifth cause of action references violation of 2923.5. 
Defendant’s demurrer to
the fifth cause of action is OVERRULED.
