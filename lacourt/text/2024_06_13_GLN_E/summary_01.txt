```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling is that the Defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to establish that there was a triable issue of material fact as to the issue of the dangerous condition of the sidewalk. The Defendant's expert testimony shows that the defect was trivial, and the Plaintiff's testimony is inconsistent and unclear. The Court also finds that the Defendant did not have constructive notice of the dangerous condition. The tentative ruling is subject to change after hearing argument.
