LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION
DEMANDS
Within 30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the
original of the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of
the response on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on
motion of the party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for
response, or unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been
directed, the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the party making the demand may move for an order compelling
response to the demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing,
or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based
on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). (CCP § 2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may
relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220,
2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §
2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further
responses, a motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit,
and the propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or
that it satisfied a “meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 404 citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (The Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶ 8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶
8:1483 to 8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30
days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories
are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them on the
propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court has
shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding party
the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2030.260(a).)
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an
order compelling response to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
“The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any
right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as
well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The party’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel
responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does
not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a “meet and
confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific

ANALYSIS
Defendant alleges it served the three discovery requests at issue
here – Form Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and Special
Interrogatories, Set One – on Plaintiff on February 1, 2024. (Law Declarations
¶ 3.) 
Defendant provides the proofs of
service for the three discovery requests that were allegedly served on February
1, 2024. The proofs of service for the three discovery requests that were
propounded on February 1, 2024 indicate that the discovery was served by email,
and the email address that the discovery was served on matches Plaintiff’s
counsel’s email address on eCourt.
However, Defendant’s motion
indicates that after it sent Plaintiff’s counsel a meet-and-confer letter on
March 7, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel responded stating that Plaintiff never
received the discovery requests that were served on February 1, 2024.
In Defendant’s motion, Defendant
states that it electronically sent the original email again to Plaintiff on
March 13, 2024. Defendant then states that Plaintiff’s counsel claimed he could
not open the March 13, 2024 email.
In Defendant’s motion, Defendant
states that it sent the discovery a third time both electronically and via US
Mail on or about March 15, 2024.
The Court notes that as to
Defendant alleging it served the Plaintiff a second and third time, Defendant
did not provide proofs of service for any discovery allegedly served on March
13, 2024 nor for any discovery allegedly served on March 15, 2024. 
Further, the Court notes that
Defendant’s counsel’s declaration does not state that it re-served the
discovery again on March 13 and March 15. Instead, the declaration simply
states, “My office sent the [discovery] to Mr. Gilanians twice more
electronically and sent hard copies via the U.S. mail as well.” (Law Decl. ¶ 5.)
Defendant states it again sent a
meet-and-confer letter on April 17, 2024. (Law Decl. ¶ 5.)
Here, the Court will hear argument
because there are several issues that need to be addressed at the hearing.
First, if the Court were to assume
that all three discovery requests were successfully served on February 1, 2024,
March 13, 2024, and March 15, 2024, then it appears as if Defendant is owed
responses because Plaintiff did not respond within 30 days, no matter which
date of service we consider, because the Law Declaration (Defendant’s counsel)
states that as of the filing of this motion [the Law declaration was dated on
April 23, 2024] Plaintiff has not provided responses. Therefore, even using the
latest date of March 15, 2024, Plaintiff did not provide responses within 30
days.
Second, the Court notes that as of
now, it is unlikely to consider the alleged service of March 13, 2024 and March
15, 2024 as dates that Defendant served Plaintiff because Defendant’s motion
and attachments does not contain proofs of service for either of those dates.
Further, as to the alleged March 13, 2024 discovery, Defendant stated that Mr.
Gilanians claimed he could not open it.
Third, the only discovery that
Defendant provided proofs of service for was the discovery allegedly served on
February 1, 2024. The Court will hear argument because on the one hand the
proofs of service indicate that the discovery was served via email to Plaintiff
at the email address that Plaintiff’s counsel listed on eCourt. However, on the
other hand, Defendant’s motion admits that Plaintiff’s counsel stated that he
never received the discovery requests sent on February 1, 2024.
Lastly, Defendant’s motion
indicates that it properly served the discovery on February 1, 2024 under CCP §
1010.6 and Cal. Rules of Court, rules 2.251 and 2.256. As to that statement,
the Court will need further explanation. CCP § 1010.6, and both rules cited by
Defendant, have several subsections. Defendant does not explain which
subsection(s) it believes it is complying with or how it is complying with
whatever subsection(s) it thinks are applicable. Defendant should be prepared
to come forward with specific subsection(s) and be able to point the Court to
exactly what it thinks is applicable and how it is complying with the
sections/subsections it is allegedly complying with.


TENTATIVE RULING
The Court will hear argument.

Sanctions -
Inspection Demands
In relevant part, § 2031.300(c)
states as follows:
Except
as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response
to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§ 2031.300(c).)
 
Sanctions –

other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§ 2030.290(c).)



Sanctions
Ruling
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of
a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to
the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the
requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was
filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
As
to Motion 1, Defendant requests sanctions under 2030.290(c)
in the amount of $780.00 against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly
and severally. Defendant bases this request on an hourly rate of $195.00. Law
(Defendant’s counsel) states that preparing the moving papers took two hours.
Law requests another two hours for preparing the Reply and appearing at the
hearing. The Court notes that no opposition was submitted, and that a notice
of non-opposition was submitted by Defendant in Reply.
 
As
to Motion 3, Defendant requests sanctions under 2030.290(c) in the amount of
$780.00 against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly and severally.
Defendant bases this request on an hourly rate of $195.00. Law states that
preparing the moving papers took two hours. Law requests another two hours for
preparing the Reply and appearing at the hearing. The Court notes that no
opposition was submitted and that Defendant did not submit a
notice of non-Opposition in Reply.
 
As
to Motion 2, Defendant requests sanctions in the total amount of $1,780.00
against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly and severally. 
 
As
to Motion 2, Defendant requests sanctions of $780.00 under 2031.300(c). Defendant
bases this request on an hourly rate of $195.00. Law states that preparing the
moving papers took two hours. Law requests another two hours for preparing the
Reply and appearing at the hearing. The Court notes that no opposition was
submitted, and that a notice of non-opposition was submitted by Defendant in
Reply.
 
Defendant
then states with respect to Motion 2:
 
Additionally,
Cal. Code Civ. Proc section 2023.050 requires the imposition of a
one-thousand-dollar ($1,000.00) sanction for a party or attorney who fails to
respond in good faith to a request for the production of documents made under
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.010. Cal. Code Civ. Proc section 2023.050.
 
(Def. Mot. p.
5.)
 
As
stated in § 2023.050:
 
“(a) Notwithstanding any
other law, and in addition to any other sanctions imposed pursuant to this
chapter, a court shall impose a one-thousand-dollar ($1,000) sanction, payable
to the requesting party, upon a party, person, or attorney if, upon reviewing a
request for a sanction made pursuant to Section 2023.040, the court finds any
of the following:
 
(1) The
party, person, or attorney did not respond in good faith to a request for the
production of documents made pursuant to Section 2020.010, 2020.410, 2020.510,
or 2025.210, or to an inspection demand made pursuant to Section 2031.010.
(2) The
party, person, or attorney produced requested documents within seven days
before the court was scheduled to hear a motion to compel production of the
records pursuant to Section 2025.450, 2025.480, or 2031.320 that is filed by
the requesting party as a result of the other party’s, person’s, or attorney’s
failure to respond in good faith.
(3) The
party, person, or attorney failed to confer in person, by telephone, letter, or
other means of communication in writing, as defined in Section 250 of the
Evidence Code, with the party or attorney requesting the documents in a
reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning
the request.
 
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph
(3) of subdivision (o) of Section 6068 of the Business and Professions Code,
the court may, in its discretion, require an attorney who is sanctioned
pursuant to subdivision (a) to report the sanction, in writing, to the State
Bar within 30 days of the imposition of the sanction.
(c) The court may excuse the
imposition of the sanction required by subdivision (a) if the court makes
written findings that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.
 
(d) Sanctions pursuant to
this section shall be imposed only after notice to the party, person, or
attorney against whom the sanction is proposed to be imposed and opportunity
for that party, person, or attorney to be heard.
 
(e) For purposes of this
section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a natural person acted in good
faith if that person was not represented by an attorney in the action at the
time the conduct that is sanctionable under subdivision (a) occurred. This
presumption may only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence.”
 
(CCP
§ 2023.050(a)-(e).)
 
Defendant
should be prepared to address its additional sanctions request of $1,000.00
with respect to Motion 2.
 
First,
Defendant cited s 2023.050 as the section that requires the imposition of the
additional $1,000.00 sanction. However, § 2023.050(a) states in relevant part
that this sanction shall be imposed “…upon reviewing a request for a sanction
made pursuant to Section 2023.040.” Here, the Court does not see in Defendant’s
moving papers that Defendant is requesting sanctions “pursuant to § 2023.040.” 
 
Section
2023.040 states:
 
A request for
a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and
attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction
sought. The notice of motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and
authorities, and accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction sought.
 
(CCP § 2023.040.)
 
The
Court will also hear argument as to sanctions for Motions 1 and Motion 3.
