Here is a text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Glendale Properties, Inc. and has overruled it as to the second, fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action. The Judge finds that the complaint sufficiently pleads these causes of action and that the Defendant has not shown that the plaintiff has failed to state a valid claim.

The Judge also denied the motion to strike the allegations supporting the punitive damages claim, finding that the Defendant has not shown that the allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

Finally, the Judge denied the motion to strike the claim for attorney fees, finding that the lease agreement provides for the recovery of attorney fees to the prevailing party.

The Judge has ordered the Defendant to answer the complaint within 10 days of the order.
