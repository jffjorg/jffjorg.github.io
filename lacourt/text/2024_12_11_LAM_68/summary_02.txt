The lawsuit involves a former employee, Susan Barrera, who alleges that she was terminated by her employer, Kaiser, et al. after complaining about threats of physical violence from a co-employee, Patricia Roman. The defendants are seeking to file a first amended answer to the complaint, which would add new affirmative defenses and additional facts to the already pled affirmative defense of estoppel/unclean hands.

The judge grants the motion, finding that the proposed amended answer complies with the requirements set forth in California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324. The judge concludes that the amendment is necessary and proper, and that the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered through diligent review of the responses.
