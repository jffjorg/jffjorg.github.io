And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the defendants, Avant Plastic Surgery, Inc. and Avant Aesthetic Institute, Inc. The first motion is for summary judgment, which the defendants argued was due to the fact that the care and treatment provided to the plaintiff, Mengxue Deng, was within the standard of care. The judge denied this motion, finding that the defendants failed to provide competent evidence to establish that their treatment was within the standard of care. The judge also denied the defendants' motion to require the plaintiff to file an undertaking to secure an award of costs and attorney's fees, as the defendants failed to show a reasonable possibility of success on their claims.

The plaintiff, Mengxue Deng, had undergone Kybella injections at the defendants' clinic and had experienced pain and swelling after the injections. The defendants had argued that their treatment was within the standard of care, but the judge found that the defendants' expert witness, Dorothy A. Dennin, R.N., lacked the necessary qualifications to opine on the standard of care for a patient following the administration of Kybella injections. As a result, the judge denied the defendants' motions and scheduled the case for trial.
