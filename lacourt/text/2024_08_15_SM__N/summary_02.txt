And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of the defendants to quash and stay the subpoena for business records. The defendants, including NMS Fin Holdings, LLC, NMS Capital Advisors, LLC, and Trevor Saliba, argued that the subpoena is duplicative and seeks information that is already available in Annual Audited Reports and Tax Returns. However, the Judge found that the plaintiff, J&C Global Holdings, Inc., has a legitimate reason for seeking the information, as it is relevant to its allegations of breach of contract and profiteering. The Judge cited a previous case, GT, Inc. v. Superior Court, which held that a litigant should not be denied access to financial information that goes to the heart of the cause of action. The Judge ordered the defendants to comply with the subpoena and produce the requested documents.
