And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants defendant Christopher Scott Bird's motion to compel the deposition of the person most knowledgeable at non-party United Parcel Services, Inc. (UPS). The defendant served a remote deposition subpoena on the PMK at UPS on January 22, 2024, and personally served the subpoena on the PMK on February 1, 2024. Despite the subpoena, the PMK did not appear at the scheduled deposition on February 14, 2024. The defendant requests sanctions against UPS in the amount of $1,762.93. The Judge finds that the defendant has met his burden to show personal service of the deposition subpoena and UPS's unexcused failure to produce the PMK. The Judge grants the motion and orders UPS to produce its PMK to appear and testify at deposition within 20 days. The Judge also imposes sanctions in the amount of $1,762.93 against UPS.
