And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is regarding a demurrer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings in the case of Trinity Media Financing Int'l Ltd. v. Every Breath LLC, et al. The court has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice. The Judge's analysis concludes that the demurrer is overruled because the complaint states a cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations. The Judge also finds that the complaint states a cause of action for fraud, specifically promissory fraud.

The Judge grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the third cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations, but only as to the extent that it relies on contracts between the parties. The Judge finds that the complaint states a cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations, even if Trinity is a party to some of the contracts alleged. The Judge denies Trinity's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the third cause of action, finding that the complaint states a cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations regarding third-party agreements.
