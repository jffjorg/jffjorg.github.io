And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion filed by defendant Kurtzer. The plaintiff, 1239 23rd Street Homeowners Assoc., filed a special motion to strike the cross-complaint filed by Kurtzer on January 4, 2024. Kurtzer subsequently dismissed the cross-complaint on February 20, 2024. The court finds that the motion is substantially moot and taken off calendar. However, the court notes that the dismissal does not moot the issue of mandatory attorneys' fees under the anti-SLAPP statute, and the plaintiff may file a noticed fee motion to recover any appropriate fees.
