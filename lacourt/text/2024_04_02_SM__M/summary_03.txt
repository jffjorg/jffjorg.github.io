And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively granted the motion of Gabriel Balayan, Esq. and Mentis Legal Law Firm APC to be relieved as counsel of record for defendants 5904 Kanan Dume LLC and Tony Bagramian. The motion is based on the client's breach of the retainer agreement, which has rendered it unreasonably difficult for counsel to carry out the representation effectively. The court finds that there is no prejudice to the client and grants the motion. The order is effective upon the filing of proof of service of the order on the client.
