Legal
Standard
 
The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or
attorney and after notice from one to the other. (CCP §
284(2).) The attorney seeking to withdraw must take “reasonable steps to
avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the client, including
giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other
counsel.” (Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct, 3-700(A)(2). See, e.g., Vann v.
Shilleh (1975) [holding withdrawal prejudicial where attorney
withdraw from the representation of defendant on the Friday before trial began
the following Monday].) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court
(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)  
 
An
application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form
MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (CRC 3.1362(a), (c), (e).) The
requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that have
appeared in the case.” (CRC, 3.1362(d).)
When a client is served by mail, the attorney’s declaration must indicate that
the client’s address was confirmed within the last 30 days and how it was
confirmed. (Id.) If the attorney is
unable to confirm the client’s current address, the declaration must state the
reasonable efforts made within the last 30 days to obtain the client’s current
address. (Id.) Additionally, the
declaration “must state in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney client relationship why” a motion is brought
instead of filing a substitution of attorney. (CRC, 3.1362(c).)
 
Analysis
                                                                                                        
Gabriel Balayan, Esq. and Mentis
Legal Law Firm APC move to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendants 5904
Kanan Dume LLC and Tony Bagramian. Counsel provides all the required forms.
Counsel declares that the client has rendered it unreasonably difficult for
counsel to carry out the representation effectively and that the client is in
material breach of their retainer agreement. Counsel
served their client by mail at the client’s last known address, which was
confirmed within the past 30 days by mail with return receipt requested.
 
The
declaration notes the incorrect trial date on calendar. The trial is set for
March 10, 2025, not March 10, 2024. However, counsel correctly notes the trial
date on the MC-053 form. The final status conference hearing date set for March
3, 2025, must also be added to the order. 
 
Otherwise,
the Court cannot find any prejudice on the part of the client. There are no dispositive
motions pending, and trial is not for another year.  Accordingly, the motion is tentatively
GRANTED. The order is effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the
order on the client. Until then, counsel remains counsel of record.
