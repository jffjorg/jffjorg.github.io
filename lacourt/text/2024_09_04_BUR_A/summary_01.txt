```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is not requesting oral argument on this matter. The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant and the opposition filed by the plaintiff. The court has concluded that the demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges medical negligence, is overruled. The court finds that the statute of limitations has not run out on the plaintiff's claim, and that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action.

The court has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges elder abuse, but has granted the plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend the complaint to properly plead an elder abuse cause of action. The court notes that the plaintiff has not pled her age, which is an essential element of an elder abuse claim, and that the statute of limitations for elder abuse claims is two years.

The court's ruling is tentative and will become final unless a party requests oral argument or files a written objection.
