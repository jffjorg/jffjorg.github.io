COURT’S[TENTATIVE]
  DECISION RE:     
Demurrer Without Motion to Strike
 



 
 
Defendants
Habib Talebi and Mery Tabrizi (“Defendants”) demur to the complaint brought by
Plaintiff Maboud Nourkhah (“Plaintiff”).
 
This
court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend.
 
I.               
BACKGROUND¿ 
 
On August
15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants alleging causes of
action for breach of contract and “faluse [&] defamation in society[.]”
(Complaint p. 2.)
On October
4, 2024, Defendants demurred to Plaintiff’s complaint. No opposition has been
filed.
II.            
PROCEDURAL
REQUIREMENTS
 

Timeliness

“A
person against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may, within
30 days after service of the complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the
complaint or cross-complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40(a).) 
Plaintiff attached no proof of service
to the complaint. (Complaint.) Accordingly, this court cannot evaluate whether
Defendants’ demurrer is timely. Regardless, this court exercises its discretion
and considers the demurrer. (Jackson v. Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 742,
750 [stating, “the lower court acted within its broad discretion by considering
defendant's demurrer, notwithstanding plaintiff's claim that it was untimely.”])

Meet
     and Confer

California Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.41,
subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and confer” in good faith before the
filing of a demurrer to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in
the demurrer.¿The demurring party is required to file and serve with the
demurrer a declaration either confirming that parties were unable to resolve
the issues raised by the demurrer despite having met and conferred or that the
opposing party failed to meet and confer with the demurring party in good faith.
(Code Civ. Proc. §¿430.41(a)(3).)¿
 
Defendants’ counsel submits a
declaration stating counsel “called the plaintiff to attempt to resolve the
issues raised by this demurrer but was unable to do so.” (Axelrod ¶ 2.) Defendants’ counsel also called Plaintiff twice, but
states “Plaintiff essentially refused to speak to me.” (Axelrod ¶ 2.)
This
court finds that Defendants have satisfied the meet and confer requirement.
 
III.          
LEGAL
STANDARD¿ 
¿¿¿ 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or the facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 745.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it contains “[a]¿statement¿of
the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.”
(Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this standard, a “complaint ordinarily
is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.” (Doe v.
City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)
 
A party may demur to a complaint because the
complaint “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e).) A party may also
demur to a complaint because “[t]he pleading is uncertain.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) “’[U]ncertain’ includes
ambiguous and unintelligible.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)
 
Demurrer
for uncertainty are strictly construed, because discovery can be used for
clarification. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616.) Against a demurrer, a plaintiff is required only to “set forth in
his complaint the essential facts of his case with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant of the nature,
source, and extent of his cause of action.” (Elder v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co.
(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 841, 858.)
 
IV.          
DISCUSSION¿ 
 

Breach of Contract

 
Defendants
argue Plaintiff’s complaint fails to state a claim for breach of contract.
(Demurrer p. 7.) 
 
The
elements of a breach of contract claim are: (1) existence of a contract; (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendants’ breach;
and (4) resulting damage. (Wall Street
Network, Ltd. v. N. Y. Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)
 
Plaintiff’s
complaint contains no factual allegations supporting the elements of a breach
of contract cause of action. Accordingly, this court sustains the demurrer as
to Plaintiff’s breach of contract cause of action.
 

Defamation

 
Defendants
argue Plaintiff’s complaint fails to state a claim for defamation. (Demurrer p.
8.)
 
“The
elements of a defamation claim are: (1) a publication that is; (2) false; (3)
defamatory; (4) unprivileged; and (5) has a natural tendency to injure or
causes special damage.” (J-M Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. Phillips & Cohen
LLP (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 87, 97.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
complaint contains no factual allegations supporting the elements of a
defamation cause of action. Accordingly, this court sustains the demurrer as to
Plaintiff’s defamation cause of action.
 

Uncertainty

 
Defendants
argue both of Plaintiff’s causes of action are uncertain. (Demurrer pp. 7-8.)
 
“Even
as against a special demurrer, a plaintiff is required only to ‘set forth in
his complaint the essential facts of his case with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant of the
nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.’” (Elder v. Pac. Bell
Tel. Co., supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 858.) 
 
Plaintiff
alleges no facts in the complaint. Further, Plaintiff states that Plaintiff is
a “corporation qualified to do business in California” and “defendant is a
corporation or unincorporated association and its principal place of business
is here.” (Complaint.)  None of the
parties in this action appear to be corporations. 
 
Accordingly,
this court finds that the complaint is so vague and unclear that the nature,
source, and extent of the claims being brought against Defendants cannot be
understood.
 
V.             
LEAVE
TO AMEND
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend
must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) “If there is
any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action,
it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v.
Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.) “If the plaintiff has
not had an opportunity to amend the complaint in response to the demurrer,
leave to amend is liberally allowed as a matter of fairness, unless the
complaint shows on its face that it is incapable of amendment.” (City of
Stockton v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 747.) Courts generally
allow at least one time to amend a complaint, after sustaining a demurrer, even
without any request for leave to amend. (McDonald v. Superior Court
(1986) 180 Cal. App. 3d 297, 303-304.)¿ 
 
This
court finds that there is a reasonable possibility that Plaintiff can
successfully amend the complaint. Accordingly, this court grants Plaintiff
leave to amend.
 
VI.          
CONCLUSION 
 
For
the foregoing reasons, this court sustains the demurrer and grants Plaintiff
leave to amend.
