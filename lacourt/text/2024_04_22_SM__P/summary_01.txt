And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is on a motion for new trial in a residential unlawful detainer case. The defendant, Love, has filed a motion for a new trial, alleging prejudicial error. The defendant argues that the court made an error of law by allowing an improper verdict form to be submitted to the jury and excluding defendant's evidence. The defendant also claims that the court abused its discretion by excluding a portion of defense counsel's closing argument regarding the defendant's affirmative defense and that the court displayed bias and prejudice towards the defendant due to her disability.

The court takes judicial notice of a prior unlawful detainer filed by the plaintiff against the defendant. The court finds that the defendant's arguments regarding the exclusion of evidence regarding the plaintiff's violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and the exclusion of evidence regarding SCEP fees are not prejudicial error. The court also finds that the defendant's claims of bias and prejudice by the court are unfounded.

The court denies the defendant's motion for new trial.
