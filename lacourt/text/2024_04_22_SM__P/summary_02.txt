And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Paolinetti, is seeking relief from the Government Code Section 945.4 requirements to bring a timely government tort claim against the City of West Hollywood in a trip and fall matter. The plaintiff alleges that the late filing resulted from counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has failed to show a statutory excuse for failing to meet the claims deadline. The plaintiff's failure to present a timely claim was not due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, but rather due to the lack of diligence in investigating and pursuing the claim. The court therefore denies the plaintiff's petition for relief.
