And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is a decision on two motions to compel filed by Defendant Julien Brunet. The motions seek to compel Plaintiff Jacob McGee to respond to outstanding discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The Court granted the motions, ordering Plaintiff McGee to serve verified responses to the outstanding discovery requests within 30 days. Additionally, the Court awarded sanctions to Defendant in the amount of $750, consisting of $570 in attorney fees and $180 in costs. The Court's ruling is based on the failure of Plaintiff McGee to serve timely responses to the discovery requests and the lack of opposition to the motions.
