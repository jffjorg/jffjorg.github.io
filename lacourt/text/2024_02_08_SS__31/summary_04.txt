The motion is based on the defendant's argument that its former counsel, Eric Welch, was negligent in representing the defendant and failed to inform the defendant of significant developments in the case. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendant's former counsel's negligence should be imputed to the defendant and that the motion is untimely. The judge has also found that the defendant's vice-president, D. Randy Fox, was not aware of delinquent discovery and that the defendant's attempts to remedy the situation were inadequate. The judge has ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff's attorney's fees and costs.
