And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor Michaela Jade Delaney. The settlement agreement was reached between Claimant and defendants, with a total amount of $40,000. The Court finds the settlement fair and reasonable, but denies the petition due to defective filing. Specifically, counsel did not sign the petition on page 7 of MC-350EX, and Claimant's counsel's declaration in support of 40% of Claimant's proceeds to be used for attorney's fees was also unsigned. The Court orders the petitioner to reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
