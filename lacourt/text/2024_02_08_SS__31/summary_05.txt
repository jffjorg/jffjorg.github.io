And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the request for default judgment filed by Plaintiff Defu Zhang against Defendant Xiang Fei Cao. The court finds that the Plaintiff is limited to seeking damages as set forth in the Statement of Damages, which caps the amount at $17,520.30 for past medical specials. The court also reduces the request for general damages from $1,190,000 to $10,000, as there is no evidence to support the claimed damages. The court awards Plaintiff $27,520.30 in principal damages and $523.20 in costs. However, the court denies Plaintiff's request for loss of income or earning capacity, as there is no evidence to support a claim for permanent injury. The court notes that the Plaintiff must still introduce admissible prima facie evidence of damages, and that some of the medical records provided do not correlate with the allegations against the Defendant. The court orders Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
