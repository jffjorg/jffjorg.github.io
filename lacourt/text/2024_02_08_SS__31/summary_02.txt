Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the defendant's motion to continue the trial date. The defendant had filed the motion to continue the trial date due to the need to complete discovery and have her discovery motions heard prior to the trial date. The judge has determined that there is good cause for a continuance based on the factors outlined in California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1332(c) and (d). The judge has taken into account the proximity of the trial date, the fact that there has been no opposition to the motion, and the need for the defendant to complete her discovery and have her motions heard. The judge has also considered the fact that the defendant has been unable to serve the cross-complaint on Roberto Sandoval, who is a party to the case, due to his living in a gated community. The judge has granted the motion and continued the trial date to a new date and time. The judge has also warned the parties that any further continuances will not be granted due to the age of the case and the number of prior continuances.
