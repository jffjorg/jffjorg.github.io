  Case Number:  23CHCV01052    Hearing Date:   April 19, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    4/19/24     Case    Name: Michael John Garcia v. Enrique Moreno Roque; Cacho Landscape    Maintenance Company Inc.; and Does 1-100     Case    # 23CHCV01052      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    APRIL 19, 2024    MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF THE  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case # 23CHCV01052    Motion  filed: 10/25/23   MOVING PARTY: Defendants Cacho Landscape Maintenance  Company Inc., and Enrique Moreno Roque (“Defendants”)  RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Michael John Garcia  (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: ok.    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court striking Plaintiff’s second cause of action, paragraphs  15 through 24, and the fifth prayer for exemplary and punitive damages of the  second amended complaint.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED with LEAVE TO AMEND.   BACKGROUND   Plaintiff filed his Complaint alleging personal injuries  caused by a vehicle operated by Defendant Enrique Moreno Roque (“Roque”).   On April 12, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the present action.  Subsequently, on September 6, 2023, he filed the operative Second Amended  Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants and Does 1 through 100, alleging (1)  Negligence, and (2) Violations of Vehicle Code Section 20001 and 20003.   On October 25, 2023, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Strike portions  of the SAC. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed his  Opposition on April 5, 2024.                On April  17, 2024, Defendants filed their untimely Reply.   ANALYSIS   Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading  may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part  thereof.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).)  The court may,  upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems  proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any  pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a); Stafford v. Shultz  (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the  claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or  disregarded”].)     Additionally, the court may also strike all or any part of  any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with California law, a court  rule, or an order of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd.  (b).)  An immaterial or irrelevant allegation is one that is not essential  to the statement of a claim or defense; is neither pertinent to nor supported  by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense; or a demand for judgment  requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subd. (b).)  The grounds for moving to strike  must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)    A.     Procedural  Requirements   1.       Meet and Confer   “Before filing a motion to strike . . . the moving party  shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the  pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining  if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the  motion to strike.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a).)  If no  agreement is reached, the moving party shall file and serve with the motion to  strike a declaration stating either: (1) the means by which the parties met and  conferred and that the parties did not reach an agreement, or (2) that the  party who filed the pleading failed to respond to the meet and confer request  or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.  (Code Civ. Proc., §  435.5, subd. (a)(3).)                  Here, Defendants’ counsel attests  that email exchanges between the parties reflect that Plaintiff’s counsel  believed sufficient facts for punitive damages have been pleaded and refused to  amend the complaint. (Tusa Decl., ¶ 7.) However, these efforts did not meet the  in-person or by telephone requirement as mandated by Code of Civil Procedure  section 435 subdivision (a)(3). Consequently, the Court determines that the  parties have not sufficiently fulfilled the meet and confer requirements.                The Court directs the parties to  adhere to the applicable meet and confer requirements for all future  proceedings.   2.       Untimely Filing of Reply   All reply papers shall be filed at least five court days  before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) “No paper may be  rejected for filing on the ground that it was untimely submitted for filing. If  the court, in its discretion, refuses to consider a late filed paper, the  minutes or order must so indicate.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d).)                          The Court notes that Defendants’  Reply was filed two days late. However, it appears that Plaintiff was timely  served with the Reply on April 12, 2024. (4/17/24 Proof of Service.)               Accordingly, the Court will consider  the Reply, but orders Defendants to adhere to the applicable Code of Civil  Procedure and California Rules of Court requirements for timely filing of  papers in all future proceedings.    B.      Second Cause  of Action – Violations of Vehicle Code Sections 20001 and 20003   The Motion first seeks to strike the second cause of action  of the SAC, specifically paragraphs 15-24. The SAC’s second cause of action  alleges violations of Vehicle Code Sections 20001 and 20003. (Compl., at 4.)   Vehicle Code 20001 subdivision (a) provides, “The driver of  a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to a person, other than  himself, or in the death of a person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the  scene of the accident and shall fulfill the requirements of Sections 20003 and  20004.”   Vehicle Code 20003 sets forth: “(a) The driver of any  vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person  shall also give his or her name, current residence address, the names and  current residence addresses of any occupant of the driver’s vehicle injured in  the accident, the registration number of the vehicle he or she is driving, and  the name and current residence address of the owner to the person struck or the  driver or occupants of any vehicle collided with, and shall give the  information to any traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident. The  driver also shall render to any person injured in the accident reasonable  assistance, including transporting, or making arrangements for transporting,  any injured person to a physician, surgeon, or hospital for medical or surgical  treatment if it is apparent that treatment is necessary or if that  transportation is requested by any injured person. (b) ... shall also, upon  being requested, exhibit his or her driver’s license, if available, or, in the  case of an injured occupant, any other available identification, to the person  struck or to the driver or occupants of any vehicle collided with, and to any  traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident.”    Violating section 20001 is a felony. (Vehicle Code, §  20001, subd. (b).) A violation of Vehicle Code Section 20001 gives rise to civil  liability only if it is a proximate cause of further injury or death.  (See People v. Corners (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 139, 148; see also Corenbaum  v. Lampkin (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1340.) (Underlines added.) In  Brooks v. E.J. Willig Truck Transp. Co. (1953) 40 Cal.2d 669(Brooks),  the court held that a hit and run cannot give rise to damages unless the fact  that the defendant fled the scene was “a proximate cause of further injury or  death” beyond the accident itself.¿ (Id. at 679.)¿Brooks held  that fleeing an accident scene only constitutes a tort if the act itself causes  the plaintiff additional injury above and beyond the damages caused by the  collision that preceded flight.¿ (Ibid.)    Here, the SAC alleges that “[t]he nature of the collision  and the resulting impact to Plaintiff’s vehicle [sic] was such that  injuries were likely to occur to Plaintiff.” (SAC, ¶ 19.) The SAC does not  plead that Defendant Roque’s flight from scene itself caused Plaintiff  additional injury above and beyond the damages resulting from the collision.    Following the Brooks holding, the Court concludes  that Plaintiff’s SAC does not sufficiently establish civil liabilities against  Defendants for violation of Vehicle Code Sections 20001 and 20003.    Therefore, the Court GRANTS Motion to Strike as to Plaintiff’s  second cause of action, specifically paragraphs 15-24.    C.     Punitive  Damages   Punitive damages may be imposed where it is proven by clear  and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression,  fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).)    “Malice” is defined as conduct intended by the defendant to  cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct carried on with a willful  and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. (Civ. Code, § 3294,  subd. (c)(1).) “‘Punitive damages are proper only when the tortious conduct  rises to levels of extreme indifference to the plaintiff’s rights, a level  which decent citizens should not have to tolerate.’ [Citation.]” (Lackner v.  North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1210.)    “Oppression” is defined in as “despicable conduct subjecting  a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s  rights.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been  defined in the case law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.”  (See, e.g., Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales & Marketing,  Inc. (2000) 78 Cal. App. 4th 847, 891.)¿¿   Further, “[t]here must be evidence that defendant acted  with knowledge of the probable dangerous consequences to plaintiff’s interests  and deliberately failed to avoid these consequences.” (Flyer’s Body Shop  Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title Ins. Co. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1149,  1155; see also Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217,  1228 [“Conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient where  the defendant is aware of the probably dangerous consequences of his or her  conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences”].)     A motion to strike punitive damages is properly granted  where a plaintiff does not state a prima facie claim for punitive damages,  including allegations that defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud or  malice.  (Turman v. Turning Point of Cent. California, Inc. (2010)  191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)  “Mere negligence, even gross negligence, is not  sufficient to justify such an award” for punitive damages.  (Kendall  Yacht Corp. v. United California Bank (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 949, 958.)   The allegations supporting a request for punitive damages must be alleged with  specificity; conclusory allegations without sufficient facts are not  enough.  (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033,  1041-1042.)   Here, Defendants move to strike the fifth prayer of the  SAC: “For exemplary and punitive damages, according to proof against  Defendants ENRIQUE MORENO ROQUE AND DOES 1 THROUGH 100[.]” (SAC, at 7.)   Plaintiff prays for punitive damages under both causes of  action – negligence and violation of Vehicle Code sections. However, established law  sets forth that mere negligence, even gross negligence or recklessness is  insufficient to establish that a defendant acted with “willful and conscious  disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Dawes v. Superior Court  (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 82, 87.)    Furthermore, Plaintiff’s SAC does not expressly or  implicitly allege “malice, oppression” under his first cause of action.  Consequently, punitive damages may not be imposed.   As to the second cause of action, the Court has previously  determined that the SAC failed to sufficiently plead Defendants’ civil  liabilities for the alleged violations of Vehicle Code sections. Since there  must be an actionable tort underlying any claim for punitive  damages which cannot be asserted as an  independent cause of action¿(Hilliard v. A.H. Robins Co. (1983) 148  Cal.App.3d 374, 391), punitive damages are unavailable under the second cause  of action.   Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Strike the fifth  prayer for exemplary and punitive damages and GRANTS Plaintiff LEAVE TO AMEND.   CONCLUSION   The Court GRANTS with LEAVE TO AMEND Defendants’ Motion to  Strike.    Paragraphs 15-24 under the second cause of action and the  fifth prayer of Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint are hereby stricken.   Plaintiff is ordered to file a Third Amended Complaint  within 20 days from the date of this order.   Moving party is to give notice.
