And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike portions of the Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Defendants U-Haul Co. of California, U-Haul Co. of Arizona, and Arcoa Risk Retention Group, Inc. The motion was filed to strike the request for punitive damages in the first cause of action for breach of contract, the fifth cause of action for fraud, and the sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge agrees with Cross-Defendants that the request for punitive damages in the first cause of action for breach of contract is improper because punitive damages are not available for breach of contract. The judge also agrees that the allegations in support of the bad faith cause of action are not sufficient to support the punitive damages claim against a corporate employer.

The judge grants the motion to strike the request for punitive damages in the first cause of action for breach of contract without leave to amend. The judge grants the motion to strike the request for punitive damages in the fifth and sixth causes of action for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress with 20 days leave to amend.

The judge notes that Cross-Complainant failed to address certain arguments raised by Cross-Defendants and failed to plead sufficient facts to support the punitive damages claim against a corporate employer. The judge also notes that the opposition filed by Cross-Complainant added an argument that their request for attorneys' fees was proper, but the motion did not place attorneys' fees into issue and made no argument against the request for attorneys' fees.
