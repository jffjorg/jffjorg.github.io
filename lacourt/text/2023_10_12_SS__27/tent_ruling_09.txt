[1] The Court also notes this
representation is not stated in a declaration from Plaintiff under penalty of
perjury.    


[2] Curiously, Plaintiff also waives whatever
sanctions to which he might be entitled. 
Given there is no dispute that Defendant properly served the at-issue
discovery requests and Plaintiff has not provided responses, Plaintiff would
not be entitled to any sanctions.
