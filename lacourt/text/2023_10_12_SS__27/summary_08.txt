And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand for Identification and Production and Inspection of Documents filed by the Defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The Plaintiff, Donyea Richardson, had failed to provide responses to the discovery requests despite being served on November 23, 2022, and being granted an extension to provide responses. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has waived all objections to the discovery requests and orders the Plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The judge also imposes sanctions on the Plaintiff in the amount of $750, representing 3 hours of defense counsel's hourly rate, for the Plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests. The judge sets the hearing for October 12, 2023, and requires the parties to provide written submissions on the tentative ruling if they intend to submit on the tentative.
