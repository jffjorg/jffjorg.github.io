RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On August 25, 2023, Wiesman Pirian, counsel for Plaintiff, Teri
Shelton, filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
            The Motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS 
 
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to the
client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Wiesman Pirian seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for
Plaintiff for the following reason: “Client has become uncooperative which has
rendered continued legal representation unreasonably difficult.”  (MC-052.) 
 
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)  
 
Upon review, the Court finds the Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED
and effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon
Plaintiff.
Moving party to give notice.
