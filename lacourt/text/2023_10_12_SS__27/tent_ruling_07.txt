[1] The parties did not agree in
writing to extend the filing date for Defendants’ motions to compel further.





[2] This very point was made in Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc., supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at 232.  “We can leave for another day the possibility
of an ‘absurd result’ as the trial court put it, if there is no time limit on a
motion to compel involving objections.”  The
Court of Appeal went on to add in a footnote, “[b]ut that other day will
doubtless come, and we are more likely to get it right if the Legislature
addresses it before we have to.” (Id. at fn.5.)  In this case, the day has come but the Legislature
has yet to address it.        





[3] For example, Plaintiff represented
he would serve supplemental responses to Defendants’ discovery requests but
thereafter refused once the 45-day deadline passed.  





[4] Both parties have a series of
motions to compel further on calendar.  At
the hearing, the Court will address and inquire about the status of these various
motions.
