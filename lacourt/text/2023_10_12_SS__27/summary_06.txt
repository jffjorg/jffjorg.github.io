And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion for relief under CCP § 473(b) filed by the defendants, Waterstone Apartments CA, LLC and Pria Perea, seeking relief from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against them through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The motion was filed due to the defendants' failure to receive substantive responses to their discovery requests from the plaintiffs, Joshua Cliffords and Benjamin Cliffords. The defendants argue that the 45-day deadline for bringing a motion to compel further responses has passed and that they are entitled to relief under CCP § 473(b). The Judge concludes that unverified, objection-only responses to discovery do not trigger the 45-day deadline and that the defendants may bring their motions to compel further responses. The motion for relief under CCP § 473(b) is deemed moot.
