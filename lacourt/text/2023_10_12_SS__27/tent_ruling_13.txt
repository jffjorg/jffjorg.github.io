[1] Plaintiff argues the demurrer
should be overruled because Defendants did not timely file their Declaration of
Demurring Party as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a)(2).  As the Declaration
indicates, Defendants’ responsive pleading was due on August 21, 2023 yet they
did not file the Declaration until a  day
later.  However, Plaintiff does not cite
any authority for the proposition that a court may sustain a demurrer in this
procedural context.  As Plaintiff was
able to respond to the substance of this demurrer, the Court reaches the merits
of the arguments.
