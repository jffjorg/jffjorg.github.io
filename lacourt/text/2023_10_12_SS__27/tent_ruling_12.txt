I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff, Aida Perez, initiated this wrongful
death action against Defendants, Maersk A/S dba A.P. Moller—Maersk
(“Maersk”), Damco Distribution Services, Inc., Damco USA Inc., 52 Degree Lane,
Inc., San Judas Tadeo Trucking, LLC, San Judas Tade Trucking, Inc., and Gabriel
Mendez, arising out of the death of Plaintiff’s fiancé, Jose Antonio Arciniega
(“Decedent”), on Defendants’ premises on August 31, 2022.  Plaintiff
asserts causes of action for Negligence and Premises Liability.  On July 18, 2023, the Court deemed this case and
 Isabel Violet Arciniega, et al. v.
Maersk A/S, et al., LASC Case No. 22STCV29437 were related.
 
            On August
22, 2023, Defendants filed a Declaration of Demurring Party in Support of
Automatic Extension.  The Declaration
indicates Defendants’ responsive pleading was due on August 21, 2021.  
 
            On September
8, 2023, Defendants, Maersk and Maersk Warehousing & Distribution Services
USA LLC (f/k/a Damco Distribution Services, Inc. and Damco USA Inc.), filed
this Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  
 
Plaintiff opposes[1]
and Defendants reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER  
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   Judicial
Council forms are not immune to demurrer.  (People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v.
Superior Court (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1486.) 
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subd. (e).)  “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where
a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A.  Meet and Confer
 
Defense counsel has complied with the meet and confer
requirement.¿ (See Declaration of Davil R. Vasquez.)
 
B.  Analysis
 
The sole issue to
be decided is whether Plaintiff has standing as Decedent’s fiancé and alleged
dependent to maintain her claims against Defendants.  
 
“A cause of action
for the death of a person caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another may
be asserted by any of the following persons or by the decedent’s personal
representative on their behalf: (a) The decedent’s surviving spouse, domestic
partner, children, and issue of deceased children . . .”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 377.60, subd. (a).)  Whether or not qualified under subdivision
(a), if they were dependent on the decedent, the putative spouse, children of
the putative spouse, stepchildren, parents, or the legal guardians of the
decedent if the parents are deceased.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.60, subd. (b)(1).)  As used in this subdivision,
“putative spouse” means the surviving spouse of a void or voidable marriage who
is found by the court to have believed in good faith that the marriage to the
decedent was valid.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
377.60, subd. (b)(2).)  A cause of action
for wrongful death is a statutory claim meant to compensate specified
persons—heirs—for the loss of companionship and for other losses suffered as a
result of a decedent’s death.  (Lattimore v. Dickey (2015) 239
Cal.App.4th 959, 968.)  
 
Defendants argue
Plaintiff does not have standing under section 377.60 to bring this wrongful
death action.  The Court agrees.  Plaintiff alleges she was Decedent’s fiancé
at the time of the incident.  (Complaint,
¶ 2.)  Section 377.60, subdivision (a)
lists the persons who may assert a wrongful death cause of action, including
the decedent’s surviving spouse, domestic partner, children and issue of
deceased children.  Missing from that
list are persons who have the intention of marrying such as a fiancé.   
 
Plaintiff contends
Defendants’ read section 377.60 too narrowly. 
Plaintiff draws the Court’s attention to the language under subdivision
(b)(1) which states, in part “if they were dependent on the decedent, . . . .”   Here,
Plaintiff alleges she “was financially dependent on [Decedent].”  (Complaint, ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff’s reading of section 377.60,
however, pulls out of context a fragment of the statute.  The cited language, “if they were dependent
on the decedent” is not a separate category of persons.  Rather, it is a clause which modifies the
list of additional persons who may bring a wrongful death action.  That list includes the “putative spouse,
children of the putative spouse, stepchildren, parents, or the legal guardians
of the decedent if the parents are deceased.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 377.60, subd. (b)(1).)   The Complaint does not allege any facts to
show Plaintiff has standing as a person listed under subdivision (a) or (b)(1)
of section 377.60.
 
Case law supports the
conclusion Plaintiff lacks standing.  In Harrod
v. Pacific Southwest Airlines (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 155, the trial court sustained
without leave to amend a demurrer to a wrongful death lawsuit brought by a
surviving nonmarital partner of the decedent. 
The plaintiff had been living with the decedent the year prior to her
death.  The decedent died in a plane
crash.  The two were due to be married
seven months after her untimely death. They had pooled their earnings while
living together, agreed to equally share property accumulated during their
relationship, and bought a house, taking title in both of their names.  The appellate court affirmed the judgment
dismissing the suit and held that a decedent’s meretricious spouse is not an
heir within the meaning of section 377.60 (then codified as section 377).  (Harrod, 118 Cal.App.3d at p.
157.)   The appellate court also noted that a wrongful
death cause of action “is purely statutory and exists only so far and in favor
of such person as the legislative power may declare.”  (Id. at p. 158.)  So, too, here.  Much like the plaintiff in Harrod,
Plaintiff is the nonmarital surviving partner of Decedent.  Plaintiff does not have standing.    
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
Accordingly, the demurrer is SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is DENIED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
