Here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the Defendants, Maersk A/S and Maersk Warehousing & Distribution Services USA LLC, to the Plaintiff's complaint. The Plaintiff, Aida Perez, is suing the Defendants for wrongful death and premises liability following the death of her fiancé, Jose Antonio Arciniega, on August 31, 2022, on the Defendants' premises. The judge concludes that the Plaintiff does not have standing as Decedent's fiancé to maintain the claims against the Defendants under California Code of Civil Procedure section 377.60. The judge finds that the Plaintiff's reading of the statute is incorrect and that the cited language is not a separate category of persons. Case law, including Harrod v. Pacific Southwest Airlines (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 155, supports the conclusion that the Plaintiff lacks standing. The judge denies leave to amend the complaint and orders the Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
