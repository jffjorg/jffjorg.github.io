And here is a summary of the tentatively ruling in English text:

The tentatively ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The issue is whether the defendant's actions increased the risk of injury to the plaintiff, and the court finds that there is a triable issue of material fact. The defendant's motion is denied because the court cannot find as a matter of law that the primary assumption of risk doctrine bars the plaintiffs' claims. The court also finds that the defendant did not show that the elements of a negligence claim and a premises liability claim are the same, and therefore, summary adjudication is not proper. The case will proceed to trial.
