MOTIONS
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Run D. Wu and Dan Yuedong Wu 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On October 8, 2021, Plaintiff, Esmaralda Y. Fuentes-Perez,
filed this action against Defendants, Run D. Wu and Dan Yuedong Wu, arising
from an apartment fire that occurred around November 2020.  Plaintiff is
presently self-represented.
 
            Run
D. Wu’s Discovery Requests
            
            Run D. Wu
served Plaintiff with written discovery requests on December 27, 2021,
including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Production of
Documents.  Plaintiff served responses on
October 24, 2022.  Run D. Wu found
Plaintiff’s responses to be deficient and thereafter filed a motion to compel
further responses.  The Court granted the
motions on April 11, 2023 and April 19, 2023. 
Plaintiff did not file opposition or appear at the hearings.  A notice of ruling was served on Plaintiff on
April 12, 2023, and April 19, 2023, respectively.  To date, Plaintiff has not provided further
discovery responses.
 
            Dan
Yuedong Wu’s Discovery Requests
            
            Dan Yuedong
Wu served Plaintiff with written discovery on February 3, 2023.  After Plaintiff failed to provide timely responses,
objections or requests for extension, Dan Yuedong Wu moved to compel
Plaintiff’s responses.  The Court granted
the motion on August 24, 2022.  Plaintiff
did not file opposition or appear at the hearing.  Dan Yuedong Wu served Plaintiff with notice
of the ruling on August 30, 2022.  
 
            After Plaintiff
failed to provide Dan Yuedong Wu with discovery responses, Dan Yuedong Wu then
moved for evidentiary and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.  The Court granted the motion on January 26,
2023.  Plaintiff did not file opposition
or appear at the hearing.  Dan Yuedong Wu
served Plaintiff with the notice of the ruling on February 16, 2023.  Plaintiff did not provide Dan Yuedong Wu with
any discovery responses.
 
             On May 23, 2023, Defendants filed these motions
for imposition of terminating sanctions. 
Plaintiff did not file any opposition. 
Dan Yuedong Wu’s motion was heard on June 15, 2023.  The Court issued a tentative ruling granting Dan
Yuedong Wu’s motion.  Plaintiff appeared
at the hearing and requested more time to provide discovery responses.  Pursuant to that request, the Court continued
the hearing for Dan Yuedong Wu’s motion to October 12, 2023.  The Court advanced and continued Run D. Wu’s
motion’s from August 11, 2023 to October 12, 2023.  Defendants were to file supplemental documents
in support of their motions no later than 16 court days before the hearing and
to re-serve the discovery requests on Plaintiff.  The Court warned Plaintiff that these motions
for terminating sanctions would be granted if Plaintiff fails to comply.  
 
            On June 20,
2023, Dan Yuedong Wu re-served Plaintiff with notice of the Court’s June 15,
2023 ruling.  On the same day, Dan
Yuedong Wu re-served Plaintiff with his First Set of Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents.  
 
            On June 30,
2023, Run D. Wu re-served Plaintiff with his First Set of Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents.  
 
On September 13, 2023, and September 15, 2023, Defendants
filed supplemental declarations.  
According to the declarations, Plaintiff has not served discovery
responses or documents.  Defendants now request
that the Court grant these motions for terminating sanctions.
            
            The motions,
and supplemental declarations, are unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030
gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process.¿ Misuse of the discovery process includes
failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court
order to provide discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d),
(g).)¿ A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the
party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)¿ A violation of a discovery order is sufficient
for the imposition of terminating sanctions.¿ (Collison & Kaplan v.
Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)¿ Terminating sanctions are
appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court’s orders.¿ (Deyo
v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)¿¿¿ 
The court should consider the
totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if
the actions were willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number
of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery.  (Lang v. Hochman (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a
greater sanction is warranted.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)  However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a
lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the
ultimate sanction.”  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.)
        
Before any sanctions may be imposed
the court must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of
the party to serve the required answers.  (Fairfield v. Superior Court
for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)  Lack of
diligence may be deemed willful where the party understood its obligation, had
the ability to comply, and failed to comply.  (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)  The party who failed to
comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure
was not willful.  (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.)¿ 
A terminating sanction is a
“drastic measure which should be employed with caution.”¿ (Deyo, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “A decision to order terminating sanctions should not
be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history
of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing
the ultimate sanction.”¿ (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)¿ While the court has discretion to impose
terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should be appropriate to the
dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”¿ (Deyo, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction
against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his
discovery obligations.”¿ (Ibid.)  Discovery sanctions are
not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair
disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of
information.¿ (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64
[superseded on other grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229
Cal.App.3d 967, 971].)¿ 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            As the
Court stated in Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at pp. 795-796,
“[t]erminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying
the court’s orders.”¿ Terminating sanctions are appropriate here for that very
reason.¿ Plaintiff did not provide Defendant Dan Yuedong Wu with her discovery responses,
disobeyed a Court Order compelling her to provide discovery responses, and has
failed to file an opposition to this motion.¿¿¿Plaintiff also did not provide
further discovery responses to Defendant Run D. Wu, disobeyed a Court order
compelling her to provide further responses, and has failed to file an
opposition to this motion.
 
            The Court
finds Plaintiff knew of her discovery obligations and knew of the Court Orders
compelling her compliance.¿ The Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to provide initial
discovery responses and further discovery responses was willful as was her
disobedience to the Court’s Orders.  Given Plaintiff’s apparent
disinterest in prosecuting this action, even after the Court imposed evidence
and additional monetary sanctions on Plaintiff in connection with Dan Yuedong
Wu’s discovery motions, and being given another opportunity to provide
discovery responses at the June 15, 2023 hearing, the Court finds lesser
sanctions would not curb the abuse.¿ 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
            
            Based on
the foregoing, the motions for terminating sanctions are GRANTED.  Plaintiff Esmaralda Fuentes-Perez’s Complaint
against Defendant Dan Yuedong Wu and Defendant Run D. Wu are dismissed with
prejudice. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
