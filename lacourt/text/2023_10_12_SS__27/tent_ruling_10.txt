DEMURRER

RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On November 11, 2022, Plaintiff, Marcelino John, initiated
this action against Defendants, County of Los Angeles, City of Los Angeles, and
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“LACMTA”), for injuries
Plaintiff sustained when he fell while exiting LACMTA’s bus.  Plaintiff alleges LACMTA’s bus driver
negligently stopped the bus approximately 36-40 inches away from the curb,
causing Plaintiff to misstep and fall.  Plaintiff
asserts causes of action for (1) Negligence, (2) Negligence Per Se, (3) Dangerous
Condition of Public Property Pursuant to Government Code § 835, and (4)
Statutory Liability.  
 
            On September
14, 2023, LACMTA filed this Demurrer to the Second Cause of Action and Motion
to Strike portions of the Complaint.  
 
The demurrer and motion to strike are unopposed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER  
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   Judicial
Council forms are not immune to demurrer.  (People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v.
Superior Court (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1486.) 
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subd. (e).)  “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where
a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A.  Meet and Confer
 
Defense counsel has complied with the meet and confer
requirement.¿ (See Declaration of Eitan Yehoshua.)
 
B.  Demurrer
 
LACMTA demurs to
the Second Cause of Action because negligence per se is not a cause of
action.  The Court agrees.  Negligence per se is not a separate tort
cause of action.¿ It is an evidentiary doctrine whereby negligence may be
presumed if the evidentiary requirements are met.¿ (Quiroz v. Seventh Ave.
Center¿(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1285 [“the doctrine of negligence per
se does not establish tort liability.¿ Rather, it merely codifies the rule that
a presumption of negligence arises from the violation of a statute which was
enacted to protect a class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member
against the type of harm that the plaintiff suffered¿as a result of¿the
violation”].)¿ “Accordingly, to apply negligence per se is not to state an
independent cause of action.¿ The doctrine does not provide a private right of
action for violation of a statute.¿ [Citation.]¿ Instead, it operates to
establish a presumption of negligence for which the statute serves the
subsidiary function of providing evidence of an element of a preexisting common
law cause of action.¿ (Ibid.)¿¿Plaintiff does not submit any evidence or
argument in opposition.    
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer
to the Second Cause of Action is SUSTAINED. 
 
C.  Motion to Strike
 
Any party, within
the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a motion to
strike the whole pleading or any part thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd.
(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).) On a motion to strike,
the court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an
order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b); Stafford v.
Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)  
 
LACMTA seeks to
strike (1) lines 20-22 of Paragraph 17 from the First Cause of Action of
Plaintiff’s Complaint, and (2) the Fourth Cause of Action for Statutory
Liability.  Paragraph 17, lines 20-22
allege, in relevant part, “ . . . Metropolitan Transportation Authority Bus
negligently entrusted said Metropolitan Transportation Authority Bus to the
driver thereof, . . . .”  The Fourth
Cause of Action (label vaguely as Statutory Liability) alleges Defendants,
including LACMTA, are statutorily liable pursuant to Vehicle Code Sections
17150-17159, et seq., for permitting the bus driver to operate the subject bus.
 
 
The foregoing
portions of the Complaint concern negligent entrustment claims.  LACMTA argues they should be stricken because
there is no statutory basis to impose liability for negligent entrustment
against LACMTA.[2]
 Liability against public entities in
California must be based on statute.  (Guzman v. County of Monterey¿(2009)
46 Cal.4th 887, 897.)  
 
Here, lines 20-22
of Paragraph 17 of the First Cause of Action and the Fourth Cause of Action fail
to identify an independent statutory basis for imposing liability on LACMTA.  The Complaint is deficient.
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
The unopposed demurrer is sustained.  Leave to amend the Second Cause of Action is denied.
 
The unopposed motion to strike is granted.  Leave to amend is granted.
 
Plaintiff Marcelino John is ordered to serve and file a First
Amended Complaint within 20 days of this order. 

 
Defendant Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority is
ordered to serve and file its responsive pleading within 30 days of service of
the First Amended Complaint.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
