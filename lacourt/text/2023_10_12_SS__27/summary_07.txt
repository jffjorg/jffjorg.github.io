And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before the court today. The parties did not agree to extend the filing date for the defendant's motions to compel further, which is a point also made in a previous case, Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. The court will address and inquire about the status of the various motions to compel further at the upcoming hearing. The plaintiff failed to serve supplemental responses to the defendant's discovery requests, and the defendant's motions to compel further were not filed on time. The court will discuss these issues at the hearing.
