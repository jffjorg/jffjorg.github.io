PETITION
TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Brian Kawai
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimant,
Lauren Kawai, a minor, by and through her parent and guardian ad litem, Petitioner,
Brian Kawai, has agreed to settle her claims against Defendant Palos Verdes
Peninsula Unified School District in exchange for $187,500.  If approved, $13,509.95 will be used for
medical expenses, $75,000 will be used for attorney’s fees, $8,892.60 will be
used to reimburse Petitioner for payment of medical treatment for Claimant, and
$8,500.34 will be used for non-medical expenses, leaving a settlement balance
of $81,597.11 for Claimant to be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity,
subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  The details of
the annuity are specified at Attachment 18b(3) of the Petition and Attachment
8b(2) of the proposed Order (Form MC-351).  
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            Upon
review, the Court finds the settlement balance is fair and reasonable.  The Court also finds the request for
attorney’s fees is fair and reasonable and consistent with the signed retainer
agreement between Claimant and her counsel. 

 
            Accordingly,
the unopposed Petition is GRANTED.  The
Court sets an OSC Re: Purchase of Annuity for December 12, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.¿
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.953, subd. (a).)¿ If an acknowledgement of receipt
by the financial institution is filed before that date, no appearance will be
required.
 
Moving party to give notice.
