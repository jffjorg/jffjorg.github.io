[1] Defendant does not dispute this
fact.  Instead, Defendant disputes the
inference that the attendant’s presence in the only open lane caused Ms.
Schipske’s daughter to collide with Ms. Schipske’s stalled go-kart.  As discussed, infra, Plaintiff’s inference is
a reasonable one.  And on summary
judgment, a trial court is directed to draw all reasonable inferences in favor
of the opposing party.  (See Weiss,
supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment
or summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in
the light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)
