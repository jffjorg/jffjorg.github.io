BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs bring this action under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a
vehicle they purchased on or around 8/28/22, for which Defendant issued the
manufacturer’s express warranty. (Compl. ¶¶ 4, 7–9.) Plaintiffs allege that “the
subject vehicle has suffered from nonconformity(s) to warranty to, including,
but not limited to, acceleration, brake switch assembly, ECM, fuel pump
assembly, and other defects” during the applicable warranty period. (Id. at
¶ 10.) Plaintiffs allege that they presented the vehicle for repair at an
authorized repair facility, but the defects remain. (Id. at ¶¶ 11–12.)
 
On 11/16/23, Plaintiffs filed their
complaint, alleging against Defendant the sole cause of action for Violation of
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. On 12/29/23, Defendant filed its answer.
 
On 12/19/23,
Plaintiffs served a notice of deposition of Defendant’s PMQ. (Decl. of Scott A.
Sanchez ¶ 5.) On 1/9/24, Defendant served its responses and objections thereto.
(Id. at ¶ 6.)
 
On 1/12/24,
Plaintiffs served their first amended notice of deposition of Defendant’s PMQ.
(Id. at ¶ 8.) On 1/25/24, Defendant served its responses and objections
thereto. (Id. at ¶ 9.)
 
On 2/1/24,
Plaintiffs served their second amended notice of deposition of Defendant’s PMQ.
(Id. at ¶ 11.) On 2/23/24, Defendant served its responses and objections
thereto. (Id. at ¶ 12.) However, Defendant failed to provide Plaintiffs
with a date for the deposition. (Id. at ¶ 13.)
 
On 3/22/24, Plaintiffs filed the
instant motion to compel the deposition of the
Defendant’s PMQ. On 4/30/24, Defendant filed its opposition. On 5/6/24,
Plaintiffs filed their reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A party may, upon proper written
notice, obtain discovery by taking the oral deposition of any natural person,
organization, partnership, association, or governmental agency. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2025.010, 2025.220.) A party deponent can be required to attend a
deposition by service of a deposition notice on the party's attorney. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
 
“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, … fails to appear for examination, … the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
            
A motion to compel a deposition must
(1) “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice;” and (2) “be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.” (Id. at subd. (b).)
 
1.      Meet and Confer
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ counsel declares
that on 1/9/24, 1/25/24, 3/1/24, 3/5/24, and 3/6/24, he and Defendant’s counsel
met and conferred regarding the issues raised in the instant motion and about
potential dates for the deposition. (Sanchez Decl. ¶¶ 5.) Accordingly, the
Court finds that counsel has satisfied the meet-and-confer requirement under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (b)(2).)
 
2.      Good Cause
 
Here, Plaintiff asserts that there is good cause to depose
Defendant’s PMQ because “the deposition testimony of Nissan's PMQ is
crucial to Plaintiffs’ ability to prove their case and to show that Nissan’s
violation of the Song-Beverly Act was ‘willful,’ subjecting it to a civil
penalty.” (Pls.’ Mot. 4:12–14.)
 
Here, “the
categories of testimony requested include: (1) why Nissan did not repurchase
the vehicle pursuant to the lemon law pre-suit [Categories 1 and 2]; (2)
questions about the service, repair and communication history related to the
vehicle and Plaintiffs [Category 3]; (3) questions relating to Nissan’s
investigation of the service history [Categories 4–6]; and (4) questions about
the warranty nonconformities of which Plaintiffs complain [Category 7].” (Id.
at 10:10–14.)
 
In
opposition, Defendant argues that the motion should be denied “because Nissan
has agreed to produce a witness on five of the seven categories of testimony at
issue and documents on … all of the duplicative document requests at issue.
Further, Nissan offered and Plaintiff declined to depose Nissan’s Person Most
Qualified (“PMQ”) on May 31, 2024.” (Def.’s Opp. 2:5–8.) “The only matter of
testimony that Nissan declined to produce a witness on are 6) an investigation
into whether Plaintiffs’ vehicle qualified for repurchase or replacement before
filing of the Complaint where Plaintiffs did not request a repurchase prior to
filing the Complaint and. (no. 7) concerning ‘warranty nonconformity(s)’ is
mostly covered by matter no. 3 (the service and repair history) and Nissan
stands on its objections concerning this one category.” (Id. at
2:15–19.)
 
Plaintiffs argue in reply that with regard to Category 6, “there
is no requirement that a plaintiff/consumer specifically request a repurchase”
before a manufacturer’s affirmative duty to make restitution arises. (Pls.’ Reply 4:5–14, citing Lukather v. General Motors, LLC
(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1050.) Plaintiffs further assert that with regard
to Category 7, “questions regarding warranty nonconformities encompass a
deeper, more specific area of examination which does not necessarily include
the service and repair history.” (Id. at 4:1–3.) The
Court agrees with Plaintiffs, and further finds that the testimony and
documents sought are relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims that Defendant “willfully”
violated the Song-Beverly Act, thereby subjecting it to civil penalties. (Civ.
Code § 1794, subd. (c).)
 
With
respect to Defendant’s argument that the motion should be denied because
Defendant offered to have its PMQ deposed on 5/31/24, which Plaintiffs
declined, the Court finds that Defendant unreasonably delayed in offering this
deposition date despite Plaintiffs’ counsel’s attempts to confirm. As
Plaintiffs’ counsel notes via sworn declaration, Defendant’s counsel’s offer
for the deposition date came late in the day on 4/29/24, one day before
Defendant’s opposition to the instant motion was due. (Suppl. Decl. of Scott A.
Sanchez ¶¶ 3–4.) Thereafter, “Plaintiffs’ Counsel informed Nissan’s Counsel
that Nissan had provided May 31, 2024, for its deposition in two other cases
with this office, and that Plaintiffs therefore did not believe that Nissan
would be able to complete three separate depositions in a single day.” (Id. at
¶ 5.)
 
The Court
therefore finds no basis to deny the instant motion based on Defendant’s weak
argument that Plaintiff is at fault for the delay in deposing Defendant’s PMQ. Based
on the foregoing, the Court orders the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ to be
taken, with production of the requested documents, on or before 5/12/24.
//

3.      Sanctions
 
If the Court grants a motion to compel a deposition,
it “shall impose a monetary sanction … in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd.
(g)(1).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs request monetary
sanctions in the total amount of $2,625.00 to
be imposed on Defendant. This amount includes: (1) 5 hours of Plaintiffs’
attorney’s time spent working on this motion; and (2) an anticipated additional
2 hours reading Defendant’s opposition, drafting a reply, and appearing at the
hearing at his hourly billing rate of $375.00 per hour. (Sanchez Decl. ¶ 20.)
 
As the Court notes above, it
appears that Defendant unreasonably and unjustifiably delayed several months in
offering a deposition date despite Plaintiffs’ counsel’s multiple attempts to
confirm the same. “Instead of working with Plaintiffs to resolve this matter,
Nissan largely ignored Plaintiffs’ calls and correspondences. Through its
inaction, Nissan caused wasteful delay and impeded basic discovery.” (Pls.’
Mot. 11:16–18.) “Here, Plaintiffs engaged in three months of meet and confer
efforts via phone calls, voicemails, and correspondences, but Nissan ignored
these communications.” (Id. at 12:5–6.)
 
Based on the foregoing, and in
granting the instant motion, the Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff monetary
sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $750.00. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. Defendant is ordered to produce
its PMQ to be deposed regarding all noticed categories, and to produce the
documents specified in the deposition notice, on or before 5/12/24. The Court
imposes $750.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant.
