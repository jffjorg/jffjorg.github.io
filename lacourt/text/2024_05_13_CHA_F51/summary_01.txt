And here is the summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling concludes that the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company (Moving Defendant) is overruled. The court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts to meet the relaxed standard of pleading for a fraud cause of action, including allegations of fraudulent concealment by Moving Defendant. The court also finds that Moving Defendant had a duty to disclose material facts, despite not having a direct transactional relationship with Plaintiffs. Finally, the court holds that the economic loss rule does not apply to fraudulent inducement, and that a party alleging fraud or deceit in connection with a contract must establish tortious conduct independent of a breach of the contract itself.
