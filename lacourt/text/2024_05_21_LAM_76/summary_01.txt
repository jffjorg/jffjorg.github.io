```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Jose Delgadillo's motion for reconsideration of the order compelling arbitration. The motion was filed 350 days after the order was entered, and the judge finds that it is untimely. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff cannot bring a motion for reconsideration under California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1008(b) because they were not the party who originally brought the motion to compel arbitration. The judge further declines to reconsider the order compelling arbitration on its own motion, despite subsequent published opinions which conflict with Felisilda. The judge also states that a motion for reconsideration cannot correct judicial error and that the Court has no jurisdiction to order the case back into court if it is already in arbitration.
