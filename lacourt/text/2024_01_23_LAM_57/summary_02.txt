And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the defendant's demurrer, which is a request to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. The judge has decided to overrule the demurrer for all of the plaintiff's causes of action, except for the cause of action for unjust enrichment. However, the judge has sustained the demurrer for unjust enrichment, meaning that the plaintiff will not be able to pursue this claim. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for judicial notice, which would have allowed the defendant to introduce certain documents into evidence without having to prove their authenticity. The judge's decision is based on the case law, specifically Rutherford Holdings LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 233 Cal.App.4th 221, 231, which states that unjust enrichment is not a recognized stand-alone cause of action.
