And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a response to the Plaintiffs' motion to reconsider the Court's January 25, 2023 order compelling arbitration of their claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Although the motion is untimely, the Court is treating it as a request under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008(c) to reconsider the order on its own motion. The Court is vacating the order compelling arbitration due to a dramatic change in the law since the order was made. The Court of Appeal's decision in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, which was the basis for the order compelling arbitration, has been disavowed by subsequent court decisions. The stay of proceedings in this Court is lifted, and the case will be set for trial.
