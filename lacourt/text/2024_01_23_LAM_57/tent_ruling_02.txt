 Case Number:  23STCV22776    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendant's demurrer is overruled as to all of Plaintiffs' cause of action, except as to the cause of action for unjust enrichment.  The demurrer to that cause of action is sustained without leave to amend because unjust enrichment is not a recognized, stand-alone of cause of action; rather, unjust enrichment embodies remedial principles attendant to other recognized claims.  (Rutherford Holdings LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 233 Cal.App.4th 221, 231.)The Court is denying Defendant's request for judicial notice.  The documents that are the subject of the request for judicial notice are critical to Defendants' demurrer.  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the documents are not the proper subject of judicial notice.
