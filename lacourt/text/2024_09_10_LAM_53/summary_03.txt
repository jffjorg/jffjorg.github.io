And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial. The plaintiffs, Amosun Akala, Daniel P. Stelzer, and Stacy Hayes, filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Unified School District alleging seven causes of action, including failure to accommodate religious belief or observance, discrimination based on religion, and harassment based on national origin. The court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, and the plaintiffs now seek a new trial based on insufficiency of evidence, against law, and error in law.

The judge finds that the matter relied on by the plaintiffs is insufficient to show that the evidence presented by the parties in connection with the defendant's motion for summary judgment was insufficient to justify the court's order granting summary judgment in the defendant's favor. The judge also finds that the matter relied on by the plaintiffs is insufficient to show that the court's order was against law, and that the court made an error in law.

The judge concludes that the court's May 7, 2024 order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiffs is supported by sufficient evidence, is not against law, and is not erroneous as a matter of law. Therefore, the judge denies the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial.
