 Case Number:  20STCV49246    Hearing Date:   September 10, 2024    Dept:  53 Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. v.
Lu  20STCV49246 
Ex
Parte Application 9/10/24
The
court denies plaintiff’s ex parte application for an order staying depositions
because the court finds that plaintiff has not shown good cause for that
request.  
After
plaintiff files its motions for protective order concerning the depositions,
any party may file an ex parte application to advance the hearings on those
motions.   
The
court orders the parties’ counsel to meet and confer no later than September
17, 2024, to discuss and make a reasonable and good faith effort to schedule
dates for the depositions that are the subject of plaintiff’s ex parte
application.  If the parties’ counsel do
not informally resolve the dispute concerning the scheduling of those
depositions, the court expects to the parties’ counsel to schedule and hold an
Informal Discovery Conference with the court to address that issue.    
The court
orders plaintiff to give notice of this order.
