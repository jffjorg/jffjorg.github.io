And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed nine petitions seeking approval of compromises of claims on behalf of nine minor claimants. The petitions were filed by Yessica Koh, Guadalupe Reyes, Liliann Garcia, and Monique Martinez, who are the parents or guardians of the minor claimants. The court found that the settlements were fair and reasonable, and in the best interests of the minor claimants. The settlements were made with the defendants, Susan Koepke-Green, Kismet Enterprises LLC, and others, and total $478,000. Of this amount, $6,700 will be allocated to each minor claimant, with $1,675 going to counsel for attorney's fees and the remaining $5,025 deposited into insured accounts for the minor claimants. The court granted the petitions and set an Order to Show Cause for the filing of Receipt and Acknowledgement of Order for the Deposit of Money into Blocked Accounts. The court also ordered the plaintiff and petitioner to give notice of this ruling.
