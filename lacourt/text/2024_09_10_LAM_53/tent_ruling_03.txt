plaintiffs’ motion for new trial
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Plaintiffs Amosun Akala, Daniel P.
Stelzer, and Stacy Hayes  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District
Motion for New Trial
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No reply papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Amosun Akala, Daniel P. Stelzer, and Stacy Hayes
(“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District (“Defendant”) on October 31, 2022, alleging seven causes of action for
(1) failure to accommodate religious belief or observance; (2) discrimination
based on religion; (3) harassment based on religion; (4) discrimination based
on national origin; (5) harassment based on national origin; (6) retaliation;
and (7) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. 
            On May 7, 2024, the court issued an
order granting Defendant’s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’
Complaint.  (May 7, 2024 Order, p.
20:1-3.)  Pursuant to that order, on July
1, 2024, the court entered judgment in favor of Defendant and against
Plaintiffs.  (Judgment entered July 1,
2024, p. 2:11-14.) 
            Plaintiffs now move the court for an
order setting aside the court’s May 7, 2024 order and the July 1, 2024
judgment, and granting a new trial against Defendants.  Plaintiffs move for this relief on the grounds
that (1) the evidence was insufficient to justify the court’s decision, (2) the
decision is against law, and (3) the court made an error in law.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subds. (6) [new
trial may be granted based on “[i]nsufficiency of the evidence to justify the
verdict or other decision, or the verdict or other decision is against law”], (7)
[new trial may be granted based on “[e]rror in law, occurring at the trial and
excepted to by the party making the application”]; Doe v. United Air Lines,
Inc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1504 [“An order granting summary judgment
is properly challenged by a motion for a new trial”].)  Specifically, Plaintiffs have based their
motion for a new trial on the sole ground that, in a case pending in Department
24 of the Los Angeles Superior Court, Mitchell, et al. v. Los Angeles
Unified School District (LASC Case No. 22STCV29869), the court denied
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. 
(Mot., pp. 3:20-5:23.)  Plaintiffs
assert that “[t]he ruling in Mitchell shows the error in the” court’s
May 7, 2024 order in this action.  (Mot.,
p. 5:18.)  
            First, the court finds that the
matter relied on by Plaintiffs is insufficient to show that the evidence
presented by the parties in connection with Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment was insufficient to justify the court’s order granting summary
judgment in Defendant’s favor.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 657, subd. (6).) 
Plaintiffs did not present adequate analysis or evidence showing that,
upon weighing the evidence, the court “clearly should have reached a different
verdict or decision.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 657.)  Moreover, while Plaintiffs have
cited the ruling in the Mitchell case, the order made in Department 24
is not binding on this court.  (Harrott
v. County of Kings (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1138, 1146 [“Trial court decisions are
not precedents binding on other courts under the principle of stare decisis”]; Sargent
Fletcher, Inc. v. Able Corp. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1658, 1669 [“‘[a]
written trial court ruling has no precedential value’”].)  The court further finds, after considering
the evidence and arguments raised by the parties, that the evidence presented
was sufficient to justify the court’s order granting Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment. 
            Second, the court finds that the
matter relied on by Plaintiffs is insufficient to show that (1) the court’s
order was against law, and (2) the court made an error in law.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subds. (6), (7).)  While the court notes that Plaintiffs contend
that the court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant because
Department 24 denied a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant in
another action, as set forth above, the order issued in that department is not
binding on this court.  (Harrott, supra,
25 Cal.4th at p. 1148; Sargent Fletcher, Inc., supra, 110
Cal.App.4th at p. 1669.)  Thus,
Plaintiffs have not cited binding authority establishing that the court’s order
was against law or that the court’s ruling was, as a matter of law,
erroneous.  (Collins v. Sutter
Memorial Hospital (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1, 17 [noting that a motion for a
new trial based on a decision against law “‘is available mainly in two
situations: (a) an improper verdict [citation]; (b) a defective statement of
decision [citation]’”], 17-18 [a court may grant a new trial based on an error
in law “if ‘its original ruling, as a matter of law, was erroneous’”].) 
            Thus, for the reasons set forth
above, the court finds that its May 7, 2024 order granting summary judgment in
favor of Defendant and against Plaintiffs (1) is supported by sufficient
evidence, (2) is not against law, and (3) is not erroneous as a matter of
law.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subds.
(6), (7).)  The court therefore denies Plaintiffs’
motion for a new trial.
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiffs Amosun
Akala, Daniel P. Stelzer, and Stacy Hayes’s motion for a new trial.
            The court orders defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
