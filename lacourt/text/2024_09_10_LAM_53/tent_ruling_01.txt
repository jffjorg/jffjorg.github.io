  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel responses to
  requests for production of documents
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Sommer Ray Beaty           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Sommer Ray Beaty (“Defendant”) filed the pending motion to
compel responses to requests for production of documents on June 6, 2024,
moving the court for an order (1) compelling plaintiffs Anthony Aiello and
Anthony’s Worldwide Productions, LLC (“Plaintiffs”) to serve responses to
Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiffs in the amount
of $3,230.
On August 2, 2024, Defendant filed an ex parte application (set for
hearing on August 12, 2024) requesting that the court shorten the time to hear,
and advance the March 12, 2025 hearing on, Defendant’s motion to compel
Plaintiffs’ responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents.  (Aug. 2, 2024 Ex Parte, p. 2:11-15.)  On August 12, 2024, the court issued an order
(1) granting Defendant’s ex parte application, (2) advancing the hearing on
Defendant’s motion from March 12, 2025 to September 10, 2024, and (3) ordering
Defendant to give notice of the court’s ruling. 
(Aug. 12, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.) 
Defendant has not filed a proof of service showing that Defendant
served Plaintiffs with the court’s August 12, 2024 order.  Moreover, Plaintiffs did not file an
opposition to Defendant’s motion.  Thus,
it appears that Plaintiffs have not been given notice of the new hearing date
on Defendant’s motion to compel their responses to her Requests for Production
of Documents.
The court finds that it is appropriate, and therefore exercises its
discretion, to continue the hearing on Defendant’s motion in order to ensure
that Plaintiffs are given notice of the new hearing date on the motion and to,
if desired, file an opposition to Defendant’s motion.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendant Sommer Ray Beaty’s motion to compel responses to requests for
production of documents is continued to October 9, 2024.
            The court orders defendant Sommer
Ray Beaty (1) to give notice of this ruling to plaintiffs Anthony Aiello and
Anthony’s Worldwide Productions, LLC, and (2) to file with the court a proof of
service of the notice of ruling on plaintiffs Anthony Aiello and Anthony’s
Worldwide Productions, LLC no later than September 12, 2024.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  September 10, 2024
