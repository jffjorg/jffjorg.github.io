And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Gergis Ghobrial. The Defendant, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Memorial Health Services, and Desiree Thomas, had moved to compel the deposition after Plaintiff refused to appear for a second session on November 13, 2023. The Plaintiff had previously attempted to impose conditions on the deposition, which were denied by the court. The judge granted the motion to compel the deposition, but denied the request for terminating, issue, and evidentiary sanctions. The judge awarded sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $2,310, which is less than the amount sought by the Defendant. The judge found that the Plaintiff's refusal to appear for the deposition was not justified and that the sanctions were necessary to secure compliance with the court's orders.
