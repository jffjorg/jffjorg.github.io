And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the County of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment or adjudication on Krista Perez's claims for employment discrimination, retaliation, and harassment. The judge finds that the County has failed to meet its initial burden of production to show that Perez has not undergone any adverse employment actions. The judge also finds that the County has not presented any evidence or argument regarding the reasons for the adverse employment actions described by Perez.

The judge notes that Perez has presented evidence creating triable issues of fact as to the discriminatory motive for Sheila Bryant's behavior, including Bryant's treatment of Perez and other Hispanic women employees. The judge finds that this evidence creates a triable issue of fact as to whether Bryant's behavior was motivated by discrimination.

The judge also finds that the County's argument that Perez's supervisor, Bertha Mendez, promptly acted to separate Bryant and Perez and direct that they communicate only by email, and one year later encouraged Bryant to apply for a transfer, creates triable issues as to whether the County is liable for harassment.

The motion is therefore denied, and the case will proceed to trial.
