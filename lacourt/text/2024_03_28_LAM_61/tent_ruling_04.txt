 Case Number:  23STCV20016    Hearing Date:   March 28, 2024    Dept:  61 Plaintiff Larica Fantasia
Jackson’s Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement is GRANTED.
Plaintiff to give notice.
I.                  
MOTION TO
APPROVE SETTLEMENT
Under PAGA, “t[t]he superior
court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil
action filed pursuant to this part. The proposed settlement shall be
submitted to the agency at the same time that it is submitted to the court.” (Lab.
Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)
“[A] trial court should
evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and
adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations,
deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.” (Moniz
v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) 
Federal courts have compared
and contrasted PAGA settlements to class action settlements:
In the class
action context, where PAGA claims often also appear, a district court must
independently determine that a proposed settlement agreement is “fundamentally
fair, adequate and reasonable” before granting approval. [Citations.] However,
as the parties rightly point out and as noted above, this is not a class action
lawsuit, and PAGA claims are intended to serve a decidedly different
purpose-namely to protect the public rather than for the benefit of private
parties. [Citation.] In one recent district court case, the LWDA provided some
guidance regarding court approval of PAGA settlements. [Citations.] In that
case, where both class action and PAGA claims were covered by a proposed
settlement, the LWDA stressed that “when a PAGA claim is settled, the relief
provided for under the PAGA be genuine and meaningful, consistent with the
underlying purpose of the statute to benefit the public and, in the context of
a class action, the court evaluate whether the settlement meets the standards
of being “fundamentally fair, reasonable, and adequate” with reference to the
public policies underlying the PAGA.”
(Salazar, supra, 2017 WL
1135801 at pp. 3–4.) A number of these factors, “including the strength of the
plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding, the complexity and
likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement amount,” have been
recognized as useful in the analysis of PAGA settlements. (Moniz, supra,
72 Cal.App.5th at p. 77.) 
Plaintiff Larica Fantasia Jacko
(Plaintiff) presents the terms of a proposed PAGA settlement here as follows. (Defendant
North Oak Real estate Investments, Inc. (Defendant) agrees to pay a gross
settlement amount of $100,000.00. (Messrelian Decl. Exh. 1, § 3, ¶ 2.)
Plaintiff’s counsel is to be paid from this amount one third, amounting to
$33,333.33, plus expenses of up to $11,290.87. (Id. at § 3, ¶ 6.)
$6,000.00 is apportioned to the settlement administrator, (Id. at § 3, ¶
2), though Plaintiff seeks payment from the settlement of only $5,000.00.
(Motion at p. 9; Messrelian Decl. ¶ 20.)
This leaves a net settlement
amount of $50,375.80. From this amount, 75% ($37,781.85) is to go to the Labor
Workforce Development Agency (LWDA), while 25% ($12,593.95) to be paid to the
aggrieved employees on a pro rata basis, based on the pay periods worked from
October 25, 2021 through August 17, 2023. (Messrelian Decl. Exh. 1, § 3, ¶ 4.)
Defendant’s records indicate approximately 113 workers falling within the
definition of “aggrieved employee” for this action, and 3,225 pay periods split
among them. (Messrelian Decl. ¶ 6.) Assuming each employee worked the same
number of pay periods, the average payment to each employee is $111.44. 
Plaintiff estimates Defendant’s
maximum exposure on Plaintiff’s strongest claims — failure to provide accurate
wage statements and failure to reimburse expenses — of $271,000, i.e. a $100
penalty-per-violation in each available pay period. (Messrelian Decl. ¶ 14.) A
similar maximum exposure existed for Plaintiff’s claims under Labor Code §§ 226
and 2802, based on the limited number of resident managers among the aggrieved
employees. (Ibid.) Defendant advanced arguments showing that resident
managers such as Plaintiff would not have been eligible for meal or rest
breaks, based on length of shift alone. (Ibid.) Plaintiff argues there
is potential danger of an ultimate PAGA decision that would be substantially
lower than these exposure estimates, as the judge may wish to avoid “stacking”
penalties on the same period for multiple violations founded on the same factual
misconduct. (Messrelian Decl. ¶ 15.) Plaintiff also advances the danger of a
court’s discretionary decision to reduce the penalty award. (Messrelian Decl. ¶
16.) 
In light of the above, the
overall settlement amount furthers the purposes of PAGA. The settlement is
reasonable in light of the strength and complexity of Plaintiff’s claims, and
the risks posed by litigation. Plaintiff’s request for fees, representing one
third of the gross settlement amount, is reasonable.. The calculation of
attorney fees from a percentage of a common fund created by a settlement
agreement is a permissible mode of fee calculation. (See Laffitte v. Robert
Half Internat. Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503.)
The motion is therefore
GRANTED.
