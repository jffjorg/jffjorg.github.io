RECORDS SERVED ON CAPITAL ONE

Daniel Torres

PARTY: Plaintiffs Abel Gonzalez, Albert Gonzalez, Jr., and Albert Gonzalez
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
Defendant
requests that the Court quash and/or limit the subpoena for production of
business records from third-party Capital One
 
RULING: Motion
is denied.
 
SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiffs Abel
Gonzalez, Albert Gonzalez, Jr., and Albert Gonzalez (Plaintiffs) were
shareholders of Pueblo Restaurant, Inc., with Defendant Daniel Torres
(Defendant). Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendant took control of the
business and paid out funds to himself and failed to pay the other
shareholders. Plaintiffs discovered that Defendant submitted, approved, and
authorized credit card payments that were subsequently paid by Pueblo. Plaintiffs
are seeking information on those credit card payments, which included 50
payments totaling $270,710.21 to American Express and 25 payments totaling
$54,384 to Capital One. 
 
The business
records subpoenas issued to American Express and Capital One by Plaintiffs were
to discover more information about these payments, including whether they were
payments made for Pueblo or payments made for Defendant personally. The
business records subpoena was served on Capital One and Defendant on September
28, 2023, with the records requested to be provided by October 20, 2023.
 
The requests at
issue are the following:
 
Request No.
1:
Credit Card
Number Unknown; Statements for all Capital One credit card accounts for Daniel
Torres, Pueblo Restaurant, Inc., Casa Torres Wholesale, Palacio Torres, Casa
Torres Banquets, and Casa Torres from January 1, 2018, to September 28, 2023. 
 
Request No.
2: 
Credit Card
Number Unknown; Copies of all checks, money orders, electronic records and
other documents showing the source and manner of each credit card payment for
all credit card accounts of Daniel Torres, Pueblo Restaurant, Inc., Casa Torres
Wholesale, Palacio Torres, Casa Torres Banquets, and Casa Torres from January
1, 2018, to September 28, 2023.
 
Defendant
argues in his motion to quash filed on October 12, 2023, that the requests are
overly broad and not limited in scope; there are privacy concerns involved in
the production; and the documents are not relevant because some seek personal
financial information of Defendant.
 
Plaintiffs
argue in their opposition that Plaintiffs are entitled to learn where their
money is. They also argue that the documents sought are already as limited as
can be given the information available to Plaintiffs. Next, they argue that
Defendant cannot have a privacy interest in the records if he had Pueblo pay
the credit card bills. They also request sanctions against Defendant and his
counsel of record in the amount of $2,000.00.
 
Defendant
reiterates in his reply that the requests are overly broad and should be
limited in scope. Defendant also argues that the information sought is not
relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims. Defendant argues that sanctions are not
appropriate.
 
ANALYSIS
CCP § 1987.1
provides that any witness may make a motion to quash a subpoena and request a
protective order upon reasonable notice. (See Lee v. Swansboro County
Property Owners Assn. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 575, 583.) The Court has broad
authority to quash or modify a subpoena or issue a protective order. (Id.)
In the context of non-party discovery subpoenas, the courts have determined
that requests that are not likely to lead to relevant or admissible evidence,
not specified with reasonable particularity, and require overly burdensome
searches by non-parties are not reasonable. (CCP § 2020; see Calcor Space
Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (Thiem Industries, Inc.) (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 216, 221.)
 
For Defendant’s
relevance argument, it is clearly relevant to Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of
fiduciary duty if he was making credit card payments for his personal credit
cards from Pueblo’s accounts.
 
As for whether
the requests were overly broad, the requests are only for a specific time
period: 2018 to the present. While Plaintiffs’ do not have the credit card
number related to the Capital One payments, they are only seeking information
for Defendant and Pueblo and related entities. Seeking this information would
not burden Defendant; only Capital One would be burdened.
 
Next are
Defendant’s privacy arguments. “California accords privacy the constitutional
status of an inalienable right, on par with defending life and possessing
property. Courts must balance the rights of civil litigants to discover
relevant facts against privacy interests of persons subject to discovery.” (California
Constitution, Article I, §1; Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d
833, 239.) “A showing of relevancy may be enough to cause the court to balance
the compelling public need for discovery against the fundamental right of
privacy.” (Mendez v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 557, 567.)
However, the balance will favor for confidential information in third party
personnel files unless the litigant can show a compelling need for the
particular documents and that the information cannot reasonably be obtained
through depositions or from nonconfidential sources….” (Life Technologies
Corp v. Superior Court (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 640, 652-653.)
 
Plaintiffs have
demonstrated that the information sought is relevant to their breach of
fiduciary duty cause of action. The information sought regarding the credit
card payments from Pueblo’s account can only be obtained through Defendant or Capital
One. Plaintiffs have a compelling need for this information because it could
establish Defendant’s liability for the breach of fiduciary duty cause of
action and demonstrate that Defendant was using Pueblo’s credit cards for his
own personal use.
 
The Court
denies Defendant’s motion to quash the business record subpoenas. Plaintiffs
have demonstrated that the information sought is relevant and not overly broad,
and Plaintiffs’ compelling need for the information outweighs Defendant’s
privacy concerns.
 
CCP § 2025.410
allows for the imposition of sanctions when a party unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to quash without substantial justification. Plaintiffs have
requested $2,000.00 in sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of
record for Defendant’s unsuccessful motion to quash. The Court finds that
Defendant did not act with substantial justification in filing the motion to
quash. However, because this motion is substantially similar to Defendant’s
other motion to quash, the Court will only grant sanctions in the amount of
$800.00.
 
Defendant’s
motion to quash the subpoena of business of records from Capital One is denied.
Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record are ordered to pay sanctions in the
amount of $800.00 to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days.
