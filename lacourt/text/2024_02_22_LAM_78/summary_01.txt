And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Epps & Coulson, LLP to Kevin Voong's Answer to their Cross-Complaint. The case is about legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. The Court sustains the demurrer as to every affirmative defense but the first affirmative defense with leave to amend. The first affirmative defense alleges that the Cross-Complaint does not contain facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against him. The Court overrules the demurrer to this defense. The other affirmative defenses, including those alleging damages caused by the acts or omissions of others, comparative fault, intervening and superseding cause, and waiver of relief, are insufficiently pled and the demurrer is sustained. The Court also sustains the demurrer to Voong's Answer as to all but the first affirmative defense with leave to amend.
