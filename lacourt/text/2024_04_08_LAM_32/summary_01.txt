And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is on two motions: a motion by the Defendants to file a cross-complaint and a motion by the Plaintiffs to reopen discovery. The Judge grants the Defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, finding that it is a compulsory cross-claim and that the Defendants acted in good faith. The Judge also grants the Plaintiffs' motion to reopen discovery, but limits the discovery to the new claims raised in the cross-complaint. The Judge notes that the parties will be free to test the merits of the cross-claims through subsequent motions.
