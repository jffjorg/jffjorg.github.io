Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to amend the existing protective order in a case involving WG Holdings SPV, LLC (WGH) and Triton LA, LLC et al. The case was initiated by WGH for breach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract, interference, and fraud. The parties have previously cross-complained against each other, and there is a settlement agreement in place. However, the parties are currently engaged in similar litigation in Texas.

The judge finds good cause to amend the protective order to allow for the use of covered information in the Texas litigation. This would prevent the parties in the Texas litigation from having to re-conduct discovery on similar claims and would therefore mitigate unnecessary burden and expense. Since there is no opposition to the motion, the judge grants the motion to amend the protective order.
