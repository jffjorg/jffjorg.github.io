And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Chervine Razmazma, Travis Alexander, Kevin Williams, Tony Tawil, and Brennan Balzi, have filed a demurrer to the plaintiff, Bartolomeo Ruspoli's, second amended complaint. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the complaint's allegations against the defendants personally. The court has sustained the demurrer, giving the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint. The plaintiff may not add new parties or causes of action without permission from the court. The court's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff's complaint does not provide sufficient facts to support an alter ego theory, which would allow the court to pierce the corporate veil and hold the defendants personally liable. The plaintiff must provide specific facts to support this theory and must also identify the exact nature of the claims against each defendant.
