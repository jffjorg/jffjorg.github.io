And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' petition to compel arbitration and dismiss the action. The defendants requested arbitration based on a provision in the Los Angeles Rams season ticket holder license agreement that states all disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs' claims, which include allegations of assault, battery, and false arrest, are not within the scope of the arbitration agreement. The judge concluded that the agreement only covers disputes arising from the license agreement itself, such as breach of contract, and not claims of physical violence. The judge also cited a previous case, RN Solution, Inc. v. Catholic Healthcare West, in which the court found it would be an extreme semantic stretch to claim that a party's battery-related claims against another party bear a significant relationship to the contract. Therefore, the judge denied the defendants' petition and allowed the case to proceed.
