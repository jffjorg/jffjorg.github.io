And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend the answer filed by the defendant, Doe 1, in the case of R. J. vs. Doe 1. The defendant seeks to add an affirmative defense under Education Code section 44808, which precludes liability for conduct that occurred off the school site. The defendant filed its answer on June 22, 2022, and subsequently learned of the alleged abuse during the deposition of the plaintiff on August 8, 2023. The defendant discovered that the plaintiff alleges the abuse occurred both on and off campus. The defendant has complied with the court's rules by providing a copy of the proposed amended answer and explaining why the amendment is necessary and proper. The court exercises its discretion liberally in favor of amendments and grants the unopposed motion for leave to file an amended answer. The defendant is ordered to file the amended answer as a separate document within 10 days of the order.
