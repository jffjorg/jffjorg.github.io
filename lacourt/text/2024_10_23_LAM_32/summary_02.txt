Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a lawsuit filed by Justin Smith against Alla Zorikova, Olivia Jeong, and Joycelyn Yew. The complaint alleges that the defendants ran an illegal dog breeding operation and made false representations about the puppies they sold. The defendants filed demurrers to the complaint, which the court has partially sustained and partially overruled. The court has also granted the defendants' motion to quash a subpoena issued to Airbnb, Inc. The ruling addresses various legal issues, including the sufficiency of the pleadings, the applicability of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) and the Unfair Competition Law (UCL), and the requirements for pleading fraud.
