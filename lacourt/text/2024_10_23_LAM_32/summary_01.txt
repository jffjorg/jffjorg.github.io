And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel deposition filed by Plaintiff Ester Fishman against Defendant Marcus Fishman. The case concerns a quiet title action, where Plaintiff is seeking to claim legal title to two subject properties. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant was abusive and controlling during their marriage, and that Defendant's undue influence and coercion led to Plaintiff granting title to the properties to both herself and Defendant. Defendant has refused to be deposed in person, citing a medical condition that makes it difficult for him to travel. The Judge finds that Defendant's medical condition warrants a remote deposition, and that an in-person deposition would cause undue burden. Therefore, the deposition is ordered to take place remotely, and Defendant is expected to refrain from any obstructive behavior during the deposition.
