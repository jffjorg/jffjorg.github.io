Summary:

The Judge rejects the plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration clause is invalid due to fraudulent inducement, breach of contract, and the operation of the Hammer Clause. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's desire for public exposure and accountability does not justify avoiding arbitration. The Judge orders the case to be stayed in its entirety pending the outcome of arbitration.
