MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff
 
            RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants Michael Theodore and Casa
Theodore, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises out of a dispute over the
enforcement of a money judgment. The currently operative fourth amended
complaint (the “4AC”) alleges: (1) statutory voidable transfers; and (2) common
law voidable transfers.  
 
            
 
            On September 19, 2023, the Court issued an order
directing Defendants to provide further responses to Requests for Production
(“RFPs”), Set Five.  On November 20,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses (the “Motion”) on
the grounds that Defendants’ responses to the RFPs remain inadequate. 
 
DISCUSSION
Under
California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 2031.310, a motion to
compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents
may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2)
inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3)
unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(CCP § 2031.310, subd. (c).)  A
motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.  (See CCP § 2031.310 subd. (b)(1); Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216,
234-35.)  To establish good cause, a
discovery proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of consequence in the
action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or
disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or
disprove the fact.  (Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)  
 
A
representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search
and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand.  (CCP § 2031.230.)  This statement shall also specify whether the
inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party.  (Id.)  The statement shall set forth the name and
address of any natural person or organization known or believed by that party
to have possession, custody, or control of that item or category of item.  (Id.) 

 
As a
preliminary matter, the Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has
been satisfied. 
 
The
supplemental responses Defendants provided on October 10, 2023 state that
Defendants were unable to comply with the RFPs because the responsive documents
had been lost (with respect to RFP numbers 234-251) or never existed (with
respect to RFP numbers 252-257).  (See
Declaration of Lyle R. Mink (“Mink Decl.”) ¶ 11, Exhibit 2.)  The RFPs request bank records, tax returns,
and Reports of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (“FBARs”).  (See Mink Decl., Exhibit 1.)[1]
 
With regard
to the RFPs whose supplemental responses state that the documents have been
lost, Defendants’ statements of compliance do not list information about
individuals or organizations known or believed to have possession, custody, or
control of the requested documents—which, based on the types of documents
requested, likely include the IRS and Defendants’ banking institutions.  It is unclear if Defendants have requested
responsive tax documents from the IRS.  (See
Mink Decl., Exhibit 4 at p. 3.) 
Defendants’ responses to the RFPs requesting bank records likewise fail
to identify the financial institutions that may have custody, possession, or
control over the relevant documents.  As
a result, the Court agrees that Defendants’ responses contain inadequate
statements of compliance.  The Court
therefore GRANTS the Motion in part and orders Defendants to provide further
supplemental responses to RFP numbers 234-251 within 20 days of the date of
this order.  
 
Monetary Sanctions
            In
connection with the Motion, Plaintiff requests $4,061.65 in monetary
sanctions.  This amount represents: (1)
three hours preparing the moving papers at a rate of $500 per hour; (2) an
anticipated two hours drafting reply papers and three hours preparing for the
hearing; and (3) a filing fee of $61.65. 
(Mink Decl. ¶ 13.)
 
The
Court exercises its discretion and awards Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the
reasonable amount of $1,061.65, which represents two hours preparing the moving
papers at a rate of $500 per hour and $61.65 in filing fees.  (Moran v. Oso Valley Greenbelt Assn.
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1034.) 
Defendants and counsel are jointly responsible for paying this amount
within 20 days of the date of this order. 

 
             Moving party is
ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
