Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to compel further responses filed by Plaintiff Kyle Madison. The motion is brought on the grounds that Defendants Michael Theodore and Casa Theodore, Inc. failed to provide adequate responses to Requests for Production (RFPs). The Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has been satisfied.

The Court finds that Defendants' supplemental responses state that responsive documents had been lost or never existed, but fail to identify individuals or organizations known or believed to have possession, custody, or control of the requested documents. As a result, the Court agrees that Defendants' responses contain inadequate statements of compliance.

The Court grants the motion in part and orders Defendants to provide further supplemental responses to RFP numbers 234-251 within 20 days of the date of this order.

Additionally, the Court awards Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,061.65, which represents two hours preparing the moving papers at a rate of $500 per hour and $61.65 in filing fees.
