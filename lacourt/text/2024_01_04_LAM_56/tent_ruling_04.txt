It is an unlawful employment practice to fail to reasonably accommodate a
person’s religious practice unless the employer demonstrates that it has
explored reasonable alternative means of accommodating the religious belief or
observance.  (Gov. Code § 12940, subd.
(j).)  The employee must show that: he or
she had a bona fide religious belief that the employer knew conflicted with an
employment requirement; (2) the employer did not explore means to reasonably
accommodate the religious belief or practice; and (3) the failure to
accommodate resulted in an adverse employment action.  (See Soldinger v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.
(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 345, 369-71.)
