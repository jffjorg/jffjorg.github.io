[TENTATIVE] DENYING MOTION TO SET ASIDE/VACATE
  DISMISSAL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 7, 2024



 
On January 18, 2022, Plaintiff
Harry Jones filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant Cobalt Construction
Company.  The Court entered default against
Defendant on June 7, 2022.
On July 29,
2022 and April 11, 2023 the Court denied Plaintiff’s requests for entry of default
judgment without prejudice.  The April 11,
2023 Order also stated: “If the Plaintiff is unable to obtain a Default Judgment,
the Court may Dismiss the action.  (See Code
of Civil Procedure §§583.410, 583.420, subd.[a][2][B]; California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1340[a].)”
On September
19, 2023, the Court again denied Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment.  The Court also ordered the action dismissed without
prejudice.  The Court noted: “The Plaintiff
has filed multiple applications for entry of Default Judgment, but he has made no
effort at all to amend the application consistent with the Court’s prior orders.  The Court provided detailed directions on what
required amendment, but the Plaintiff made no amendments addressing these deficiencies.”
On March 15,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal.

The Court may relieve a party or counsel from a judgment
resulting from mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  The application for relief must be made within
a reasonable time, not to exceed six months, after the judgment.  (Ibid.)  “Section 473 is often applied liberally where
the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the motion
will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted. 
[Citations.]  In such situations ‘very
slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting aside the default.’  [Citation.]” 
(Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233 (Elston).)
Plaintiff
asserts that he “has amended the Default Judgment packet in accordance with the
Minute Orders each time, yet it was rejected each time for the same issues that
Plaintiff had fixed.  It is clear that the
Court failed to consider Plaintiff’s revisions. 
Plaintiff had made changes in order to rectify the Court’s demands, and thus
an inference of unreasonable delay on the part of Plaintiff is improper, as Plaintiff
simply did as he was told.”  (Motion at p.
6.)  This is incorrect.  Both the April 11, 2023 and September 19, 2023
Orders noted that the requests were “not significantly different from the prior
requests,” and they specifically refer to some of the items and evidence being deficient
for the same reasons noted in prior orders. 
Plaintiff also unreasonably delayed filing his amended requests.  Plaintiff filed one request on June 7, 2022, the
same day as the Case Management Conference. 
His next request was filed on July 27, 2022, only two days before an OSC
re: Entry of Default Judgment.  Plaintiff
filed another request after 8:00 p.m. on November 1, 2022, the night before another
8:30 a.m. OSC.  Plaintiff’s final request
was filed after 5:00 p.m. on July 17, 2023, again on the eve of an 8:30 a.m. OSC.
Plaintiff
argues that he was not given proper notice that the action may be dismissed, citing
Reid v. Balter (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1193 (Reid).  (Motion at p. 7.)  In that case, the court gave the plaintiffs written
notice of a May 1989 trial setting conference, and the notice also stated that if
the case was more than two years old, it would be dismissed if the plaintiffs or
counsel failed to appear for the trial setting conference.  (Reid, supra, 14 Cal.App.4th at p. 1193.)  When the plaintiffs later failed to appear for
an October 1989 status conference, the trial court dismissed the action.  (See ibid.)  The Court of Appeal determined that the plaintiffs
did not have notice of possible dismissal if they failed to appear at the October
1989 status conference because the order that was issued after the May 1989 trial
setting conference “specifically stated which sanctions might be imposed for failure
to appear at the October 1989 status conference, and dismissal of the action was
not one of them.”  (Id. at pp.
1193-1194.)  “Thus, not only was the sanctions
notice for the May 1989 hearing not sufficient for the subsequent October 1989 hearing,
but the notice given for that later hearing implied that dismissal of the case was
not a possible sanction for failure to attend it.”  (Id. at p. 1194.)
Here,
Plaintiff had notice in the April 11, 2023 Order that if he was unable to obtain
a default judgment by the July 18, 2023 OSC, the Court may dismiss the action.  Plaintiff submitted his request on July 17, which
was too late for the Court to review before the July 18 OSC.  The request that the Court denied on September
19, 2023 was the same request that Plaintiff submitted in response to the April
11 Order for the July 18 OSC.  The September
19 dismissal was based on Plaintiff’s failure to obtain a default judgment by the
July 18, 2023 OSC (or by the time the Court reviewed the papers submitted for that
OSC), as warned in the April 11, 2023 Order.
Although only “very slight evidence” is required to set
aside the dismissal (Elston, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 233), Plaintiff provides
no evidence at all.  Counsel’s
declaration only sets forth this case’s timeline and the Court’s Orders.  It does not make any showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.
The
motion to set aside/vacate dismissal is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
