And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is to sustain the demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action. The judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations are entirely uncertain and do not provide the defendant with facts sufficient to build a legal defense. The judge also grants the motion to strike the injunctive relief, meaning that the plaintiff's request for an injunction against the cast and crew of "American Dad!" is denied. Additionally, the judge denies the motion for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction with prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff's request for an injunction is denied and cannot be re-filed. The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court.
