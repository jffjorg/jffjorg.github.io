The court has tentatively ruled on the demurrer to the entire complaint and has sustained it without leave to amend. The court finds that the complaint is uncertain and lacks a legal basis for the alleged threats and violations of civil rights. The court also grants the Motion to Strike an incorrectly filed document. The court notes that the plaintiff has filed multiple complaints and amended complaints, and that the defendant has adequately met its requirement to meet and confer with the plaintiff. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are entirely uncertain and do not provide a legal basis for the alleged claims.
