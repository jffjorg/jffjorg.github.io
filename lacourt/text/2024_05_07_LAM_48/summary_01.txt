And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

This is a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The Plaintiff, Harry Jones, filed a first amended complaint against the Defendant, Cobalt Construction Company, on January 18, 2022. The Court entered default against the Defendant on June 7, 2022. The Plaintiff's requests for entry of default judgment were denied on July 29, 2022 and April 11, 2023. The Plaintiff failed to amend the application consistently with the Court's prior orders and unreasonably delayed filing amended requests. The Court notified the Plaintiff of the possible dismissal of the action on April 11, 2023, and the Plaintiff failed to obtain a default judgment by the July 18, 2023 deadline. The Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal is DENIED because the Plaintiff failed to provide any evidence of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
