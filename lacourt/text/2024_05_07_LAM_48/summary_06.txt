And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses from the defendant. The plaintiff, Ciro R. Pineda, filed two motions to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Form Interrogatories, and Special Interrogatories. However, the motions were filed 11 or 13 days after the deadline, which is untimely. The court has no jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the motions. The plaintiff is ordered to pay one additional filing fee within 10 days.
