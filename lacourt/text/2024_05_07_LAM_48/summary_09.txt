And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the entire complaint without leave to amend. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not set forth facts sufficient to allege a cause of action and that the complaint is uncertain and does not provide a legal basis for the plaintiff's allegations. The court agrees that the plaintiff's allegations are entirely uncertain and do not provide Disney with facts sufficient to build a legal defense. The court also notes that the plaintiff's claims are without legal merit and that the defendant has adequately met its requirement to meet and confer with the plaintiff.
