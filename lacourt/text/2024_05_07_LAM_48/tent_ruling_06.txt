[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTIONS TO COMPEL
  FURTHER RESPONSES
 
Dept. 48

On
February 16, 2024, Plaintiff Ciro R. Pineda filed two motions to compel Defendant
Los Angeles Unified School District’s further responses to Requests for Production
of Documents, Form Interrogatories, and Special Interrogatories.
A.        Plaintiff Must Pay One Additional Filing
Fee.
Each
category of discovery (Requests for Production of Documents, Form Interrogatories,
and Special Interrogatories) should have been filed as a separate motion, with separate
filing fees and hearing reservations.  Despite
being scheduled as only two motions and two hearings, the total substance is that
of three motions.  This unfairly allows Plaintiff
to take only two hearing reservations (instead of three) and results in an inaccurate
projection and accounting of the Court’s workload, inconveniencing both the Court
and other litigants.   All parties are ordered
not to do this again and are warned that continued action of this type may result
in monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5.
Plaintiff
is ORDERED to pay one additional filing fee within 10 days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Payment of Additional Filing Fee is scheduled for
May 22, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
B.        The Motions Are Untimely.
In
the absence of a written agreement between the parties, a motion to compel further
responses to RFPs, interrogatories, and RFAs must be filed within 45 days after
the insufficient response.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290, subd. (c).)  This deadline is jurisdictional and “renders the
court without authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.”  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
1403, 1409-1410.)
On
December 22, 2023, Defendant served its responses to Plaintiff’s first set of discovery,
triggering a motion to compel deadline of February 5, 2024.  (Majerus Decl. ¶ 5.)  Defendant calculates the deadline as February
7, 2024 after adding two days for electronic service.  (Opposition at p. 4.)
On
January 30, 2024, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter to Defendant and requested
further responses by February 5, 2024 (the day that Plaintiff believed was the
deadline to file his motions), also indicating that “[i]f the time frame poses an
issue, please feel free to reach out to discuss mutual extensions of time to respond
and for Plaintiff to file a motion to compel further responses.”  (Majerus Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 1.)
On
Monday, February 5, 2024 at 11:05 p.m., Defendant’s counsel responded that she was
unable to provide a response that day, but she would “review the letter and provide
a response by the end of the week.”  (Majerus
Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. 2.)  On Friday, February
9, 2024, Defendant’s counsel responded that “it appears that the time for any Motion
to Compel has expired.”  (Majerus Decl. ¶
8 & Ex. 3.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel may have believed that the motion to compel deadline would be extended to
“the end of the following week” (Majerus Decl. ¶ 7), but there was no actual written
agreement to extend the filing deadline. 
These motions, filed on February 16, 2024—eleven or thirteen days after the
deadline—are untimely.
The
Court has no jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the motions.
The
motions are DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
