  CASE NO.: 23STCV11392
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING WITHOUT
  LEAVE TO AMEND DEFENDANTS’ DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO
  STRIKE INCORRECTLY FILED DOCUMENT FROM JUNE 2, 2023
 
 
Dept. 48

May 7, 2024



 
On May 22, 2023, Plaintiff Dylan
Scott Perry (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Walt Disney
Company (“Defendant”). On June 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint titled as “Petition for Threats made by The Walt Disney Company.” The
Complaint alleges that The Walt Disney Company used its show “American Dad!” to
threaten to murder him, his father, and his girlfriend. 
On
June 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a pre-objection to opponent’s demurrer. 
On
June 23, 2023, Defendant The Walt Disney Company dba Twentieth Century Studios
filed the Demurrer. Disney notes that Twentieth Century Studios is not a dba of
The Walt Disney Company but rather a subsidiary. Nevertheless, although Disney
is not the correct entity, the demurrer applies equally to its subsidiary and
Disney. On June 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed his Opposition. On July 21, 2023,
Defendant filed its Reply. On April 30, 2024, Defendant filed a supplemental
reply (originally filed in 23STCV15449).
On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint, incorrectly titled
“First Amended Complaint” without leave of Court. Therefore, the Court on its
own motion strikes this Second Amended Complaint and analyzes the demurrer on
its merits as to the First Amended Complaint. 
DISCUSSION
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. 
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)  A
special demurrer for uncertainty under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f) is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is
so bad that defendant or plaintiff cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him or her. 
(Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)  Even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.”  (Ibid.)
A complaint must contain “facts
constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.” Code Civ.
Proc. § 425.10(a)(1).  When a demurrer is
sustained, we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. [Citation.] And when it is sustained without
leave to amend, we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the
defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial court has abused its
discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of discretion, and
we affirm. 
(Zelig v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, (2002) 27 Cal. 4th 1112,
1126, 45 P.3d 1171, 1180.)
A.
       Plaintiff Fails to Assert Facts
Sufficient to Constitute a Viable Cause of Action
Defendant
generally and specifically demurs to Plaintiff’s entire complaint on the basis
that (1) the First Amended Complaint is uncertain pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.10(f); and (2) the First Amended Complaint fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.10(e). 
Plaintiff
generally alleges that Defendant Disney used the animated television series American
Dad! to send him coded death threats, stalked, and broke into his
apartment. (First Amended Complaint at p.1.) The First Amended Complaint
further alleges that Defendant caused his intentional emotional distress and
violated his civil rights.  (Id.
at pp. 1-2.)  As such, Plaintiff demands
$26.1 billion in restitution, $840.00 in monetary damages for hotel costs
because he has been “staying in a hotel under an alias, with no phone or
computer out of fear of being tracked down and killed.”  (Id. at 2.)  Plaintiff also prays for punitive damages because
his civil rights were violated.  (Id.
at p. 3.)
Defendant
Disney argues Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is so uncertain as to be
unintelligible and that Disney cannot make enough sense of Plaintiff’s
allegations to defend itself.  (Demurrer
at p. 2.)  Disney further argues that
Plaintiff does not allege any cause of action or plead facts to provide a legal
basis to support his claim of civil rights violations.  (Id. at p. 2-4.)
Defendant also notes that
Plaintiff has filed a total of three actions against Defendant The Walt Disney
Company raising the same allegations of threats communicated through the
cartoon series American Dad!: 23STCV11392 (filed May 22, 2023), 23STCP01900 (filed
June 1, 2023), and 23STCV15449 (filed July 3, 2023), after Disney filed its
Demurrers to the first two actions). In light of Plaintiff’s multiple filings,
Disney respectfully suggests that the Court invoke Code of Civil Procedure
sections 391 et seq. and consider Plaintiff Dylan Scott Perry a vexatious
litigant going forward. (Supplemental Reply p.2.)
The Court finds Plaintiff has not
set forth facts sufficient to allege a cause of action.  Plaintiff does not provide a legal basis for
his allegations and does not assert facts that could support such basis, even
if Plaintiff had provided one.  Moreover,
the Court agrees that Plaintiff’s allegations are entirely uncertain and do not
provide Disney with facts sufficient to build a legal defense.  It is not clear what causes of action
Plaintiff is asserting.  Further,
Defendants have adequately met their requirement to meet and confer with
Plaintiff.  (Fenzel Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.) 
Thus,
the Court sustains the demurrer as to the entire complaint without leave to
amend.
MOTION TO STRIKE 
            On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the Motion to Strike. As of May 3, 2024, Defendant did  not file an Opposition. 
            Plaintiff seeks to strike the
incorrectly filed Amended Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum for the related Case
23STCP01900 filed on June 2, 2023. 
According
to Code of Civil Procedure § 436:  The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: 
 (a)
Strikeout any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. 
(b)
Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. 
A.        Plaintiff’s Motion is Improper
The
Court finds that Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike has multiple deficiencies. For
instance, Plaintiff fails to provide a Memorandum of Points and Authorities.
Instead, Plaintiff only states “I meant to throw it in the garbage but it got
mixed in with my filing papers.” 
Although
the moving papers are deficient, the Court in its own discretion strikes the incorrectly
filed document which relates to Case 23STCP01900. 
CONCLUSION
The
is Motion to Strike is GRANTED. 
The
demurrer to the entire First Amended Complaint is also SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Court
to give notice of ruling.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
