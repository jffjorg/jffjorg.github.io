And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants in part Plaintiff's motion for a protective order and denies Defendant's motion to strike answer. The court finds that Plaintiff's counsel's conduct during the deposition was highly inappropriate and unethical. The court orders Plaintiff's counsel to cease such behavior and pay sanctions of $2,100.00 to the Defendant. The court also grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further deposition testimony, ordering the Defendant to produce documents and answer questions within 30 days. The court denies the motion to strike the Defendant's answer, as the court previously vacated the default and permitted the Defendant to file an answer.
