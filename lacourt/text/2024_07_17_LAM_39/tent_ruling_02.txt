[1]As
the California Supreme Court noted, and as is reflected in this court’s contemporaneous
ruling on Plaintiffs’ motion to bifurcate and for expedited trial and its July
12, 2024 ruling on Defendant’s motion to quash,  the Massachusetts case does not divest
California of jurisdiction, as Plaintiffs remain free to litigate this action
“unless and until [Defendant] demonstrates to the Los Angeles County Superior
Court that any . . . judgment [in the Massachusetts case] is binding on the
parties. . . . [P]otentially conflicting judgments naturally result from
parallel proceedings but do not provide a reason for issuing a TRO.”  (Advanced Bionics, supra, 29
Cal.4th at p. 708.)
