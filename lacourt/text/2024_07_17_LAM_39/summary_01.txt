And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for a preliminary injunction filed by Michael Z. Hermalyn and FVP, LLC against DraftKings, Inc. The motion sought to prevent DraftKings from enforcing non-compete and non-solicitation clauses in Hermalyn's employment agreements. The judge found that the Massachusetts court has already issued a preliminary injunction against Hermalyn, enjoining him from using and disclosing confidential information and from soliciting Defendant's employees for a 12-month period. Therefore, any injunction in this case would necessarily have the effect of enjoining the Massachusetts court's proceedings. The judge also noted that the Plaintiffs' ex parte application for a temporary restraining order stated that Hermalyn was not seeking to enjoin Defendant's federal court action in Massachusetts, but the Defendant's subsequent preliminary injunction in Massachusetts suggests that the Plaintiffs may be seeking to enjoin the Massachusetts court's proceedings. The judge concluded that the motion is denied, and the Plaintiffs are ordered to provide notice of this order and file proof of service of such.
