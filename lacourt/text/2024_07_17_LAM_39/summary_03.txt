And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24STCV02694B, regarding a motion to bifurcate and set an expedited trial. The Plaintiffs, Michael Z. Hermalyn and FVP, LLC, move to bifurcate their declaratory relief claim from their claim for injunctive relief and expedite the trial, while the Defendant, DraftKings, Inc., opposes the motion. The Judge denies the motion to bifurcate, finding that the claims rest on the same facts and that trying them separately would result in significant duplication of effort. However, the Judge grants the motion for an expedited trial, finding that a speedy trial is necessary under the circumstances. The trial is set for August 27, 2024, at 9:30 a.m., with a final status conference on August 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
