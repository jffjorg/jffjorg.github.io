Defendant DraftKings, Inc.



 
MOTION
            Plaintiffs
Michael Z. Hermalyn (“Hermalyn”) and FVP, LLC (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move
to bifurcate the declaratory relief claim and set it for an expedited trial.  Defendant DraftKings, Inc. (“Defendant”) opposes
the motion.
ANALYSIS
Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 598, “The court may, when the convenience of witnesses,
the ends of justice, or the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation
would be promoted thereby . . . make an order . . . that the trial of any issue
or any part thereof shall precede the trial of any other issue or any part
thereof in the case[.]”  (Code Civ. Proc., 
§ 598.)  The court sees no reason
to bifurcate Plaintiffs’ declaratory relief claim from their claim for
injunctive relief under Business and Professions Code section 16600.5, and
Plaintiffs’ claim under Business and Professions Code section 17200.  The claims rest on the same facts.  Trying the claims separately would, therefore,
result in significant duplication of effort. 
Accordingly, the motion to bifurcate is denied.
However, the court
grants Plaintiffs’ motion for an expedited trial.  The governing statute in this case is Code of
Civil Procedure section 1062.3, which provides that in a case in which a
plaintiff seeks declaratory relief along with other claims, the court may grant
precedence to trial “upon noticed motion and a showing that the action requires
a speedy trial.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1062.3, subd. (b).)  
The court
concludes a speedy trial is necessary under the circumstances.  If the court does not grant Plaintiffs’
motion for a speedy trial, the issue of whether the one-year restriction on
Hermalyn’s employment is enforceable will become moot.  Extensive discovery is unlikely to be
necessary, as Defendant concedes it has already obtained substantial evidence
in the DraftKings Inc. v. Hermalyn (D.Mass. 2024, No. 1:24-cv-10299) case,
and many key facts are apparently undisputed. 
Further, all of Plaintiffs’ claims are triable to the court rather than to
a jury, which streamlines trial preparation. 

Defendant contends
Plaintiffs’ motion does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1335.  The court disagrees.  As Plaintiffs assert, references to submitted
declarations and other pleadings on file in this matter are sufficient for the
court to find good cause for specially setting a trial date pursuant to rule 3.1335.
Given the court’s July
12, 2024 ruling on Defendant’s motion to quash, the court anticipates the case
will be at issue within the next six weeks. 
Accordingly, the court sets the trial in Department 39 on August 27,
2024 at 9:30 a.m. and schedules a final status conference on August 16, 2024 at
8:30 a.m.
Plaintiffs are to
give notice of this order and file proof of service thereof.
