MOTION
Defendant Homeboy
Industries (“Defendant”) demurs to the complaint of Plaintiff Jose Sevilla
(“Plaintiff”).  Plaintiff has not opposed
the motion. 
ANALYSIS
“It is black
letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) In
ruling on a demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[]” the allegations of
the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.” (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendant
hired Plaintiff to work in its 18-month training program.  He further alleges his case manager did not
like him and harassed him until he was wrongfully terminated.  (Complaint, p. 1.)  In a complaint, “[e]ach separately stated
cause of action . . . must specifically state: [¶] (1) Its number (e.g., “first
cause of action”); [¶] (2) Its nature (e.g., “for fraud”); [¶] (3) The party
asserting it if more than one party is represented on the pleading (e.g., “by
plaintiff Jones”); and [¶] (4) The party or parties to whom it is directed
(e.g., “against defendant Smith”).” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.112.)  
Plaintiff does not
separately state or label each cause of action or list the parties against whom
he asserts them.  As such, Plaintiff’s complaint
is uncertain.  The demurrer to the complaint
is, therefore, sustained with leave to amend. 
Plaintiff is to file an amended complaint within 10 days of notice of
this order.
Defendant is
ordered to provide notice of this order and to file a proof of service thereof.
