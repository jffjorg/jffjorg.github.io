MOTION
Plaintiffs Michael
Z. Hermalyn (“Hermalyn”) and FVP, LLC (“Fanatics,” collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
move for a preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs
seek a preliminary injunction to preclude Defendant DraftKings Inc.
(“Defendant”) from attempting to enforce any non-competition or
non-solicitation provision in any agreements between Hermalyn and Defendant, or
attempting to disrupt the employment relationship between Hermalyn and
Fanatics.  Defendant opposes the
motion.  
ANALYSIS
To obtain a preliminary
injunction, a plaintiff ordinarily is required to present evidence of the
irreparable injury or interim harm that it will suffer if an injunction is not
issued pending an adjudication of the merits. . . .  If the threshold requirement of irreparable
injury is established, then we must examine two interrelated factors to
determine whether the trial court's decision to issue a preliminary injunction
should be upheld: “(1) the likelihood that the moving party will ultimately
prevail on the merits and (2) the relative interim harm to the parties from
issuance or nonissuance of the injunction.” 
(Costa Mesa City Employees' Assn. v. City of Costa Mesa (2012)
209 Cal.App.4th 298, 305-306, internal quotations and citations omitted.)  
Plaintiffs are
likely to prevail on the merits of this case. 
(See Application Group v. Hunter Group (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 881,
894.)  Under Business and Professions
Code section  16600, “every contract by
which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or
business of any kind is to that extent void.”  (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16600.)  A former employee may sue for injunctive
relief to enjoin enforcement of a covenant not to compete.  (Bus. & Prof. Code  §§ 16600, 16600.5.)  
However, Defendant
sued Hermalyn in DraftKings Inc. v. Hermalyn (D.Mass. 2024, No.
1:24-cv-10299) (“the Massachusetts case”) to enforce Hermalyn’s agreement not
to compete with Defendant.  The Court
cannot enjoin that action.  “A parallel
action in a different state presents sovereignty concerns that compel
California courts to use judicial restraint when determining whether they may
properly issue [injunctive relief] against parties pursuing an action in a
foreign jurisdiction.”  (Advanced
Bionics Corp. v. Medtronic, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 697, 707 (Advanced
Bionics).)  “[E]njoining proceedings
in another state requires an exceptional circumstance that outweighs the threat
to judicial restraint and comity principles.” 
(Id. at 708.)  
In their ex parte application
for a temporary restraining order filed on February 20, 2024,  Plaintiffs stated Hermalyn was not seeking to enjoin
Defendant from pursuing its federal court action in Massachusetts and only sought
relief in this action that would protect his rights in California.  (See Ex Parte Application for TRO and OSC Re
Preliminary Injunction Feb. 20, 2024), p. 25, fn. 6.)  Plaintiffs asserts the court at the February
22, 2024 hearing of that ex parte application rejected the notion Plaintiffs
sought to enjoin Defendant in the Massachusetts case.  But, on April 30, 2024, Defendant obtained a
preliminary injunction against Hermalyn in that matter enjoining him from using
and disclosing any confidential information and, for a 12-month period commencing
on February 1, 2024, from directly or indirectly soliciting Defendant’s employees
and providing services to a competing business. 

Therefore, any injunction
against Defendant in this case would necessarily have the effect of enjoining  the proceedings in the Massachusetts case.  It is unclear what Plaintiffs seek to enjoin
other than to prevent Defendant from enforcing the noncompete and
nonsolicitation clauses in Hermalyn’s employment agreements which the Massachusetts
court has determined to be enforceable.  
Accordingly, the
motion is denied.[1]
Plaintiffs are
ordered to provide notice of this order and file proof of service of such.
