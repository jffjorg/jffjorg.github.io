And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants, in part, Plaintiff David Kermani's motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $10,865. The motion was unopposed. The ruling is based on the terms of the commercial lease agreement and the guaranty, which provide for the award of attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. The court finds that Plaintiff is a prevailing party due to the judgment entered in his favor against Defendant Cory Rooney. The court awards Plaintiff his reasonable attorneys' fees, which include fees for services provided by Behzad Nahai, Esq. and Jeffrey Lewiston, Esq. The court deducts the fee for reviewing the opposition, preparing a reply, and appearing at the hearing from the total amount requested.
