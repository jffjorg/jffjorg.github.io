APPLICATION
 
Jennifer B. Sokoler (“Counsel”) has filed an application to appear as
counsel pro hac vice for Defendants the University of California, Los Angeles
and The Regents of the University of California, Los Angeles
(“Defendants”).  The application is unopposed.
 
The Court continued the hearing to permit Counsel to demonstrate
service of the application by mail on the State Bar at its San Francisco office.
 
ANALYSIS
 
            California Rules of Court rule 9.40
provides that an attorney in good standing in another jurisdiction may apply to
appear as counsel pro hac vice in the State of California by filing a verified
application together with proof of service by mail of a copy of the application
and notice of hearing on all parties who have appeared in the case and on the
State Bar of California at its San Francisco office, with payment of a $50.00
fee, so long as that attorney is not a resident of the State of California, and
is not regularly engaged in substantial business, professional, or other
activities in the State of California. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40.)
 
The application must state: (1) the applicant’s residence and office
addresses; (2) the courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice
and the dates of admission; (3) that the applicant is a member of good standing
in those courts; (4) that the applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred
in any court; (5) the title of each court and cause in which the applicant has
filed an application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this state in the
preceding two years, the date of each application, and whether or not it was
granted; and (6) the name, address, and telephone number of the active member
of the State Bar of California who is attorney of record in the local action. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d).)
 
            Counsel’s verified application and
the declaration of Matthew R. Cowan include all of the above information.   Regarding
the application fee, the Cowan attests:   “UCLA is exempt from filing fees under
Government Code § 6103.”  (Cowan Decl. ¶
4.)
 
With regard to notice on to the State Bar, the proof of service
indicates the verified application and supporting documents were served
electronically and by mail on counsel for Plaintiff and on the State Bar at its
San Francisco Office, in conformance with Rule 9.40(c)(1).  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
Therefore, having found
Counsel’s application satisfies both the procedural and substantive
requirements, the Court grants Counsel’s application to appear pro hac vice in
this matter.  
 
Counsel shall provide notice
of the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
