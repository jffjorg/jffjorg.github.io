BACKGROUND
 
On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff David Kermani (“Plaintiff”) brought suit
against Defendants Gold Coast Crave, LLC (“Gold Coast”) and Cory Rooney
(“Rooney” or “Defendant”) alleging two causes of action: (1) breach of written
lease (against Gold Coast) and (2) breach of written guaranty of lease (against
Rooney).  
 
On July 26, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s request for voluntary
dismissal of Defendant Gold Coast and the first cause of action without
prejudice.
 
On August 1, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment as to the second cause of action against Defendant Rooney, and
judgment was entered on August 20, 2024 in favor of Plaintiff and against
Rooney.
 
Plaintiff now moves for an award of attorneys’ fees in the amount of
$11,240.00.  The motion is unopposed.
 
LEGAL STANDARDS
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs to a prevailing party under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the recovery of attorneys’ fees
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021 provides:  “[e]xcept as
attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode
of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,
express or implied, of the parties [….]” 
Similarly, Civil Code section 1717 provides “[i]n any action on a
contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and
costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to
one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined
to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s
fees in addition to other costs.”  (Civ.
Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines the “prevailing party” as follows:

 
[T]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief
and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Paragraph 41 of the commercial
lease agreement provides:
 
41. ATTORNEY FEES: In any action or
proceeding arising out of this agreement, the prevailing party between Landlord
and Tenant shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs from the
non-prevailing Landlord or Tenant, except as provided in paragraph 35A.
 
(Ex.
A to Lewiston Decl.)  Paragraph 35A outlines
mediation fees.  (Ibid.)  The commercial lease agreement is signed by
Rooney on behalf of Gold Coast.  (Ibid.)   Further,
the guaranty provides:
 
In the event any action be brought by said
Landlord against Guarantors hereunder to enforce the obligation of Guarantors
hereunder, the unsuccessful party in such action shall pay to the prevailing
party therein a reasonable attorney's fee. The attorney's fee award shall not
be computed in accordance with any court fee schedule, but shall be such as to
fully reimburse all attorney's fees reasonably incurred.
 
(Ex.
B to Lewiston Decl.)   The Guaranty is
signed by Rooney in his individual capacity as guarantor.  (Ibid.)  
 
            Because judgment was entered in
favor of Plaintiff and against Rooney, Plaintiff is a “prevailing party”
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (a)(4).  Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to his
reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to Civil Code section 1717.  Here, Plaintiff requests $11,240 in
attorneys’ fees as follows:
 
·       $660 for 1.2 hours of time billed by Behzad
Nahai, Esq. of Nahai Law Group in 2023 at an hourly rate of $550.  (Lewiston Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
·       $3,080 for 8.8 hours of legal services
provided by Jeffrey Lewiston, Esq. in 2023 at an hourly rate of $350.  (Lewiston Decl. ¶ 7.)
 
·       $6,000 for 16 hours of legal services
provided by Jeffrey Lewiston, Esq. in 2024 at an hourly rate of $375.  (Lewiston Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
·       $1,125 for 3 hours expended by Nahai Law
Group at an hourly rate of $375 to prepare this motion.  (Lewiston Decl. ¶ 11.)
 
·       An anticipated $375 for 1 hour to review the
opposition, prepare a reply, and appear at the hearing.  (Lewiston Decl. ¶ 11.)
 
Because the motion was
unopposed, the Court deducts the $375 to review the opposition, prepare a
reply, and appear at the hearing from Plaintiff’s request.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants, in part, Plaintiff’s
motion for attorneys’ fees in the amount of $10,865.  
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
