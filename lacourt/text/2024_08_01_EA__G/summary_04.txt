And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by LoveLACars.com, Siqi Liao Zhao, and Boyi Zhao to the complaint filed by Qinghua Liu. The court sustains the demurrer in part, ruling that the fourth and fifth causes of action (negligence and breach of contract) are insufficiently pleaded and giving the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The court overrules the demurrer in part, ruling that the request for punitive damages is adequately pleaded. The court's analysis is based on the legal standards for demurrers, which require the court to accept all well-pleaded facts as true. The court finds that the fourth cause of action for negligence fails because the workers' compensation system provides the exclusive remedy for employee injuries, and the fifth cause of action for breach of contract fails because the complaint does not allege the terms of the alleged contract or provide a copy of the contract.
