Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a petition for approval of a compromise of a claim or action for Plaintiff Kaitlyn Alcala, a minor. The petition seeks approval of a $19,999.99 settlement reached between Alcala and Defendant Linda Rodriguez. The court finds that the settlement agreement is voidable by Alcala's guardian ad litem and that the court must approve payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement. The court also finds that the request for attorney fees is deficient and orders Alcala's counsel to file another supplemental declaration in support of the request for attorney fees. The hearing on the petition is continued to a date to be determined in Department G (Pomona).
