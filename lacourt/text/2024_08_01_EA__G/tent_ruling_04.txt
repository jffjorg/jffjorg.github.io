BACKGROUND
 
On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff Qinghua Liu filed a complaint
against Defendants LoveLACars.com, Siqi Liao Zhao, Boyi Zhao, Qiutai Wang, and
Does 1-20, alleging the following causes of action: (1) assault, (2) battery,
(3) civil conspiracy, (4) negligence, (5) breach of contract, (6) non-payment
of overtime or double-time wages, (7) pay stub violations, (8) unfair business
practices, and (9) wrongful constructive termination.
 
On May 13, 2024, LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos filed the
present demurrer. Prior to filing on May 2, 2024, LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos’
counsel met and conferred telephonically with Liu’s counsel and was unable to
reach a resolution. (Wang Suppl. Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
A hearing on the present demurrer is set for August 1,
2024, along with a case management conference and OSC Re: Failure to File Proof
of Service.
 
ANALYSIS

LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos demur to Liu’s
entire Complaint. For the following reasons, the Court SUSTAINS LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos’ demurrer to the fourth and ­fifth causes of
action with leave to amend and OVERRULES
the demurrer as to Liu’s request
for punitive damages.
 
Legal Standard

A party may demur to a complaint on the
grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept
all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
 
Punitive Damages

LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos argue Liu’s request
for punitive damages is inadequately pled and uncertain. (Demurrer, p.
5:18-25.) Requests for punitive damages, however, are not subject to demurrer
as they are part of the prayer and do not affect the pleading’s sufficiency. (See
Moropoulos v. C.H. & O.B. Fuller Co. (1921) 186 Cal. 679, 688; see
also Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166, fn. 9 [“[T]he
adequacy of punitive damage allegations may not properly be tested by demurrer.”].)
 
Accordingly, LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos’
demurrer on this ground is OVERRULED.
 
Negligence (Fourth Cause of Action)
 
LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos contend Liu’s fourth
cause of action for negligence fails because workers’ compensation law provides
the exclusive remedy for Liu’s claims. The court agrees.
 
California’s workers compensation system
provides the exclusive remedy for employee injury caused by an employer’s
negligence or fault. (Arendell v. Auto Parts Club, Inc. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1261, 1266.) In this case, the Complaint alleges Liu’s employers
were negligent in protecting Liu from the “unreasonable risks of harm stemming
from the employment relationship.” (Complaint, ¶ 41.) Because the Complaint
alleges Liu’s employers were negligent in protecting Liu as an employee, Liu’s
sole remedy rests with the workers’ compensation system.
 
In opposition, Liu contends Liu may pursue an
action against LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos pursuant to Labor Code section 3706
on the grounds that they are willfully uninsured. (Opp., p. 7:3-8:4.) But,
nowhere in the Complaint does Liu make this allegation.
 
Accordingly, LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos’
demurrer to the fourth cause of action for Negligence is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Breach of Contract (Fifth Cause of
Action)
 
LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos maintain Liu’s fifth
cause of action for breach of contract fails because it does not allege the
terms or provide a copy of the alleged contract at issue. (Demurrer, p.
6:23-7:2.) The court agrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
To state a cause of action for breach of
contract, a plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) If a breach of
contract claim “is based on alleged breach of a written contract, the terms
must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written
agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin,
Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances,
a plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its
precise language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty
Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.) “[T]he vital elements of a cause
of action based on contract are mutual assent (usually accomplished through the
medium of an offer and acceptance) and consideration.” (Division of Labor
Law Enforcement v. Transpacific Transportation Co. (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d
268, 275.)
 
Discussion
 
In this case, the Complaint suggests Liu’s
employment contract was written. (Complaint, ¶ 49.) Nowhere in the Complaint,
however, does Liu allege the employment contract’s terms or provide a copy of
the contract as an exhibit. And while Liu’s opposition suggests the contract
was verbal, there are no allegations in the Complaint to support this claim.
(Opp., p. 8:21-24.) Thus, the court finds the cause of action is insufficiently
pled.
 
Accordingly, LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos’
demurrer to this cause of action is SUSTAINED
with leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, LoveLACars.com and the Zhaos’
demurrer to Liu’s Complaint is SUSTAINED IN PART with twenty (20)
days leave to amend as to the fourth and fifth causes of action and OVERRULED
IN PART as to the request for punitive damages.
