And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (LACMTA) motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint is continued to a date to be determined at the hearing set in Department G (Pomona). The judge has ordered the defendant's counsel to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel regarding the motion to strike and file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine (9) court days before the next scheduled hearing on the present motion. The judge's decision is based on the fact that LACMTA's counsel did not adequately meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel before filing the motion to strike, and the court needs more time to review the parties' efforts to resolve the dispute.
