And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge grants B.R. Building Resources Company's application for a determination of good faith settlement. The case involves a breach of contract action arising from a construction project in Glendora, California. In May 2017, Brian Vosberg, as trustee of the Vosberg Family Trust, entered into a written agreement with B.R. to provide demolition, design, and construction services. However, Vosberg alleges that B.R.'s services were inadequate and resulted in project delays, causing financial damage. On November 4, 2021, Vosberg filed a complaint against B.R. and Does 1-200 alleging breach of contract, negligence, unfair business practices, and violation of contractors license laws. On September 18, 2023, B.R. filed a notice of settlement and the present motion. The Judge finds that B.R.'s application adequately describes the background of the case and provides sufficient grounds for a good faith determination. The settlement amount of $600,000 is not disproportionate to the potential liability in this matter, and there is no evidence of any collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed at injuring the interests of non-settling parties. Therefore, the Judge grants B.R.'s motion for a determination of good faith settlement.
