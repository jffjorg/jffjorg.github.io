```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies defendant Arturo Salvador's motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The judge finds that the plaintiff, Wilfredo Machado Pacheco, has established purposeful availment by demonstrating that Salvador communicated an offer to Pacheco in California, entered into an oral agreement with Pacheco, received funds from Pacheco in California, and breached the agreement by failing to send the vehicle titles or return the funds to Pacheco. The judge also finds that there is a nexus between the controversy and Salvador's contacts with California, as the communications sent to Pacheco in California created the promise to perform which Salvador allegedly breached and constituted false representations that induced Pacheco to invest in Salvador's business. The judge concludes that the interests of Pacheco and the state of California outweigh the serious burdens imposed on Salvador, and therefore denies the motion. Salvador is ordered to file a responsive pleading to Pacheco's complaint within 20 days.
