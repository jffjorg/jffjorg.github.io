COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing
an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation when the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—that is, counsel cannot
withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see
California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Noah Green, Esq., counsel of record for
Defendant Jose Angel Rodriguez seeks to withdraw from representation of Defendant.
Counsel states that there are irreconcilable differences regarding the handling
the case requiring withdrawal. Trial is set for January 27, 2025; no prejudice
will result from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel has complied with CRC 3.1362.
 
There is good cause for counsel’s
withdrawal. The motion is GRANTED.
