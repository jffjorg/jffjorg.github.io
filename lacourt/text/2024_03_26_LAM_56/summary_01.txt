Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers in this case. The case arises from alleged mishandling of the plaintiffs' investment property. The plaintiffs have filed a motion to quash a deposition subpoena for production of consumer records, and a notice of continuance of other motions to quash.

The judge finds that the requested documents are relevant to the issues of the case, specifically in determining the plaintiffs' financial sophistication, background, and investment experience for purposes of determining their reasonable reliance on any alleged misrepresentation.

However, the judge notes that two requests in the subpoena contain significant typographical errors and will be interpreted accordingly. The judge also finds that the information sought by the subpoena contains sensitive information and implicates privacy concerns.

The judge orders that the parties meet and confer and stipulate to the issuance of a Protective Order in the form approved by the Los Angeles County Superior Court for Confidential (not Highly Confidential) documents.

The judge grants the Hukriede Motion as to Category 1, which seeks the plaintiffs' income tax returns, and denies as to all other categories, subject to the limitations stated above, and subject to the submission of a proposed Protective Order.

The judge also orders that the parties meet and confer after the hearing on these motions in an attempt to resolve some or all of the other motions to quash currently on calendar, and that the other motions to quash be continued by two weeks from the dates of the current hearings.
