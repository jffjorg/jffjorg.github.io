             This is a wrongful termination case. Plaintiff
Enrique Corral (“Plaintiff’) initiated this action against Defendant Aqua
Concepts (“Defendant”) on July 25, 2022. The complaint against the following
causes of action against Defendant: (1) discrimination in violation of the
California Family Rights Act; (2) retaliation in violation of the Family Rights
Act; (3) disability discrimination in violation of the FEHA; (4) failure to
engage in a good faith interactive process in violation of the FEHA; (5) failure
to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of the FEHA; (6) retaliation
in violation of the FEAH; (7) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation
in violation of the FEHA; (8) wrongful termination in violation of public
policy; (9) failure to provide rest periods in violation of Labor Code § 226.7
and Industrial Welfare Commission Order No. 16-2001 § 11; (10) failure to
provide meal periods in violation of Labor Code §§ 512 & 226.7 and
Industrial Welfare Commission Order No. 16-2001 § 10; (11) failure to provide
itemized wage statements in violation of Labor Code §§ 226, 1174; (12) willful
failure to pay wages in violation of Labor Code §§ 201, 203; (13) violation of
Business and Professions Code § 17200.
 
            On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the following discovery motions: (1) Motion to Compel Defendant’s Responses to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two; and (2) Motion to Compel
Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set
Two. Within both motions, Plaintiffs seeks monetary sanctions against Defendant
in the amount of $6,235 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2023.010(d),
(h), and (i), 2023.030, and 2030.290(c).
 
DISCUSSION
            Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party...” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.260(a).) The propounding
party on a set of interrogatories may agree to extend the time for service
beyond that 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.270.) If the propounded party does
not respond in the appropriate amount of time, the propounding party may move
for an order to compel responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).) Where a
party fails to timely provide a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may compel a response to its interrogatories, Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, without need to meet and confer with opposing counsel.  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
404.) Furthermore, “the party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives . . . any objection to the interrogatories, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product . . . .”  (Id.)  
 
            Within 30 days after
service of a demand for inspection, the party to whom the request for
production is made shall serve the original response to the request, unless
otherwise agreed to or ordered. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260(a).) A party
requesting the production of documents may seek an order compelling a response
when there has not been a timely response to the request for production. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.300.) Moreover, where a party fails to timely respond to a
production request, the delinquent party waives all objections to
production and the requesting party may seek a motion to
compel. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
 
Merits
Here, on November 17, 2023, Plaintiff propounded on Defendant
the following discovery requests by email: (1) Special Interrogatories, Set
Two; and (2) Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. (Limonjyan Decld. ¶
2.) Responses for each of these discovery requests were initially due by December
19, 2023. (Limonjyan Decls. ¶ 3.) Because of Defendant’s failure to respond by
this date, Plaintiff counsel attempted to communicate with Defendant’s counsel
via telephone on January 18, 2024 and via email on January 26, 2024. (Limonjyan
Decls. ¶ 4.) Despite of these meet and confer attempts, Defendant failed to
provide the responses or otherwise to respond to Plaintiff’s meet and confer
attempts. It is further noted that Defendant has failed to file an opposition
to show that responses have been served since the filing of these instant
motions. Therefore, due to Defendant’s failure to provide responses to the
subject discovery requests, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling
responses to each request without objection. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.)
 
            Accordingly, the Court
grants Defendant’s motions to compel. Plaintiff is ordered to serve complete, verified,
Code-compliant responses to the subject discovery requests within twenty (20)
days from the date of this Order.
 
Sanctions
Plaintiff also request that Court award monetary
sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $6,235 for each motion.
 
            “The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to Interrogatories . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd. (c),
2031.300, subd. (c).) Also, Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(a) authorizes
sanctions for misuse of discovery, which includes: failure to respond or submit
to an authorized method of discovery; making an evasive response to discovery;
making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification, a motion to compel or to limit discovery. (Id. §§
2023.010, subds. (d), (e), (f), (g) & (h).)
 
            Defendant’s failure to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests amounts
to a misuse of the discovery process; thus, the Court finds that sanctions are
warranted against Defendant. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010, subd. (d).) In terms of the amount
requested, Plaintiff’s counsel attests that his hourly rate is $650 and that,
in addition to the filing fee, he incurred a total of 4.5 total hours in preparing
each motion and anticipates spending an additional 5 total hours reviewing
Defendant’s opposition, preparing a reply, traveling to, and attending the
hearing for each motion. (Limonjyan Decls. ¶ 8.) Under the circumstances, the
amount requested is excessive. Thus, the Court awards sanctions in the reduced
and combined amount of $1,360, consisting of 2 hours at an hourly rate of $650
and $60 in filing fees. 
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions against Defendant is granted in the reduced and combined
amount of $1,360.
 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motions
to Compel Defendant’s Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and
Request for Production of Documents, Set Two are GRANTED. Defendant is ordered
to serve responses to these discovery requests without objections within 30
days of the date of this Order.
 
            Also, the requests for monetary
sanctions against Defendant are GRANTED in the reduced and combined amount of $1,360.
Defendant is instructed to pay jointly to Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel
within 20 days of the date of this Order. 

 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
