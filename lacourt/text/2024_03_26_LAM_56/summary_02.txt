The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff has not shown that the costs incurred by the Defendant were unreasonable or unnecessary to the conduct of the litigation.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's inability to pay the costs sought by the Defendant is not grounds for striking the Memorandum of Costs. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not shown that the costs incurred by the Defendant were unreasonable or unnecessary to the conduct of the litigation. Therefore, the Motion to Strike Memorandum of Costs is denied.
