And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion for trial preference filed by Plaintiff Nathan Andualem, a minor under the age of 14, through his Guardian Ad Litem Andualem Asaye Shume. The motion was filed on June 3, 2024, and was opposed by the Defendants on July 2, 2024. After the parties met and conferred, they agreed to a mediation date of December 2, 2024, and a trial date of February 18, 2025. As the parties have already agreed on the mediation and trial dates, the motion for trial preference is deemed moot. The Judge orders the moving party to give notice to all parties.
