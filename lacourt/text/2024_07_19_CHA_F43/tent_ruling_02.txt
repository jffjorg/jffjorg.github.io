SUMMARY OF ACTION 
This personal injury action was filed by Plaintiff Nathan
Andualem through his Guardian Ad Litem (Plaintiff) on January 10, 2024. On June
3, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for trial preference pursuant to CCP § 36
because Plaintiff is a minor under the age of 14. On July 2, 2024, Defendants filed
an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion. On July 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply
indicating that the parties had met and conferred and agreed to a mediation
date of December 2, 2024, and a trial date of February 18, 2025. 
 
Based on the parties’ agreement for mediation and trial
dates, it appears that Plaintiff’s motion for trial preference is now moot.
 
Moving party to give notice to all parties.
