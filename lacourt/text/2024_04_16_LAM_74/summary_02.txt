And here is the English-text summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion by the defendant to deem requests for admission (RFAs) admitted and to impose sanctions. The plaintiff did not timely respond to the RFAs, and the defendant seeks to have the RFAs deemed admitted and to impose monetary sanctions. The court finds the motion moot since plaintiff did provide verifications to the RFAs, but service was untimely. As a result, the court grants the defendant's request for sanctions and awards the defendant's counsel $2,400 in attorney fees. The court orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant's counsel's fees within 30 days of the order.
