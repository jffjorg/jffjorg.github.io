 Case Number:  21STCV23573    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  74 Julian
Perner Ledesma v. Arash Moradzadeh, et al.
Defendant’s Motion to Deem Requests
for Admission (Sets One and Two) Admitted and Request for Sanctions
 
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND 
            On
June 24, 2021, Plaintiff Julian Perner Ledesma (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant K & B Surgical Center (Defendant) and others.
            On
April 12, 2022, Defendant served Plaintiff with requests for admission (set
one) (RFAs).
            On
July 10, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with RFAs (set two). 
            Plaintiff
responded to both sets of RFAs, but Defendant contends the responses remain
unverified. 
            On
March 12, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to deem both sets of RFAs admitted.
LEGAL STANDARD
            If a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the requesting party
may move for an order that the truth of any matters specified in the requests
be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).) Further, the Court¿shall¿make this order, “unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing¿on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) ¿
            While tardy
responses may defeat the motion, they will not avoid monetary sanctions. (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction [Citation] on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure
to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”].)  

DISCUSSION  
            This
motion is moot because Plaintiff provided verifications to the RFAs on October
7, 2023. (Matevosyan Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. 1.) However, service of verifications was
untimely, meaning Plaintiff did not timely respond to the RFAs. (Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [“Unsworn responses are tantamount
to no responses at all.”].) As a further consequence, sanctions are mandatory.
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendant’s counsel’s proposed hourly rate is reasonable, but the court finds
the hours for which she seeks compensation excessive. (Milnes Decl., ¶ 8.)
Accordingly, the court will award Defendant’s counsel $2,400 ($400 x (3 hours
(motion) + 3 hours (drafting reply, preparing for hearing, attending hearing). 
CONCLUSION 
The
court finds this motion moot. The court grants Defendant’s request for
sanctions. Plaintiff shall pay Defendant’s counsel attorney fees in the sum of
$2,400 within 30 days of this order.
Defendant
shall give notice.
