And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (set two) from the defendant. The plaintiff had previously propounded requests for production of documents, but the defendant only partially responded. The plaintiff then filed a motion to compel further responses. The court finds that the plaintiff has good cause for the discovery sought, as the documents at issue relate to financial documents needed to oppose the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court also awards the plaintiff's counsel attorney fees in the amount of $3,000. The defendant is ordered to provide further, code-compliant responses and produce responsive documents within 30 days of this order.
