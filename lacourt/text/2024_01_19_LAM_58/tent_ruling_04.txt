 
This is an
action under the Song-Beverly Act in which Jerome Fein (Plaintiff)
alleged defects in a 2017
Mercedes S550 (Vehicle). Plaintiff sued Keyes European, LLC and
Mercedes-Benz, LLC (Defendant) for breach of express and implied
warranties. 
 
The parties settled this Song-Beverly matter except as to the
issues of attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
Plaintiff now argues that, as the
prevailing party, he is entitled to fees and costs under Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d). He seeks lodestar attorneys’ fees of $85,036, plus a 1.5
multiplier – in the amount of $42,518 – and costs
of $15,194.30. The total requested in attorney fees
and costs is $142,748.30. 
 
Defendant Mercedes filed an
opposition arguing the amounts requested in fees and costs are excessive and
unreasonable.[1] Plaintiff filed
a reply. 
 
The Court grants the motion for
attorneys’ fees in a reduced amount. The request for costs is granted. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            A prevailing buyer in an action
under Song-Beverly “shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the Court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.”¿¿(Civ. Code, § 1794,¿subd. (d).) 
 
            The
prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees
were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California
Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party seeking attorney fees “
‘is not necessarily entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services
according to [his] own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’ ” (Levy
v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807,
816.)¿¿Therefore, if the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for
the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the
court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.”
(Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            A court may
“reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine,
noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and
inflated fees resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on
inefficient or duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the
analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of
fairness. (Kerkeles¿v. City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th
88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting the analysis, courts are not permitted to
tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the buyer’s damages
recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks $85,036 in attorneys’ fees for Knight Law Group, LLP (Knight Law),
plus a 1.5 multiplier enhancement, and costs of $15,194.30., for a total $142,748.30.

 
            Defendant Mercedes
does not dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party under the settlement
agreement. Instead, Defendant argues the that hours incurred to litigate this
routine, non-complex case that settled before trial is unreasonable. 
 
            A
calculation of attorneys’ fees for a Song-Beverly action¿begins with the
“lodestar” approach, under which the Court fixes the lodestar¿at¿“the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Margolin
v. Regional Planning Com.¿(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.)
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Ibid.)¿ “ ‘The reasonable hourly
rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.’ ” (Id.¿at p.
1004.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services¿provided.¿(Serrano v. Priest¿(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25,
49;¿PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 
 
            “[T]rial
courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The
essential goal in shifting fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not
to achieve auditing perfection. So trial courts may take into account their
overall sense of a suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an
attorney's time.” (Fox v. Vice (2011) 563 U.S. 826, 838.)
 
Attorneys’ Fees
 
Hourly
Rate: 
 
            Defendant Mercedes
first contends that Plaintiff’s attorneys’ hourly rates – which range from $250
to $550 – are unreasonable.
 
            In
assessing the reasonableness of hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on
its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees [citation],
the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied
[citations], and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in
the community and rate determinations in other cases.”¿(569 East County
Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
426, 437; see¿Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th
266, 272 [“ ‘ “a reasonable hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of
factors…[including] the level of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount
to be obtained in the litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability
of the case” ’ ”].)¿
 
            In
challenging the hourly rates, Defendant requests that the Court reduce all
hourly rates to, “at most,” $250. However, Defendant does not submit evidence
specifically addressing Plaintiff’s attorneys’ hourly rates. Instead, Defendant points to several Los
Angeles Superior Court cases where attorney hourly rates were reduced. (Opp.,
p. 10:3-26.) These cases are not controlling on this Court. 
 
            Defendant
also cites the holding in Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240
– where the Court of Appeal upheld a trial court’s reduction of a firm’s hourly
rate to $350. While this case does suggest that the nature and complexity of
the underlying litigation are factors in determining whether attorney’s fees
are reasonable (id. at p. 255), it does not definitively hold that the
rates requested in this case are unreasonable. That is, under the applicable
standard of review, the court of appeal only found that the trial court’s decision
to reduce the hourly rate was not “clearly wrong.” (Id. at p. 246.)
Thus, Mikhaeilpoor is of only limited help to Defendant. 
 
Here,
a review of the Kirnos Declaration
in support of the motion for attorney’s fees – which contains a description of
each attorneys’ education and experience – supports finding Plaintiff’s
attorneys’ hourly rates ranging from $250 to $550 were reasonable; the rates
are supported by substantial evidence under the present circumstances. (Kirnos
Decl., ¶¶ 29-54.)
 
Based on the Court's familiarity
with the current local market, and Plaintiff’s evidence of the experience and
skills of the various attorneys – the Court finds that Plaintiff's requested
rates per hour are reasonable.
 
            Number of
Hours Incurred: 
 
            Defendant Mercedes
also challenges the hours incurred, arguing that the amounts sought by Plaintiff
are the result of overstaffing, overbilling, and vague entries.
 
             Mercedes’s opposition challenges several specific
entries. (Opp., p. 2:25-8:5.)
 
            Duplicative
Billing: Defendant contends that, as result of overstaffing, Plaintiff
billed for duplicative entries of the same task. However, Defendant’s assertion
of duplicative billing appears overstated as Defendant has only identified three
of entries as duplicative. Moreover, in reviewing these entries, these tasks
have already been reduced based on the Court’s ruling that these discovery
related entries were excessive, as discussed below.  
 
            Vague Billing:
Defendant Mercedes also argues that numerous billing entries are vague, arguing
that they do not clearly delineate tasks billed by Plaintiff’s counsel. (Opp., 2:1-5
[“They provide no information as to (1) whether counsel was billing for the
same task, (2) whether counsel made repetitive entries, or (3) any indication
as to the substantive nature of Plaintiff’s counsel’s tasks during the duration
of this litigation.”].) 
 
Vague entries obscure a court’s
ability to assess the reasonableness of a fee request, justifying a reduction
of the fees. (See e.g., Maughan v. Google Technology (2006) 143
Cal.App.4th 1242, 1251 [affirming trial court’s reduction of fees and costs
from $112,288 to $23,000, in part because the time sheets submitted were
“somewhat vague in their descriptions of what precisely defense counsel was
doing for the claimed amount of time”].) 
 
Admittedly, there are a number of
billing entries that would benefit from greater detail in the description; however,
the billing entries are not too vague to make a determination of its
reasonableness. That is, the Court can generally understand the nature of the
work described in the context of the litigation. Counsel “is not required to
record in great detail how each minute of his time was expended” but “should
identify the general subject matter of his time expenditures.” (Hensley v.
Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S. 424, 437 n.12; see also Acevedo
v. City of Los Angeles, No. CV 14-5661-GHK (PJWx), 2016 WL 11525321, at *9
(C.D. Cal. Dec. 2, 2016) [“An entry is not considered too vague if it
identifies the general subject matter of time expenditures.”].)
 
            Excessive
Billing: Defendant also argues that the hours claimed in this case are
excessive. 
 
First, Plaintiff seeks numerous
hours for time incurred on propounding and responding to discovery and
preparing for depositions. Given Plaintiff’s counsel’s experience in this type
of litigation and the simple lemon law issues at matter here, the Court agrees that
the time incurred on such tasks are excessive and unreasonable under the
circumstances. The Court will reduce fees by $6,125 for excessive hours
incurred on discovery related tasks. 
 
Second, as to Defendant’s remaining
challenged entries, the Court also agrees that many of these entries need to be
reduced. For example, on June 9, 2022, Plaintiff billed 3.5 hours to “Attend
hearing on TRC and draft results email re appearance” and “roundtrip travel.” On
October 12, 2022, Plaintiff incurred another 3.6 hours to “attend
hearing on Trial Readiness Conference; Draft results.” On October 12, 2022,
there was also an entry for 2.2. hours for “research law re out of state depositions
and sent correspondence to defense counsel re same.” These fees are excessive. Additionally,
as another example, the time incurred to draft the motions in limine (4.3) was
excessive. Based on these and other excessive entries, Court will reduce fees
by $2,275. 
 
As noted, it is Plaintiff that “has
the burden of ‘showing that the fees incurred were “allowable,” were “reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation,” and were “reasonable in amount.” ’
” (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 34.)
But in its reply brief, Plaintiff appears to turn this burden on its head.  Plaintiff argues that attorney fee bills are “presumptively
credible,” and the burden is on the party opposing the bills to make specific
objections to particular time entries based on evidence. In making this
argument, Plaintiff selectively quotes from several cases.  None of these cases undermine the Court’s
determination that portions of Plaintiff’s claimed fees were unreasonable. 
 
First, Hadley v. Krepel
(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677 stands for the proposition that a moving party’s
verified cost bill is prima facie evidence that costs, expenses,
and services listed were necessarily incurred. (Id. at p. 682.)
Moreover, while plaintiff's attorney's verified billing records are “prima
facie evidence” that the services were “necessarily incurred,” a court is not
limited in its determination of reasonable attorney's fees “by the sufficiency
of [the opposing] motion to rebut the presumption” that the fees were
necessary. (Id. at pp. 682–683.) 
 
In Horsford v. Board of Trustees
of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, the appellate court
found that the
trial court's conclusion some of the hours billed were duplicative was not
grounds for “rejecting wholesale counsels’ verified time records.” (Horsford,
supra, 132 Cal.App.4th at p. 396.) Rather, “the verified time statements of
the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the
absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Ibid.) If the
trial court believed some hours billed by multiple attorneys were overlapping,
duplicative, or excessive, it could have exercised its discretion to reduce the
award accordingly. (Id. at pp. 396-397.) The court concluded “the trial
court abused its discretion in failing to use counsels’ time records as the
starting point for its lodestar determination.” (Id. at p. 397.) Thus, Horsford stands for
the proposition that an attorney’s verified time records, indicating the hours
actually devoted to the particular litigation, are entitled to credence, and
are only a starting point to be used in calculating the lodestar for
purposes of determining a fee award, in the absence of evidence indicating the
records are erroneous or inaccurate. 
 
Finally,
with respect to
McGrath v. County of Nevada (1995) 67 F.3d 248, the court held that the party challenging the
reasonableness of the hours billed “bears the burden of providing specific
evidence to challenge the accuracy and reasonableness of the hours charged.” (McGrath v. County of Nevada (1995) 67 F.3d 248, 255.) Notably,
this case pertained to attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and its holding is
not cited in any California authority for attorney fees. (See also Blum v.
Stenson (1984) 465 U.S. 886, 892, fn. 5 [applying to 42 U.S.C. § 1988].) 
 
More importantly,
however, other federal cases citing McGrath, have held that notwithstanding this burden shifting, the “Court
also has an independent duty to review the evidence of hours worked and tasks
undertaken to determine the reasonableness of the fees requested for the case.”
(Scalia v. County of Kern (E.D. Cal., Apr. 27, 2023, No.
117CV01097AWICDB) 2023 WL 3124385, at *1 [citing the proposition in McGrath and then
citing Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S. 424 [“It remains for the district
court to determine what fee is ‘reasonable.’”].) 
 
Thus,
deficiencies in Defendant’s opposition paper – including a lack of evidence –
does not deprive this Court of its responsibility to determine “reasonable”
fees here.
 
            Multiplier adjustment
 
            Finally,
Plaintiff seeks a 1.5 lodestar multiplier based on the risk of taking on the
case on contingency and the substantial delay in payment of attorney fees.  
 
            Relevant
factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  
 
            Although
this matter was taken on contingency (Kirnos Decl., ¶ 9), none of the other
factors support the application of a multiplier. This was a garden variety
Song-Beverly case; there were no novel or difficult questions presented. (Thayer
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819, 834.) Further,
the¿contingent risks, skill, and difficulty¿Plaintiff’s attorneys¿assert are
absorbed by¿their¿already high (albeit reasonable) hourly rates. (See¿Robertson
v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California. Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
785, 822.) 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for a lodestar multiplier is denied.
 
            Adjustments
to attorneys’ fees are summarized as follows:
 




 


Reductions


Total




Original Lodestar Amount


 


$85,036




Excessive Billing


$8,400


 




 


 


 




Reduced Lodestar Amount


$8,400


$76,636




 
            The Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees in the sum of $76,636.
 
Costs: 
 
Defendant also challenges Plaintiff’s
claimed costs of $15,194.30. Defendant does not challenge
any specific costs but only argues that “Plaintiff has not submitted any
evidence of the reasonableness of the costs incurred.” (Opp. 12:15.) Defendant
asks the Court to either deny costs outright or “continue the hearing on this
Motion for a period of time sufficient for Plaintiff to submit documentation
substantiating his request for recovery of costs, and for Defendant to
respond.” (Opp. 12:27-13:2.) 
 
In awarding
costs under section 1033.5, the trial court has broad discretion to determine
what costs were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and
whether they were reasonable in amount. (Howard v. American National Fire
Ins. Co. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 498, 541; Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(2).)
 
Once a
verified cost memorandum is submitted and the costs sought appear facially
proper, the memorandum is prima facie evidence the costs were reasonable and
necessary, and the party objecting to those costs bears the burden of proving
they are not. (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.) Upon
a proper objection in a motion to tax, the burden of proof will shift
back to the party seeking costs to provide evidence and documentary support
that the costs were reasonable and necessarily incurred. (Ladas v.
California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774 [“[I]f the
[cost] items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of
proof is on the party claiming them as costs.”].) 
 
However,
mere conclusory statements and arguments contained in the motion to tax costs
are generally not proper objections sufficient to shift the burden. (Nelson
v. Anderson, supra, 72 Cal.App.4th at p. 131 [quoting Oak Grove School
Dist. v. City Title Ins. Co. (1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678, 698–699].) To be
proper, an objection to a facially reasonable and awardable cost item must be
accompanied by evidence or supporting documentation. (Nelson, supra, at
p. 131.) Conversely, facially improper costs, despite verification, may be
challenged without submitting additional evidence to prove they are
unreasonable or not awardable and will be sufficient to shift the burden to the
party seeking costs. (Ibid.)


Here, Defendant does not object to
any specific cost or argue any specific cost incurred was unreasonable. Rather,
Defendant simply argues that the Plaintiff has not substantiated the costs
sought. This argument misstates the burden shifting where Plaintiff has filed a
facially valid memorandum of costs. That is, Defendant’s opposition argument is
not a proper objection to the facially valid costs memorandum and, therefore,
has not triggered Plaintiff’s burden to substantiate his costs.  
            
            Accordingly, the Court will grant
costs in the amount requested by Plaintiff.
            
Conclusion
 
            The motion
for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in part. In sum, the Court grants
Plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees in the total
amount of $76,636, which is a reduction of the lodestar amount by $8,400. The request
for costs is granted in the amount of $15,194.30.  
 
            Defendant Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC is ordered to pay to Plaintiff’s counsel the sum of $91,830.30 ($76,636
+ 15,194.30) for attorneys’ fees and costs. This amount shall be paid on or
before February 20, 2024.
