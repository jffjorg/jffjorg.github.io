[1]           On January 9, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a notice of non-opposition. On January 10, 2024, Defendant filed its
opposition. The opposition was due on January 3, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1005, subd. (b).) The Opposition provides no explanation for its untimeliness. The
Court has discretion to refuse to consider the late opposition. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1300; Rancho Mirage Country Club Homeowners Ass’n v.
Hazelbaker (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 262 [affirming refusal to
consider tardy opposition to plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees].) In this instance,
the Court prefers to determine this issue on the merits with the benefit of an
opposition and reply. The Court cautions counsel to adhere to statutory time deadlines.
