[1] The
court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s fourth and eighth causes of
action without leave to amend on December 9, 2022.


[2] The
court notes that, in disputing various facts set forth in the separate
statement, Plaintiff has cited allegations in her First Amended Complaint.  But “[i]t is generally understood . . . that
a party cannot rely on the allegations of [her] own pleadings, even if
verified, to make or supplement the evidentiary showing required in the summary
judgment context.”  (College Hospital,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 720, n. 7.)  Thus, the court finds that the allegations in
Plaintiff’s operative complaint cannot be used to show the existence of a
triable issue of material fact as to this element.
