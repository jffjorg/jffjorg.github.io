And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the Plaintiff's summary judgment motion, which was denied. The court sustained the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's fourth and eighth causes of action without leave to amend on December 9, 2022. The Plaintiff attempted to dispute various facts set forth in the separate statement, citing allegations in her First Amended Complaint. However, the court found that a party cannot rely on their own pleadings to make or supplement the evidentiary showing required in the summary judgment context, citing College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 720, n. 7. Therefore, the court cannot consider the allegations in the Plaintiff's operative complaint as evidence of a triable issue of material fact.
