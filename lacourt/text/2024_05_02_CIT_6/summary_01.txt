```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to deem the requests for admissions admitted. The plaintiff had moved to have the requests for admissions deemed admitted against the defendant, Keith Davis, who had failed to serve a timely response to the requests. The court finds that the defendant's responses were substantially compliant with the law and that the plaintiff's motion was not timely. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $810.00, which is comprised of the time spent preparing the motion, reviewing the opposition, and preparing the reply, plus the cost of filing the motion. The defendant must pay the monetary sanctions to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of the court's order.
