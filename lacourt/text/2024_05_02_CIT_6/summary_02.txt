And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer to the complaint. The defendant, Wayne Lee, must file and serve an amended verified answer to the complaint within 20 days of the court's order. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order. The court's decision is based on the fact that the defendant's answer was not verified, as required by law. The court also notes that the plaintiff did not meet and confer with the defendant in person or by telephone before bringing the motion, as required by law. However, the court will still consider the motion and admonishes the plaintiff to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going forward.
