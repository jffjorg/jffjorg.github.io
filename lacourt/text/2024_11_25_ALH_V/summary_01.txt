Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents filed by Defendant Lisa Wong. The court finds that Plaintiff Aram Djagharbekian has failed to provide verified responses to the discovery requests, which were served on November 8, 2023. As a result, the court grants Defendant Wong's motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents. The court also orders Defendant Wong to pay an additional filing fee to the court. However, the court declines to impose sanctions on Plaintiff Aram Djagharbekian, despite his failure to respond to discovery, due to the breakdown in communication between Plaintiff Aram Djagharbekian and his counsel.
