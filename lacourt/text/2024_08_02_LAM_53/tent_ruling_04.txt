  Order RE:
 
cross-defendant’s demurrer to first amended
  cross-complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff and cross-defendant
Eduardo Luna
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Defendants BJD Services, LLC, Dawn
Kuykendall, Jerilyn Rivetti Kuykendall, Brian McWilliams, Rodney Owens, Villa
Patrician Home Owner’s Association Inc., and Villa Patrician Home Owner’s
Association Inc.
Demurrer to First Amended Cross-Complaint
Cross-complainants Villa
Patrician Homeowner’s Association, Inc., Dawn Kuykendall, and Rodney Owens
(“Cross-Complainants”) filed a Cross-Complaint in this action on March 17,
2023, against plaintiff and cross-defendant Eduardo Luna (“Luna”).
On November 21, 2023, the
court issued an order sustaining Luna’s demurrer to Villa Patrician Homeowner’s
Association, Inc.’s first cause of action for breach of contract and Dawn
Kuykendall’s second cause of action for breach of contract in Cross-Complainants’
Cross-Complaint.  (Nov. 21, 2023 Order,
p. 4:1-4.)  The court granted
Cross-Complainants 20 days leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint to
cure the defects in those causes of action. 
(Nov. 21, 2023 Order, p. 4:5-7.) 
Cross-Complainants did not
file their First Amended Cross-Complaint with the court within 20 days after
the court issued its November 20, 2023 order. 
However, on March 11, 2024, Luna filed the pending demurrer “to the
First Amended Cross-Complaint.”  (Dem.,
p. 2:3-5.)  Thus, although
Cross-Complainants did not file the First Amended Cross-Complaint within 20
days after the issuance of the November 20, 2023 order, it appears that
Cross-Complainants served the First Amended Cross-Complaint on Luna within that
time.
Moreover, on May 21, 2024, the
court issued an order noting that, although the court granted
Cross-Complainants 20 days leave to file a First Amended Complaint and it
appeared that they served their First Amended Cross-Complaint on Luna, Cross-Complainants
inadvertently failed to file that pleading with the court.  (May 21, 2024 Order, p. 3:10-22.)  The court ordered Cross-Complainants “to file
with the court the First Amended Cross-Complaint served on plaintiff and
cross-defendant Eduardo Luna within 10 days of the date of this order.”  (May 21, 2024 Order, p. 4:8-10.)  However, Cross-Complainants have not filed
their First Amended Cross-Complaint with the court.  
The court therefore finds that
it is appropriate, and exercises its discretion, to continue the hearing on
Luna’s demurrer to give Cross-Complainants an additional opportunity to file
their First Amended Cross-Complaint with the court.
ORDER
The court orders that the
hearing on plaintiff and cross-defendant Eduardo Luna’s demurrer to First
Amended Cross-Complaint is continued to August 23, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in
Department 53. 
The court orders
cross-complainants Villa Patrician Homeowner’s Association, Inc., Dawn
Kuykendall, and Rodney Owens to file with the court, no later than August 9,
2024, the First Amended Cross-Complaint served on plaintiff and cross-defendant
Eduardo Luna.
 
 
 
            The court orders cross-complainants Villa Patrician
Homeowner’s Association, Inc., Dawn Kuykendall, and Rodney Owens to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  August 2, 2024
