MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D.,
Inc.         
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Yang Lu
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set
Twelve, and for Monetary Sanctions[1]
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court rules on plaintiff
Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s evidentiary objections, filed on May 24, 2024, as
follows:
Objections Nos. 1-4, 8-9,
11-12, 15, and 17 are overruled. 
Objections Nos. 5-7, 10, 13-14,
16, and 18 are sustained. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling defendant Yang Lu (“Defendant”) to serve further responses
to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Twelve, numbers 143-153, and (2)
awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$5,346.65.
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Twelve, numbers 143-153
because the objections to those interrogatories are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).)  The court notes that Defendant has objected to
these interrogatories on the ground that they exceed the limit of 35 specially
prepared interrogatories.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1).)  But
(1) Plaintiff also served on Defendant a declaration that substantially complies
with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.050, and (2) the court denied
Defendant’s motion for a protective order on June 28, 2024.  (Chan Decl., Ex. A, p. 6; June 28, 2024 Order,
p. 5:2.) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (d).)  The court finds that $2,186.65
((5 hours x counsel’s $425 hourly rate) + $61.65 motion filing fee) is a
reasonable amount of monetary sanctions to impose against Defendant in
connection with this motion.  (Chan
Decl., ¶¶ 25-27). 
The court denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (d).) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff
Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s motion to compel further responses to special
interrogatories and for monetary sanctions. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, the court orders defendant Yang Lu to serve further, full and
complete answers to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s Special Interrogatories,
Set Twelve, numbers 143-153, which comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.210-2030.250, within 20 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant Yang Lu
to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. in the amount of
$2,186.65 within 30 days of the date of service of this order.
            The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  August 2, 2024
