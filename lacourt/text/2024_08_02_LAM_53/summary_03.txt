And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion by defendant Citiguard Inc. to consolidate three separate actions filed by different plaintiffs. The court finds that the defendant has not complied with the procedural requirements for consolidation, including failing to file a notice of related case in the other two actions, failing to serve the motion on all attorneys of record and non-represented parties, and failing to identify the attorneys of record for each party who has appeared in the actions. Therefore, the court denies the motion without prejudice, allowing the defendant to re-file a new motion to consolidate that complies with the procedural requirements.
