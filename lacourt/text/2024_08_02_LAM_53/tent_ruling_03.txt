  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to consolidate cases
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Citiguard Inc.        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Tennia Taylor
Motion to Consolidate Cases
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants defendant
Citiguard Inc.’s request for judicial notice. 
(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Citiguard Inc. (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order consolidating
the following three actions: (1) this action, filed by plaintiff Tennia Taylor
(“Plaintiff”) (Case No. 22STCV00532), (2) the action filed by plaintiff Marquis
Mejia Hill (“plaintiff Hill”) (Case No. 22STCV00937), and (3) the action filed
by plaintiff Maud Chaira (“plaintiff Chaira”) (Case No. 23STCV30401). 
The court finds that Defendant has not complied with (1) California
Rules of Court, rules 3.350 and 3.300, and (2) Local Rule 3.3. 
First, as a threshold matter, the court notes that this action has not
been related to the action filed by plaintiff Chaira, which is currently
pending in Department 56.  Thus, the
court may not consolidate this action and plaintiff Chaira’s action.  (Local Rule 3.3, subd. (g)(1) [“Cases may not
be consolidated unless they are in the same department.  A motion to consolidate two or more cases may
be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments,
have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already
assigned to that department”].)  The
court also notes that Defendant filed a “Notice of Related Case” in plaintiff
Charia’s case.  (RJN Ex. G.)  However, Defendant did not file a Notice of
Related Case in this action, as required. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.300, subds. (d) [“The Notice of Related Case
must be filed in all pending cases listed in the notice and must be served on
all parties in those cases”], (h)(1)(A) [the judge who has the earliest filed
case must determine whether the cases must be ordered related].) 
Second, a notice of motion to consolidate must “[b]e filed in each
case sought to be consolidated.”  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 3.350, subd. (a)(1)(C).)  However, Defendant did not file its notice of
motion to consolidate in the cases filed by plaintiff Chaira or plaintiff Hill.

Third, Defendant did not serve the motion to consolidate “on all
attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought
to be consolidated[.]”  (Cal. Rules of
Ct., rule 3.350, subd. (a)(2)(B).) The proof of service states only that
Defendant served the notice of motion and motion on counsel for Plaintiff and
dismissed defendant Memorial Hospital of Gardena.  (Proof of Service filed July 23, 2024, p.
2.)  Defendant did not serve counsel for
plaintiff Hill or plaintiff Charia as required. 
Fourth, Defendant did not identify, in its notice of motion, the names
of the attorneys of record for each party who has appeared in the three subject
actions as required.  (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 3.350, subd. (a)(1)(A).) 
The court therefore denies Defendant’s motion, without prejudice to
Defendant’s filing a new motion to consolidate that complies with all
procedural requirements. 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Citiguard
Inc.’s motion to consolidate cases, without prejudice. 
            The court orders plaintiff Tennia
Taylor to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
