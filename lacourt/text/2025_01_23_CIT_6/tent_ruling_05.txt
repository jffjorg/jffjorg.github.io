   [1]Â The caption on the notice of motion to deem matters admitted mentions $960.00  in monetary sanctions, but then the body of the notice and motion both indicate  $585.00. (See Notice & Memorandum of Points & Authorities in support of  Motion for Order That Matters Set Forth in Request for Admission (Set One) be  Deemed Admitted (12/18/24).) The Court infers that the $960.00 in the caption  was a typo and that the correct amount requested is $585.00.
