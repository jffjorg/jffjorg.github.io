Defendant: Huirong Dai 
COURT RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $15,371,496.48. The Court
will modify and sign the proposed judgment.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a breach of contract case. On September 28, 2021, plaintiff Jiajin Shi
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Huirong Dai (Defendant) and
Does 1 through 50, alleging the sole cause of action for breach of contract. On
January 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint, alleging
the same cause of action for breach of contract against Defendant. 
            On
February 20, 2024, default was entered against Defendant.[1] On June 13, 2024, Plaintiff
dismissed the Doe Defendants. On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for
entry of default judgment, which was denied without prejudice. On November 25,
2024, Plaintiff submitted another default judgment package.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $15,371,696.48,
including $15,370,324.43 in damages and $1,372.05 in costs. The Court finds
Plaintiff’s costs are overstated by $200.00, and that Plaintiff’s costs add up
to $1,172.05. (See Form CIV-100, ¶ 7.) The Court otherwise finds Plaintiff’s
default judgment package in order. Accordingly, the Court will GRANT
Plaintiff’s default judgment request in the reduced amount of $15,371,496.48,
i.e., $15,370,324.43 in damages plus $1,172.05 in costs. 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$15,371,496.48. The Court will modify and sign the proposed judgment.
