And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the motion for evidentiary and monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, Yoan Koh. The defendants, including CIFIC Union International Inc. dba Compass Real Estate, Daniel Kim, and Compass California Inc., claim that Koh failed to comply with the court's discovery orders and are seeking sanctions. However, the judge notes that Koh's attorney, Steven J. Barkin, is no longer eligible to practice law in California and is effectively in pro per. The judge is skeptical that Koh is aware of the State Bar's action against Barkin or the instant motion seeking sanctions. Therefore, the judge orders the defendants to serve Koh directly to provide him with notice and an opportunity to contest the motion, if he chooses to do so. The hearing is continued to a later date, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
