[1] The court did so because Plaintiff
alleged that Bo was to pay for one-half of the Property’s purchase, but
the Operating Agreement does not require that Bo pay 50% of the purchase
price but merely $50,000. (See 2/28/24 Ruling.) 
 


[2] The appellate court
in Gherman affirmed a trial court’s denial of a motion to file a
compulsory cross-complaint based on the following observation: “Where the defendant fails to act for a period of over
30 days and waits until the first day of trial, such conduct may be interpreted
as evidence of a lack of good faith especially when coupled with the long history of
litigation between the parties, which demonstrates that both sides were
jockeying for position over the right to a jury trial ..., we conclude that
the trial court impliedly found and concluded that by attempting to file a
cross-complaint on the first day of trial, defendants were not acting in ‘good
faith’ but that the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint was merely a tactical,
strategic maneuver to deprive plaintiffs of a right to a jury trial.”],

[3] Wendy cites to cases
involving motions for leave to file an amended pleading, but those cases
are inapposite. On motions to file compulsory counter-claims, the court is left
with even less discretion than on motions to file an amended pleading.
