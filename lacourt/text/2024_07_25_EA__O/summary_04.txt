And here is the English text summarizing the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is based on information presented before today. The Plaintiff alleges that Bo is required to pay for one-half of the purchase price of the Property, but the Operating Agreement only requires Bo to pay $50,000. The Court has ruled that the Plaintiff's allegations are not supported by the Operating Agreement. Additionally, the Court has noted that the defendant's motion to file a compulsory cross-complaint may not be in good faith, citing a previous case that found that a defendant who waits until the first day of trial to file a cross-complaint may be acting in bad faith. The Court has also distinguished this case from others involving motions to file amended pleadings, noting that motions to file compulsory counter-claims have less discretion.
