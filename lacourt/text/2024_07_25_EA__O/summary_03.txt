And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Bo Sun's motion to file a cross-complaint against plaintiff Wendy Lin. The case involves a dispute over a property in Chino Hills, California, and the formation of Toptree Investment LLC. Wendy Lin alleges that Bo Sun failed to pay his capital contribution and has lost his membership interest in the company. Bo Sun seeks to file a cross-complaint against Wendy Lin and other third-party entities. The judge has concluded that there is no evidence of bad faith and has granted the motion to file the cross-complaint. The judge notes that the failure to permit the filing of the cross-complaint would be prejudicial and that the case can still be tried on the merits even if the cross-complaint is filed.
