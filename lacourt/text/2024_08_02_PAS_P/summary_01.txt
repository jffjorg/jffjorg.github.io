And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer of 360 Remodeling, Inc. to the first, second, and third causes of action in the plaintiff's complaint with leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff must re-file the complaint to state a viable cause of action against 360 Remodeling, Inc. The judge also denied the motion to strike as moot, as the demurrer was sustained. The judge granted 360 Remodeling, Inc.'s request for judicial notice. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that 360 Remodeling, Inc. was hired to perform roof repairs at the plaintiff's home, but the work was done by a subcontractor, Legend Construction Services, Inc. The plaintiff discovered water damage on June 21, 2019, and alleges that 360 Remodeling, Inc. was responsible for the damage. The judge found that the complaint was barred by the statute of limitations and that the plaintiff did not allege sufficient facts to invoke the delayed discovery rule.
