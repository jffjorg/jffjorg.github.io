ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY OF
AMERICA’S MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE TRAVELERS ACTION WITH CONSOLIDATED ACTION FOR
ALL PURPOSES  I.        INTRODUCTION
           On July 21, 2022, in Jokake Construction Services, Inc.
v. Pasadena Oaks Life Properties, LLC, et al., LASC Case No. 22AHCV00484
(the “Jokake Action”), Plaintiff Jokake Construction Services, Inc. (“Jokake”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Pasadena Oaks Life Properties, LLC;
Signature Healthcare Services, LLC; Western Alliance Bank; Kerco, Inc.; TSP
Roof Systems, Inc.; PHL, Inc.; Sierra Fireproofing, Inc.; Carpet Service-Bert
The Dutchman, Inc.; Champion Electric, Inc.; ENC Lath & Plaster Inc.; Integrit
Development Inc.; LMS Reinforcing Steel USA, LP; Graycon, Inc.; Sharpe Interior
Systems, Inc.; and DOES 1 through 50, inclusive, alleging causes of action for:
(1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, (3) abandonment of contract, (4) quantum meruit, (5) account stated,
(6) open book account, (7) breach of the implied warranty of correctness of
plans and specifications, (8) fraudulent misrepresentation, (9) fraudulent
concealment, (10) negligent misrepresentation, (11) violation of prompt payment
statute, (12) foreclosure of mechanic’s lien, and (13) declaratory relief. The
Jokake Action arises from the construction of Las Encinas Hospital, which is a
mental health facility located in Pasadena, California. (Complaint, ¶ 22.) 
           On November 10, 2022, pursuant to a motion to consolidate
filed by Jokake, the Court deemed the Jokake Action as the lead case. (11/10/22
Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court granted the motion to consolidate and
“order[ed] the following cases, 22AHCV00484, 20GDCV00713, 22STCV18721,
22AHCV00352, 22AHCV00394, 22AHCV00468, 22AHCV00477, 22AHCV00510, 22AHCV00516,
22STCV24756, and 22STLC04361, consolidated and assigned to Department P in
Pasadena Courthouse for all purposes.” (11/10/22 Minute Order at p. 1-2.) The
Court’s November 10, 2022 minute order indicated that all future documents must
be filed under the Jokake Action. (11/10/22 Minute Order at p. 2.) 
           On November 10, 2022, the Court issued a nunc pro tunc
order correcting an error in its initial November 10, 2022 minute order and
ordered that LASC Case Nos. 22AHCV00484, 22STCV18721, 22AHCV00352, 22AHCV00394,
22AHCV00468, 22AHCV00477, 22AHCV00510, 22AHCV00516, 22STCV24756, and
22STLC04361 be consolidated and assigned to Department P at Pasadena Courthouse
for all purposes. (11/10/22 Nunc Pro Tunc Order.) 
           On January 19, 2023, Cross-Complainant Travelers Casualty
and Surety Company of America (“TCSCA”) filed a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendant ENC Lath & Plaster, Inc. and Roes 1 through 50, inclusive,
alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract, (2) negligence, (3)
express indemnity, (4) implied indemnity, (5) equitable indemnity, and (6)
declaratory relief. 
           On May 16, 2023, Cross-Complainant ENC Lath & Plaster,
Inc. filed a cross-complaint against TCSCA, Jokake, and Does 1 to 150, alleging
a single cause of action for declaratory relief. 
           On August 1, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the Court
granted Jokake’s motion to “consolidate two cases that were previously ordered
related: 20GDCV00713 and 22STLC05035.” (08/01/23 Minute Order.) The Jokake
Action remained the lead case. (08/01/23 Minute Order.) 
           On August 23, 2023, the Court ordered LASC Case No. 22STCV35720
to be consolidated with the Jokake Action and assigned to Department P at
Pasadena Courthouse for all purposes. (08/23/23 Minute Order.) The Jokake
Action was deemed the lead case. (08/23/23 Minute Order.) 
           On June 18, 2024, TCSCA filed the instant Motion to
Consolidate Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America v. Kincaid
Industries, Inc., et al., LASC Case No. 24NNCV00440 (the “Travelers
Action”), which was filed on March 22, 2024, with the Jokake Action. 
           On July 22, 2024, due to the Court’s network and
connectivity issues, the hearing on the motion to consolidate was continued to
August 2, 2024. (07/22/24 Minute Order.) 
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD        
“When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).) “Coordination of civil actions sharing a common
question of fact or law is appropriate if one judge hearing all of the actions
. . . will promote the ends of justice taking into account whether the common
question of fact or law is predominating and significant to the litigation; the
convenience of the parties, witnesses, and counsel; the relative development of
the actions and the work product of counsel; the efficient utilization; the
calendar of the courts; the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent
rulings, orders, or judgments; and, the likelihood of settlement of the actions
without further litigation should coordination be denied.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
404.1.) 
“The purpose of
consolidation is merely to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding
duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both
actions.” (Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485 [citation
omitted].) “A consolidation of actions does not affect the rights of the
parties.” (Ibid.) Consolidation does not require identical causes of
action in each case, absolute identity of the parties, or identical
allegations. (Ibid.) Where common issues are present in two cases then
consolidation is appropriate. (Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants
Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-79.) 

A motion to consolidate “[i]s deemed a single
motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(2)(A).) Moreover,
a motion to consolidate “[m]ust be served on all attorneys of record and all
nonrepresented partes in all of the cases sought to be consolidated.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(2)(B).) 
Los Angeles County Court
Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1) provides that “[c]ases may not be consolidated unless
they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate two or more cases may
be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments,
have been related in a single department, or if the cases were already assigned
to that department.” 
 
III.     ANALYSIS
In support of the motion, Amanda L. Marutzky
(“Marutzky”), who is counsel for
TCSCA
provides a declaration. Attorney Marutzky does not explicitly attest to the
Jokake Action—and its related consolidated actions—sharing a common question of
law or fact. (Marutzky Decl., ¶¶ 1-10.) Attorney Marutzky, however, does state
that TCSCA issued a payment bond and performance bond naming Jokake as
principal and which guaranteed Jokake’s payment to subcontractors and supplies
and performance on the construction project. (Marutzky Decl., ¶ 4.) Moreover,
the complaint in the Travelers Action arises from the construction of Las
Encinas Hospital. (Complaint, ¶ 12.) Thus, the Court finds that there are
common questions of law and fact between the Jokake Action and the Travelers
Action. 
           The Court, however, cannot grant the
instant motion due to procedural irregularities. Here, the Travelers Action is
currently pending in Department A at the Burbank Courthouse. Los Angeles County
Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1) requires the cases to be related prior to the entry
of an order for consolidation. Upon review of the docket in the Jokake Action,
there has been no order relating the Jokake Action and the Travelers Action.
The Court has also reviewed the docket in the Travelers Action and no order has
been entered in such action relating the Jokake Action to the Travelers Action.
While the motion to consolidate is unopposed, TSCSA must comply with the
procedural requirements pertaining to a motion to consolidate. 
 
IV.     
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 Based on the foregoing, the motion to
consolidate filed by Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
Travelers
Casualty and Surety Company of America is ordered to give notice.
