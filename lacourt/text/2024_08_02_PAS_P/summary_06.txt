And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling denies the motion by Defendants Maria Manuela Florez and Gustavo Adolfo Florez to set aside the entry of default against them. The motion is deemed moot because Plaintiffs Geoffrey Hanes Wall and Kang Seung Lee filed an amended complaint, which opens the default. The amended complaint adds new causes of action and makes material changes to the original complaint, rendering the motion to set aside default unnecessary. The Judge orders the Defendants to answer the complaint within 30 days.
