 Case Number:  BC617479    Hearing Date:   August 2, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING MOTION TO TAX COSTSI.        INTRODUCTION
           This action was filed on April 18,
2016, and arises from a dispute that resulted in the shooting of several people.
Plaintiffs Akop Torosian aka Jack Torosian, Robert Torosian, Marina Fermanyan
and Elda Madatyan filed a complaint against Defendants Arutyun Fitilchyan,
Hrachya Gasparyan, Armen Tashjian, Armen Jermakyan, and Ashon Mkitaryan. The
complaint alleges eight causes of action for: 1) assault and battery, 2)
conspiracy to commit assault and battery, 3) negligence, 4) loss of consortium,
5) abuse of process, 6) extortion and blackmail, 7) conspiracy to commit
extortion and blackmail, and 8) intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
On February 8, 2024, the Court granted Defendants Fitilchyan
and Gasparyan’s motion for terminating sanctions as to Plaintiffs Akop and
Robert’s complaint for failure to obey multiple court orders to respond to
discovery.
On March 11, 2024, Defendants Fitilchyan and Gasparyan filed
their verified memorandum of costs in the amount of $2,420.
On April 8, 2024, Robert filed a motion to tax costs. On July
24, 2024, Defendants Fitilchyan and Gasparyan filed an opposition. No reply has
been filed.
The motion to tax costs is denied
as Plaintiff’s motion is untimely and because he failed to meet his burden to
present evidence and prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable.
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, as a matter of
right, in any action or proceeding absent a statute expressly noting otherwise.
(Cal Civ. Proc. Code § 1032, subd. (b).) Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court has no
discretion to deny costs to a prevailing party. (Nelson v. Anderson (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129).  A prevailing party is (i) a party that
receives a net monetary recovery, (ii) a defendant who obtains a dismissal in
its favor (iii) a defendant, when neither the plaintiff nor defendant attained
any relief and (iv) a defendant, where the plaintiff(s) obtains no
recovery from the defendant. (Cal Civ. Proc. Code § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) 
 
“If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn.
(1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774.) If the items appear to be proper expenses,
they are themselves prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services
were necessarily incurred. If the items appear proper, it is not enough for the
losing party to attack submitted costs by arguing that he thinks the costs were
not necessary or reasonable. Rather, the losing party has the burden to present
evidence and prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable. (Seever v.
Copley Press Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.) However, when items
claimed as costs do not appear on their face as proper and necessary, and the
items are properly challenged by a motion to tax costs, the burden of
establishing the necessity of the items is on the party claiming them as costs.
(See Id.; See also Whitney v. Whitney (1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 577,
585.) “[I]f the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the
burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ladas, 19
Cal.App.4th at 774.)
 
           III.     DISCUSSION
           Plaintiff moves to tax costs.
Defendants are the prevailing parties as their motion for
terminating sanctions was granted. 
Plaintiff argues that the costs set forth in the memorandum
of costs are excessive, unnecessary, and unrecoverable. Specifically, Plaintiff
objects to the initial filing fees of $435 for each defendant. 
“Any notice of motion to
strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the
cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail or email, the period
is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”¿ (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1).) Here, Defendants
served the memorandum of costs by electronic service on March 11, 2024.
(Memorandum of Costs POS.) Thus, this motion would have had to be filed 15 days
plus two court days from March 11, 2024, which would be March 28, 2024. This
motion was filed and served on April 8, 2024, making it untimely.
In any event, as Defendants filed a verified memorandum of
costs, the burden of showing that the costs sought were not reasonable or
necessary is on Plaintiff. Plaintiff only makes conclusory assertions and
offers no declarations or other evidence in support of his assertions.
Plaintiff’s failure to provide a declaration offers the Court no evidence from
which to consider Plaintiff’s claims. As discussed above, Plaintiff has the
burden of proof to show that the item of cost was not reasonably necessary for the
conduct of the litigation; mere conclusory assertions are insufficient to rebut
the prima facie showing costs are proper. (See Jones v. Dumrichob (1998)
63 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1266; County of Kern v. Ginn (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d
1107, 1113-14.) In sum, the court finds that Plaintiff fails to meet his burden
of proof.
   IV.     CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 The motion to tax costs is denied.             Defendants are to give notice of this ruling.
