 Case Number:  23AHCV01963    Hearing Date:   August 2, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PLAINTIFF HELEN WOO’S MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS
FOR ADMISSION AS ADMITTED AND FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST DEFENDANT EON WALK
I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is an action arising from alleged fraudulent actions pertaining
to a lease agreement. On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff Helen Woo (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Eon Walk (“Walk”), Sheila Elayne Linly
Clark (“Clark”), and DOES 1 through 10, alleging causes of action for: (1)
financial and elder abuse, (2) fraud, and (3) breach of contract (rent). 
          On November 1, 2023, Defendant Walk filed an answer to the
complaint. 
          On March 27, 2024, this action was reassigned from the
Honorable Margaret L. Oldendorf to the Honorable Jared D. Moses sitting in
Department P at Pasadena Courthouse effective April 2, 2024. 
          On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant
Motion for Order that Requests for Admission be Deemed Admitted and for
Monetary Sanctions Against Defendant Walk in the Amount of $3,810.00. Pursuant
to the motion, Plaintiff moves for an order that the truth of the matters
specified in her requests for admission served on Defenant Walk on December 18,
2023 be deemed admitted, and that monetary sanctions of $3,810.00 be imposed
against Defendant Walk.
          According to the proof of service attached to the motion,
Defendant Walk was electronically served with the motion on June 17, 2024 at the
electronic service address of “sheilawalk@att.net” which, according to a
November 14, 2023 proof of service filed by Defendant Walk, is the e-mail
address for Defendant Walk. (See 11/14/23 Proof of Electronic Service.) 
          On July 23, 2024, on the Court’s own motion due to the
county wide network outage, the Court continued the hearing on Plaintiff’s
motion to deem the RFAs as admitted to August 2, 2024. (07/23/24 Minute Order.)
          As of July 31, 2024, the motion is unopposed. Any
opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and served at least
nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD       
After service of requests
for admission, a party has 30 days to respond “in writing under oath and
separately to each RFA.” (St Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 774.) When a party fails to serve a timely response to
requests for admission “[t]he party to whom the request was directed waives any
objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product.” (Code Civ. Proc, § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The
requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The
court shall issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made
serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) “It is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction . . . on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated [the]
motion.” (Ibid.) A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
 
III.     ANALYSIS
 
A.  
Evidence
in Support of the Motion 
Counsel for Plaintiff, James A. Gallo (“Gallo”),
declares that Plaintiff’s first set of requests for admissions were served on
Defendant Walk via mail on December 18, 2023. (Gallo Decl., ¶ 2; Exs. 1-2.) Mr.
Gallo states that, prior to March 21, 2024, he discussed with Defendant Walk
that she agreed to accept communications from his office by e-mail. (Gallo
Decl., ¶ 6; Ex. 7.) Defendant Walk has not provided any responses to
Plaintiff’s requests for admissions. (Gallo Decl., ¶ 6.)  
 
B.   
The
Improper Service of the Motion and Other Defects 
          While the Court acknowledges that
Defendant Walk has failed to respond to discovery, the Court finds that the
electronic service of the instant motion was improper. 
          “Electronic service means service of a
document, on a person, by either electronic transmission or electronic
notification. Electronic service may be performed directly by a person,
including a party, by a person’s agent, including the person’s attorney, or
through an electronic filing service provider, and by a court.” (CCP §
1010.6(a)(1)(A).) “If a document is required to be served by certified or
registered mail, electronic service of the document is not authorized.” (CCP §
1010.6(a)(2).) “An unrepresented party may consent to receive electronic
service.” (CCP § 1010.6(c)(2).) Express consent to electronic service is given
by either: (1) serving a notice on all parties and filing the notice with the
court; or (2) manifesting affirmative consent through electronic means with the
court’s electronic filing service provider, and concurrently providing the
party’s electronic address with that consent for the purpose of receiving
electronic service. (CCP § 1010.6(c)(3)(i)-(ii).) “The act of electronic filing
shall not be construed as express consent.” (CCP § 1010.6(c)(3)(ii).)¿¿ 
          The Court notes that Defendant Walk has
always represented herself in pro per in this action. Thus, Defendant
Walk is currently self-represented. Here, the relevant proof of service shows
that Defendant Walk was served with the motion by electronic service. After
reviewing the court file, the Court finds that Defendant Walk has not expressly
consented to receive electronic service under CCP § 1010.6. Thus, electronic
service of the motion was improper under CCP § 1010.6. As such, the Court
cannot grant the motion.¿¿ 
          Additionally, the Court notes that the
notice of motion does not sufficiently set forth the location for the hearing
on the motion as Plaintiff only articulated the department in which the hearing
will occur but did not set forth the courthouse address. Plaintiff was required
to set forth the location of the hearing pursuant to California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1110(b)(1) which states that the notice of motion must set
forth “[t]he . . . location, if ascertainable, of any scheduled hearing . . . .”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(b).)  Defendant
Walk is entitled to proper notice and the failure of Plaintiff to set forth the
courthouse address on the notice of motion does not comport with due
process. 
 
IV.     
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Helen Woo’s
motion to deem RFAs as admitted and for monetary sanctions is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE. 
          Plaintiff Helen Woo to give notice of this order.
          
Dated:  August 2, 2024
