```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to tax costs filed by Plaintiff Robert Torosian. The motion was untimely and the Plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proof to show that the costs claimed by the defendants were not reasonable or necessary. The defendants are the prevailing parties as their motion for terminating sanctions was granted. The judge noted that the Plaintiff only made conclusory assertions without providing any evidence to support his claims, and that mere assertions are insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing that the costs are proper. The judge found that the Plaintiff failed to provide a declaration or other evidence to support his claims, and therefore denied the motion to tax costs.
