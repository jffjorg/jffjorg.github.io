And here is the English-text summary:

This Tentative Ruling denies, without prejudice, Plaintiff Helen Woo's motion to deem requests for admission as admitted and for monetary sanctions against Defendant Eon Walk. The Court finds that the electronic service of the motion was improper because Defendant Walk did not express consent to receive electronic service, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1010.6. Additionally, the Court notes that the notice of motion did not provide sufficient location for the hearing, violating California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1110(b). The Court denies the motion because the service was improper and the notice of motion was defective.
