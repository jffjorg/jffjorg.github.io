And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Ford Motor Company's motion for a protective order to govern the production of confidential materials. The case involves a complaint filed by Jesus Correa Morales aka Jesus Morales against Ford Motor Company and others, alleging causes of action for violation of the Song-Beverly Act and negligent repair. The parties have been discussing a protective order in this case for months, but have been unable to reach an agreement on the form of the order. Ford Motor Company has proposed modifications to the LASC Model Protective Order, but the judge finds that these modifications are not warranted. The judge notes that the LASC Model Protective Order already provides adequate protection for Ford Motor Company's confidential documents, and that the proposed modifications do not establish good cause for their inclusion. The judge therefore denies Ford Motor Company's motion, but allows the parties to execute the LASC Model Protective Order.
