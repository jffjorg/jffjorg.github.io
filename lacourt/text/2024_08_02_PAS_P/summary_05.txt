The Judge, Jared D. Moses, has issued a tentative ruling denying, without prejudice, Plaintiff Helen Woo's motion to deem requests for admission as admitted and for monetary sanctions against Defendant Eon Walk. The motion was filed in an action arising from alleged fraudulent actions pertaining to a lease agreement. The Plaintiff sought to deem the truth of the matters specified in her requests for admission served on Defendant Walk as admitted and to impose monetary sanctions of $3,810.00. The Judge found that the electronic service of the motion was improper and that the Plaintiff failed to set forth the courthouse address on the notice of motion, which is required by law. The Judge also noted that Defendant Walk failed to respond to the requests for admission. The Judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the Plaintiff may refile the motion after addressing the deficiencies identified in the ruling.
