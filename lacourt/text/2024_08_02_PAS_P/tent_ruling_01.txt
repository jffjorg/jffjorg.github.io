  Case Number:  20GDCV00304    Hearing Date:   August 2, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER SUSTAINING THE DEMURRER OF DEFENDANT 360 REMODELING, INC. TO THE FIRST,
SECOND, AND THIRD CAUSES OF ACTION IN THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND; DENYING THE MOTION TO STRIKE AS MOOTI.        INTRODUCTION
          This action arises from Plaintiff Anahid Cholakian
(“Plaintiff”) sustaining water damage to her home located at 250 West Fairview
Avenue, Apartment 302, Glendale, California 91202 (the “Subject Property”). On
March 6, 2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Legend
Construction Services, Inc. (“Legend); Fairview Gardens Community Association
(“Fairview”), Farmers Insurance Company, Inc. (“Farmers”), and DOES 1 through
50, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract, (2)
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) negligence, (4)
negligent hiring/retention, and (5) negligent entrustment. None of the causes
of actions asserted in the complaint are alleged against the “Doe” defendants. 
          On April 20, 2020, Plaintiff filed an amendment to
complaint which identified Doe 1 as Fire Insurance Exchange (“FIE”). 
          On May 13, 2020, pursuant to a request for dismissal filed
by Plaintiff, Defendant Farmers was dismissed from this action without
prejudice. 
          On November 17, 2021, pursuant to a request for dismissal
filed by Plaintiff, Defendant Farmers was dismissed from this action with
prejudice. 
          Also, on November 17, 2021, pursuant to a request for
dismissal filed by Plaintiff, Defendant FIE was dismissed from this action with
prejudice. 
          On August 1, 2022, pursuant to a request for dismissal
filed by Plaintiff, Does 1 to 50 were dismissed from this action without
prejudice. 
          On November 3, 2022, pursuant to a request for dismissal
filed by Plaintiff, Does 1 to 50 were dismissed from this action without
prejudice. 
          On December 1, 2022, pursuant to a stipulation between the
parties, the Court entered an order setting aside the default entered against
Defendant Fairview. 
          On December 20, 2022, Defendant Fairview filed an answer to
the complaint.
          On December 29, 2022, Defendant Fairview filed a cross-complaint
against Defendant Legend and ROES 1 to 20 for: (1) indemnity, and (2)
contribution. 
          On June 6, 2023, Defendant Fairview filed an amendment to
cross-complaint which identified 360 Remodeling, Inc. as Roe 1. 
          On September 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint
which identified 360 Remodeling, Inc. as Doe 2. 
          On September 25, 2023, 360 Remodeling, Inc. filed an answer
to the cross-complaint filed by Defendant Fairview. Also, on such date, 360
Remodeling, Inc. filed a cross-complaint against Defendant Legend and ROES 75
to 95 for: (1) indemnity, and (2) contribution. 
          On October 19, 2023, Defendant 360 Remodeling, Inc. (“360”)
filed a demurrer to the third cause of action for negligence in Plaintiff’s
complaint, which Plaintiff opposed, and Defendant 360 filed a reply brief. 
          On March 11, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court
sustained the demurrer of Defendant 360 to the complaint with 20 days leave to
amend. (03/11/24 Minute Order.) Plaintiff also made an oral motion to set aside
the dismissal of Does 1 through 50 and the Court ordered the dismissals of Does
1 through 50 on August 1, 2022 and November 1, 2022 set aside and vacated.
(03/11/24 Minute Order.) 
          On March 26, 2024, this action was reassigned from the
Honorable Margaret L. Oldendorf to the Honorable Jared D. Moses sitting in
Department P at Pasadena Courthouse effective April 2, 2024. 
          On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative first
amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants Legend, Fairview, Farmers, 360, and
Does 1 through 50, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) negligence,
(2) negligent hiring, and (3) negligent entrustment. While Defendant 360 is not
named in the caption of the FAC, Plaintiff indicates that all causes of action
in the FAC are asserted against Defendant 360. (FAC at p. 2.) 
          On April 22, 2024, Defendant 360 filed the instant demurrer
to the first, second, and third causes of action in the FAC, as well as a
motion to strike. 
          On July 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed respective oppositions to
the demurrer and motion to strike, to which Defendant 360 filed respective
reply briefs on July 25, 2024. 
          The Court notes that Plaintiff’s opposition briefs were
filed and served late; however, Plaintiff’s counsel attests to the county wide
outage as being the cause of the late filing. (Keusseyan Decl., ¶¶ 2, 4-5.)
Thus, the Court will consider Plaintiff’s opposition papers. 
 
II.      DEMURRER
A. Legal Standard
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a
complaint fails to state a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)  A demurrer is treated as
“admitting all material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of
“contentions, deductions or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-Defendants
Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer
is that the pleadings are “deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.”
(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th
593, 604.)  
Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.) Allegations need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted by
judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) 
          Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Ibid.) “If there is any reasonable possibility that the
plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer
without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70
Cal.2d 240, 245.)  
          B. The Meet and
Confer Requirement 
          Before filing a
demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer “in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to the demurrer for the purposes of determining whether an agreement
can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) A motion to strike also requires a similar meet and confer process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 435.5.) 
The
meet and confer requirement has been met as counsel for Defendant 360, Artin
Gholian (“Gholian”), provides a declaration attesting to a telephonic meet and
confer discussions concerning the demurrer and motion to strike. (Gholian
Decl., ¶ 6.)  
C.
Judicial Notice 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant 360’s request for judicial notice. (Evid. Code §§ 452,
453.)  
          D. Demurrer
          Defendant 360 demurs to each cause of action in the FAC on
the grounds that each cause of action is time-barred by the applicable statute
of limitations. Further, Defendant 360 contends that Plaintiff cannot state a
claim for negligence against Defendant 360 as a matter of law. 
 
          Pertinent Allegations of the FAC 
          The Court finds it necessary to set forth the pertinent
allegations of the FAC given that the demurrer is based on the argument
concerning the expiration of the statute of limitations. The FAC alleges the
following: Defendant Fairview is the homeowner’s association for the Subject
Property. (FAC, ¶ 4.) Defendant Fairview hired Defendant 360 to perform roof
repairs and complete work in common areas at the Subject Property. (FAC, ¶ 13;
Ex. A.) Defendant 360 was the general contractor assigned to the task and was
responsible to oversee and supervise the construction activities being
performed. (FAC, ¶ 13.) Unbeknownst to Plaintiff at the time, Defendant 360
hired and supervised a subcontractor, Defendant Legend, to complete the work
instead. (FAC, ¶ 14.) Defendant 360 remodeling remained the general contractor
on the project and was responsible for overseeing the construction activities
and work being performed. (FAC, ¶ 14.) Plaintiff believes that Defendant 360
was in constant communication with Defendant Legend throughout the work being
performed. (FAC, ¶ 14.) 
          Thereafter, on or about June 21, 2019, Plaintiff arrived at
her home and discovered water damage throughout the Subject Property. (FAC, ¶
15.) Plaintiff alleges that on June 21, 2019, it rained and Defendants Legend
and 360 failed to properly tarp the roof over the Subject Property, which
caused significant rainwater to intrude into the Subject Property. (FAC, ¶ 16.)
Following the June 21, 2019 date of loss, Defendant Legend made necessary
repairs to three other units that had water from rain while Defendant 360
supervised the work to make sure it was completed correctly. (FAC, ¶ 17.) After
the follow-up repair work following the June 21, 2019 date of loss, Defendant
360 inspected the roof and did a walk through with Defendant Fairview. (FAC, ¶ 18.)

 
          The Statute of Limitations and Plaintiff’s Delayed
Discovery
          Relevant Law Concerning the Statute of Limitations
An
action for injury to real property is subject to a three-year statute of
limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (b).) “In tort cases, the statute
of limitations generally begins to run upon the occurrence of the last event
essential to the cause of action, even if the plaintiff is unaware that a cause
of action exists.” (Wilshire Westwood Associates v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 732, 739.) “Where the harm at issue is a tortious injury to
property, the injury is considered to be to the property itself, rather than to
the property owner.” (Ibid.) “[W]here a complaint sets forth, or
attempts to set forth, a cause of action against a fictitiously named defendant
and his true name is thereafter discovered and is substituted by amendment, for
statute of limitations purposes, he is considered a party to the action as of
the date of the original pleading.” (Cooper v. Jevne (1976) 56
Cal.App.3d 860, 873.) 
          A cause of action accrues at the time when the cause of
action is complete with all of its elements.” (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery,
Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 806.) “An important exception to the general
rule of accrual is the discovery rule, which postpones accrual of a cause of
action until the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of
action.” (Id. at p. 807.) “A plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of
action when he or she has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its
elements.” (Ibid.) “[S]uspicion of one or more of the elements of a
cause of action, coupled with knowledge of any remaining elements, will
generally trigger the statute of limitations period.” (Ibid.) “The
discovery rule only delays accrual until the plaintiff has, or should have,
inquiry notice of the cause of action.” (Ibid.) “In order to rely on the
discovery rule for delayed accrual of a cause of action, [a] plaintiff whose
complaint shows on its face that his claim would be barred without the benefit
of the discovery rule must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and
manner of discovery and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery
despite reasonable diligence.” (Id. at p. 808.) “In assessing the
sufficiency of the allegations of delayed discovery, the court places the
burden on the plaintiff to show diligence; conclusory allegations will not
withstand demurrer.” (Ibid.)¿¿ 
          Analysis as to the Statute of Limitations Issue 
          Here, the operative FAC indicates that the date of loss pertaining
to the Subject Property was June 21, 2019. (FAC, ¶ 15.) Plaintiff filed her
initial complaint on March 6, 2020, in which Defendant 360 was not named as a
defendant and no cause of action was asserted against any doe defendant
therein. In her opposition brief, Plaintiff does not dispute that the FAC does
not relate back to the filing of the original complaint as it concerns
Defendant 360. 
          Defendant 360 was not brought into this action until an
amendment to the cross-complaint was filed by Defendant Fairview on June 6,
2023. However, Plaintiff did not bring Defendant 360 into this action until
September 7, 2023, when Plaintiff amended her original complaint which named
Defendant 360 as “Doe 1.”  
          The Court finds that on its face, the FAC against Defendant
360 is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The Court finds that
Plaintiff’s reliance on Fox v. Ethicon-Endo Surgery, Inc., supra,
35 Cal.4th 797 is inapposite as in that the case the plaintiff set forth
allegations in the operative first amended complaint as to delayed discovery
and reasonable diligence. (Fox v. Ethicon-Endo Surgery, Inc., supra,
35 Cal.4th 797, 805.) 
          Here, the FAC only makes a conclusory allegation as to the
discovery of Defendant 360’s role in the construction work at issue. (FAC, ¶
14.) While Plaintiff may have in fact discovered Defendant 360’s involvement well
after the filing of the complaint, Plaintiff did not set forth any allegations
of reasonable diligence in the FAC. (FAC, ¶¶ 20-92.) The FAC does not allege
the time and manner of discovery or the inability to make earlier discovery
despite reasonable diligence as to the identity of Defendant 360. Thus,
Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to invoke the delayed discovery
rule. 
          Given that Plaintiff has not stated sufficient facts in the
FAC to invoke the delayed discovery rule, the Court finds that the FAC is
barred on its face as to Defendant 360. 
          Due to the Court’s analysis as to the statute of
limitations issue above, such analysis is dispositive of the demurrer before
the Court. 
          The Court does not find that there is no reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. The Court therefore SUSTAINS the demurrer
of Defendant 360 to the first, second, and third causes of action in the FAC
with leave to amend. 
 
III.     MOTION
TO STRIKE 
Defendant 360 moves to strike the allegations of the
FAC on the grounds that the allegations asserted against it are barred by the
statute of limitations. Given that the Court has sustained the demurrer to the
FAC with leave to amend, the Court DENIES the motion to strike as MOOT. 
 
IV.      
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 Defendant 360’s demurrer is sustained with 20
days leave to amend as to the first, second, and third causes of action in the
FAC.
Defendant
360’s motion to strike is denied as moot. 
          Defendant 360 Remodeling, Inc. to give notice.
