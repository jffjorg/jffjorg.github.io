And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to a sexual harassment case. The court has overruled objections to certain exhibits on hearsay grounds, where the exhibit's relevance to the truth of the matter was unclear. Additionally, the court has found that there is no admissible evidence to support the existence of a sexual relationship between employees. The court cites several legal precedents, including Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009), Granadino v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2015), and Miller v. Department of Corrections (2005). The court has also addressed the plaintiff's sexual favoritism theory of discrimination, which is based on Miller v. Department of Corrections (2005). The court has ruled that the sexual harassment claims are asserted only against Regents and Osborne, and not against Sood or Bernardo.
