is not even admissible evidence that such a relationship even existed.
“[S]peculation is not evidence.” (Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 243, 289.) Thus, this evidence does not raise a triable issue
of material fact. (Granadino v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 411, 415 [“‘[R]esponsive evidence that gives rise to no more than
mere speculation cannot be regarded as substantial, and is insufficient to
establish a triable issue of material fact.’ ”].)

arising from Miller v. Department of Corrections (2005) 36 Cal.4th 446,
the Court addresses this theory below. 


[4]            The sexual
harassment claims are asserted only against Defendants Regents and Osborne, and
