 
            This is an employment case brought
by Plaintiff Jennifer Walske (Plaintiff) against her employer, Regents of the
University of California (Regents), and her former supervisors, Defendants Alfred Osborne
(Osborne), Antonio Bernardo (Bernardo), and Sanjay Sood (Sood) (jointly, Defendants).

 
The Complaint, the operative pleading, alleges claims for: (1.)
discrimination based on sex; (2.) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (3.) sexual
harassment; (4.) failure to prevent discrimination, (5.) hostile work
environment in violation of FEHA, (6.) retaliation in violation of Labor Code
section 1102.5; (7.) retaliation in violation of Government Code Section
8547.10; (8.) intentional infliction of emotional distress and (9.) negligent
infliction of emotional distress.
 
On a September 9, 2022 ruling on a demurrer, the Court sustained
Defendant Regent’s demurrer to the ninth cause of action for negligent
infliction of emotional distress. 
 
Now, Defendants move for summary judgment, or in the alternative,
summary adjudication. Plaintiff opposes the motion.
 
On April 18, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the
eighth cause of action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress as to
all Defendants. Thus, the motion for summary adjudication of this cause of
action (Issues Nos. 14-17 as to Regents, Issues Nos. 23-25 as to Defendant Osborne,
Nos. 30-32 as to Defendant Sood, and Issues Nos. 37-39 as to Defendant Bernardo)
is moot.
 
            The
motion for summary judgment is granted. 
 
Evidentiary Issues:
 
 Plaintiff’s objections to the declaration of Osborne
is ruled as follows: Nos. 1-2, 4-6, 8-10 are overruled, No. 3(1) is sustained
in part, and No. 7(1) is sustained. Plaintiff’s objections to the declaration
of Sood is ruled as follows: Nos. 1-4, 9-10, 12, 14, 15 are overruled, No. 5(1)
is sustained in part, No. 6(1) is sustained in part, No. 7(1) is sustained in

LEGAL STANDARD
“The party moving for summary judgment
bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact
and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.) A triable issue of
material fact exists if the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to
find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in
accordance with the applicable standard of proof. (Ibid.) 
 
            “When deciding whether to grant
summary judgment, the court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the
papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection), as well
as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light
most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v.
Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 463,
467; Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
             Defendants move for summary judgment on the
grounds that Plaintiff cannot establish all the elements of her claims and there
are no triable issue of material fact in dispute.  
 
            In support of the motion for summary
judgment and summary adjudication, Defendants argue Plaintiff cannot show any
of the purported adverse employment actions were the result of discrimination
and retaliation and it had a non-discriminatory reason for its adverse
employment decisions. Defendants also argue there is no evidence to support the
existence of harassment or a hostile work environment.  
 
Discrimination based on Gender/Sex Cause of Action:
 
            Defendant Regent moves for summary adjudication
of the first cause of action on the grounds that Plaintiff cannot show an
adverse employment action based on her sex/gender.
 
            FEHA prohibits an employer from
discriminating against any employee based on race, age, sex or other protected
characteristics. (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (a).) To prevail on such a claim,
the plaintiff must sufficiently plead and prove all elements of a
discrimination cause of action: (1) that she was a member of a protected class;
(2) that she was adequately performing the essential functions of her position;
(3) that she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) that the circumstances
suggest a discriminatory motive. (Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc. (2000)
24 Cal.4th 317, 355; see also De Jung v. Superior Court (2008) 169
Cal.App.4th 533, 551 [requiring causal relationship between discriminatory
animus and adverse employment action].)
 
             “California uses the three-stage
burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying
claims of discrimination based on a theory of disparate treatment,” known as
the McDonnell Douglas test. (Scotch v. Art Institute of California
(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 986, 1004.) Under the McDonnell Douglas test, “the
plaintiff [first] has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of
discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff meets this burden, the employer must
offer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment
decision. Third, and finally, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the
employer's proffered reason pretextual.” (Knight v. Hayward Unified School
Dist. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 121, 129.)
 
            “‘A defendant employer's motion for summary
judgment slightly modifies the order of these [McDonnell Douglas]
showings.’” (Scotch, supra, 173 Cal.App.4th at p. 1005.) To
prevail on summary judgment, the defendant employer is “required to show either
that (1) plaintiff could not establish one of the
[prima facie] elements of the FEHA claim, or (2) there was a legitimate,
nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff's
employment.” (Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1237, 1247.)
 
            Here, Defendant seeks to show both
that Plaintiff cannot establish one of the prima facie elements of the FEHA
claim, and there was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for any adverse
employment action.
 
            In the Complaint (and opposition),
Plaintiff identifies three events that she contends constitute adverse actions:
(1) Defendants’ decision to appoint Delmas as Permanent Director, instead of
Plaintiff; (2) the change in her course schedule and resulting reduction in
salary; and (3) not renewing her appointment contract. 
 
First, Defendant argues that – notwithstanding the allegations in the
Complaint – Plaintiff has only identified one adverse employment action – the
decision not to renew Plaintiff’s employment appointment contract in 2022. Defendant’s
argument on this point is not well taken.
 
            “[T]he FEHA's discrimination
provision addresses only explicit changes in the ‘terms, conditions, or
privileges of employment’ (§ 12940, subd. (a)); that is, changes involving some
official action taken by the employer. [Citation.]” (Roby v. McKesson
Corp. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 686, 706.) Such official action by an employer with
respect to an employee includes “hiring, firing, failing to promote, adverse
job assignment, significant change in compensation or benefits, or official
disciplinary action.” (Ibid.)
 
            Here, the challenged adverse
employment actions constitute – in effect – a denial of a promotion and a
reduction in salary – which both meet the definition of a change to the
conditions and privileges of employment. 
 
            Defendant also argues that there is
no evidence showing a discriminatory animus based on sex/gender as the cause
for these adverse employment decisions. In particular, Defendant notes that the
only person who Plaintiff alleges perpetrated any gender bias was Defendant Osborne and the
evidence pertaining to Osborne showing discriminatory animus is insufficient.
(DSS 28, 29-46.) 
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff submits evidence
to support the discriminatory motive. Specifically, she states that Defendant
Osborne made “gendered comments to her” about the way she dressed and he
engaged in an inappropriate relationship with his female subordinate – Elaine
Hagan (Hagan), the Executive Director of the Price Center – that influenced his
decisions in treating Plaintiff differently than her male counterparts. 
 
            Although Plaintiff makes this
argument, the underlying evidence is insufficient to raise a triable issue of
material fact as to discriminatory animus based on sex/gender.
 
            First, as to the comment on
Plaintiff’s clothing, the undisputed evidence is that Osborne, on a single
occasion, relayed to Plaintiff that students made comments about her clothing being
too expensive and that it was “tone deaf” given the social impact nature of the
courses she taught. (DSS 28 [Osborne Decl., ¶ 16].) Notably, Osborne merely
repeated the concerns raised by students and these concerns were not gender-specific.
 
            Further, there is no evidence that the
alleged relationship[2]
between Osborne and Hagan had any gender/sex specific impact on Plaintiff. The
only discriminatory animus evidence pertaining to this relationship is that Plaintiff
informed Brett Trueman, a UCLA Anderson professor and faculty representative
for UCLA’s Office of Equity, Diversity & Inclusion, about her “concerns
that her immediate supervisor and UCLA Anderson’s then Interim Dean Osborne,
made inappropriate gendered comments to her, treated male faculty differently
and more favorably, and appeared to be engaged in an improper romantic
relationship with a female subordinate, resulting in a hostile work environment
for those female faculty and staff who were not in a relationship with him.”
(PAF 1 [Walske Decl., ¶ 4].) 
 
However, neither her report nor any other
evidence shows any disparate impact based on gender that could lead to
inference of discriminatory animus. That is, there no evidence at all as to how
– if this relationship existed – it negatively impacted Plaintiff because of
her gender.[3] 
 
            The only other evidence was Plaintiff’s
comments to “Lilian Hsu as part of UCLA’s second ‘Climate Assessment’ of the
faculty at UCLA Anderson—at the behest of UCLA’s Provost—focusing on, among
other issues, the treatment of female faculty [wherein] [Plaintiff] described
for Ms. Hsu that, among other seemingly discriminatory conduct, Osborne had
made gendered comments to her in the context of personnel-related discussions
and decisions, i.e., that Dr. Walske was told that she was promoted to
permanent Faculty Director as she had been promised but then demoted because of
the way she dresses, only to be promoted and demoted again.” (PAF 22.) 
 
            Based on the foregoing, there is no
triable issue of material fact showing that any adverse employment decision by
Osborne was the result of gender/sex discrimination. Thus, Plaintiff’s claim
that Osborne’s gender discrimination also impacted decisions made by Defendants
Bernado and Sood also fail. 
 
            There is no evidence creating a triable
issue of material fact in dispute. The motion for summary adjudication of the
first cause of action (Issue No. 1) is granted. 
 
Harassment/Hostile Work Environment Causes of Action:
 
            In moving for summary adjudication
of the harassment and hostile work environment causes of action, the parties
rely on similar arguments and evidence as the discrimination claim. 
 
FEHA’s “prohibition against sexual
harassment includes protection from a broad range of conduct, ranging from
expressly or impliedly conditioning employment benefits on submission to or
tolerance of unwelcome sexual advances, to the creation of a work environment
that is hostile or abusive on the basis of sex.” (Miller
v. Department of Corrections (2005) 36 Cal.4th 446, 461.) A hostile
work environment sexual harassment claim requires a plaintiff employee to show:
(1) he or she was subjected to unwelcome sexual advances, conduct or comments;
(2) the harassment was based on sex; and (3) the harassment was sufficiently
severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive
working environment. (Lyle v. Warner Brothers Television Productions
(2006) 38 Cal.4th 264, 279; Kelley v. The Conco Companies (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 191, 202–203.) To be a hostile work environment, it “must be both
objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable person would find
hostile or abusive, and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so.” (Faragher
v. City of Boca Raton (1998) 524 U.S. 775, 787; ANA Maria
Soares v. California (E.D. Cal., June 28, 2016, No.
CV21600128WBSEFB) 2016 WL 3519411, at *2.)
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that her claim for hostile work environment
harassment is based on sexual favoritism by a supervisor – citing Miller v. Department of Corrections (2005) 36 Cal.4th
446 – and the “gendered comment” Osborne made about Plaintiff’s designer
clothing. 
 
Generally, under California law, “a romantic relationship between a
supervisor and an employee does not, without more, give rise to a sexual
discrimination or sexual harassment claim under either the FEHA or the public
policy of the state.” (Proksel v. Gattis
(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1626, 1631.) Favoritism of a romantic
partner “may be unfair, but it does not discriminate against women or men...,
since both are disadvantaged for reasons other than their genders.” (Nielsen
v. Trofholz Technologies, Inc. (E.D. Cal. 2010) 750 F.Supp.2d 1157, 1165-1166
[citing Proksel v. Gattis (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1626, 1630] [emphasis
added].) 
 
Our Supreme Court has explained that “an employee may establish an
actionable claim of sexual harassment under the FEHA by demonstrating that
widespread sexual favoritism was severe or pervasive enough to alter his or her
working conditions and create a hostile work environment.” (Miller v. Department of Corrections (2005) 36 Cal.4th
446, 466.) 
 
But Miller is distinguishable from the facts here. In Miller,
a male corrections officer engaged in sexual relationships with three
subordinate female employees. (36 Cal. 4th at 466.) He promoted these women and
awarded them with job benefits, while denying advancement opportunities to the
plaintiffs, who did not have sexual contact with him. (Id.) The Miller
plaintiffs also observed the officer engaging in sexual activity in the
workplace and claimed that he touched some of them inappropriately. (Id.
at 467.) 
 
The Miller court explained that “when such sexual favoritism
in a workplace is sufficiently widespread it may create an actionable hostile
work environment in which the demeaning message is conveyed to female employees
that they are viewed by management as ‘sexual playthings’ or that the way
required for women to get ahead in the workplace is to engage in sexual conduct
with their supervisors or the management.” (Miller, supra, 36 Cal.4th at
p. 451.) The Miller court stated such a demeaning atmosphere may be
actionable by both men and women. (Id. at pp. 464, 470.)
 
The Supreme Court later characterized the nature of the harassment in
Miller as the “offensive sex-biased message that the supervisor
conveyed.” (Roby v. McKesson Corp. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 686, 708 [emphasis
in original].)
 
Here, Plaintiff has alleged that a rumored romantic relationship
between Professor Osborne and his subordinate, Hagan—about which Plaintiff had
a belief but no actual knowledge—created a hostile work environment that
altered the conditions of her employment. However, Plaintiff submits no evidence
of how she experienced an abusive work environment based on this alleged relationship.  She offers no foundation for her belief and cites
nothing more than departmental gossip. Moreover, there is no evidence that
Hagan experienced special treatment at the expense of Plaintiff – that is,
Hagan did not receive the title of Faculty Director, or received the teaching
schedule Plaintiff wanted. Plaintiff also does not present any evidence that
suggests that her male colleagues suffered any less than her or her female
co-workers because of Osborne’s alleged preferential treatment of Hagan. In
fact, there is no evidence of any differential treatment suffered by Plaintiff
as result of Osborne’s alleged relationship with Hagan. Thus, to the extent
that Plaintiff’s harassment claims are based on this theory, they are not
actionable.
 
In fact, even in Miller, the court noted that the plaintiffs had
viable claims because they “alleged far more than that a supervisor
engaged in an isolated workplace sexual affair and accorded special benefits to
a sexual partner. They proffered evidence demonstrating the effect of
widespread favoritism on the work environment, namely the creation of an
atmosphere that was demeaning to women.” (Miller, supra, 36 Cal.4th at
p. 470.)
 
 No evidence, including Plaintiff's own declaration, suggests
that she was subjected to a hostile work environment caused by
sexual favoritism in the workplace. 
 
Finally, Osborne’s comment on Plaintiff’s clothing alone are insufficient
to create a hostile work environment. That is, Osborne’s alleged comment about
Plaintiff’s clothes was neither severe nor pervasive conduct. Osborne made a
single comment about Plaintiff’s clothes to Plaintiff around March 2019, noting
that students had complained to Osborne that Plaintiff’s expensive clothes were
“tone deaf” because she was teaching courses on benefitting underserved
communities. (Osborne Dec. ¶ 16.) Even if Osborne should not have relayed these
comments and this comment could be treated as gender based, the comment was not
severe enough alone to create a hostile environment. (Lyle v. Warner Bros.
Television Prods. (2006) 38 Cal.4th 364, 283.) In fact, as the Court noted
above, even Plaintiff’s characterization of 
this comment as a “gendered comment” is questionable.
 
The motion for summary adjudication of the
third cause of action for harassment (Issue 4) and the fifth cause of action
for hostile work environment (Issue No. 7) is granted as to Regents. The motion
for summary adjudication of these causes of action (Issue No. 18-19.) are also
granted as to Defendant Osborne for the same reasons.[4]

 
Retaliation Causes of Action:
 
            Plaintiff alleges
three separate retaliation causes of action – (1) retaliation pursuant to FEHA;
(2) retaliation pursuant to Labor Code section 1102.5; and (3) retaliation
pursuant to Government Code section 8547.10. 
 
1.    
Retaliation under FEHA:
 
Government Code Section 12940,
subdivision (h) “makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer ‘to
discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the
person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the
person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under
this part.’ ” (Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc.
(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1035 (Yanowitz).)
Likewise, an employer may be liable for its failure to prevent unlawful
retaliation. (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (k).) 
 
FEHA discrimination and
retaliation claims continue to adhere to the McDonnell Douglas
“three-stage burden-shifting test.” (Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc.
(2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 354 (Guz); Department of Corrections &
Rehabilitation v. State Personnel Bd. (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 908, 924.) 
 
“The central issue is ... whether
the evidence as a whole supports a reasoned inference that the challenged
action was the product of discriminatory or retaliatory animus. The employer's
mere articulation of a legitimate reason for the action cannot answer this
question; it can only dispel the presumption of improper motive that would
otherwise entitle the employee to a judgment in his favor. Thus, citing a
legitimate reason for the challenged action will entitle the employer to
summary judgment only when the employee’s showing, while sufficient to invoke
the presumption, is too weak to sustain a reasoned inference in the employee's
favor.’ ” (Light v. Department of Parks & Recreation (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 75, 94 [italics omitted].)
 
“Generally in cases involving
affirmative adverse employment actions, pretext may be demonstrated by showing
‘ “the proffered reason had no basis in fact, the proffered reason did not
actually motivate the discharge, or, the proffered reason was insufficient to
motivate discharge.” ’ ” (Soria v. Univision Radio Los
Angeles, Inc. (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 570, 594.) “ ‘ “Whether judgment
as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a
number of factors. These include the strength of the plaintiff’s prima facie
case, the probative value of the proof that the employer’s explanation is
false, and any other evidence that supports the employer’s case . . ..” ’ ” (Sandell
v. Taylor-Listug, Inc. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 309.)
 
2.    
Labor Code section 1102.5 and
Government Code section 8547.10:
 
Labor Code section 1102.5 provides
that “[a]n employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not
retaliate against an employee for disclosing information, or because the
employer believes that the employee disclosed or may disclose information, to a
government or law enforcement agency, to a person with authority over the
employee or another employee who has the authority to investigate, discover, or
correct the violation or noncompliance . . . if the employee has reasonable
cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal
statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal
rule or regulation, regardless of whether disclosing the information is part of
the employee's job duties.” (Labor Code, § 1102.5, subd. (b).)
 
To establish a prima facie case of
retaliation under section 1102.5(b), a plaintiff “ ‘must show (1) she
engaged in a protected activity, (2) her employer subjected her to an adverse
employment action, and (3) there is a causal link between the two.’ ” (McVeigh
v. Recology San Francisco (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 443, 468.) An employee
engages in protected activity under section 1102.5, subdivision
(b), when he or she discloses to a governmental agency or employer
reasonably based suspicion of illegal activity. (McVeigh, supra, at
p. 469; Mueller v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 809,
821-822 [Section 1102.5(b) “requires that to come within its provisions, the
activity disclosed by an employee must violate a federal or state law, rule or
regulation. [Citation.]”].) 
 
Labor Code section 1102.6 provides
the framework for evaluating a claim of whistleblower retaliation under section
1102.5: “Once an employee-whistleblower establishes by a preponderance of the
evidence that retaliation was a contributing factor in the employee’s
termination, demotion, or other adverse action, the employer the bears the
burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that it would have
taken the same action ‘for legitimate, independent reasons.’” (Lawson v. PPG
Architectural Finishes, Inc. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 703, 707.) Thus, unlike the
FEHA claim, “[u]nder section 1102.6, a plaintiff does not need to show that the
employer’s nonretaliatory reason was pretextual. Even if the employer had a
genuine, nonretaliatory reason for its adverse action, the plaintiff still
carries the burden assigned by statute if it is shown that the employer also
had at least one retaliatory reason that was a contributing factor in the
action.” (Id. at p. 716.)
 
Similarly, Government
Code section 8547.10 provides: 
 
“In any civil action or
administrative proceeding, once it has been demonstrated by a preponderance of
the evidence that an activity protected by this article was a contributing
factor in the alleged retaliation against a former, current, or prospective
employee, the burden of proof shall be on the supervisor, manager, or
appointing power to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the
alleged action would have occurred for legitimate, independent reasons even if
the employee had not engaged in protected disclosures or refused an illegal
order.”
 
The “language in Government Code
section 8547.10 mirrors the language of Labor Code section 1102.6, which states
that ‘once it has been demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that an
activity proscribed by Section 1102.5 was a contributing factor in the alleged
prohibited action against the employee, the employer shall have the burden of
proof to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged action
would have occurred for legitimate, independent reasons even if the employee
had not engaged in activities protected by Section 1102.5.’ ” (Scheer v. Regents of the University of California
(2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 904, 915-916.)
 
For a Labor Code section 1102.5
whistleblower claim and a claim under Government Code section 8547.10, a
plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) plaintiff
complained about activities that she reasonably believed violated a state or
federal statute, rule, or regulation; (2) she suffered a contested employment
action; and (3) her complaint was a contributing factor in the contested
employment action. (Lawson v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc. (2022) 12
Cal.5th 703, 718; Lab. Code, §§ 1102.5, 1102.6; Gov. Code, § 8547.10, subd. (e).)
 
3.     Relevant Facts to the Retaliation Claims:



            Relevant to the
retaliation claims, in early April 2019, Plaintiff met with Brett Trueman (Trueman),
a UCLA Anderson professor and faculty representative for UCLA’s Office of
Equity, Diversity & Inclusion, to discuss with him her gender
discrimination concerns regarding Defendant Osborne. (PAF 1.) On June 19, 2019,
Defendant Osborne learned of Plaintiff’ gender discrimination complaint against
him. (PAF 30.) 
 
Further, on August 15, 2019 Lillian Hsu
advised Plaintiff that she “reported the incident [Plaintiff] described
involving [Defendant] Osborne to the Title IX Office.” (PAF 26.) On August 24,
2019, Plaintiff informed Defendant Bernardo of her Title IX complaint against
Defendant Osborne. (PAF 27.)
 
Then, on August 28, 2019, Defendant Bernardo
made the decision not to appoint Plaintiff as the permanent Faculty Director by
specifically informing Plaintiff that he had selected someone else as Faculty
Director for Impact@Anderson. (PSS 6.) 
 
Further, Bernardo sought and received
input from several individuals in making this decision. (PAF 8-23.) This input
is the basis for Plaintiff’s “cat’s paw” theory, where she attempts to establish
the element of causation by showing that any of the persons involved in
bringing about the adverse action held the requisite animus, provided that such
person’s animus operated as a ‘but-for’ cause, i.e., a force without with the
adverse action would not have happened.” (Reeves v. Safeway Stores, Inc.
(2004) 121 Cal. App.4th 95, 108.) Specifically, she argues that Professor
Osborne’s retaliatory animus can be imputed onto Dean Bernando. 
 
            Here, Plaintiff submits evidence
that, in April 2019, Professor Osborne learned of Plaintiff’s report of gender
discrimination and hostile work environment brought against him to Brett
Trueman, a UCLA Anderson professor and faculty representative for UCLA’s Office
of Equity, Diversity & Inclusion. Less than a month later, on May 17, 2019,
Professor Osborne provided a less than positive review of Plaintiff’s
performance as Interim Faculty Director to be used in connection with her
Fourth Year Appraisal, which—according to UCLA Anderson—was “a necessary
precursor to a promotion to Adjunct Associate Professor.” (PAF 7-16.) This, in
turn, caused Plaintiff’s Fourth Year Appraisal to change from “favorable” to
“favorable with reservations.” (PSS 8 [Ex. 46].) Specifically, Professor
Osborne provided a “secret review” to the Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC)
less than a month after he and Hagan were advised by Professor Trueman of Plaintiff’s
complaints about them both. (PSS 8.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff’s protected activity
are her complaints involving gender discrimination. Although the Court found
she has not shown gender discrimination, the claims do not require actual
illegal activity – only that Plaintiff had a reasonable belief that their
employer was engaged in the illegal activity to qualify for protection under
either statute. (People ex rel. Garcia-Brower v. Kolla's, Inc.
(2023) 14 Cal.5th 719, 731; Nejadian v. County of Los Angeles (2019) 40
Cal.App.5th 703, 719.) Retaliation for her good faith discrimination claim is
sufficient. 
 
            Further, the purported retaliatory
acts occurred after the protected activity, as required by law. (Kourounian
v. California Dept. of Tax & Fee Administration (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th
1100, 1113-14.)
 
            Plaintiff Walske’s evidence is insufficient to raise a triable issue of
material fact in dispute with respect to the retaliation claims. 
 
            The proximity in time between the
protected activity and the adverse employment action is sufficient to raise an
inference of a causal link between these two events to make a prima facie
showing. (Morgan v. Regents of University of Cal. (2000) 88 Cal.App.4th
52, 69 [“ ‘The causal link may be established by an inference derived from
circumstantial evidence, “such as the employer's knowledge that the [employee]
engaged in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected
action and allegedly retaliatory employment decision.” ’ ”].)  
 
However, to rely solely on temporal proximity to establish a prima
facie case, the proximity must be “ ‘very close.’ ” (Zirpel v. Alki David
Productions, Inc. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 563, 578; see e.g. Loggins v.
Kaiser Permanente Internat. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1110, fn. 6 [nine
months does not qualify as a “ ‘relatively short time’ ”].) Moreover, it is
well established that, while evidence of temporal proximity is relevant as to
pretext, it is not sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact. (Arteaga v.
Brink's, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 327, 353 [“But temporal proximity
alone is not sufficient to raise a triable issue as to pretext once the
employer has offered evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the
termination.”]; see Chen v. County of Orange (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 926,
931 [“Mere sequence is not enough—that would be the classic logical fallacy of
‘post hoc ergo propter hoc’ (after the fact, therefore because of the fact.”].)
            
In the face of the legitimate non-retaliatory
reason for the adverse employment action, Plaintiff has failed to raise a
triable issue of material fact as to these retaliation claims as to Bernardo
and Osborne. 
 
As to Osborne, he had legitimate,
non-retaliatory business reasons for his decision not to allow Plaintiff to
remove “interim” from her title. First, the then-Permanent Director was still
employed by Defendant. (DSS 3 [Osborne Dec. ¶ 6, Exs. 24, 27].) Second, Osborne,
who was then serving as Interim Dean while the search for new dean was underway,
wanted the new permanent Dean to select the new Permanent Director. (DSS 27 [Osborne
Dec. ¶¶ 8, 10].) 
 
With respect to Bernardo, he appointed
Delmas as Faculty Director over Walske because Delmas, also female, had more
experience in the field, had been at Anderson longer, and because he considered
her a superior candidate. (DSS 34.)
 
On September 15, 2019, Plaintiff
contacted the Office of the President (UCOP) regarding a whistleblower
complaint. (PAF 23.) However, due to “long gaps in communication”, Plaintiff did
not file a whistleblower retaliation complaint until May 4, 2020, alleging
retaliation for reporting Osborne’s alleged relationship with Hagan. On June
24, 2020, Plaintiff signed and returned her contract for the 2020/2021 academic
year. (DSS 23; PSS 23; PAF 31.) In August 2020, Osborne learned of Plaintiff’s
Title IX. (DSS 66; PSS 66.) 
 
On October 8, 2020, Defendant Sood,
Faculty Chairman, announced to the members of the Investment Committee,
including Plaintiff, that he would like to nominate Professor Osborne to serve
on the committee. (PAF 32.) Plaintiff responded to Professor Sood, saying “I
don’t feel comfortable having [Professor Osborne] join the [Investment
Committee] at this time, given the ongoing Title IX investigation. This seems
to have come out of nowhere as it hasn’t previously been discussed.” (PAF 33.)

 
On May 24, 2021, the Title IX
office issued its report of the investigation of Plaintiff’s complaints about
Professor Osborne. (PAF 41.) On June 10, 2021, Patty Gonzalez Johnson, Senior
Manager of Academic Services & Operation, emailed Professor Sood, stating,
“I just wanted to circle back on Jennifer Walske because I recall sometime back
you had asked for us to hold-off moving anything. Please let me know if I can
proceed with scheduling her courses and moving her winter course to Fall.” (PAF
42.) On June 11, 2021, Professor Sood responded to Ms. Johnson, stating, “I’m
still working on this so let’s hold off for now.” (PAF 43.) As of June 18,
2021, Professor Sood had a draft contract for Plaintiff’s for 2021-2022
academic year: 100% Fall and Winter, 56.25% Spring, Total compensation:
$159,729.12. (PAF 47.)
 
Then, on June 23, 2021, Mohammed
Cato, Title IX Director, advised Defendant Sood that the Title XI investigation
determined “there was INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE to find Dr. Osborne responsible for
a violation of the Non Discrimination Policy, APM 015 and APM 035.” (PAF 55.)
Less than a month later, on July 20, 2021, Plaintiff received her contract for
the 2021-2022 academic year, reflecting a 50% reduction in pay and reduced
course load: 50% Fall, 56.25% Winter, 50% Spring, Total compensation:
$97,395.84. (PAF 63.) On September 9, 2021, Defendant issued yet another
proposed contract for Plaintiff for the 2021-2022 academic year, which further
reduced her course load and pay: 50% Fall, 25% Winter, 50% Spring, Total
compensation: $77,916.68. (PAF 74.)
 
Although the timeline of events is
somewhat convoluted, there is arguably some temporal proximity between
Plaintiff’s protected activity and the adverse employment actions. However, the
temporal proximity evidence is seriously undermined by the fact that that Defendant’s
first renewal of her appointment, issued on November 8, 2019 (after her alleged
protected disclosures), included more opportunities to teach with a significant
overload compensation. (DSS 36 [Sood Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. 11].) Further, Plaintiff requested
to reduce her courseload multiple times and her schedule and compensation were
adjusted accordingly. (DSS 37 [Sood Decl., ¶¶ 11-12, Exs. 12-15].) In fact, one
course she was scheduled to teach was cancelled due to low student enrollment.
(DSS 39-40 [Sood Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. 16].)
 
In AY 2020-2021, Plaintiff’s
courseload was reduced because she received poor student evaluations, was not
teaching in the manner directed, and because she refused to teach at all in
Fall 2021 and Winter 2022. (DSS 41 [Sood Dec. ¶¶ 16-18, Ex. 26].) Plaintiff’s
refusal to teach led to Sood’s decision to not renew her appointment. (DSS 46
[Sood Decl., ¶ 20].)
 
Again, the temporal proximity from
the conclusion of certain protected activity and the adverse action is weak;
even assuming it is sufficient to raise an inference of causal connection
between the two events, it is insufficient to overcome the clear and convincing
evidence of legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for the adverse action. 
 
The motion for summary adjudication of the second, sixth and
seventh causes of action is granted. 
 
Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation Cause
of Action:
 
            Based
on the Court’s ruling to summarily adjudicate the causes of action for discrimination
and retaliation, the cause of action for failure to prevent discrimination must
also fail. (Trujillo
v. North County Transit Dist. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 280, 289 [“Employers
should not be held liable to employees for failure to take necessary steps to
prevent such conduct, except where the actions took place and were not
prevented.”].) 
 
            Therefore, the motion or summary adjudication
of the fourth cause of action (Issue No. 5) is granted. 
 
Issue of Punitive Damages:
 
The motion for summary adjudication of the
issue of punitive damages has been rendered moot based on the Court’s ruling to
grant summary adjudication as to all underlying causes of action.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion for summary judgment is granted.
