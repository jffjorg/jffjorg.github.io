CONNER JAMES
  HENNESSY.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV01344
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  March 21, 2024



 
Defendant Conner
James Hennessy’s pro per unopposed
demurrer to Plaintiff Circa 1200, LLC’s complaint for unlawful detainer is overruled.
 
          Defendant Conner James Hennessy (“Hennessy”) (“Defendant”),
in pro per, demurs unopposed to the complaint (“Complaint”) of
Plaintiff Circa 1200, LLC (“Circa”) (“Plaintiff”) on the grounds that the claim
fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute a viable cause of action.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 1.)
 
Background
On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff
filed its operative Complaint against Defendant alleging a single cause of
action for unlawful detainer arising from the termination of a written one-year
term lease with Plaintiff’s predecessor in interest for real property located
at 1200 S. Figueroa Steet #E3023, Los Angeles, CA 90015 (“Premises”).  (See Complaint ¶¶3, 6.)  
Defendant filed the instant
demurrer on February 16, 2024.  As of the
date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Summary of Allegations
Plaintiff alleges Defendant
agreed to rent the Premises on or about May 19, 2022, for a one-year term.  (Complaint ¶6a.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant agreed to pay
monthly rent of $5,058.00.  (Complaint ¶6a.)  Plaintiff alleges this written agreement was
made with Plaintiff’s agent.  (Complaint
¶6b.)  Plaintiff alleges a copy of the
written lease agreement is not attached because this action is solely for nonpayment
of rent under C.C.P. §1161(2).  (Complaint
¶6f.)  Plaintiff alleges the tenancy is
not subject to the Tenant Protection Act of 2019.  (Complaint ¶7a.)  
Plaintiff alleges Defendant
was served with a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit.  (Complaint ¶9a(1).)  Plaintiff alleges on December 22, 2023, the
period stated in the notice checked in 9a expired at the end of the day and the
notice included an election of forfeiture. 
(Complaint ¶¶9b, 9d, 9e; Exh. 2.) 
Plaintiff alleges the notice was served on Defendant by posting a copy
on the premises on December 19, 2023, and giving a copy to the person found residing
at the premises and mailing a copy to Defendant at the premises on to Defendant
on December 19, 2023, because no person of suitable age or discretion could be
found there.  (Complaint ¶10a, d; Exh. 3.)
Plaintiff alleges at the time
the 3-day notice to pay rent or quit was served, the amount of rent due was $45,522,
and the fair rental value of the premises is $168.60 per day.  (Complaint ¶¶12-13.)
 
Demurrer

Summary of Demurrer
In support of his demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint, Defendant argues the claim fails to allege facts
sufficient to constitute a viable cause of action because the Complaint is not
properly verified.  (Demurrer, pgs. 4-5;
C.C.P. §430.10(e).)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994
[ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not
subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
Unlawful Detainer
A
cause of action for unlawful detainer must allege the following elements: (1) a
verified complaint; (2) facts on which the plaintiff seeks to recover; (3) description
of premises with reasonable certainty; (4) amount of rent in default, if the
action is based on paragraph (2) of §1161; (5) specifically the method used to
serve the defendant with the notice or notices of termination; (6) in action
regarding residential property, unless agreement is oral, landlord lacks
possession of writing, or action is based solely on C.C.P. §1161(2),
attachments including copies of (a) notices of termination served on the
defendant, (b) any written lease or rental agreement regarding the premises,
including any addenda or attachments to the lease.  (C.C.P. §1166; see also Palm
Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1425
[alleging and proving proper service on lessees of a valid three-day notice to
pay or quit is essential to declaring lessors’ judgment for possession under §1161].)  
Plaintiff’s Complaint is
compliance with §1161(a)(1) because C.C.P. §446 provides, in part,
When the verification
is made by the attorney for the reason that the parties are absent from the
county where he or she has his or her office, or from some other cause are
unable to verify it, or when the verification is made on behalf of a
corporation or public agency by any officer thereof, the attorney’s or
officer’s affidavit shall state that he or she has read the pleading and that
he or she is informed and believes the matters therein to be true and on that
ground alleges that the matters stated therein are true. However, in those
cases the pleadings shall not otherwise be considered as an affidavit or
declaration establishing the facts therein alleged.
 
(C.C.P. §446,
emphasis added.)
          Here, Plaintiff’s attorney verified
Plaintiff’s complaint by stating he is making the verification for and on
behalf of Plaintiff because Plaintiff is absent from LA County where Plaintiff’s
attorney’s office is located, and includes his typed name, signature, a
statement that he has read the pleading and knows its contents, and that he is
informed and believes, and on that ground alleges, that the matters stated in
the Complaint and supplemental allegations are true.  (Verification.)  Further, Plaintiff’s attorney’s verification
is signed under penalty of perjury. 
(Verification.)  Therefore,
Plaintiff’s attorney’s verification is proper.
          Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer is
overruled.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint is overruled.
Moving Party to give notice.
