And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted defendant Tucker Carlson's motion to quash the deposition notice and stay the deposition, as well as his request for a protective order. The judge finds that plaintiff Steven E. Greer's complaint has been previously sustained with leave to amend, and that he is attempting to relitigate previously decided claims. The judge concludes that there is no basis to conclude that plaintiff has any viable claims against defendant, and therefore grants the motion to stay the deposition until plaintiff has stated a viable claim. The judge also denies plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions.
