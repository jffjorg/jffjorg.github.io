And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled to grant the motion to stay court proceedings against Hilton & Hyland Real Estate, Inc. and Jonah Wilson, pending the completion of the binding arbitration between the plaintiffs and the seller. The court has concluded that option #3, which allows the arbitration to proceed as to one party (the seller) and stay the court case as to the other party (the defendants), best serves the goals of favoring arbitration while reducing duplication and the possibility of inconsistent results. The court has also noted that if the arbitrator finds that the seller did not make any misrepresentations, this would effectively end the arbitration and the litigation, and that issue preclusion would bar re-litigation of the same issues decided in the arbitration.
