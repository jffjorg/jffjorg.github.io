This is a tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (Set Two) by Plaintiff Christina Hwa against Defendant McDonald's Restaurant of California Inc. and others. The motion was denied without prejudice because no joint statement was filed by the parties, as required by the court's rules. The court's decision to deny the motion means that the Plaintiff's requests for production of documents will not be compelled, but the Plaintiff can re-file the motion if additional responses are not received.
