And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Labor Commissioner of the State of California has filed a petition to compel Mission City Plastering Inc. and David Arriaga to comply with state investigative subpoenas. The subpoenas were issued on April 15, 2024, and served on April 18, 2024. Despite informal attempts by the Labor Commissioner to obtain compliance, the respondents failed to respond to the subpoenas or ask for an extension. The Labor Commissioner has also filed a motion for an Order to Show Cause (OSC) directing the respondents to appear and respond to the petition. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the Labor Commissioner's authority to investigate matters within its jurisdiction is valid and that the investigative subpoenas meet the three-part test articulated by the California Supreme Court. The judge has ordered the respondents to comply with the subpoenas and has granted the Labor Commissioner's petition.
