Analysis
 
Petitioner Labor Commissioner
requests an Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) directing Respondents to appear and
respond to the Labor Commissioner’s Petition filed in this action, as provided
for by Government Code section 11188.
 
Government
Code section 11180 authorizes department heads to investigate matters within
the department's jurisdiction. (Gov. Code, § 11180 [“The head of each
department may make investigations and prosecute actions concerning: [¶] (a)
All matters relating to the business activities and subjects under the
jurisdiction of the department. [¶] (b) Violations of any law or rule or order
of the department. [¶] (c) Such other matters as may be provided by law.”].) 
 
Government
Code section 11181 authorizes the department head to issue subpoenas for the
production of documents. (Gov. Code, § 11181, subd. (e) [“In connection with
any investigation or action authorized by this article, the department head may
...: [¶] ... [¶] Issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the
production of papers, books, accounts, documents, any writing as defined by
Section 250 of the Evidence Code, tangible things, and testimony pertinent or
material to any inquiry, investigation, hearing, proceeding, or action
conducted in any part of the state.”].) Such subpoenas are valid as long as
they meet the three-part test articulated by our Supreme Court in Brovelli
v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 524. Specifically, the subpoenas are
valid if: (1) they inquire into matters the agency is authorized to
investigate; (2) they are “not too indefinite”; and (3) the information sought
is “reasonably relevant” to the investigation. (Id. at p. 529; see Craib
v. Bulmash (1989) 49 Cal.3d 475, 482 [administrative subpoena may be
enforced if it is issued “for ‘a lawfully authorized purpose, within the
power of [the legislative body] to command,’ ” and seeks documents that “are ‘relevant’
to the inquiry.”].)
 
If the
responding party fails to comply with the subpoena, the department head may
file a petition in the superior court for an order compelling compliance. (Gov.
Code, §§ 11186, 11187.) “Trial courts are authorized to enforce investigative
subpoenas that are ‘regularly issued.’ (Gov. Code, § 11188.) ‘The term
“regularly issued” means in accordance with the provisions of sections 11180,
11181, 11182, 11184 and 11185 of the Government Code providing for the matters
which may be investigated, the acts authorized in connection with
investigations, and the service of process.’ ” (Stiger v. Flippin (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 646, 657.) 
 
On April 15,
2024, Petitioner Labor Commissioner issued investigative subpoenas to Mission
City Plastering Inc. and David Arriaga. (Pet. ¶ 29.) These subpoenas were
served on them on April 18, 2024. (Id. ¶ 31.) However, they failed to respond
to the subpoenas or ask for an extension. (Pet. ¶ 33.) The Labor Commissioner’s
informal attempts to obtain compliance with the subpoenas were unavailing. (Pet.
¶¶ 33-34.)
 
The motion
is granted pursuant to Government Code section 11188. 
 
Conclusion
 
The motion is granted.
