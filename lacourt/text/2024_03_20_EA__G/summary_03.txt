And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the McWhirters' motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the pending foreclosure of their personal residence. The court finds that there is no likelihood that the McWhirters will be able to prevail on their claim that the 2009 deed of trust is invalid because Venti failed to make a required loan. The court concludes that the purpose of the 2009 deed of trust was to secure existing debt or obligations, and that the McWhirters' subsequent promises to satisfy the obligations of the deed of trust establish that its purpose was not to secure a loan that was never made. The Temporary Restraining Order issued by the court on February 7, 2024 is dissolved, and the bond posted by the plaintiffs is exonered.
