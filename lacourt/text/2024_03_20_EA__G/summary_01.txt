And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the City of Claremont's motion for summary judgment in this case. The City argued that it did not plant or direct the planting of the subject tree that fell onto Juan Cervera, Jr.'s property, and that IEAC (Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club) failed to provide evidence to support this claim. The judge found that IEAC's evidence did not establish that the City planted or directed the planting of the subject tree, and that there was no evidence to support the claim that the subject tree was a public improvement.

The judge also granted the City's motion for summary judgment as to the cause of action for inverse condemnation, finding that IEAC failed to provide evidence that the City planted or directed the planting of the subject tree as part of a planned project or design serving a public purpose. Finally, the judge granted the City's motion for summary judgment as to the cause of action for dangerous condition of public property, finding that IEAC failed to provide evidence that the subject tree was in a dangerous condition at the time it fell.
