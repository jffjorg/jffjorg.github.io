And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on The Internet Auto Group, Inc.'s (IAG) demurrer to Adam Dolce's First Amended Complaint. IAG's counsel failed to include a declaration describing any meet and confer efforts that took place prior to filing the demurrer. The Judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. As a result, IAG's counsel is ordered to meet and confer with Dolce's counsel regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing on the demurrer. The hearing on the demurrer is continued to a date to be determined.
