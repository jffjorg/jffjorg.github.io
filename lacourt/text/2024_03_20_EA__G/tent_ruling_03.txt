BACKGROUND
On
January 9, 2024, Plaintiffs Donald G. McWhirter, Jr. and Carolynn T. McWhirter

trustee of the Venti, Jr. Family Trust, dated May 31, 1990 (Venti Trust), and
Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) quiet title, (2)
declaratory relief, and (3) accounting.
On January
11, 2024, the McWhirters filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that the
court denied on January 30.
On February
7, 2024, the court granted the McWhirters’ request for a temporary restraining
order and set an OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction. A hearing on the OSC is set
for March 20 with a case management conference set for June 13.

The McWhirters’ evidentiary
objections to Venti’s declaration are OVERRULED as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
ANALYSIS
The
McWhirters seeks a preliminary injunction to halt the pending foreclosure of
their personal residence. For the following reasons, the court DENIES their
motion.
Legal
Standard
“[A]
court will deny a preliminary injunction unless there is a reasonable
probability that the plaintiff will be successful on the merits, but the
granting of a preliminary injunction does not amount to an adjudication of the
merits.” (Beehan v. Lido Isle Community Assn. (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 858,
866.) “The function of a preliminary injunction is the preservation of the
status quo until a final determination of the merits.” (Ibid.)
In
evaluating a party’s request for a preliminary injunction, courts consider “(1)
how likely it is that the moving party will prevail on the merits, and (2) the
relative harm the parties will suffer in the interim due to the issuance or nonissuance of the injunction.” (Dodge,
Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th
1414, 1420.) “[T]he greater the . . . showing on one, the less must be shown on
the other to support an injunction.” (Ibid, quoting Butt v. State of
California (1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 678.) The balancing of harm between the
parties also “involves consideration of such things as the inadequacy of other
remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity of preserving the
status quo.” (Husain v. McDonald’s Corp. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 860,
867, quoting Abrams v. St. John’s Hospital & health Center (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 628, 636.)¿The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as the moving
party “to show all elements necessary to support issuance of a preliminary
injunction.” (O’Connell v. Superior Court (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452,
1481.)
Discussion
In this case, the McWhirters
are seeking to quiet the title to their property in Glendora on the grounds
that a deed of trust recorded against the Glendora property by Venti on
February 18, 2009, is invalid. They allege the 2009 deed of trust is invalid
because Venti failed to lend the funds required pursuant to the deed of trust.
In interpreting a deed of
trust, courts follow the rules for interpreting contracts. (See Pacific
States Savings & Loan Co. v. Hollywood Knickerbocker (1935) 11
Cal.App.2d 56, 62.) These rules include the “cardinal rule that the whole of a
contract is to be taken together, so as to give effect to every part, if
reasonably practicable; each clause helping to interpret the other.” (Ibid.)
Courts also construe the contract in accordance with the “clear intention of
the parties.” (Ibid.) “The proper interpretation of a contract is
disputable if the contract is susceptible of more than one reasonable
interpretation, that is, if the contract is ambiguous. An ambiguity may appear
on the face of a contract, or extrinsic evidence may reveal a latent ambiguity.
[Citation.] A court determining whether a contract is ambiguous must first
consider extrinsic evidence offered to prove the parties' mutual intention. If
the court determines that the contract is reasonably susceptible of an
interpretation supported by extrinsic evidence, the court must admit that
evidence for purposes of interpreting the contract.” (Fremont Indemnity Co.
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 114.) When the language
of a deed of trust is ambiguous, it should be construed in favor of the
beneficiary so as to protect the validity of the security interest. (See
Nineteenth Realty Co. v. Diggs (1933) 134 Cal.App. 278, 285.)
Here, the 2009 deed of trust
states it is made “in consideration of the sum lent to the Trustor by the
Beneficiary, in the amount of $300,000.00 U.S. DOLLARS (the ‘Principal Amount’)
the receipt of which the Trustor does hereby acknowledges itself indebted.”
(McWhirter Decl., Ex. B, p. 9.) But the parties dispute whether this deed of
trust was intended to secure a loan to be made or prior debts that the
McWhirters already allegedly owed. In a declaration, Donald McWhirter states
the McWhirters executed the 2009 deed of trust based upon Venti’s
representation that Venti would loan $300,000 to the McWhirters. (McWhirter
Decl., ¶ 10.) In response, Venti denies promising to make any loan of $300,000
to the McWhirters. (Venti Decl., ¶ 3.) Instead, Venti claims the purpose of the
deed of trust was to settle existing debts or obligations that the McWhirters
owed. (Venti Decl., ¶ 2, 4, 12.)
As an initial matter, the
court notes the plain language of the 2009 deed of trust does not support the
McWhirters’ interpretation. While they claim the deed of trust was executed in
consideration of Venti’s promise to loan them $300,000, the deed of trust
itself refers to the loaned funds in the past tense by stating it was in
consideration “of the sum lent to the Trustor” and that Trustor
“acknowledges itself indebted.” (McWhirter Decl., Ex. B, p. 9 (emphasis added).)
Furthermore, the extrinsic evidence provided also contradicts the McWhirters’
interpretation. The McWhirters and Venti both agree that Venti did not loan any
funds after the execution of the 2009 deed of trust. (McWhirter Decl., ¶ 11; Venti
Decl., ¶ 3.)
But in subsequent email
correspondence between Donald McWhirter and Venti in February 2010, McWhirter
acknowledges debt owed pursuant to the 2009 deed of trust. In an email to
Venti, Donald McWhirter asked Venti not to release the “300K lien” as it was
“our only avenue to get you paid back.” (Venti Decl., Ex. 2.) After Venti
responded to Donald McWhirter’s email by expressing doubts about there being
sufficient equity in the McWhirters’ property, Donald McWhirter replied with
the following:
“Tony,
between you and I, Far East has confirmed to NOT go after us once we are
discharged from Bankruptcy, I will send you over the documents, hopefully
letting us sell the house and to do the right thing by you. We should be
able to get 1.2 million for the house, tile first is 890,000, second of 34,000
and unpaid taxes are only 5,000, which should give us money to pay you back.
As well as you being the agent for the sale. 
Don.”
(Venti Decl., Ex. 3 (emphasis added).)
Because Venti did not loan
any funds after the execution of the 2009 deed of trust, Donald McWhirter’s subsequent
promises a year later to satisfy the obligations of the 2009 deed of trust
establish that its purpose was to secure existing debt or obligations. The
court determines there is no logical reason for Donald McWhirter to promise to
satisfy a loan that was never made. Based on the evidence presented to the
court, the court finds there is no likelihood that the McWhirters will be able
to prevail on their claim that the 2009 deed of trust is invalid because Venti
failed to make a required loan.
“A trial court may not grant
a preliminary injunction, regardless of the balance of interim harm, unless
there is some possibility that the plaintiff will ultimately prevail on the
merits of the claim.” (Aiuto v. City and County of San Francisco (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 1347, 1361.) Accordingly, the court DENIES the
McWhirters’ request for a preliminary injunction.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the McWhirters’
motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED.  The
Temporary Restraining Order issued by the court on February 7, 2024 is DISSOLVED.  The bond posted by Plaintiffs is
EXONERATED.
