The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Marcus Webster's motion to quash a subpoena to his current employer, Aya Healthcare, Inc. The subpoena requests various employment records, including wage and earnings records, from Aya Healthcare, Inc. The Judge finds that some of the information requested is discoverable, but that other requests are overbroad and seek information that is not relevant to the issues in the case. The Judge grants the motion to quash the subpoena as to wage and earnings records, but denies it as to the remainder of the subpoena. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's right to privacy in his employment records has been diminished due to his claims for lost income, lost benefits, employment, and career opportunities. However, the Judge also finds that the remaining requests for employment records are overbroad and seek information that is not relevant to the issues in the case. The Judge will issue a final ruling after considering the parties' arguments at a hearing.
