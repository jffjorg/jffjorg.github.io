And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wilshire Gayley, LLC v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The court has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) failed to comply with its own design criteria. The court has also granted the motion to strike the language following "(a)" in paragraph 4 of the Prayer.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action, which concerns the application of ZI No. 1117 to Petitioner's project. The court has also denied MTA's claim that the case is moot, as Petitioner's prior allegations were based on the risk of expiration of its entitlements.

The court has also denied MTA's claim that Petitioner has not sufficiently pleaded facts to support an injunction. The court has noted that an injunction may be appropriate if Petitioner is successful in its litigation and MTA is required to comply with its duties.

The court has ordered Petitioner to argue whether there is a reasonable likelihood it could cure the deficiency in the second cause of action in an amendment. The court has also ordered MTA to file a reply to the opposition to the motion to strike.
