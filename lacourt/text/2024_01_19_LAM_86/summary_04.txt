And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispute between the Petitioner and the Respondents regarding the merits of the case. The Petitioner was issued a subpoena that contained an order to appear, and the Respondents are arguing that the Petitioner is guilty of misconduct related to the communications from DDA Goodrich. The judge notes that there is a conflict in the evidence about whether DDA Goodrich called the Petitioner 30 times on October 4, and the Petitioner testified that he received no calls or voicemails from DDA Goodrich on that day. The judge also notes that the Respondents' argument that the Petitioner should have responded to emails is not relevant to the case, as count 2 of the complaint explicitly alleges a failure to respond to text messages and voicemail. The judge concludes that the Board could not find the Petitioner guilty of count 2 based on his off-duty conduct, and that the Respondents have not developed a cogent argument to support their position.
