[1] The subpoena was an “e-Subpoena” and contained an
order to appear. It notes it was issued in lieu of a subpoena pursuant to Penal
Code sections 1328A, 1328C, 1328D and 1328, subdivision (c). (AR 1417.)


[2] As argued by Petitioner, there may be
reasons the Board did not find Petitioner guilty of misconduct related to DDA
Goodrich’s October 4 communications with Petitioner. The court notes there was
a conflict in the evidence about whether DDA Goodrich called Petitioner
“close to
30 times” on October 4. (Reply 4:1-6 [citing AR 878, 881, 1168-1169, 1171-1172,
1219.) Petitioner testified he received no calls or voicemails from DDA Goodrich
on October 4. (AR 1168.)


[3] Whether the Department could properly charge Petitioner
with off-duty misconduct is not before the court.


[4] The court’s earlier discussion about Petitioner being
off duty when he received the text from DDA Goodrich is equally applicable here.


[5] In a footnote, Respondents argue “Petitioner should
have responded to the emails because LAPD officers must check their emails
every working day which meant Petitioner should have read Goodrich’s emails on
October 1 because he worked that day.” (Opposition 9, fn. 3.) Respondents’ position
misses the mark. Respondents do not develop any cogent argument Petitioner
could be found guilty of count 2 when count 2 expressly alleged a failure to
respond to text messages and voicemail.


[6] For the reasons discussed above for the October 1
messages, the court agrees the Board could not find Petitioner guilty of count
2 based on his off-duty conduct given the express language of the complaint.  However, it does not appear the Board found
Petitioner guilty of failing to respond to DDA Goodrich’s October 3 text
messages during other than work hours, i.e., when he was on duty.
 


[7] The ordinary dictionary definition of transport means “to
transfer or convey from one place to another.” (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transport.)


[8] Petitioner testified the witnesses had been served
with a subpoena that instructed the witnesses where to report. (AR 1044.) Petitioner
also reported the officers who transported the witnesses to court, the officers
who arrested Portis had been issued subpoenas with relevant information on them
about the location of the trial. (AR 1044.) Petitioner also testified the subpoenas
listed a telephone number the witnesses could call “worst case scenario.” (AR
1048.) Petitioner also believed the witnesses had spoken to DDA Goodrich “days
prior based on what [DDA Goodrich] had provided to [him].” (AR 1049.) Petitioner
assumed the witnesses knew “where they were supposed to go.” (AR 1049.)
