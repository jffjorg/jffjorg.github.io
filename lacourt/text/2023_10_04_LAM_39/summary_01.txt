The Judge's Tentative Ruling denies Plaintiff's motion with respect to Dr. Wang's documents, citing insufficiency of evidence and lack of foundation for the Court to conclude that Dr. Wang's documents were not produced. The Court also notes that the parties did not lodge a complete copy of Dr. Wang's deposition transcript and that Plaintiff's counsel's declaration lacks sufficient foundation for the Court to conclude that Dr. Wang's documents were not produced.
