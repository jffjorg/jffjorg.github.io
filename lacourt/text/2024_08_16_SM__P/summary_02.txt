And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is scheduled to be heard on August 16, 2024. The case involves a dispute between a plaintiff and a defendant regarding a cohabitation agreement. The plaintiff filed a UD case based on the agreement, but the defendant demurred and the action was dismissed. The plaintiff then filed an instant action, but failed to disclose the prior case. The defendant claims to have never received notice of the summons, and the plaintiff obtained a default judgment based on alleged false service. The defendant has requested papers from the plaintiff's counsel, but the counsel has refused to provide them. The court has determined that the defendant has not established exigency, and therefore the matter will be continued to September 5, 2024. The plaintiff is ordered to serve the defendant with the papers filed in the instant case and the UD case electronically forthwith. The defendant is given until August 27, 2024, to file a reply to any opposition papers filed by the plaintiff.
