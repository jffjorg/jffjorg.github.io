And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to enforce a settlement that resolved an unlawful detainer (UD) case. The settlement required a large payment in January 2024, followed by additional payments each month until the total judgment is paid. Although the court is unclear about whether the original payment was made, it assumes it was due to a motion to enforce brought in April that was later withdrawn. The judge has denied the motion to enforce, citing that there is no urgency demonstrated and that the motion would be heard on less than three weeks' notice. However, the judge warns the defendant that if the motion is granted, eviction could follow immediately. The judge does not anticipate hearing argument on the matter on the scheduled hearing date.
