Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs. The cross-complaint seeks damages for breach of contract and failure to pay rent. The judge finds that the proposed cross-complaint is compulsory and that the defendants are acting in good faith. The defendants had previously requested a continuance of the hearing, which the judge is inclined to grant. The judge orders the defendants to file the cross-complaint within 5 days of the order and to give notice of the ruling. The case involves a dispute over a rental agreement and allegations of breach of habitability, negligence, IIED, NIED, harassment, and retaliation.
