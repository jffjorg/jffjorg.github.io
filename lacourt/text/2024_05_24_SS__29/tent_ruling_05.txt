Mamasig.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied in part and granted in
part.
Background
On
December 2, 2021, Plaintiff Michelle Clyoine Sampson (“Plaintiff”) filed her
complaint against Ereka Mamasig (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 60, asserting
causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out
of an automobile accident occurring on March 17, 2020.  Defendant filed an answer on October 11,
2022.
On
November 3, 2023, the motion for to be relieved as Plaintiff’s counsel was
granted. Plaintiff is now representing herself in pro per.
On February 29, 2024, the Court ordered Plaintiff to
appear for a physical examination on March 12.
 
On March 26, 2024, the Court ordered Plaintiff to appear
for her deposition on April 15.
 
On April 25, 2024, Defendant filed
this motion for terminating sanctions.  Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions.  No opposition has been filed.
 
The
matter is set for trial on July 24, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling compliance with
a demand for a physical examination, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240,
subd. (d).)
When a party fails to obey an order compelling attendance and
testimony at a deposition, “the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
that party deponent ….  In lieu of, or in
addition to, this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 … against that deponent.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (h).)  
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
Defendant contends terminating sanctions are warranted due
to Plaintiff’s failure to comply with this Court’s February 29 and March 26,
2024 orders compelling Plaintiff to appear for medical examination and for
deposition. Defendant also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,112.

 
Plaintiff failed to comply with her obligations under the
Civil Discovery act to appear for deposition and submit to a physical examination.  Those are serious instances of misuse of the
discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).)  Plaintiff then
compounded her abuse by failing to comply with two Court orders requiring her
to sit for a deposition and submit to the physical examination.  (Id., subd. (g).)  Serious sanctions are warranted for this discovery
abuse.  
 
For terminating sanctions, however, a party
must present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process,
as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendant has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing, for example, that
nonmonetary sanctions short of a terminating sanction have not cured (or would
not cure) Plaintiff’s misconduct. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendant.
Accordingly,
the Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
Defendant
does not seek lesser nonmonetary sanctions.
Defendants
does seek further monetary sanctions.  That
request is granted.  Defendant’s motion
is brought because of Plaintiff’s ongoing misuses of the discovery process.  The Court awards sanctions in the amount of
$1,112, calculated based on two hours of attorney time at counsel’s reasonable
hourly rate of $186 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee, plus $680 in costs
incurred as a result of Plaintiff’s failure to appear for her deposition as
ordered on April 15, 2024.  (Mosier
Decl., ¶ 8.)
The
denial as to terminating sanctions is without prejudice to Defendant in seeking
other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the
proceedings, based on a further showing of misuse of the discovery process.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for
terminating sanctions.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for
further monetary sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay Defendant
monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $1,112 within
30 days of notice of this order.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
