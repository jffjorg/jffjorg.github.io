 Case Number:  20STCV49195    Hearing Date:   May 24, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Set Aside Dismissal filed by Plaintiff Lynn
Steinberg.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On December 24, 2020, Plaintiff Lynn Steinberg
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint for negligence against Defendants Uber Technologies,
Inc. (“Uber”), Chris Hwang (“Hwang”), and Does 1 through 10, arising from an
accident that occurred on January 31, 2019.  Hwang filed his answer
on December 21, 2021.  Uber filed its answer on January 4, 2022.
On September 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
notice of settlement of entire case.  The
Court set an OSC re Dismissal for December 11, 2023.
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
motion to seal certain of her medical records. 
The motion was set for hearing on March 6, 2024.
In the interim, the OSC re Dismissal came
before the Court on December 11.  Plaintiff
did not appear.  The Court issued an
order dismissing the entire case without prejudice.  This had the effect of vacating the hearing
date on Plaintiff’s motion to seal.
On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion
to set aside the dismissal for the limited purpose of allowing her motion to
seal to be heard.  Hwang and Uber filed
oppositions to the motion on May 10 and 13. 
Uber also seeks sanctions.  Plaintiff
filed a reply on May 17.
Legal Standard
“The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken…” (Code Civ. Proc., §473, subd. (b).) 
To qualify for relief under section 473,
the moving party must act diligently in seeking relief and must submit
affidavits or testimony demonstrating a reasonable cause for the
default. (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 234.) 
“In a motion under section 473 the initial
burden is on the moving party to prove excusable neglect by a “preponderance of
the evidence. [Citations]”” (Kendall v. Barker (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d
619, 624.) “The moving party has a double burden: He must show a satisfactory
excuse for his default, and he must show diligence in making the motion after
discovery of the default.” (Id. at 625.)
Request
for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff
requests judicial notice of several filings to this Court. The Court GRANTS the
Judicial Notice.
Discussion
The Court has considered
all of the evidence and argument from both sides.  The motion is granted.  Plaintiff has shown a sufficient basis for relief
under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).  All that Plaintiff seeks is her day in Court on
the motion to seal her medical records, which was lost by the inadvertence or
mistake of her counsel.
Uber’s request
for sanctions under section 473, subdivision (c), is denied.  Uber has shown no basis for such relief. 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal for the
limited purpose of allowing her motion to seal to be heard is GRANTED.
The Court SETS ASIDE the dismissal entered by the Court
on December 11, 2023.
The Court sets the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to seal,
filed on November 21, 2023, on June/July __, 2024, at 1:30 pm, in Department 29
of the Spring Street Courthouse.
