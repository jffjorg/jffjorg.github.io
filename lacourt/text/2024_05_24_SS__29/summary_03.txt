And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is granting the motion to set aside the dismissal of the case for the limited purpose of allowing the plaintiff's motion to seal her medical records to be heard. The plaintiff had filed a complaint for negligence against Uber Technologies, Inc. and Chris Hwang, arising from an accident on January 31, 2019. The plaintiff's complaint was dismissed on December 11, 2023, after she failed to appear at a hearing. The plaintiff has now filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, arguing that it was due to the mistake or inadvertence of her counsel. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff has shown a sufficient basis for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The judge has also denied Uber's request for sanctions under section 473, subdivision (c). The case will proceed to a hearing on the motion to seal the plaintiff's medical records, scheduled for June/July 2024.
