And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling denied the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Santosh Narayan on behalf of J.C.J., a minor plaintiff represented by Guardian Ad Litem Lisa Curtis. The court found that the motion was incomplete and failed to comply with the required forms and procedures. Specifically, the declaration did not address the reason for seeking relief, and the court concluded that the attorney could not be relieved as counsel for a minor without the appearance of a new attorney to represent the minor.
