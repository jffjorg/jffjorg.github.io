And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Defendant Ereka Mamasig. The Judge denies the motion for terminating sanctions, but grants the request for further monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,112. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders, including failing to appear for a physical examination and deposition, warrants some form of sanctions. However, the Judge does not find that terminating sanctions are warranted at this time, as there has been no showing that lesser non-monetary sanctions have not cured or would not cure the Plaintiff's misconduct. The Judge also notes that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the Defendant.
