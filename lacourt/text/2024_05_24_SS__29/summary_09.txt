And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial, finding that good cause has been shown. The trial was originally set for August 20, 2024, but the defendant, Bank of America, N.A., requested a continuance due to unresolved discovery issues. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to appear for a deposition on April 16, 2024. The judge finds that a continuance is necessary to allow the parties to pursue settling the matter and to allow the defendant to proceed with discovery. The trial is advanced and continued to mid-December 2024, with the final status conference and deadlines reset accordingly.
