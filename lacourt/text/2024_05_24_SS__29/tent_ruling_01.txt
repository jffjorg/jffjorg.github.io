  Case Number:  20STCV01742    Hearing Date:   May 24, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Santosh Narayan.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
This case is brought on behalf of two minor
plaintiffs, A.B. and J.C.J.  
On January 14, 2020, A.B., by and through his
Guardian Ad Litem, Sylvia Betancourt, and J.C.J., by and through his Guardian
Ad Litem, Lisa Curtis, filed a complaint against Social Vocational Services,
Inc., Romel Cortez, and Does 1 through 50, for (1) assault, (2) battery, (3)
intentional infliction of emotional distress, (4) dependent adult abuse and
neglect, (5) violation of the Ralph Civil Rights Act, (6) negligence, and (7)
negligent supervision, all arising from abuse sustained by each developmentally
disabled Plaintiff in late 2018.
The named Defendants filed their answers on
August 3 and 4, 2020.
On April 22, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a notice
of settlement of the entire case.
On July 16, 2021, the Court granted a
petition to approve compromise of disputed claim for A.B. That aspect of the
settlement is now fully resolved.
On April 20, 2022, the Court granted a
petition to approve compromise of disputed claim for J.C.J.  The total gross settlement amount was $60,000;
after payment of attorney’s fees and costs, the amount of the net settlement proceeds
for J.C.J. was $27,603.84.  Of that
amount, $16,000 was to be deposited into an ABLE account for the benefit of
J.C.J.  The remainder ($11,603.84) was ordered
to be used for J.C.J. as follows: (1) $3,128.29 to purchase a therapeutic
tandem bike; (2) $2,898.27 to purchase a bedroom set and mattress cover; (3) $1,229.21
to purchase an entertainment system and blender; (4) $4,000 to pre-purchase burial
arrangements; and (5) $347.97 to purchase shoes.  On approval, the Court set an OSC re proof of
purchase of these items.
The OSC was initially set for July 20,
2022. The OSC was continued to October 18, 2022, and again to January 12, 2023,
then to March 13, 2023, then to May 17, 2023, then to July 25, 2023, then to
December 4, 2023, and then to January 17, 2024. 
At the January 17 hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel stated Ms.
Curtis had provided some of the receipts for purchases but not all of them. The
OSC was continued to March 19 and to June 20, 2024. 
On April 23, 2024, Santosh Narayan (“Counsel”) filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel for J.C.J., by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Lisa Curtis. 
No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. 
The declaration,
however, is not on the mandatory form required by California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(c).
In addition, the
declaration does not address the reason for seeking relief, or the steps to
acquire the client’s current address for proper service, as required by California
Rules of Court rule 3.1362(c). 
Finally, Counsel
seeks to be relieved as counsel for a minor, by and through a guardian ad
litem.  An attorney must appear on behalf
of the minor or person lacking legal capacity to make decisions. A non-attorney
appointed as guardian ad litem cannot act in pro per as doing so would
constitute the unauthorized practice of law (Bus. & Professions Code § 6125;
see J.W. v. Superior Court (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 958, 965.)
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED.
