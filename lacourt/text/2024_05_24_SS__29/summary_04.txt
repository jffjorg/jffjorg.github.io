Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will hear from counsel regarding the dispute regarding deposition topics and Requests for Production Nos. 1, 3, and 12-23. The court will also consider the evidence submitted by Elihu in support of the law firm's trade secret argument and the Defendants' response to that evidence. The court will also examine the issue of whether the requested information is discoverable and not subject to privilege, as well as the burden on the non-party witness. The court will also consider the sanctions sought by Elihu and Plaintiff. The court's decision will be based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the court's own discretion.
