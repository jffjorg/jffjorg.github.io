Bermudez Rodriguez and MS&R Pizza, Inc. 
 
Tentative
The motion is denied in part and granted in
part.
Background
On January 10, 2023, Lasha Andrews, Johnishia
Shepard, Bre’Ann Brinson, Jay’Lonii Williams (a minor), and De’Shawn Walker (a
minor) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendants Efrain
Bermudez Rodriguez, Domino’s Pizza, MS&R Pizza, Inc., and Does 1 through
100, arising out of an automobile accident on February 1, 2021.  Plaintiff Lasha Andrews was appointed
guardian ad litem for the two minor plaintiffs.
Defendants Efrain Bermudez Rodriguez and MS
Pizza, Inc. (erroneously sued as MS&R Pizza, Inc.) (collectively, “Defendants”)
filed an answer on May 17, 2023.
On
February 13, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel and ordered
each of the five Plaintiffs to provide code complaint written responses to
Defendants’ form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for
production.
 
On April
2, 2024, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiffs’ counsel to be relieved as
counsel for the three adult Plaintiffs. 
The Court denied the motion as to the two minor Plaintiffs.
 
On April 23, 2024, Defendants filed
this motion for terminating sanctions as to the causes of action asserted in the
complaint as to the adult Plaintiffs. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
When a party fails to obey an order compelling the party to
provide initial responses to interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a party fails to obey an order compelling the party to
provide written responses to requests for production, “the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
Defendants contend terminating sanctions are warranted as
against the three adult Plaintiffs (Lasha Andrews, Johnishia Shepard and
Bre’Ann Brinson) due to their failure to comply with this Court’s February 13,
2024 orders compelling them to provide responses to form interrogatories,
special interrogatories, and requests for production.  Defendants also request additional monetary
sanctions in the amount of $455.34. 
The three adult Plaintiffs failed to comply with their
obligations under the Civil Discovery act to respond to written discovery.  Those are serious instances of misuse of the
discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).)  Plaintiffs then
compounded their abuse by failing to comply with a Court order.  (Id., subd. (g).)  Serious sanctions are warranted for this discovery
abuse.  
 
For terminating sanctions, however, a party
must present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process,
as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendants have not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing, for example, that
nonmonetary sanctions short of a terminating sanction have not cured (or would
not cure) Plaintiffs’ misconduct.
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendants.
Accordingly,
the Defendants’ request for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
Defendants
do not seek lesser nonmonetary sanctions.
Defendants
do seek further monetary sanctions.  That
request is granted in part.  Defendants’
motion is brought because of the ongoing misuses of the discovery process by
the three adult Plaintiffs.  The Court
awards sanctions in the amount of $380.34, calculated based on two hours of
attorney time at counsel’s reasonable hourly rate of $160.17, plus a $60 filing
fee.  (Margaryan Decl., ¶ 13.)
The
denial as to terminating sanctions is without prejudice to Defendant in seeking
other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the
proceedings, based on a further showing of misuse of the discovery process.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendants’ motion for
terminating sanctions.
The Court GRANTS in part Defendants’ request
for further monetary sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiffs Lasha
Andrews, Johnishia Shepard and Bre’Ann Brinson, jointly and severally, to pay Defendant monetary sanctions under the Civil
Discovery Act in the amount of $380.34 within 30 days of notice of this order.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
