And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Daniel Dangoor to challenge the good faith nature of a settlement reached between Plaintiff Rafie Rafiee and several other defendants. The settlement, which was reached in November 2023, provides for the settling defendants to pay $10,000 in exchange for a release of all claims. Dangoor argues that the settlement is not in good faith because the settling defendants, who are better financially equipped and have insurance options, have tendered a very small amount, which exposes him to an unfair proportion of liability that could exceed $150,000. Dangoor also claims that Plaintiff's counsel has engaged in tortious conduct and seeks to punish him. The Judge, however, finds that the settlement amount is not "out of the ballpark" and is consistent with the equitable objectives of Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6. The Judge denies Dangoor's motion and grants the settlement.
