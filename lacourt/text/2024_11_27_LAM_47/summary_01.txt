And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties. The Plaintiff, Lauren Redmond, filed a motion to compel deposition and request for sanctions against the Defendants, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Matthew Floit, and Andrew Ludwick. The Defendants filed a motion to compel deposition and request for sanctions against the Plaintiff.

The Judge granted the Defendant's motion to compel deposition, ordering the Plaintiff to appear in-person for her deposition at a time and place of the Defendants' choosing within 30 days. The Judge denied the request for sanctions.

The Judge also granted the Plaintiff's motion for a protective order, ordering that the individual Defendants, Matthew Floit and Andrew Ludwick, may attend the Plaintiff's in-person deposition by remote means only.

The Judge's ruling was based on the California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.610, 2025.450, and 2025.420, as well as case law. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's failure to appear for further deposition and the termination of the deposition by her counsel was unjustified, and that the request for sanctions was excessive and unreasonably inflated. The Judge also found that the proposed relief of requiring the individual Defendants to attend the Plaintiff's deposition remotely was a narrowly tailored solution to facilitate the Plaintiff's in-person deposition while mitigating the risk of undue embarrassment to the Plaintiff.
