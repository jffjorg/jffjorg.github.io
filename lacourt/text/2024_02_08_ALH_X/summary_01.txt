Summary (English text):

This is a tentative ruling issued by Judge Joel L. Lofton in a case filed by Kevin Wang against JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. The case involves a dispute over a safe deposit box that was allegedly taken by the Defendant without the Plaintiff's permission. The Defendant moved to compel arbitration, citing an arbitration agreement that the Plaintiff signed in 2018. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the agreement is unconscionable and that the Defendant has waived its right to arbitrate. Judge Lofton rules in favor of the Defendant, granting the motion to compel arbitration and staying the case.
