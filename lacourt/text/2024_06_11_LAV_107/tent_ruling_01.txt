COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: Quash Service of Summons
  
                        



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
 
I. BACKGROUND
On January 1,
2021, plaintiff Jubilio Escalera (“Plaintiff”) executed a credit application
and agreement to convert a garage located at 21025 Costanso Street, Woodland
Hills, CA 91364 (“21025 Constanso”), into a new accessory dwelling unit
(“Project”). (Compl. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff contends that he supplied all the
construction materials required to complete the Project and that as of July 28,
2021, defendants Sergio Miramontes (“Sergio”) and his wife, Rosa Miramontes
(“Rosa”) (jointly “Defendants”), have failed to make full payment of $35,000.00
due to Plaintiff for the materials required to complete the Project. (Compl. ¶¶
14,16.)
 
On May 11, 2022,
Plaintiff recorded a mechanics lien (“Mechanics Lien”) against the Project in
Los Angeles County, California under Instrument No. 20220514463. (Compl. ¶ 17;
Exh. A.) On August 11, 2022, Plaintiff, in pro per, initiated this lawsuit by
filing a complaint (the “Complaint”) for foreclosure of the Mechanics Lien
(“First Cause of Action”) against Defendants. (Compl. p. 5.; Exh. A.)
 
On May 2, 2024,
Defendants filed a motion to quash service of summons (the “Motion”) along with
a request for judicial notice, both of which were served by first class mail on
Plaintiff at 7912 Ventura Canyon Avenue, Panorama City, CA 91402-6311.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the
Motion.  
 
The Court notes
Plaintiff last appeared at the April 9, 2024 OSC, at which time he informed the
Court that his counsel had passed away and, due to Plaintiff’s own health
problems, he had been delayed in finding new representation.  Plaintiff failed to appear at the May 9, 2024
OSC and CMC. 
Defendants’ 5/2/24
request for judicial notice of the entire Court file in this matter and the
Court’s Case Information Sheet is denied. 
There is no need for the Court to take judicial notice of the case file
because the Court can always review the file for the case at hand.  
 
II. LEGAL STANDARD
 
A motion to quash
service of summons may be brought on the grounds that the court lacks personal
jurisdiction over the defendant. (Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)
“[W]here a defendant properly moves
to quash service of summons the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove facts requisite to an effective service.” (Sheard v.
Superior Court (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 207, 211.)
 
Personal service
may be accomplished by personally delivering a copy of the summons and
complaint to the person to be served.¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., § 415.10.)¿ 
 
In determining
whether a plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence, “[t]he question is simply
whether [the plaintiff] took those steps which a reasonable person who truly
desired to give notice would have taken under the circumstances.”  (Donel, Inc v. Badalian, (1978) 87
Cal. App. 3d 327, 333.)  “No single
formula nor mode of search can be said to constitute due diligence in every
case.”  (Id.)
 
Filing a proof of
service by a registered process server creates a rebuttable presumption that
service was proper.¿ (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara, (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390; Evid. Code, § 647 [“The return of a process server
registered pursuant to . . . the Business and Professions Code upon process or
notice establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence,
of the facts stated in the return”].)¿ However, the presumption only arises if
the proof of service complies with the statutory requirements regarding such
proofs.¿ (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426,
1441-1442.)¿ The method described as “personal service” means service that is
accomplished “by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the
complaint to the person to be served.” (§ 415.10.) If the complaint and summons
were personally delivered to, i.e., handed to, defendant then he could be said
to have been “personally served.” (Am. Express Centurion Bank v. Zara,
389.)
 
Although the
filing of a proof of service by a registered process server creates a
rebuttable presumption that service was proper (see Evid. Code § 647), that
presumption may be impeached by contrary evidence submitted by a defendant.
(See, e.g., Fernandes v. Singh (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 932, 941 p.
6.)  
 
C.C.P.
§418.10(a)(1) provides that, “A defendant, on or before the last day of his or
her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause
allow, may serve and file a notice of motion… To quash service of summons on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”
 
If service of
summons is not properly and validly effectuated by one or more of the approved
methods, California courts lack personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and
any judicial actions taken without such service violates principles of
fundamental due process and is therefore void. (Cnty. of San Diego v. Gorham
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1231.)
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Defendants argue
that Plaintiff’s complaint offends due process and in turn fails to authorize
personal jurisdiction over them because the Complaint and Summons were never
effectively served on them. (Motion, p. 4.) Defendants argue that personal
service on them at 21025 Constanso was impossible because the unit is
unoccupied, and their residence is actually 21027 Constanso Street, Woodland
Hills, CA 91364. (Motion, p. 4; Declaration of Sergio Miramontes (“S. Montes
Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-5, Exh. A.)  Specifically, Sergio
declares that while he and Rosa were at home on the date of the alleged
service, no process server or individual presented them with the Summons and
Complaint.  (S. Montes Decl. ¶3.)  The Court notes that only Sergio has
submitted a declaration supporting his assertion that he was not served with
the Summons and Complaint in this action; however, there is no declaration by
Rosa asserting she was not served on the alleged date of service.  
 
To further support
their claim, Defendants submit evidence that Susanna Turner (“Turner”), a
paralegal of their counsel, called the Court on May 24, 2024, and at that time
was informed by a Call Center Clerk that no Summons had been issued in the
instant matter, Case No.  22VECV01156.
(Declaration of Susanna Turner (“Turner Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-4.)  While the truth of the matter of any
assertions the Call Center Clerk made to Turner regarding the issuance of a
summons in this matter would amount to hearsay, a review of the Case File
demonstrates that no Summons has been filed in this action.  
 
As a preliminary
matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s process server Richard Williams
(“Williams”) is not a registered California process server.  (2/22/23 PoS as to Rosa; 2/22/23 PoS as to
Sergio.)  As such, the proofs of service
themselves do not create a rebuttable presumption that service was
proper.  To the extent Plaintiff contends
service was properly made, Plaintiff must submit evidence or a declaration of
Williams in support of the Proofs of Service. 
However, Plaintiff has not opposed the instant motion.  In addition, as discussed above, Defendants
submitted evidence Sergio was not served with the summons and complaint in the
manner described in the Proof of Service as to him given the incorrect address
and given he did not receive service of the document on the alleged date.  Sergio declares Rosa was likewise not served
with the summons and complaint in the action and was not located at the service
address, which is the address of their then unoccupied ADU.  Finally, the case file for the instant matter
does not appear to include an issued filed summons; however, the Court
acknowledges that this does not preclude a summons from being issued to
Plaintiff for service on Defendants. 
 
Plaintiff did not
meet his burden of demonstrating facts justifying the existence of jurisdiction
over Sergio given Sergio submitted evidence showing he was not served with the
summons and complaint and the Proof of Service was not completed by a registered
process server. 
 
 
Accordingly, this
court GRANTS the Motion as to Sergio Miramontes. The motion is DENIED as to
Rosa Miramontes.
