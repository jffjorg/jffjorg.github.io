And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Brian Whitaker, sued the defendant, Marcos Lopez, alleging violations of California's Unruh Civil Rights Act and Disabled Persons Act. The court found that the plaintiff's complaint did not satisfy the heightened pleading standards for "tester" plaintiffs, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.50. The court held that the plaintiff's complaint did not adequately plead the specific facts of how he was prevented from using the defendant's restaurant services. The court granted the defendant's motion, but gave the plaintiff leave to amend his complaint to cure the defects.
