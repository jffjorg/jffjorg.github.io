And here is the English-text summary:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court has granted the motion to quash service of summons as to Sergio Miramontes, finding that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate personal jurisdiction over him. The court found that Sergio was not served with the summons and complaint, and the proof of service was not completed by a registered process server. The court denied the motion as to Rosa Miramontes, as there was no evidence submitted by Rosa to support her absence of service. The court also noted that the plaintiff's process server, Richard Williams, is not a registered California process server.
