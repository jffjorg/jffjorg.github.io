```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Rachel Bendavid's motion to vacate and set aside the default entered against her on July 31, 2024. The default was entered due to the failure of her counsel to file an answer until September 24, 2024. The judge finds that the counsel's excusable neglect was caused by a family medical emergency, which diverted his attention from the litigation. The judge cites Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which allows the court to relieve a party from a judgment or other proceeding taken against them through their mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The judge also notes that the test for excusable neglect is whether a reasonably prudent person in similar circumstances might have made the same error. As a result, the judge directs counsel to file an answer within 20 days and orders the moving party to provide notice.
