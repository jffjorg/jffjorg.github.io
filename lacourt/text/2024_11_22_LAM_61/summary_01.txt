And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motion for a trial continuance filed by Hexadyne Corporation, a cross-defendant in the case. Hexadyne is seeking a six-month continuance of the trial and reopening of discovery to allow it to conduct discovery into Mason Electric Company, Inc.'s cross-complaint and file a dispositive motion. The court finds that good cause exists for the continuance, as Mason's responses to discovery have been obstructive and non-responsive, and Hexadyne has not yet been able to file a responsive pleading or assert affirmative defenses. The court also notes that the parties have stipulated to a continuance of trial in the past, and that the requested continuance is only six months, which is not an unreasonable amount of time. The court finds that the motion is properly considered, despite Mason's arguments that it is untimely and that Hexadyne has unreasonably delayed bringing the motion.
