 Hearing
  Date: August 7, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s
motion for request for judicial notice is DENIED.
 
On March 11,
2019, Plaintiff Issa Al-Bayati (Plaintiff) filed suit against Defendants Los
Angeles Unified School Districts (LAUSD), Ana Velasco, and Nelson Velasco
(collectively, Defendants). On April 15, 2019, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint (FAC) alleging: (1) general negligence; (2) premises liability; (3)
negligent hiring and retention; and (4) negligent training and supervision. 
 
Now,
Plaintiff moves for the Court to grant her Request for Judicial Notice (RJN).
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
requests the Court take judicial notice of the: (1) the Judgment from The Court
Of Appeal of The State of California Second Appellate District, Division Eight
(Case Number B313331) in the matter Issa Al-Bayati V. Los Angeles Unified
School District, et al, LASC Case No. 19STCV08232, dated May 10, 2023; and (2)
Audio and Transcript of Oral Arguments in The Court Of Appeal of The State of
California Second Appellate District, Division Eight (Case Number B313331) in
the matter Issa Al-Bayati V. Los Angeles Unified School District, et al, LASC
Case No. 19STCV08232, dated March 30, 2023.
 
Judicial
notice may be taken of the following matters to the extent that they are not
embraced within Section 451: (d) Records of any court of this state or any
court of record of the United States or of any state of the United States; or
(h) Facts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are
capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of
reasonably indisputable accuracy. (Cal. Evid. Code §452(d); and §452(h).)
 
Here,
Plaintiffs contend that the documents are a matter of public record, and are
not reasonably subject to dispute. However, as noted by Defendant, the opinion
is unpublished, and per California Rules of Court, Rule 8.1115(a), it is
prohibited for the courts and parties to cite or rely on this Unpublished
Opinion. The case cited by Plaintiff in support, Kilroy v. State of
California (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 140, 148, actually indicates that factual
findings in a prior judicial opinion were not a proper subject of judicial notice.
Moreover, “ ‘An appellate opinion is not a judgment of the appellate court,
such as is the remittitur. An appellate opinion's recitation of facts is
nothing more than the hearsay assertions of the judges who issued the opinion.
An appellate opinion—insofar as it recites pertinent facts—is not to be
classified in the same vein as orders, findings of fact and conclusions of law,
and judgments.’ (Kilroy, 119 Cal.App.4th at 146.).” (Opp., 4: 20-24.) 
 
Plaintiff has
also failed to show that the Unofficial Transcript falls under Evidence Code
Sections 451(d) or 451 (h). The arguments of counsel are not evidence or an
official record, and it does not appear that the transcriptions were performed
by a court reporter. The arguments of counsel are not “facts and propositions
that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and
accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable
accuracy,” and thus are not the appropriate subject of judicial notice. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for request for judicial notice is denied.  
 
 
It is so ordered.
