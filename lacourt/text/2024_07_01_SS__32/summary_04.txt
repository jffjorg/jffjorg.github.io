And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petition filed by Deborah Carson on behalf of her 11-year-old son, Chase Carson. The Court denies the petition without prejudice due to several errors and omissions. Specifically, the petition lacks the correct Court address, fails to complete item 10c, and contains unclear information in attachment 11b(2). Additionally, the petition does not include attachment 17d and fails to change the response in item 17e. The Court orders Petitioner to correct these errors and provide additional information before re-filing the petition.
