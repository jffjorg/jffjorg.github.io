And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff Frankie Lane to deem admitted Requests for Admission, Set One, propounded on Defendant Raman Dlamini. The Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions against the Defendant and their counsel for failure to respond to the requests for admission. The Defendant opposes the motion and claims that the discovery went to their counsel's spam folder, preventing them from receiving actual notice of the underlying discovery. The Judge declines to award monetary sanctions, finding that there is a question of whether the Defendant's counsel received actual notice of the underlying discovery. Therefore, the motion is denied as moot.
