And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a proposed decision by the Judge in a court case, and it addresses a motion filed by the plaintiff, Maria Hernandez, to compel the defendant, Isaac Landfert, to serve verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions against the defendant and his counsel of record.

The Judge grants the motion to compel, ordering the defendant to provide verified responses without objection within 30 days. The Judge also awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $660 against the defendant and his counsel of record, jointly and severally.

The ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, which allows a party to move for an order compelling responses to discovery requests if the opposing party fails to serve a timely response. The Judge finds that the defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests and that sanctions are warranted. However, the Judge reduces the amount of sanctions requested by the plaintiff due to the lack of opposition and the ability of the plaintiff to appear remotely at the hearing.
