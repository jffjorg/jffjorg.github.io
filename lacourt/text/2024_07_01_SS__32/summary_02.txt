And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a lawsuit between Plaintiff Karapet Talasyan and Defendants Jouhaina Simaan and Wadie Simaan. The lawsuit is related to a motor vehicle accident that occurred on October 31, 2016. Plaintiff is seeking to reopen discovery and continue the trial for three months to gather more information about Defendant Jouhaina Simaan's purported lack of mental capacity. The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion, citing several reasons, including the fact that Plaintiff did not meet and confer with the Defendants before filing the motion, did not specify what additional discovery is sought, and did not demonstrate diligence in completing Defendant's deposition before the deadline. The judge also noted that the letter from the clinic stating that Jouhaina lacks capacity was not a signed declaration and that Plaintiff is skeptical that Jouhaina lacks capacity since this was not disclosed prior to February 2024.
