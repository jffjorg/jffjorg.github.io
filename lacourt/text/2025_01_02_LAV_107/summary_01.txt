And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Pogos Tofalyan. The court has overruled the demurrer on all three causes of action raised by Plaintiff Georgi Dzneladze.

The first cause of action is for breach of contract, alleging that the Silver Age Parties failed to provide a license and failed to provide regular profits from the Business. The court finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for breach of contract.

The second cause of action is for fraud and deceit, alleging that the Silver Age Parties made misrepresentations about the Business' licensing status and failed to provide a license. The court finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for fraud and deceit.

The third cause of action is for unjust enrichment, alleging that the Silver Age Parties received a benefit from the Business and failed to provide stock certificates and regular profits. The court finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for unjust enrichment.

The court has ruled that the parol evidence rule does not apply to exclude evidence of the original agreement relating to the sale of the Business because the Settlement Agreement contains an integration clause. The court has also ruled that the complaint's references to the Stock Purchase Agreement do not appear to vary, alter, or add terms to the Settlement Agreement.

The court has further ruled that the complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for fraud and deceit, despite the fact that Defendant Pogos Tofalyan did not enter into the Settlement Agreement. The court has also ruled that the complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for unjust enrichment.

The court will issue a final judgment after considering any further arguments or evidence that may be presented.
