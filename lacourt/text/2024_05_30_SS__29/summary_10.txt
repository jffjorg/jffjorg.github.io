And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a hearing on May 30, 2024. The case involves a motor vehicle accident on May 26, 2023, and two consolidated cases filed by Francisco Hitabarada and Noah Williams against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (LACMTA). LACMTA served plaintiff Williams with discovery requests on November 7, 2023, but plaintiff did not respond. LACMTA filed motions to compel and requests for sanctions. The court finds that the motions to compel are denied as moot since plaintiff has now responded to the discovery requests. The requests for sanctions are also denied.
