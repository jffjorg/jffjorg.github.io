Interrogatories (Set Two)

Background
Jacquith Embray (“Plaintiff”) filed the
complaint in this action on March 16, 2022, asserting one cause of action for
professional negligence against Pedram Sooferi, D.D.S., Sean Sooferian, D.D.S., and Does 1 through 50, based on events occurring
during a visit to Defendants’ dental office on March 18, 2021. The named
defendants filed their answers on September 7 and 19, 2023.
On February 21, 2024, Defendant Pedram
Sooferi (“Defendant”) served discovery on Plaintiff, including Requests for
Admission (Set One) and Form Interrogatories (Set Two).  (Hertzog Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id., ¶ 6.) 

On April 18, 2024, Defendant filed these two
motions: a motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to the form interrogatories
and a motion for an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted as true the
matters specified in the requests for admission.  Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions in
each motion.
Plaintiff has not filed any opposition.
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not
provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).) In addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response
generally waives all objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for
Admission (Set One) and Form Interrogatories (Set Two) on February 21, 2024.  (Hertzog Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff has not served any responses to
these discovery requests.  (Id., ¶
6.)  
Defendant need not show anything more.  The motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to
the form interrogatories is granted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  The motion for a deemed-admitted order is
granted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions on the motion to compel responses to the form
interrogatories is denied.  The
applicable statute, Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), authorizes
sanctions against a party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to
compel, but here Plaintiff did not oppose the motion.
Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions on the motion for a deemed-admitted order is
granted.  The applicable statute, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), provides that sanctions are “mandatory” against “the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated [the] motion.” 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of a motion for a
deemed-admitted order, as well as the economies of scale associated with
preparing parallel discovery motions, the Court sets sanctions in the amount
$570, calculated based on two hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable
billing rate of $255 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Hertzog Decl., ¶ 8.)

Form
Interrogatories (Set Two).

Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set Two) within 14 days of notice.
