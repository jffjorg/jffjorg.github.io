Delay in Prosecution filed by Specially Appearing Defendant Raymond-Southern
California, Inc.
 
Tentative
The motion
is granted.
Background
On August 14, 2019, Jasmine Dominguez (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Burbank Mall Associates, LLC and Does 1 through 100 for
negligence and premises liability arising out of an incident in which Plaintiff
asserts that she was injured by falling bathroom sink metal.
On August 16, 2019, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Burbank
Town Center as Doe 1.
On December 7, 2020, Plaintiff filed the complaint to name CAPREF
Burbank LLC (“CAPREF”) as Doe 2. CAPREF filed an answer on March 9, 2021.
On December 28, 2020, the Court, at the request of Plaintiff,
dismissed without prejudice all causes of action in the complaint against
Burbank Mall Associates, LLC.
On October 25, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Jones
Lang Lasalle Americas, Inc. (“JLL”) as Doe 3. JLL filed an answer on January
30, 2024.
On January 30, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name W.E.
O’Neil Construction Company of California (“O’Neil”) as Doe 4. 
On March 29, 2024, O’Neil filed an answer to the complaint. On the
same day, O’Neil filed a cross-complaint against Raymond Southern California
Inc. (“Raymond”) and Roes 1 through 50.
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Raymond
as Doe 5.
On April 24, 2024, JLL and CAPREF filed a cross-complaint against O’Neill,
Raymond, and Roes 1 through 50.
On May 2, 2024, Raymond, specially appearing, filed this motion to
dismiss complaint for failure to serve within three years of filing. The motion
is set for hearing on May 30. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 16, and Raymond
filed a reply on May 22.
The Court is aware that on May 6, 2024, O’Neil On May 6, Defendant
W.E. filed a motion to dismiss for failure to serve within three years. That
motion is to be heard on June 6, 2024.
Judicial Notice/ Objections to Evidence
Raymond requests that the Court take judicial notice of
Plaintiff’s complaint, the amendment to complaint naming Raymond as a defendant,
and proof of service on Raymond. The request, which is not opposed, is GRANTED.
Raymond also asserts two objections to the Declaration of Plaintiff’s
counsel. The Court OVERRULES both objections.
Legal Standard
“The summons and complaint
shall be served upon a defendant within three years after the action is
commenced against the defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.210, subd. (a).) 
“(a) If service is not made in an action
within the time prescribed in this article: 
(1) The action shall not be further
prosecuted and no further proceedings shall be held in the action. 
(2) The action shall be dismissed by the
court on its own motion or on motion of any person interested in the action,
whether named as a party or not, after notice to the parties. 
(b) The requirements of this article are
mandatory and are not subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as
expressly provided by statute.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.250.)
“In computing the time within which service
must be made pursuant to this article, there shall be excluded the time during
which any of the following conditions existed:
(a) The defendant was not amenable to the
process of the court.
(b) The prosecution of the action or
proceedings in the action was stayed and the stay affected service.
(c) The validity of service was the subject
of litigation by the parties.
(d) Service, for any other reason, was
impossible, impracticable, or futile due to causes beyond the plaintiff’s
control. Failure to discover relevant facts or evidence is not a cause beyond
the plaintiff’s control for the purpose of this subdivision.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.240.) 
 
Courts have clarified the relation between the
requirement to serve a defendant within three years under Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.210 and the “relation-back” doctrine for fictitiously
named defendants:  
“The
relation-back doctrine applicable to a fictitiously named defendant and the
requirement that a plaintiff serve the summons and complaint within three years
are independent concepts. Thus, even where the filing of an amended complaint
on a Doe defendant relates back to the filing of an original complaint, the
plaintiff must nonetheless identify and serve a Doe defendant with a summons
and complaint within three years of the commencement of the action.”  
(Higgins v. Super. Ct. (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 973, 982.) 
“In short, a plaintiff has three years from the
date of filing the complaint to identify and serve a Doe defendant.” (Inversiones
Papaluchi S.A.S. v. Super. Ct. (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1061.)
Discussion
Plaintiff filed the complaint in August
2019. Plaintiff did not serve Raymond until more than four years and seven
months later, in April 2024. This is well beyond the three-year time period set
forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210.  
Plaintiff does not argue that Raymond was
not amenable to service, that the action was stayed, or that the validity of
service was subject to litigation during this period of more than four years
and seven months. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 583.240, subs. (a)-(c).)
Instead, Plaintiff argues that a different
defendant, CAPREF, provided false or misleading discovery responses in April
2021 that did not identify Raymond as a potential defendant in this action.
(Ghermezian Decl., ¶¶ 14-16 & Exhs. 13-14.) Plaintiff asserts that her
counsel did not learn that Raymond was potentially responsible for the injuries
in this matter until some time in early 2024. (Id., ¶¶ 7-10.) As a result,
Plaintiff contends, service on Raymond was “impracticable” or “futile.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.240, subd. (d).) In the alternative, or in addition, Plaintiff
contends that Raymond should be equitably estopped from seeking dismissal
because of the alleged false or misleading discovery responses of CAPREF.
The Court has considered all of the
evidence in the record and all of the argument submitted by both sides. This is
not a situation in which service on Raymond was at any relevant time “impracticable”
or “futile.” Rather, Plaintiff simply failed to discover the relevant facts regarding
potential defendants until 2024. Such a failure to discover relevant facts or
evidence “is not a cause beyond the plaintiff’s control for the purpose of” Code
of Civil Procedure section 583.240, subdivision (d). 
Nor is there any basis to apply estoppel
against Raymond. Even assuming that Plaintiff is correct in asserting that
CAPREF provided false or misleading discovery responses, there is no evidence
that Raymond did anything wrong or, for that matter, anything at all – much less
anything that would estop Raymond from asserting a statutory bar to prosecution
of this case against it. (See Tresway Aero, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1971) 5
Cal.3d 431, 439-440; Brookview Condominium Owners’ Ass’n v. Heltzer Enterprises-Brookview
(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 502, 511-512.)
Accordingly, the Court must dismiss the
causes of action asserted against Raymond in Plaintiff’s complaint. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 583.250, subd. (a)(2).) This is mandatory; the three-year period to
serve is “not subject to extension, excuse, or exception, except as expressly
provided by statute.” (Id., subd. (b).)
This dismissal does not apply to the causes
of action asserted against Raymond in the cross-complaint filed by O’Neil or
the cross-complaint filed by JLL and CAPREF.
The motion is granted.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Raymond’s motion to dismiss.
The Court DISMISSES all causes of action
against Raymond asserted in Plaintiff’s complaint.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
