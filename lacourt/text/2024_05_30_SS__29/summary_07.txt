And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion by the plaintiff's counsel to compel further responses to form interrogatories. The hearing on the motion was previously set for February 29, but was continued to May 30 to allow for the resolution of two threshold preliminary issues. The first issue is the substitution of the plaintiff's successor-in-interest as plaintiff, which requires a motion and a declaration that includes all the information set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32. The second issue is the lack of notice to the defendants regarding the advanced date for the informal discovery conference. The court has ordered the plaintiff's counsel to give notice and expects that the issue of substitution will be resolved in the interim. The hearing on the motion to compel is continued until an appropriate order of substitution is completed.
