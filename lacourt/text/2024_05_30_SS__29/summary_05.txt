English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied without prejudice the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Fatima Adauta. The defendants had previously noticed the deposition for March 27, 2024, but the plaintiff did not object and did not appear. The defendants then noticed the deposition again for May 30, 2024, but the plaintiff was not given proper notice of the actual hearing date and did not receive an opportunity to be heard. The court finds that the defendants have made a proper showing for their motion to compel, but the defendants failed to provide proper notice of the motion. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.
