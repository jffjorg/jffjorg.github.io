And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The complaint was dismissed due to the failure to enter default judgment. The plaintiff's counsel, Justin H. King, missed the hearing due to a calendaring error. The judge finds that the dismissal occurred due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The court grants the motion, and sets an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re Dismissal for Failure to Enter Default Judgment in approximately 45 days.
