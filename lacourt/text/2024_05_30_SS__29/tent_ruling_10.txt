Background
These two consolidated cases arise
out of a motor vehicle accident on May 26, 2023, at or near the intersection of
Broadway and Washington Boulevard in Los Angeles.
 
On August 24, 2023, in Case No.
23STCV20355, Francisco Hitabarada filed a complaint for negligence against Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (“LACMTA”), E. Cuchilla, and Does
1 through 25.  LACMTA filed an answer on
October 10, 2023.
 
On October 4, 2023, in Case No.
23STCV24175, Noah Williams (“Williams”) filed a complaint against LACMTA and
Does 1 through 10 for motor vehicle negligence. 
LACMTA filed an answer on November 8, 2023.
 
The two cases were related on December
7, 2023, and consolidated on April 12, 2024.
 
As it relates to the matters
currently before the Court and set for hearing on May 30, LACMTA served
Plaintiff Williams with written discovery on November 7, 2023, including Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for
Production (Set One).  (Sheppard Decls.,
¶ 5 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff did not
respond to the discovery.  (Id., ¶
7.)
 
On April 18, 2024, LACMTA filed these
three motions to compel.  LACMTA also
seeks sanctions.  
 
Plaintiff Williams served responses
to the discovery on or about May 7.  (Yeager
Decl., ¶ 2.)  Williams filed a consolidated
reply to all three motions on May 8. 
 
LACMTA filed three reply briefs on
May 14.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Requests for admission may be
propounded on a party without leave of court 10 days after the service of the
summons on, or appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On November 7, 2023, LACMTA served
Plaintiff Williams with Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories
(Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One).  (Sheppard Decls., ¶ 5 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff did not serve timely responses to
these discovery requests.  (Id., ¶
7.)  Indeed, Plaintiff did not respond to
the discovery until after this motion was filed.  (Yeager Decl., ¶ 2.)
 
But Plaintiff has now responded.  Accordingly, the motions to compel initial
responses to the form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests
for production are denied as moot.
 
LACMTA’s requests for sanctions are
also denied.  The applicable statutes
authorize sanctions in this context against a party or attorney “who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel an initial response.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).)  In other contexts within the Civil Discovery
Act, the Legislature has not imposed this requirement for sanctions.  (E.g., Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  But the requirement does apply here – and here,
Plaintiff has not unsuccessfully opposed the motions.   
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES AS MOOT LACMTA’s three motions
to compel.
 
The
Court DENIES LACMTA’s requests for sanctions.
 
Moving party
is ORDERED to give notice.
