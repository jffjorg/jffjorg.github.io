(Set One)
City’s Motion for an Order Deeming NR to Have Admitted as True the Matters
Specified in Requests for Admission (Set One)
 
Tentative
The Court will hear from counsel.  Counsel may not submit.
The hearings on the motions are continued for
at least 21 days.
Background
On January 21, 2021, Francisco Fierro
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Downey (“City”), County of Los
Angeles (“County”), City of Los Angeles, and Does 1 through 100 for premises
liability and general negligence arising out of an incident on February 5,
2020, in which Plaintiff alleges that, while he was traveling on his
wheelchair, he fell into an open ditch at a construction site.  
On August 18, 2022, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against City, County, and Does 1 through 100.  
On September 19, 2022, City filed an answer
to the FAC.
On November 18, 2022, the Court, at the
request of Plaintiff, dismissed without prejudice the causes of action in the
FAC against County. 
On June 5, 2023, Plaintiff amended his
complaint to name NR Development, Inc. (“NR”) as Doe 1. On October 24, 2023, NR
filed an answer.  
On November 22, 2023, City filed a
cross-complaint against NR and Roes 101 through 120.  NR filed an answer to the cross-complaint on
December 22, 2023.
On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
notice of settlement.  Although it
purports to be a notice of settlement of the entire case, the Court was
subsequently informed that the causes of action in the cross-complaint have not
been settled.
Two discovery disputes are before the Court and
set for hearing on May 30, 2024.
As is relevant to those disputes, City served
written discovery on NR on December 7, 2023, including Request for Admission
(Set One) and Form Interrogatories (Set One). 
(Sanchez Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A-B.) 
NR served responses, including both objections and substantive answers,
on January 9, 2024.  (Id., ¶ 4 & Exhs.
B-C.)  The responses were not verified,
and along with its moving papers City files a declaration (dated February 23, 2024)
asserting that no verifications had been received.  (Id., ¶¶ 4, 5, 7 & Exhs. B-C.)
NR asserts that verifications were signed on
March 20, 2024.  (Mantych Decls., ¶ 7
& Exhs. 1.)  City concedes in its replies
that NR sent the verifications to City on March 20.  (Motion to Compel Reply, at p. 2:15-16.)
Notwithstanding that concession, on April 12,
2024, City filed a motion to compel NR to respond to the Form Interrogatories and
a motion for an order deeming NR to have admitted as true the matters specified
in the Requests for Admission.  NR filed
an opposition on May 16, and City filed a reply on May 22.
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On December 7, 2023, City served NR with Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Sanchez Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A-B.)  NR initially served unverified responses but
then provided the verifications on March 20, 2024.  (Id., ¶¶ 4, 5, 7 & Exhs. B-C; Mantych
Decls., ¶ 7 & Exhs. 1.)  
City filed these two motions on April 12,
2024.  Even though City had been in
receipt of the verifications for approximately 23 days, City represented in the
motions that NR had not provided verifications. 
That was false.  The Court cannot
determine on this record whether the false statements in the moving papers were
intentional or accidental, but what appears to the Court to be true is the
following: in its moving papers, City made false statements regarding the most
critical fact in their motions.
Based on the facts that existed as of the
date of filing (and not some earlier date), the motions appear to be frivolous
and the motion papers appear to include false statements of fact.
This is unacceptable.  The Court will hear from counsel for City
regarding whether these false statements were intentional or accidental.  The Court may set an OSC regarding why monetary
sanctions should not be imposed on City for bringing a frivolous motion under
Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (a) and/or for making
factual contentions in a motion that have no evidentiary support under Code of
Civil Procedure section 128.7, subdivision (b)(3).  Alternatively, City may wish to consider
other options, such as withdrawing the motions.
The motions are continued for a period of at
least 21 days.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
128.5, subd. (f)(1)(D) & 128.7, subd. (c)(2).  
Conclusion
The Court will hear
from counsel.
The hearings on City’s motions are continued
for at least 21 days.
City to give notice.
