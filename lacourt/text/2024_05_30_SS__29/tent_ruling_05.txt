 Case Number:  21STCV04291    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendants’ Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff Fatima
Adauta 
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.
 
Background
On February 3, 2021, Fatima Adauta and
Maria Serafin filed a complaint against David Redlus and Deanna Redlus
(collectively "Defendants”) for negligence arising out of an automobile
accident occurring on February 22, 2019.
 
On January 11, 2023, default was
entered against Defendants. Defendants filed their answer on March 17, 2023. On
April 24, 2023, a stipulation was filed setting aside default against
Defendants.
 
As it relates to the matter currently
before the Court and set for hearing on May 30, Defendants initially noticed
the deposition of Plaintiff Fatima Adauta (“Plaintiff”) for October 5,
2023.  (Messina Decl., ¶ 4.)  The deposition was taken off calendar at
Plaintiff’s request.  (Id., ¶
5.)  Plaintiff indicated that she was
available for deposition on March 27, 2024, and so Defendants noticed her
deposition on that date.  (Id., ¶¶
7-10 & Exh. E.)
 
Plaintiff did not serve objections or
appear for the deposition.  (Id.,
¶¶ 11-16 & Exh. H.)  Defendants
inquired about the nonappearance and rescheduling the deposition but received
no response.  (Id., ¶¶ 17-18 &
Exh. I.)
 
On April 5, 2024, Defendants filed this motion to compel
the deposition of Plaintiff. Defendants also seek monetary sanctions.
 
According to the Court’s records, and the reservation
attached to the moving papers, this motion is set for hearing on May 30, 2024.  According to the notice of motion and motion,
however, the hearing is set for June 17, 2024. 

 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any such motion to compel
must show good cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has
failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that
the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.”  (Id., subd.
(b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
After a
prior unsuccessful attempt, Defendants noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for March
27, 2024, a date on which Plaintiff had previously indicated she was available.  (Messina Decl., ¶¶
7-10 & Exh. E.)  Plaintiff did not object
and did not appear.  (Id., ¶¶ 11-16
& Exh. H.)  Defendants reached out to
Plaintiff to inquire about the nonappearance and received no 
response.  (Id.,
¶¶ 17-18 & Exh. I.)
 
Defendants have made a proper showing for their motion to
compel.
 
What Defendants have not done, however, is to give proper
notice of the motion.  According to the moving
papers, this motion was set for hearing on June 17, 2024.  Plaintiff was not given proper notice of the
actual hearing date (May 30) and so did not receive proper notice and an
opportunity to be heard.
 
For that reason, the motion is denied without prejudice.
Conclusion
 
The Court
DENIES without prejudice Defendants’ motion to compel the deposition of
Plaintiff Fatima Adauta.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
