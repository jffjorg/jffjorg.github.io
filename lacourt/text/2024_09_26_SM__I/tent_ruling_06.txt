 Case Number:  24SMCV00423    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion for sanctions by plaintiff.  First, once again this is an overlength
brief.  The court, on its own motion,
STRIKES the overlength portion of the brief. 
Second, the general basis of the motion is that Paul Hastings acted
inappropriately in refusing to accept service of process for three of the
defendants.  The court has already ruled
against plaintiff in that regard. 
Because that is the general basis of the motion, the motion fails.  The court has reviewed the issues set forth
in the motion (and even peeked at the stricken part) and does not find the
motion convincing on its merits.  The
motion is, therefore, DENIED.  Again, it
is time to move on.  The court does not
expect to see this case again except for an occasional status conference to
make sure that the arbitration is going forward or, after the arbitration has
concluded, in a motion to confirm, vacate, or correct the arbitration award.
