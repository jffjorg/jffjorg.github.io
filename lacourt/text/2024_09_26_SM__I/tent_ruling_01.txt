  Case Number:  22SMCV00400    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  I Plaintiff has submitted an opposition to the court’s
“motion” not to enter a default judgment. 
The court will explain its ruling. 

 
Plaintiff had a vintage car. 
He hired Blakely to rebuild the engine and paid Blakely to do so.  Plaintiff states that, unbeknownst to him,
Blakely sent the car to others who did not store it properly, which led to
significant damage.  Plaintiff has
settled with Blakely, but the other defendants are in default.  Plaintiff has requested that the court enter
a default judgment against them.
 
The court cannot really do so in the way plaintiff would
like.  The complaint has no dollar amount
in it other than the $9400 that plaintiff paid to Blakely.  The court can enter judgment for $9400, but
it would have to be reduced by the amount of any settlement plaintiff reached
with Blakely.  The net would be a proper
judgment, but that is not what plaintiff seeks. 
Plaintiff seeks a recovery for the additional damage to the car—an
amount well in excess of $9400.  The
problem is that such amount is not quantified in the complaint, and therefore
it would be a denial of due process to the defaulted defendants to enter a
judgment in that amount.  The judgment
would be void on its face.
 
Therefore, plaintiff has two choices: (1) he can seek a
judgment for $9400 less the amount he got through his settlement with Blakely
(but given that the judgment is below this court’s minimum jurisdiction, the
court is unlikely to award plaintiff his costs); or (2) he can file an amended
complaint with the amount of damages set forth, re-serve the amended complaint,
and (if defendants do not respond) seek a judgment for that amount, again less
whatever was recovered from Blakely.  Of
course, if defendants do answer, then the case will have to be litigated.  The court notes that the filing of an amended
complaint automatically vacates the default.
