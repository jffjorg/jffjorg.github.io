And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's opposition to the court's motion not to enter a default judgment. The plaintiff had hired Blakely to rebuild the engine of his vintage car, but Blakely sent the car to others who did not store it properly, causing significant damage. The plaintiff has settled with Blakely, but the other defendants are in default. The plaintiff is seeking a default judgment against them for the additional damage to the car, but the court cannot do so in the amount the plaintiff seeks because the complaint does not specify the amount of damages. The court notes that a default judgment must be supported by the complaint and that due process requires quantification of damages. The court gives the plaintiff two options: seek a judgment for $9400 less the amount he got through his settlement with Blakely, or file an amended complaint with the specified damages and re-serve it. If the defendants do not respond to the amended complaint, the plaintiff can seek a judgment for that amount, less whatever was recovered from Blakely.
