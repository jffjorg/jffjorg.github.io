And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court sets forth general discovery guidelines and IDC guidelines to help guide the discussion in today's IDC. The court emphasizes the importance of good faith in the discovery process and encourages parties to view objections and responses in a similar way. The court also provides guidance on boilerplate objections, the need for specific responses to discovery requests, and the importance of diligent search and verification.

The court believes that a good faith meet and confer process is essential to resolving disputes and encourages parties to approach the process as a problem-solving exercise. The court also prefers an informal discovery conference (IDC) before any party files a motion to compel further responses.

The court sets forth specific guidelines for the IDC process, including the requirement that parties submit a joint statement setting forth their respective positions five court days before the IDC, and that the IDC be attended by a person with the authority to agree to the other side's position without getting further permission.

The court also emphasizes the importance of civility and professionalism during the IDC process, and encourages parties to be willing to give up sanctions if it will resolve the dispute. The goal of the IDC process is to "get to yes" and to reach an agreement that is fair and reasonable.
