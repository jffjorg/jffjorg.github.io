And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to obtain financial information for punitive damages. The motion is denied because the plaintiffs have not shown a "strong likelihood" of success on the punitive damages issue. The Judge states that the evidence presented by the plaintiffs is weak and mainly consists of allegations in the complaint, police reports, and a deposition from a witness who was drunk at the time of the incident. The Judge notes that the deposition is evidence, but the witness's recollection is poor and she was impeached during the deposition. The Judge also points out that the defendant, Zeray, has not provided a declaration or sworn statement, which would be evidence. The Judge orders that the motion is denied, but without prejudice to being renewed on a more significant showing. The Judge also notes that section 3295 does not apply to trial subpoenas, and the plaintiffs will be able to issue a subpoena to obtain the information for trial purposes.
