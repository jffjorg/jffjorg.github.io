The tentative ruling grants plaintiff Marcus Moreno's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set one, as per Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290. Defendant Elian Akkari is ordered to serve responses to these interrogatories within 15 days. The motion is granted because the defendant failed to serve any responses to the discovery requests, which were served on March 22, 2023. The court notes that sanctions are denied because the motion was unopposed and no provision of the Discovery Act authorizes the imposition of sanctions in this case.
