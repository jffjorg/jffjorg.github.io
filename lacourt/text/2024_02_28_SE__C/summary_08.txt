And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Passport Foods USA, LLC's motion to compel further documents from Defendant Passport Foods (SVC) LLC. The dispute arose from the court's November 21, 2023 order, which required Defendant to produce its tax documents, including "All of Debtor's rights in…tax refunds and tax refund claims, as well as Debtor's books and records relating to any of the foregoing." Plaintiff seeks payroll records, which Defendant argues are outside the scope of the court's order. The court finds that the payroll records are within the scope of the order and orders Defendant to produce them, along with other relevant documents. The court declines to impose sanctions on either party.
