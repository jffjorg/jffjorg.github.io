 Case Number:  23NWCV01584    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  C Angelica Salazar, et al. vs Kia America, Inc., Case
No. 23NWCV01584
This is a lemon law action. 
 
A party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual
showing "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis
for granting relief ex parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
 
Trial in this matter is scheduled for October 9, 2024.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel is not set to be heard until September 18, 2024,
which would leave no time for Defendant to provide further responses prior to
the discovery cut-off for the current rial date in the event Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel is granted. The Court finds that Plaintiff would be irreparably
harmed by not allowing the motion to be heard prior to the discovery cut-off
dates. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs Angelica Salazar and Daniel Ramirez
Cruz’s Ex Parte Application to ADVANCE the hearing date for Amended Motions to
Compel the Deposition and Production of Documents is GRANTED. The Hearing for
Amended Motions to Compel the Deposition and Production of Documents is
ADVANCED from Wednesday, September 18, 2024 and CONTINUED to Wednesday,
April 24, 2024 in Department SE-C at 9:30 a.m.
 
Plaintiff to give Notice.
