23NWCV02191
On February 7, 2024, this Ex Parte was called on calendar
for Status Report re Defendant/Cross-Complainant Jose Gonzalez’s Bankruptcy
Proceeding and Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Loan Oak Fund’s Ex Parte Application
for (1) Vacating Default, and (2) Dissolving Temporary Restraining Order. The
Court has read and considered Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Loan Oak Fund’s Status
Report re Bankruptcy filed January 29, 2024.
 
The Court found that a brief continuance was required to
determine whether the bankruptcy stay would remain in effect. The matter
ultimately was CONTINUED to February 28, 2024. 
 
As of February 14, 2024, the stay has been lifted. Given
that the stay is no longer in effect on that date, the Court now schedules a
hearing on Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Loan Oak Fund’s Motion to Vacate Default. 
 
Accordingly, the Court sets the Vacating Default for Wednesday,
March 27, 2024 in Department SE-C at 10:30 a.m.   
 
Plaintiff to give Notice.
