Plaintiff’s
Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enforce Settlement is GRANTED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff American Express National Bank (Plaintiff)
moves for an order vacating dismissal and entering judgment pursuant to CCP §
664.6. The Motion is unopposed.
Background
Plaintiff
filed a Complaint against Defendants Claudia Vera and Zeraty, LLC for Common
Counts. The parties entered into a Settlement Agreement and signed a
stipulation for the Court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement
Agreement.
Legal
Standard
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.” (CCP § 664.6.)
Discussion

Dismissal is vacated and the Court enters
judgment against Defendants in the amount of $26,610.37. The parties filed a
signed stipulation for the Court to maintain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP §
664.6. The stipulation was granted on May 11, 2021. Defendants agreed to pay
$28,400.00 in monthly payments of $1,577.78 from November 2020 to April 2022
with the last payment being $1,577.74. The stipulation provides that the
parties agree that “Defendants are indebted to Plaintiff … in the amount of
$35,514.05” and that the “Court can enter a judgment against Defendants in the
amount of $35,514.05 plus costs” should Defendant fail to comply with the
stipulation. (Dyle Decl., Ex. A, ¶¶ 4-5.) 
Plaintiff moved on September 11, 2023 to vacate
the dismissal on the grounds that Defendants have failed to pay since May 12,
2021. Defendants made payments totaling $9,466.68. Thus, Plaintiff requests
that this Court enter Judgment in the amount of $26,610.37, which consists of
the remaining balance of $26,047.37 and $563.00 in costs. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. Judgment shall be
entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and severally, in
the amount of $26,610.37.
