And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Angelica Salazar and Daniel Ramirez Cruz vs. Kia America, Inc. (Case No. 23NWCV01584). The case is a lemon law action, and the Court has scheduled a trial for October 9, 2024. The Plaintiff's Motion to Compel is currently set to be heard on September 18, 2024, but this would leave no time for the Defendant to provide further responses prior to the discovery cut-off date. The Court finds that the Plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm if the motion is not heard before the discovery cut-off date, and therefore grants the Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application to advance the hearing date. The hearing for the Amended Motions to Compel deposition and production of documents is continued from September 18, 2024 to April 24, 2024.
