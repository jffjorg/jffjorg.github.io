And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant, General Motors LLC, will not be allowed to dismiss the plaintiff's fraud claims. The plaintiffs, Karina Hinojosa and Luis Alejandro Garcia, allege that the defendant misrepresented the condition of a 2018 GMC Sierra they purchased, and that the defendant concealed the vehicle's transmission defects. The judge found that the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded their fraud claims and that the statute of limitations does not bar the claims. The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages.
