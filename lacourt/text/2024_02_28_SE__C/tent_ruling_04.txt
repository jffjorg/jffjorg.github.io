TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiff
Marcus Moreno’s motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set one is
GRANTED. Monetary sanctions are DENIED.
 
Defendant
Akkari is ordered to serve responses to form interrogatories, set one within 15
days. 
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Plaintiff Marcus Moreno moves to
compel responses to form Interrogatories, set one pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290.  No
Opposition has been filed as of February 23, 2024.  
 
Plaintiff alleges a breach of contract for home
improvement services, causing damages of $81,110.90. Plaintiff alleges causes
of action for the following: 
 
1.    Breach
of Contract
2.    Fraud
3.    Negligence
4.    Restitution

5.    Money
Had and Received. 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b) allows the propounding
party to file a motion to compel responses to interrogatories if a response has
not been received.  If responses are
untimely, the responding party waives objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  
 
Plaintiff served discovery on March 22, 2023.  (Decl. Gaitan, ¶ 3.)  Defendant
failed to serve any responses to form interrogatories.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.  Defendant Akkari is ordered to serve
responses without objections within 15 days. 

 
Sanctions:  Discovery sanctions may not be imposed
under Section 2023.030, even together with Section 2023.010, absent another
provision of the Discovery Act that authorizes the imposition of sanctions. (City
of L. A. v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
500.) Sanctions with respect to interrogatories are only authorized against a
party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel responses. (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).) Here, sanctions are denied because the
motion is unopposed.
