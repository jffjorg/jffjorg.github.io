Plaintiff’s
Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enforce Settlement is GRANTED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff American Express National Bank
(Plaintiff) moves for an order vacating dismissal and entering judgment
pursuant to CCP § 664.6. The Motion is unopposed.
Background
Plaintiff
filed a Complaint against Defendant Terry Thompson for Common Counts. The
parties entered into a Settlement Agreement and signed a stipulation for the
Court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement.
Legal
Standard
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.” (CCP § 664.6.)
Discussion

Dismissal is vacated and the Court enters
judgment against Defendants in the amount of $17,563.00. The parties filed a
signed stipulation for the Court to maintain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP §
664.6. The stipulation was granted on May 11, 2022. Defendants agreed to pay
$28,415.88 in lump sum payments of $2,415.88 in April 2022 and $6,500.00 in
December 2023 and a combination of monthly payments of $3,000.00 and $500.00
from May 2022 to November 2023. The stipulation provides that the parties agree
that “Defendants are indebted to Plaintiff … in the amount of $28,415.88” and
that the “Court can enter a judgment against Defendants in the amount of $28,415.88
plus costs” should Defendant fail to comply with the stipulation. (Dyle Decl.,
Ex. A, ¶¶ 4-5.) Plaintiff moved on September 11, 2023 to vacate the dismissal
on the grounds that Defendants have failed to pay since December 23, 2022.
Defendants made payments totaling $11,415.88. Thus, Plaintiff requests that
this Court enter Judgment in the amount of $17,563.00, which consists of the
remaining balance of $17,000.00 and $563.00 in costs. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. Judgment shall be
entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and severally, in
the amount of $17,563.00.
