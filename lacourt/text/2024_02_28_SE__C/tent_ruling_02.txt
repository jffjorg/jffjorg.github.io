Plaintiff’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions
is CONTINUED to March 6, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Javier Ortegon (Plaintiff) moves for
an order of terminating, issue, and monetary sanctions against Defendant
Carolina Cortazar (Defendant Cortazar). 
Defendant Cortazar filed an untimely Opposition on February 16,
2024.  
Background
This
is a landlord-tenant dispute between Plaintiff and Defendants Carolina
Cortazar, Steven Mitchell, and Carlos Sandoval. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants unlawfully entered the leased property on several occasions,
threatened Plaintiff, removed Plaintiff’s personal property, and wrongfully
evicted Plaintiff.
Legal
Standard
If
a party fails to comply with a court order compelling discovery responses or
attendance at a deposition, the court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or
terminating sanctions. (CCP § 2025.450(h); § 2030.290(c); § 2031.300(c).) “To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method … the court, after notice to any affected party,
person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose … [monetary,
issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process ….” (CCP § 2030.030.) “Misuses of the discovery
process include, but are not limited to, the following: … (d) Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery … (g) Disobeying a
court order to provide discovery ….” (CCP § 2030.010.)
Discussion

Plaintiff moves for terminating sanctions and
monetary sanctions after Defendant Cortazar violated this Court’s March 24,
2022 order to respond to Plaintiff’s Demand for Inspection of Premises, Set One,
and this Court’s February 21, 2023 order to provide responses, without
objections, to Plaintiff’s Demand for Inspection of Tangible Things, Set One.  Additionally, Defendant Cortazar and her
counsel have failed to pay any of monetary sanctions ordered by the Court, to
respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One, and Form
Interrogatories, Set Two, served on July 25, 2023, and to produce any documents
whatsoever.
In Opposition, Defendant Cortazar declares that
on September 21, 2021, the property formerly occupied by Plaintiff was leased
to another tenant who currently occupies the property. (Cortazar Decl., ¶ 2.)
Defendant Cortazar argues that responses to Plaintiff’s Demand for Inspection
of Tangible Things, Set One, were served on October 25, 2022, indicating that
Defendant Cortazar is no longer in possession of Plaintiff’s personal property
because the property has already been disposed of by the Sheriff’s Department. (Cortazar
Decl., ¶ 3.) On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff was convicted of the attempted
murder of Defendant Carlos Sandoval, son of Defendant Cortazar, and is
currently serving a state prison sentence. (Cortazar Decl., ¶ 4.) Counsel for
Defendant Cortazar, Paul Denni, contends that Plaintiff’s counsel has not met
and conferred in good faith. (Denni Decl., ¶ 7.)  
As
of February 23, 2024, no Reply to Defendant Cortazar’s untimely Opposition has
been filed.  Plaintiff’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions is CONTINUED to March 6,
2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C, to be heard together with Plaintiff’s Motion
to Deem Matters Admitted.  Plaintiff may
file a Reply in accordance with the continued hearing date.
