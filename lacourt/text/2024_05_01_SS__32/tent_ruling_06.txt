OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Progressive
Insurance Company (“Petitioner”) filed the instant
petition for a case number in connection with an Uninsured Motorist proceeding
pursuant to Insurance Code section 11580.2 involving Respondent Antasha Carter,
in pro per (“Respondent”).
 
Petitioner moves to deem admitted the matters in Request
for Admissions, Set One, served on Respondent. No opposition has been filed.    
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“[T]he
uninsured motorist law grants the superior court the exclusive jurisdiction to
hear discovery matters arising under uninsured motorist arbitrations.” (Miranda
v. 21st Century Ins. Co.¿(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 913, 926.) In uninsured
motorist arbitrations, discovery may be commenced both before and after the
commencement of arbitration. (Id. at 923.)  
 
Insurance Code
section 11580.2 does not provide any manner for the service of a petition.
However, “Section 1290.4, subdivision (b) of the Code of Civil Procedure does
set forth service requirements for a “petition” under the contractual
arbitration law.” (Id. at 928.) Under section 1290.4, a copy of the petition
and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing and any other papers
upon which the petition is based must be served in the manner provided in the
arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1290.4(a).)¿ If the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner
for service, then section 1290.4 requires that service be made in the manner
provided by law for the service of summons in an action.¿ (Id., §
1290.4(b).)¿ 
 
Where there has
been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a
substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)¿ The court “shall” grant a motion to
deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom
the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on
the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ 
 
The Discovery
Act does not define “substantial compliance” in the context of service of a
proposed response that complies with Code Civ. Proc., section 2033.220. The
courts have ruled that “substantial compliance” means actual compliance with
all matters of substance and that technical deviations are not to be given the
stature of noncompliance. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th
762, 779.) For example, unverified responses are not in substantial compliance.
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Additionally, RFA
responses must be examined in their entirety. (St. Mary v. Superior Court
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 780.)  
 
Unverified
discovery responses are tantamount to no response at all, and are subject to a
motion to compel responses (rather than a motion to compel further responses).¿
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 632, 635-36.)¿
However, objections to discovery responses do not require a verification. (See Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 656.)  
 
Where a party
fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, on February 21, 2024, Petitioner served Request for Admissions,
Set One on Respondent. (Calendo Decl. ¶ 28., Exh. T.) The responses were due
March 26, 2024. Since then, no responses have been received. (Id. ¶ 30.)
Therefore, because responses have not been served, the motion to deem admitted
is granted. 
 
Petitioner does not request monetary sanctions. However, sanctions are
mandatory. Therefore, the Court awards $60 in sanctions against Respondent for
the motion filing fee. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Petitioner’s motion to deem admitted Request for
Admissions, Set One against Respondent Antasha Carter
is GRANTED.
 
The Court further conditionally grants
$60.00 in monetary sanctions against Respondent Antasha Carter. Said monetary sanctions shall be paid to
counsel for Petitioner within 30 days. 
 
Petitioner shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
