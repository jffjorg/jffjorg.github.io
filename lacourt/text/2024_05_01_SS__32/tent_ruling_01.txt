TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


May
  1, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


20STCV26481




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant SF Markets, LLC




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Idalia Lemus 



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendant SF Markets, LLC (“Defendant”) moves for
terminating sanctions, or in the alternative, for evidentiary and monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff Idalia
Lemus (“Plaintiff”) for failure to comply with the Court’s October 19, 2023 discovery
order. Plaintiff opposes.[1]
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225,
1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting
default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the
plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating
various discovery statutes].)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant served discovery on Plaintiff on May 15, 2023. (Crossin
Decl. ¶ 2–3.) On October 19, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s unopposed
motions to compel. Plaintiff was ordered to provide verified responses, without
objections, to Special Interrogatories, Set Two and Request for Production of
Documents, Set Two within 30 days. (See Min. Order, 10/19/23.) Plaintiff and
her counsel of record was also ordered to pay $435 in monetary sanctions for
both motions. Defendant served notice of the orders electronically to
Plaintiff’s counsel on October 20, 2023. 
 
On February 26, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion asserting
that it had not received responses. (Crossin Decl. ¶ 6.) 
 
Plaintiff’s opposition asserts that on April 24, 2024, she provided
objection-free, verified responses to Supplemental discovery. (Panah Decl. ¶ 2,
Exh. 1.) However, the supplemental discovery attached to the opposition is not
the subject discovery that was compelled at the October 20, 2023 hearing. 
 
            Still, Defendant has not presented
enough facts that Plaintiff willfully disobeyed the Court’s order or that this
was preceded by a history of abuse. Therefore, the motion for terminating
sanctions is denied. 
 
The Court also denies Defendant’s request for evidentiary sanctions
since Defendant requested the Court preclude evidence regarding its liability
or Plaintiff’s damages. (Motion, 7.) This would have a similar effect as
terminating Plaintiff’s case. 
 
However, the Court finds monetary sanctions are warranted. Plaintiff
offers no specific facts to explain why discovery responses were not served within
the time set by the Court’s order. Accordingly, monetary sanctions are
appropriate. The Court finds the amount requested to be reasonable.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion for terminating and evidentiary
sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff and counsel of record, jointly and severally, shall pay
monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,560.00 to counsel for Defendant within
30 days of this order.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
