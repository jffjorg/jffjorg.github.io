  Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special
  Interrogatories, Set One




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation

BACKGROUND
 
 Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation
(“Defendant”) now moves for an order to deem admitted Requests for Admission,
Set One and to compel verified responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One,
propounded on Plaintiff Darlene Willis (“Plaintiff”). Defendant also seeks monetary
sanctions. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Requests
for Admission
 
Where there has
been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a
substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)¿ The court “shall” grant a motion to
deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom
the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on
the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ 
 
Where a party
fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Interrogatories
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902,
905-906.)  
 
If a motion to
compel responses is filed, the Court shall impose a monetary sanction against
the losing party “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 (c).) Further, “[t]he
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a). 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Defendant asserts that it served Requests for
Admission, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories,
Set One on Plaintiff on November 16, 2023. (Tsao Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. 1, 2.) The
responses were due on December 19, 2023. (Id. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff has not responded
and has not filed an opposition to this motion. Therefore, the motion to deem
admitted and motion to compel are granted.   
 
Defendant
requests $1,460 and $1,110 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her
counsel of record for both motions, representing an hourly rate of $350 and the
$60.00 filing fee. The Court finds sanctions are warranted because Plaintiff
has failed to respond. However, the amount requested is excessive due to the
type of motions at issue and the fact no opposition was filed. Therefore, the
Court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,170 (3 hours of total attorney time
to file and appear at the hearing, plus the $60 filing fee for each motion). 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to establish to deem
Request for Admissions, Set One admitted is GRANTED. Defendant’s Motion to
Compel Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One is
GRANTED. Plaintiff Darlene Willis shall serve
verified responses without objections within 30 days. 
 
The Court further GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel of record, jointly and severally,
in the reduced amount of $1,170.00.
Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Defendant within 30 days
of the date of this order. 
 
Defendant shall
provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
