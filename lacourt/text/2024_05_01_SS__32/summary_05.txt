English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

**Tentative Ruling**

The Court hereby denies the motion for sanctions filed by Defendants Peter A. Coeler dba P.A.C. Properties and PBM 1, LLC against Plaintiffs Adrienne Tripp and Hoss Zargaran. The motion was filed in an attempt to impose $126,020 in sanctions against Plaintiffs for alleged frivolous litigation.

**Background**

Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants on November 12, 2021, alleging negligence, premises liability, and loss of consortium. The Court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment, and Defendants subsequently filed the instant motion for sanctions.

**Discussion**

Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' complaint was frivolous and lacked merit, and that Plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient legal and factual support for their claims. However, the Court finds that the complaint was not entirely without merit, and that Defendants failed to demonstrate subjective bad faith.

**Conclusion and Order**

The motion for sanctions is DENIED. Defendents shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
