The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at the trial, and the court dismissed the complaint. The plaintiff's counsel claims that he made a mistake about the travel time and was unable to appear at the trial. The defendants oppose the plaintiff's request to set a new trial date, instead asking for a trial setting conference on a future date. The court grants the plaintiff's motion and sets a new trial date for June 12, 2024. All trial counsel are ordered to appear personally at 8:30 a.m.
