And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's discovery responses is granted. The defendant's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demands for production of documents is also granted. The plaintiff is ordered to produce verified discovery responses without objection within 20 days.

The judge also grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,060.00. The court finds that the defendant's counsel spent 1 hour preparing each motion, anticipating another hour reviewing the opposition and reply per motion, and another hour appearing at the hearing per motion.
