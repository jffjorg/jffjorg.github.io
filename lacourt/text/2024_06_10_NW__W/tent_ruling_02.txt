BACKGROUND
 
On
January 9, 2023, Plaintiff Robin La Due filed a complaint against Defendants
Shahe Boyadjian and Maral Boyadjian. Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
on August 24, 2023 for Breach of Contract, Stolen Property, and Malicious
Sabotage. Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint on January 8, 2024, adding
a cause of action for Fraud on the Court. 
 
The parties have a history of litigation between them that began
prior to Plaintiffs filing the instant action. In January 2022, Boyadjian filed
a small claims action against Robin La Due to recover unpaid rent. Judgment was
ultimately entered in favor of Boyadjian, against La Due. On June 21, 2022,
Boyadjian filed an unlawful detainer action against Robin La Due, stemming from
his longstanding unjustified failure to pay rent at the subject property, in
direct violation of the lease agreement. That matter was also fully litigated
and resulted in another judgment in favor of Boyadjian, against La Due.
Following those two actions by Boyadjian, Plaintiff subsequently brought two
civil actions against the Boyadjians. In
this action, Plaintiff alleges Defendants did not properly give Plaintiff
enough time to vacate the premises upon the Sheriffs arrival and left their
personal property at the unit, which Defendants have refused to return.
Plaintiff also alleges Defendant withheld Plaintiff’s security deposit. 
 
[Tentative]
Ruling
 
Defendants’
Motion to Dismiss for Plaintiff’s Failure to Amend Following Sustaining of
Demurrer is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants Shahe Boyadjian and Maral
Boyadjian move the court for an order dismissing the Second Amended Complaint
of Plaintiff Robin La Due with prejudice , in its entirety, on the grounds of
Plaintiff’s failure to file an amended pleading within the time given.
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 581 provides that a court may dismiss the complaint as to
that defendant when, after a demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, the
plaintiff fails to amend the complaint within the time allowed by the court and
either party moves for dismissal. (CCP § 581(f).) While dismissal under Code of
Civil Procedure section 581(f) is discretionary, any such dismissal must be
with prejudice. (Cano v. Glover (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 326, 330.) “No
cases have held that a dismissal pursuant to section 581, subdivision (f)(2)
may be without prejudice. The right to dismiss without prejudice is expressly
permitted by other subdivisions of section 581 but section 581, subdivision
(f)(2) does not so provide.”¿(Id. at 229.) 
 
Pursuant to
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1320, following a ruling on a demurrer,
unless otherwise ordered, leave to answer or amend within 10 days is deemed
granted.
 
On April 9, 2024,
this court sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the entirety of Plaintiff’s Second
Amended Complaint. The court sustained the demurrer to the first, second, and
third causes of action with 20 days leave to amend, giving Plaintiff more
opportunity to sufficiently plead causes of action one, two, and three. Additionally,
the court sustained Defendants’ demurrer as to the fourth cause of action for
“Fraud on the Court” without leave to amend. As a result, Plaintiff’s Third
Amended Complaint was to be filed no later than April 29, 2024. As of the date
of this filing, April 30, 2024, Plaintiff has not served or filed an amended
pleading nor did they seek an extension before Defendants filed the present
motion. 
 
Such failure can be
construed as a presumption that Plaintiff has no meritorious claims. (See Southern
California Gas Co. v. Flannery (2016), 5 Cal. App. 5th 476, 483, fn.7 (lack
of opposition waives arguments); Sexton v. Superior Court (1997), 58
Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.) Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion and
Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendants are dismissed with prejudice.
