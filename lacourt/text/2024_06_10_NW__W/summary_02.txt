And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has rejected the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint, ruling that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a claim for fraudulent concealment. The court finds that the plaintiff has alleged that the defendant, Ford Motor Company, knew about the transmission defect in the 2019 Ford 150 that the plaintiff purchased and concealed this fact from the plaintiff. The court also rejects the defendant's argument that the claim is barred by the economic loss rule, as the issue is still open and has not been addressed by the California Supreme Court.
