And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Ford Motor Company's demurrer to Shlomo Cohen's first amended complaint is overruled. The Judge disagrees with Ford's argument that the plaintiff's fraudulent concealment cause of action fails to state a claim against Ford. The Judge finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges that Ford knew about the transmission defect and concealed it from the plaintiff. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's allegations are not barred by the economic loss rule under current case law.
