And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant, Arthur M. Danielian. The plaintiff, Carlos Burgos, had requested the default judgment due to the defendant's failure to respond to the lawsuit. However, the court found that the plaintiff failed to provide a required document, known as a JUD-100, which is necessary for the court to consider the request for default judgment. Additionally, the plaintiff did not provide a declaration from a percipient witness, such as the plaintiff himself, attesting to his damages and authenticating the medical records and bills. The court also noted that the plaintiff seeks interest in the amount of $72,346.56, but since the damages are related to personal injury, the court will not award interest in this case. The plaintiff has 30 days to correct the defects in the default judgment package and resubmit it to the court. If the plaintiff fails to do so, the court may impose sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
