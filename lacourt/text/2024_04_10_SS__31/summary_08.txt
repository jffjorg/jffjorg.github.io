And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel a second physical examination of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had previously undergone an orthopedic examination, and the defendant seeks to examine the plaintiff's neurological and cognitive injuries. The plaintiff opposes the motion, citing the cumulative nature of the examination and a lack of specificity in the defendant's motion. The court finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the examination and that the notice provided to the plaintiff is sufficient. The court also finds that the taking of the plaintiff's medical history is necessary for the examining doctor to form an opinion of the plaintiff's condition.
