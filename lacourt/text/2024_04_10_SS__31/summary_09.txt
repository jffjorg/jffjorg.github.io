Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' second amended complaint is overruled. The judge has determined that the complaint sufficiently states a cause of action against the defendants, despite their claims that the complaint is insufficient. The judge has also denied the defendants' request for judicial notice of exhibits, finding that the exhibits are not relevant to the issue at hand. The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and has set a hearing date for April 10, 2024.
