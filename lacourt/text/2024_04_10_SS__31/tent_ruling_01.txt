BACKGROUND Defendants Erick Galvan (“Galvan”) and Kimberlyn Medina (collectively, “Defendants”) propounded form interrogatories, set one, on plaintiff Martin Verduzco Silva (“Plaintiff”) on October 19, 2023. (Mot. Form Rogs, Exh. A.) Defendant Galvan also propounded a demand for production of documents, set one, on Plaintiff on October 19, 2023. (Mot. Doc. Production, Exh. A.) Responses were due by November 22, 2023. Defendants assert that Plaintiff has failed to serve verified responses to date. Defendants therefore seek an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Any opposition was due on or before March 27, 2024; the motions are unopposed.  II. MOTIONS TO COMPEL For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)    Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery by Defendants and failed to timely respond, any objections have been waived. Plaintiff did not oppose the motion demonstrating otherwise. Defendants’ motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendants’ form interrogatories, set one, and to defendant Galvan’s demand for production of documents, set one, without objections, within twenty (20) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b), 2031.300(a),(b).)  III. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Sunset seeks sanctions in the amount of $460 for each motion. Defendants are awarded one hour for each motion to compel, and one hour to appear at the hearing (awarded only once), at the requested rate of $100 per hour for a total of $300 in attorney’s fees. Further, Defendants are awarded two motion filing fees of $60, for a total of $120 as costs.       Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally. Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Defendants, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $420, within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 5th day of April 2024      Hon.
