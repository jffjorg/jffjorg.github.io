And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The plaintiff's attorney, Counsel, has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel due to an irreparable breakdown of the working relationship with the plaintiff. However, the court is unclear about the method Counsel used to confirm the plaintiff's address and will require further explanation in a declaration. Additionally, Counsel failed to file proof of service of the notice of motion and motion on the plaintiff and other parties who have appeared in the action. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice, and Counsel is ordered to give notice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if no agreement is reached, parties must submit to the court via email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
