  Order RE:
 
order to show cause (1) why the court should
  not set aside its order approving amendment to complaint, and (2) why the
  court should not set aside and strike defendant’s default
 



 
Order to Show Cause (1) Why the Court Should Not Set Aside its June 17,
2024 Order Approving the Amendment to Complaint, and (2) Why the Court Should
Not Set Aside and Strike JJL Machine Shop, Inc., dba Alameda Motor’s Default,
Entered on August 2, 2024
            On
September 26, 2024, the court issued an order on the ex parte application for
entry of default judgment or order setting hearing on default filed by
plaintiff Zenayda Servin (“Plaintiff”). 
Therein, the court noted that the default of JJL Machine Shop, Inc.,
d/b/a Alameda Motors (“JJL Machine Shop”) appeared to have been improperly
entered because (1) it appeared that the court should not have entered
an order approving the Amendment to Complaint lodged by Plaintiff on June 13,
2024 since Plaintiff was improperly attempting to substitute a new entity in as
a defendant (i.e., JJL Machine Shop in place of Luis A. Perez, d/b/a Alameda
Motors), and (2) even if that were a proper use of the Amendment to Complaint
form, Plaintiff merely corrected the name of Luis A. Perez d/b/a Alameda Motors
to be JJL Machine Shop, such that its default should not have been entered
since that defendant had already filed a responsive pleading to the First
Amended Complaint.  (Sep. 26, 2024 Order,
pp. 1:24-25, 2:9-25.)  
            Thus, the court set an Order to Show
Cause (1) why the court should not set aside its June 17, 2024 order approving
the Amendment to Complaint, and (2) why the court should not set aside and
strike JJL Machine Shop, Inc., dba Alameda Motors’s default, entered on August
2, 2024, for hearing on December 11, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.  (Sep. 26, 2024 Order, p. 3:5-9.)  Plaintiff served a copy of the court’s
September 26, 2024 order on JJL Machine Shop and Felipe Perez, d/b/a Fix and Go
Auto Repair by mail on October 17, 2024. 
(Oct. 17, 2024 POS-040, ¶¶ 5-6.) 
Plaintiff filed a response to the Order to Show Cause on November 18,
2024, arguing that the court should not set aside its order and JJL Machine
Shop’s default on the ground that Plaintiff properly substituted JJL Machine
Shop in by its true name.  (Diaz Decl.,
¶¶ 4-6.)
First, the court finds that
the “Amendment to Complaint” form lodged by Plaintiff on June 17, 2024 should
not have been approved. 
Although Plaintiff stated that
she was correcting the name of Luis A. Perez, d/b/a Alameda Motors to be JJL
Machine Shop, the effect of the amendment was to substitute in an entirely new
defendant, which is an improper use of the “Amendment to Complaint” form’s
request to correct the name of a defendant. 
(June 17, 2024 Amendment to Complaint, p. 1; Pl. Response to Order to
Show Cause, Diaz Decl., ¶¶ 4 [Plaintiff’s counsel “discovered Alameda Motors
was operating as a corporation and not a sole proprietorship”], 6 [“Upon the
Courts order issued on June 17, 2024, Luis A. Perez, individually was no longer
a Defendant in this case”].)  While Luis
A. Perez and JJL Machine Shop, Inc. may be operating under the same fictitious
business name of “Alameda Motors,” those are two separate entities.  Thus, Plaintiff’s attempt to substitute in an
entirely new entity as a defendant (i.e., JJL Machine Shop) by stating that
Plaintiff was correcting the name of Luis A. Perez, d/b/a Alameda Motors was
improper. 
Second, the court finds that the entry of default against “JJL Machine
Shop, Inc., d/b/a Alameda Motors” was improper because (1) as set forth above,
Plaintiff’s use of the Amendment to Complaint form to substitute in a new
entity as a defendant was improper and therefore the court will set aside its
June 17, 2024 order approving that amendment, and (2) even if the court had not
determined that its June 17, 2024 order must be set aside, default should not
have been entered against JJL Machine Shop since Luis A. Perez, d/b/a Alameda
Motors (i.e., the “incorrect” name of JJL Machine Shop) filed a responsive
pleading to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint on April 16, 2024.  (April 16, 2024 General Denial (Amended)
filed by Luis A. Perez, d/b/a Alameda Motors.) 
To the extent that Plaintiff wishes
to add JJL Machine Shop as a defendant to this action, Plaintiff may file a
noticed motion requesting leave to amend the First Amended Complaint or
substitute in JJL Machine Shop as a Doe defendant pursuant to the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure section 474.
ORDER
The court orders that its June 17, 2024 order approving the “Amendment
to Complaint” filed by plaintiff Zenayda Servin is set aside. 
The court orders that JJL Machine Shop, Inc., d/b/a Alameda Motors’s
default, entered on August 2, 2024, is set aside.
The court orders plaintiff Zenayda Servin to give notice of this
ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 11, 2024
