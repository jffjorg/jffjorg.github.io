  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel defendant to
  appear for and testify at deposition and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Kristin Davidkhanian           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Defendant to Appear for and Testify at Deposition and
for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Kristin Davidkhanian (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling defendant Elena Janev (“Defendant”) to appear for and
testify at deposition, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $2,020.
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . .
., without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it . . ., the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony
. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
Plaintiff has presented evidence showing that (1) Plaintiff noticed
Defendant’s deposition for September 12, 2023, and (2) Defendant did not appear
for deposition on that date.  (Banayan
Decl., ¶¶ 2, 4 [Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer with Defendant’s counsel
regarding Defendant’s failure to object or appear at deposition], 21; Banayan
Decl., Ex. 1, Notice of Taking Deposition of Def.)  Plaintiff’s further attempts to schedule
Defendant’s deposition were unsuccessful. 
(Banayan Decl., Exs. 4-15; Banayan Decl., ¶ 21.) 
Defendant did not file an opposition to this motion, nor did Defendant
file other evidence with the court establishing that she has since agreed to
appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken by Plaintiff’s counsel.  The court notes that, in response to other
motions to compel discovery that were filed by Plaintiff, Defendant’s counsel
stated, in his declaration, that counsel is now attempting to schedule
Defendant’s deposition.  (Nov. 14, 2024
Joint Opp. to Discovery Motions, Burgee Decl., ¶ 12.)  However, it appears that Defendant has not
yet appeared for deposition. 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling Defendant to appear for and testify at deposition and therefore
grants Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (g)(1).)  The court finds that
$1,370 ((2 hours x $650 per hour) + $70 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of
sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Banayan Decl., ¶ 22.) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s request that the court issue an order
striking Defendant’s answer.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(1).) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Kristin
Davidkhanian’s motion to compel defendant to appear for and testify at
deposition and for sanctions as follows. 
            The court orders defendant Elena
Janev to attend and testify at a deposition to be taken by counsel for
plaintiff Kristin Davidkhanian on _____________, 2025, at 10:00 a.m., at the
offices of Bana Legal Group, P.C., located at 10250 Constellation Blvd., Suite
100, Los Angeles, California, 90067. 
            The court orders defendant Elena
Janev to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Kristin Davidkhanian in the amount
of $1,370 within 30 days of the date of this order.
            The court orders plaintiff Kristin
Davidkhanian to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 11, 2024
