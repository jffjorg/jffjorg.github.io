And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ivan Mendoza v. Orange Trim, Inc. et al. The ruling is in response to Orange Trim, Inc.'s attempt to represent itself in the case without an attorney. The court has found that Orange Trim, Inc. is a corporation and, as such, is required to be represented by counsel in court. Despite this, Orange Trim, Inc. filed a Substitution of Attorney – Civil form stating it was substituting in to represent itself through one of its officers.

The court has ordered that Orange Trim, Inc.'s answer to the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint be stricken and that the company be represented by counsel. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to file a Request for Entry of Default against Orange Trim, Inc. and to prepare default judgment documents. The final status conference and trial have been vacated, and a new hearing has been set for February 21, 2025, to consider entry of default and default judgment.
