And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to appear for and testify at a deposition, as well as a request for monetary sanctions. The plaintiff, Kristin Davidkhanian, had previously noticed the defendant, Elena Janev, for a deposition on September 12, 2023, but Janev failed to appear. Despite attempts to reschedule the deposition, Janev did not appear. The judge finds that the plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling Janev to appear for and testify at deposition and grants the motion. The judge also awards monetary sanctions against Janev in the amount of $1,370, which is calculated based on the plaintiff's costs. The judge denies the plaintiff's request to strike Janev's answer. The ruling orders Janev to attend and testify at a deposition on a future date and to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
