BACKGROUND¿ 
 
This is a
wrongful foreclosure action in which Plaintiffs homeowners allege that
Defendants mortgage loan servicers misrepresented to Plaintiffs the true nature
of their ownership of the subject property, to collect mortgage payments from
Plaintiffs.
 
As of
1/7/03, Plaintiffs owned and resided at certain real property located at 680
Griswold Street, San Fernando CA 91340. (SSUF #1.) In 2005, Plaintiffs obtained
a mortgage refinancing loan, secured by a Deed of Trust dated 6/20/05, and
serviced by Defendants. (SSUF #2, 3.) In 2007, Plaintiffs obtained a second
mortgage, secured by a junior Deed of Trust, further encumbering the property.
(SSUF #4.)
 
On 1/7/09,
the junior lienholder foreclosed on the junior Deed of Trust and conveyed the
property to itself, while Plaintiffs remained in possession. (SSUF #8, 9.) In
2010, Plaintiffs applied for a loan modification with Defendants, which was
ultimately approved. (SSUF # 10–13.)
 
On 1/9/12,
Defendants recorded a Notice of Default on the mortgage loan and recorded a
Notice of Trustee’s Sale on 4/11/12. (SSUF #18.) The foreclosure was put on
hold after Plaintiffs filed a bankruptcy case. (SSUF #19.) On 8/13/15,
Defendants recorded a new Notice of Trustee’s Sale, and a Trustee’s Deed Upon
Sale was recorded reflecting the foreclosure sale. (SSUF #21, 22.)
 
On 1/7/16,
Plaintiffs filed the instant action. On 8/30/17, Plaintiffs filed the operative
fourth amended complaint (“4AC”), which alleges against Defendants the
following causes of action: (1) Unfair Debt Collection Practice; and (2) Unfair
Competition.
 
On 11/8/17,
the Court sustained Defendants’ demurrer against Plaintiffs’ 4AC and
Defendants’ motion to strike Plaintiffs’ second cause of action without leave
to amend. On 9/23/19, the ruling was partially reversed by the Court of Appeal,
who held that the 4AC alleged facts sufficient to support Plaintiffs’ first
cause of action, by alleging that Defendants misrepresented the nature of
Plaintiffs’ ownership to pressure Plaintiffs to continue paying on the loan. (Arrendondo
v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (Sept. 23, 2019, B288007) [nonpub.
opn.] at pp. 15–16.)
 
On 7/28/23,
Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment. On 9/15/23, Plaintiffs
filed their opposition. On 10/6/23, Moving Defendants filed their reply. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Legal Standard
 
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 65, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381–382.) 
 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant
moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519–1520.)  
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts
to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 163.) Courts “liberally
construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and
resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v.
Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) 
 
A.   
Rosenthal
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
 
Plaintiffs’ sole remaining cause of action against
Defendants alleges Unfair Debt Collection under the Rosenthal Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act (Civil Code section 1788 et seq.) (the “Rosenthal
Act”). The Rosenthal Act was enacted “to prohibit debt collectors from
engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the collection of consumer
debts and to require debtors to act fairly in entering into and honoring such
debts.” (Stats. 1977, ch. 907, § 1; Civ. Code § 1788.1, subd. (b).)
 
A
violation of the Rosenthal Act may be based on deceptive practices arising from
the collection of a debt associated with a mortgage. (Alborzian v. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 29, 37–38.) Section 1788.13 of the
Rosenthal Act incorporates section 1692e of the Federal Debt Collection Practices
Act, which provides, “a debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or
misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any
debt.” “Whether a debt collection effort entails false representations,
threats, or deception is judged objectively from the perspective of the ‘least
sophisticated debtor.’ … This unsavvy consumer is charged with a ‘basic level
of understanding and willingness to read with care’ … but is of ‘below average
sophistication or intelligence,’ and is ‘uninformed or naive.’ … He or she is
‘under no obligation to seek explanation of conflicting or misleading language
in debt collection letters.’” (Alborzian, 235 Cal.App.4th at 37
[internal citations omitted].)
 
Here,
Plaintiffs allege in their 4AC that they were advised by Defendants that they
could “save their home” by continuing to make payments to qualify for a loan
modification. (4AC ¶¶ 18, 20–21.) Defendants argue that “here, the Junior
Lienholder assumed ownership of the Property upon foreclosing, but DBNTC’s
first-position Loan and DOT remained intact. As borrowers who had contracted
for the Loan, Plaintiffs were still obligated to repay it; but, if they did not
do so, it was the Junior Lienholder that would lose ownership of the Property
at Carrington’s foreclosure sale – and that is precisely what happened.” (MSJ 13:9–13.)
Furthermore, Defendants assert that they “never said – in writing or in
discussions of any kind – that agreeing to loan modification would enable
Plaintiffs to ‘save’ their home.” (Id. at 14:17–19.)
 
Defendants
proffer a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale, recorded on 1/20/09, reflecting the junior
lienholder’s foreclosure sale of the property. (Ex. 6 to MSJ.) Defendants also
proffer Plaintiffs’ deposition transcripts, wherein Plaintiff Martin Arredondo
states that Defendants did not represent that they could help him save the
home. (Dep. of M. Arredondo, 80:2–8.)
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendants have met their initial burden
to establish a defense to Plaintiffs’ Unfair Debt Collection cause of action.
The burden therefore shifts to Plaintiffs to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists as to whether Defendants represented that Plaintiffs were
the true owners of the home and that their ownership could be “saved” by making
continued payments on their mortgage loan.
 
Plaintiffs
assert in opposition that “the Rosenthal act is violated by CMS’s statements
writings and conduct which deceived Lorena to believe that she owned 680
Griswold, and to make payments to protect her ownership, and work with CMS to
save the house.” (Pls.’ Opp. 3:26–28.)[1] “The
material issue is creating the false impression that Lorena owned 680 Griswold
to collect a debt. In this regard, the declaration testimony of Martin, Danny,
and Lorena at deposition would support an inference from the trier of fact that
Lorena could protect her ownership of 680 Griswold and that CMS would assist
the effort.” (Id. at 6:17–20.)
 
In
support of their arguments, Plaintiffs proffer a letter Defendants sent to
Plaintiffs, dated 2/9/10, offering a loan modification if Plaintiffs were found
eligible, and stating that “we will work with you to explore other options
available to help you keep your home.” (Ex. 110 to Pls.’ Opp.) Plaintiffs
proffer Plaintiff Lorena Arredondo’s sworn declaration, wherein she states that
she understood the “keep your home” language to mean that she could keep her
ownership of the subject property by making monthly payments to Defendants.
(Decl. of L. Arredondo ¶ 7.)
 
The
Court sustains Defendants’ evidentiary objection No. 3, against Paragraph 7 of
the Declaration of Lorena Arredondo, as it contradicts her prior sworn
deposition testimony stating that she cannot read English, and that her husband
was primarily responsible for communicating with Defendants. (Dep. of L.
Arredondo, 18:16–19:8.) A party's admissions or concessions made during
discovery govern and control over the party's contrary affidavits or
declarations filed in connection with the summary judgment motion. (D'Amico
v. Board of Med. Exam'rs (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 20–22.) When there is a clear
and unequivocal admission by the plaintiff in the plaintiff's deposition and
the plaintiff contradicts that admission in a subsequent declaration, a judge
is forced to conclude that there is no substantial evidence of the existence of
a triable issue of fact. (Turley v. Familian Corp. (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th
969, 981–983.) Therefore, here, the Court disregards Lorena’s statement
interpreting the language found in the 2/9/10 letter from Defendants. (Minish
v. Hanuman Fellowship (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 437, 459–460; Ex. 110 to Pls.’
Opp.)
 
Additionally,
the Court observes that Plaintiffs acknowledge the junior lienholder’s
foreclosure sale on the face of the 4AC, as noted in the Court’s original
rulings on previous demurrers, which constitutes “constructive notice of the
lack of any interest in the property, and therefore a lack of any basis for
fraud.” (4AC ¶ 16; 11/8/17 Min. Order, p. 4–5; 8/10/17 Min. Order, p. 4.) 
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their responsive
burden to show that a triable issue exists as to whether Defendants deceived
them into believing that they owned the subject property, to induce Plaintiffs
into making payments for a loan modification. Accordingly, the motion is
granted on this ground.
 
B.    
Statute of
Limitations
 
Defendants
further assert that Plaintiffs’ Unfair Debt Collection cause of action is
time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The statute of
limitations for actions brought under the Rosenthal Act is one year from the
date of the occurrence of the violation. (Civ. Code § 1788.30, subd. (f).)
 
Here,
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claim is time-barred because “Plaintiffs
allege the conduct giving rise to their claim occurred in either June of 2010
(when Carrington sent its correspondence with the ‘Helping you stay in your
home’ tag line) or in November 2010, when the permanent loan modification was
implemented. Yet, they did not file their lawsuit until January 7, 2016 – more
than six years after the latest of the dates on which allegedly offending
conduct occurred.” (MSJ 17:7–11.)
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendants have satisfied their initial
burden to establish a complete defense to Plaintiffs’ cause of action. The
burden thus shifts to Plaintiffs to show that a triable issue of material fact
exists as to whether their claim is time-barred.
 
In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the statute of limitations is extended by
Defendants’ continuing course of conduct.” Under the continuing violation
doctrine, a plaintiff may recover for unlawful acts occurring outside the
limitations period if they continued into that period. … The continuing
violation doctrine requires proof that (1) the defendant's actions inside and
outside the limitations period are sufficiently similar in kind; (2) those
actions occurred with sufficient frequency; and (3) those actions have not
acquired a degree of permanence.” (Wassmann v. South Orange County Community
College District (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 825, 850–851.)
 
Here,
Plaintiffs assert that Defendants “repeatedly treated Lorena as owner of 680
Griswold, and repeatedly demanded payments while ‘working with Lorena to help
her keep her home (Ex 110). CMS’ conduct constitutes a continuing pattern and
course of conduct and is not composed of unrelated discrete acts.” (Pls.’ Opp.
7:20–22.)
 
As
outlined above, and as Defendants observe, “Plaintiffs do not allege that
Carrington told them on a continuing basis that they could save their home, nor
is there evidence of such conduct.” (Defs.’ Reply 5:15–16.) Exhibit 110 to
Plaintiffs’ opposition is the 2/9/10 letter from Defendants to Lorena regarding
her potential eligibility for a loan modification, and Plaintiffs do not point
to any supplementary evidence that Defendants repeated any representations
about Plaintiffs’ ownership in the home, let alone that those representations
were made within the limitations period. 
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their responsive
burden to show that a triable issue exists as to whether Plaintiffs’ cause of
action for Unfair Debt Collection is time-barred under the applicable statute
of limitations. Accordingly, the motion is granted on this ground.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. Defendants are entitled to summary
judgment.
