PETITIONER’S REQUESTS
Petitioner
Mayra Mancillas (“Petitioner”) asks the Court to approve the compromise of the
claims of Claimants Valerie Lopez and Jose Perez 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Valerie Lopez petition 
Section
12a of the petition states that total medical expenses are $6,934.50 and
negotiated, statutory, and contractual reductions come to $1,330.00.  Based on these figures, $5,604.50 in medical
expenses should be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, section 12a(4) states that only $1,170.22
will be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
The discrepancy
appears to exist because Section 12a(3) of the petition does not reflect all of
the negotiated, contractual, and statutory reductions of the medical expenses.  Section 12b(4) of the petition shows that
Medi-Cal paid $4,804.50 of the medical expenses but is asking for reimbursement
of only $370.22.  The difference between
these two figures -- $4,434.28 -- is a reduction in
the amount of medical expenses.  
Section
12b(5) reflects a separate reduction.  According
to the petition, medical service providers with $2,130 in liens have agreed to
accept $800, resulting in a reduction of $1,330. 
Adding
these two reduction amounts ($4,434.28 and $1,330) together results in $5,764.28
in reductions (rather than $1,330.00 as the petition currently states).  With this figure for reductions, the
reimbursement figure of $1,170.22 is appropriate because the reductions plus the
reimbursement from the settlement proceeds ensure that the settlement reimburses all medical expenses that have not been reduced or waived. 
The
Court continues the hearing and orders Petitioner to submit a corrected
petition. 
B.   Jose Perez petition 
Section
12a of the petition states that total medical expenses are $3,790.02 and
negotiated, statutory, and contractual reductions come to $500.00.  Based on these figures, $3,290.02 in medical
expenses should be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, section 12a(4) states that only $419.21
will be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
As
with Valerie Lopez’s petition, the discrepancy appears to exist because Section
12a(3) of the petition does not reflect all of the negotiated, contractual, and
statutory reductions of the medical expenses. 
Section 12b(4) of the petition shows that Medi-Cal paid $2,885.02 of the
medical expenses but is asking for reimbursement of only $19.21.  The difference between these two figures -- $2,865.81
-- is a reduction in the amount of medical expenses.  
Section
12b(5) reflects a separate reduction. 
According to the petition, medical service providers with $905 in liens
have agreed to accept $400, resulting in a reduction of $505. 
Adding
these two reduction amounts ($2,865.81 and $505) together results in $3,378.81
in reductions (rather than $500 as the petition currently states).  With this figure for reductions, the
reimbursement figure of $419.21 is appropriate because the reductions plus the
reimbursement from the settlement proceeds ensure that the settlement reimburses all medical expenses that have not been reduced or
waived. 
The
Court continues the hearing and orders Petitioner to submit a corrected
petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES the hearing on the petition to approve the compromise of the pending
action of minor Valerie Lopez to November 7, 2023 at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28
of the Spring Street Courthouse.
