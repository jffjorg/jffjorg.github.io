The judge rules in favor of Plaintiff's counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted because Counsel has filed all necessary forms and has served the application and supporting papers on the client and Defendant's counsel. The judge finds that there has been a complete breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and that Counsel should be relieved of their duties. The motion is granted, and Counsel will be relieved upon filing proof of service on the client of the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.
