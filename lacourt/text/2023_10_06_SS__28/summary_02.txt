And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority has filed a motion for a protective order and seeks to strike language in Plaintiff Gilberto Avendano's expert witness designation that refers to "all various treating physicians and healthcare providers." Defendant argues that this language violates Code of Civil Procedure sections 2034.210 and 2034.260, subdivision (b)(1), because it does not provide the name and address of the unnamed physicians and healthcare providers.

The Court grants the motion. The Court strikes the phrase "all various treating physicians and healthcare providers . . . including but not limited to" from Plaintiff's expert witness designation and grants Plaintiff five court days to file an amended Designation of Experts omitting the stricken language.
