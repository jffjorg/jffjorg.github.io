BACKGROUND 
On
September 23, 2020, Plaintiff Gilberto Avendano (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendant Los Angeles County MTA and Does 1-25 for
general negligence and premises liability. 
On
November 12, 2020, Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“Defendant”) filed an answer. 
On
June 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint. 
On
July 31, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for a protective order.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
Trial
is scheduled for March 13, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS Defendant asks the Court to issue a protective order and strike language in Plaintiff's expert witness designation purporting to designate unnamed treating physicians and healthcare providers. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.210, subdivision
(a) provides: 
“After the setting of the initial trial date for the
action, any party may obtain discovery by demanding that all parties
simultaneously exchange information concerning each other’s expert trial
witnesses to the following extent: 
“(a) Any party may demand a mutual and simultaneous
exchange by all parties of a list containing the name and address of any
natural person, including one who is a party, whose oral or deposition
testimony in the form of an expert opinion any party expects to offer in
evidence at the trial.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.210,
subd. (a).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2034.260 provides in part:  
“(a) All parties who have appeared in the action shall
exchange information concerning expert witnesses in writing on or before the
date of exchange specified in the demand. The exchange of information may occur
at a meeting of the attorneys for the parties involved or by serving the
information on the other party by any method specified in Section 1011 or 1013,
on or before the date of exchange. 
“(b) The exchange of expert witness information shall
include either of the following: 
“(1) A list setting forth the name and address of a
person whose expert opinion that party expects to offer in evidence at the
trial. 
“(2) A statement that the party does not presently
intend to offer the testimony of an expert witness.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2034.260, subds. (a), (b).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2034.250 provides in part: 
“(a) A party who has been served with a demand to
exchange information concerning expert trial witnesses may promptly move for a
protective order. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(b) The court, for good cause shown, may make any
order that justice requires to protect any party from unwarranted annoyance,
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden and expense. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.250,
subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Defendant
asks the Court to issue a protective order striking language in Plaintiff’s
July 25, 2023, expert witness designation that refers to “all various treating
physicians and healthcare providers . . . including but not limited to” seven named
individuals.  Defendant argues the quoted
language violates Code of Civil Procedure sections 2034.210 and 2034.260, subdivision
(b)(1), because it does not provide the name and address of the unnamed
physicians and healthcare providers. 
The
Court grants the motion.  (See Kalaba v. Gray
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1416, 1418 [“the transformation from treating physician
to expert does not occur unless the treating physician is identified by name
and address in the proponent's designation, and it is not enough that a
plaintiff has ‘designated’ as experts ‘all past or present examining and/or
treating physicians’ ”].) 
CONCLUSION 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s
motion for a protective order.  The Court
strikes the phrase “all various treating physicians and healthcare providers .
. . including but not limited to” from Plaintiff Gilberto Avendano’s July 25, 2023 Designation of Expert Witness and
grants Plaintiff five court days to file an amended Designation of Experts omitting
the stricken language. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
