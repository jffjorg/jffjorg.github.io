And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the petitions to approve the compromise of the claims of minor Plaintiffs Valerie Lopez and Jose Perez. The petitions show that there is a discrepancy in the reimbursement figures for medical expenses, which the court believes is due to incomplete information. The court orders the petitioner to submit a corrected petition to clarify the reduction figures. The court also continues the hearing to November 7, 2023, and orders the petitioner to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service with the court within five days.
