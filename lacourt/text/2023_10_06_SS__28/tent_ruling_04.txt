        Having considered the moving,
  opposing, and reply papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
 On October 28, 2022,
  Plaintiff Tsunami Glover (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Nayeli
  Corado, Anderson Cardona, and Does 1-30 for motor vehicle and general negligence.  
 On February 14, 2023, Defendants
  Anderson Cardona and Leidy Nayeli Corado filed an answer. 
 On September 8, 2023, Plaintiff
  filed a motion to compel Defendant Leidy Nayeli Corado’s responses to Plaintiff’s request for production of
  documents, special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for
  admission, and for sanctions. On September 25, 2023, Defendant Leidy Nayeli
  Corado (“Defendant”) filed an opposition. 
  On September 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
 Trial is currently
  scheduled for April 26, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
          Plaintiff asks the Court to compel Defendant’s responses
  to Plaintiff’s first set of discovery requests, deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, and impose sanctions.  Defendant asks the Court to
  deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
 “If a party to whom a demand for inspection,
  copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to
  it, the following rules shall apply: 
 “(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
  copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
  Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may
  relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
  following conditions are satisfied: 
 “(1) The party has subsequently served a response
  that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
  2031.240, and 2031.280. 
 “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 “(b) The party making the demand may move for an
  order compelling response to the demand. 
 “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the
  court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
  Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
  makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
  copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
  make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the
  order compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just,
  including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
  terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
  lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary
  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
 “(d)
  (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional circumstances, the
  court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for
  failure to provide electronically stored information that has been lost,
  damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good faith
  operation of an electronic information system. 
 “(2)
  This subdivision shall not be construed to alter any obligation to preserve
  discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2031.300.) 
      B.   Interrogatories 
 “If
  a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
  response, the following rules apply: 
 “(a)
  The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to
  exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as
  any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on
  the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
  2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on
  its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
 “(1)
  The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
  compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. 
 “(2)
  The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
  inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 “(b)
  The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
  response to the interrogatories. 
 “(c)
  The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
  Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
  makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it
  finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
  unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court
  may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
  sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
  (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
  (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2030.290.) 
 C.      Requests for admissions 
 “If a party to whom requests for admission are
  directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
 “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission
  are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
  privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
  with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from
  this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
  satisfied: 
 “(1) The party has subsequently served a response
  that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
  2033.230. 
 “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 “(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
  the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
  the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under
  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
 “(c) The court shall make this order, unless it
  finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
  has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
  requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
  2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under
  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
  both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
  necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2033.280.) 
          D.   Discovery
  sanctions 
          “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that
  one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising
  that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
  incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may also impose
  this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the
  misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that
  assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
  of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
 “Misuses of the discovery
  process include, but are not limited to . . . 
 *
  * *
 “(d) Failing to respond or
  to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2023.010, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION

A.  
Plaintiff’s
motion 
On May 24, 2023, Plaintiff served a request for
production of documents, special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and
requests for admission on Plaintiff. 
Responses were due June 26, 2023. 
On June 29, 2023, counsel for Plaintiff and Defendant met and conferred
about the overdue responses.  Plaintiff’s
counsel agreed to a two-week extension, to July 14, 2023, conditioned on
Defendant’s waiver of objections.  On
July 14, Plaintiff’s counsel granted another two-week extension to July 28, 2023.  Defendant had not provided responses by the
time Plaintiff filed the motion to compel on September 8, 2023. 
Plaintiff asks the Court to compel Defendant to provide
verified, code-compliant responses, without objections, to the request for
production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories, and
to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission. 
B.   Defendant’s opposition 
Defendant argues the discovery issues are moot because
she served responses to the discovery two weeks after Plaintiff filed the
motion to compel.  Defendant has attached
copies of the discovery responses to her opposition to the motion.  The responses include objections. 
C.   Plaintiff’s reply 
Plaintiff argues the matter is not moot because
Defendant’s untimely discovery responses were deficient and included objections. 
D.   Analysis 
1.    Request for production of documents 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, when
Defendant failed to serve a timely response to Plaintiff’s request for production
of documents, Defendant “waive[d] any objection to the demand, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  Defendant has not filed a motion for relief from
the waiver.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
 Plaintiff moved for “an order compelling response to
the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).)  Because Defendant's responses include objections, the Court has authority to grant Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses.  (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 405 [construing Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b) (interrogatories),
which contains language analogous to Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b) (demand
for inspection)].) 
 The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses
to the request for production of documents and orders Defendant to provide
verified, code-compliant responses and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by November
6, 2023.  The Court grants Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions as discussed below. 
2.    Interrogatories 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, when
Defendant failed to serve a timely response to Plaintiff’s special and form
interrogatories, Defendant “waive[d] any right to exercise the option to
produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) Defendant
has not filed a motion for relief from the waiver.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff moved for “an order compelling response to
the interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  Because Defendant's responses include objections, the Court has authority to grant Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses.  (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 405.) 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel
responses to the form and special interrogatories and orders Defendant to provide
verified, code-compliant responses and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by
November 6, 2023.  The Court grants Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions as discussed below. 
3.    Requests for admission 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, when
Defendant failed to serve a timely response to Plaintiff’s requests for
admission, Defendant “waive[d] any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(a).)  Defendant has not filed a motion
for relief from the waiver.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff has moved “for an order that the genuineness
of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be
deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) 
“The court shall make this order, unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
In his reply, Plaintiff does not identify any deficiencies in the late-filed responses to requests for admissions.  Plaintiff argues generally that that
the discovery responses are “deficient” and include “countless boiler-plate
objections.”  Plaintiff also asserts that
Defendant “failed to provide substantive responses to many of the
interrogatories served by Plaintiff.”  The responses to the requests for admission do not include any objections.  
The responses to requests for
admission substantially comply with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.220.  Therefore,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to deem admitted the matters specified in
the requests for admission.  The Court
grants Plaintiff’s request for sanctions, however, as discussed below.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
E.   Sanctions and additional filing fees 
Plaintiff was required to file a separate motion for
each type of discovery at issue. 
Therefore, the Court orders Plaintiff to pay $180 in additional filing
fees to the Court. 
Plaintiff requests $2,560.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time to prepare the moving papers, one hour to prepare
a reply, and one hour to attend the hearing, at counsel’s hourly rate of $500
per hour, plus one $60 filing fee. 
The Court grants Plaintiff $990 in sanctions based on
3 hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250 per hour and 4 filing
fees. 
CONCLUSION 
 The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Tsunami Glover’s motion to compel Defendant Leidy Nayeli
Corado’s responses to Plaintiff’s request for production of documents, set
one.  The Court orders Defendant to
provide verified code-compliant responses and to produce the documents,
electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without
objections by November 6, 2023. 
  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Tsunami Glover’s motion to
compel Defendant Leidy Nayeli Corado’s responses to Plaintiff’s special
interrogatories, set one.  The Court
orders Defendant to provide verified code-compliant responses without
objections by November 6, 2023. 
 The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Tsunami Glover’s motion to

 The Court DENIES Plaintiff Tsunami Glover’s motion to deem
admitted the matters specified in Plaintiff’s requests for admission, set one,
