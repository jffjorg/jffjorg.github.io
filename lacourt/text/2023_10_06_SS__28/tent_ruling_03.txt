 Case Number:  22STCV08569    Hearing Date:   October 6, 2023    Dept:  28 


Having considered the moving papers, the Court rules
  as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On March 9, 2022, Plaintiff Roxana Contreras
  (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Villalobos Market, Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50 for negligence and premises liability. 
On November 8, 2022, Defendant filed an answer. 
On August 21, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel Nare
  Kupelian filed and served a motion to be relieved as counsel. 
Trial is set for January 4, 2024. 
COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s counsel asks to be relieved as counsel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed
  to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
  form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising
  the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under
  Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent
  under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in
  Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
  service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order
  on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4)
  the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting
  Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to
  withdraw.  The motion should be granted
  if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
  of justice. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION 
Counsel has filed completed MC-051, MC-052,
  and MC-053 forms.  Counsel submitted a
  declaration stating “there has been a complete breakdown of the Attorney-Client
  relationship.”  Counsel served the application
  and supporting papers on Defendant’s counsel and on Plaintiff at her last known
  address, which counsel confirmed by phone within the last 30 days. 
The Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s counsel's motion to be
  relieved as counsel.  Counsel will be
  relieved upon filing proof of service on the client of the Order Granting
  Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (Judicial Council form
  MC-053). 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Counsel is ordered to file the proof of service of
  this ruling with the Court within five days.
