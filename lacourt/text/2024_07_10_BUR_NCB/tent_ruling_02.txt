[1] Defendant cites
to various cases regarding partial performance of unexecuted agreements or oral
agreements to argue that it has sufficiently raised a triable issue of material
fact.  However, the cases cited are
factually distinguishable.  For example, Schubert
v. Lowe (1924) 193 Cal. 291 involved an oral agreement
whereby the plaintiff agreed to execute a written lease.  Unlike this case, Schubert did not
involve an underlying written and executed agreement that required all
subsequent amendments and modifications to be in writing.  


[2] Section 30.8,
entitled “Entire Agreement; Merger; Severability” states that no provision of
the Lease may be modified, waived or discharged except by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which enforcement of such modification,
waiver or discharge is sought.
