And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant is arguing that they have raised a triable issue of material fact regarding partial performance of an unexecuted agreement or oral agreement. However, the judge finds that the cases cited by the defendant are factually distinguishable, including Schubert v. Lowe, which involved an oral agreement to execute a written lease, but did not involve an underlying written and executed agreement that required all subsequent amendments and modifications to be in writing. The judge also notes that Section 30.8 of an unknown statute states that no provision of the lease can be modified, waived, or discharged except by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of such modification, waiver, or discharge is sought.
