BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiff 330 North Brand, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
filed an unlawful detainer complaint against Defendant JohnHart Corp. (“Defendant”).  The property at issue is located at 330 North
Brand Blvd., Suite 130, Glendale, CA 91203. 
Plaintiff is the owner of the premises. 

On December 19, 2011, Plaintiff as
landlord and Defendant as tenant entered into a written Office Lease (as
amended by a First Amendment to Office Lease dated January
3, 2017, a Second Amendment to Office Lease dated May 31, 2017, a Third
Amendment to Office Lease dated February 15, 2018, and a Fourth Amendment to
Office Lease dated August 18, 2020; hereinafter, “Lease”) whereby Defendant
leased the premises.  Plaintiff alleges
that additional space within the building containing the premises was also
leased by Defendant under the Lease, but possession of such space has been
resolved and is not at issue in this matter. Plaintiff alleges that the Lease
expired on December 31, 2020 and that all times thereafter, Defendant remained
in possession pursuant to Article 15 of the Lease (the holdover provision),
except that the parties agreed that Defendant would not pay 200% of the rent as
(a) the time period was in the midst of Covid and (b) the parties were
attempting to negotiate an extension of the Lease.
Plaintiff
alleges that the Lease expired on December 31, 2020 and the Lease became a
month-to-month holdover tenancy. 
Plaintiff alleges that on October 8, 2023, Plaintiff served a 30-Day
Notice To Terminate Tenancy (the “Notice”) on Defendant in accordance with the
provisions of the Lease by forwarding same according to the notice provisions
of the Lease to Defendant at the Premises via FedEx. FedEx confirmed delivery
as of October 11, 2023. Plaintiff alleges that the Notice required Defendant to
quit the premises within 30 days after service of the Notice and also set forth
Plaintiff's election to declare a forfeiture of the Lease.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is still in
possession of the premises despite more than 30 days passing since service of
the Notice (the expiration of the 30-day period was November 10, 2023).
On May 23, 2024, the default of all
unnamed occupants in possession was entered. 

B.    
Motion on Calendar 
On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a motion for summary judgment in its favor against Defendant in this case
for possession of the premises and for damages in the amount of $61,090.70 (190
days at $321.53 per day for each day that Defendant remains at the premises
from January 12, 2024 until judgment). 
Alternatively, Plaintiff seeks summary adjudication on the following
issue:
·        
Issue 1: The undisputed facts demonstrate
that Plaintiff is entitled to an order summarily adjudicating the cause of
action for unlawful detainer and granting possession of the premises because Defendant’s
occupancy of the premises has been month-to-month for years.  Plaintiff has served a 30-day notice to
terminate the lease and Defendant failed to vacate the property.  
On July 3, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition brief. 
The Court held a hearing on the matter on
July 5, 2024.  The Court was informed
that an opposition was filed and continued the hearing to July 10, 2024 in
order to give Plaintiff an opportunity to file a reply brief by July 8,
2024.  
On July 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply
brief. 
DISCUSSION 
CCP § 1161 defines
“unlawful detainer” in relevant part as follows: 
1. When the tenant continues in possession, in
person or by subtenant, of the property, or any part thereof, after the expiration of the term for which it is
let to the tenant; provided the expiration is of a nondefault nature
however brought about without the permission of the
landlord, or the successor in estate of the
landlord, if applicable; including the case where the person to be removed
became the occupant of the premises as a servant, employee, agent, or licensee
and the relation of master and servant, or employer and employee, or principal
and agent, or licensor and licensee, has been lawfully terminated or the time
fixed for occupancy by the agreement between the parties has expired; but
nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as preventing the removal of the
occupant in any other lawful manner; but in case of a tenancy at will, it shall first be terminated by notice, as
prescribed in the Civil Code.
(CCP
§ 1161(1).)  
Plaintiff moves
for summary judgment in its favor against Defendant. 
In support of
its motion, Plaintiff provides the declaration of Spencer Wilson, the Vice
President of Transwestern, the agent and property manager for Plaintiff.  (Wilson Decl., ¶1.)  Mr. Wilson states that on December 19, 2011,
Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written Office Lease for the premises,
which was subsequently amended 4 times (“Lease”).  (Id., ¶3, Ex. A [Lease].)  He states that all relevant times, Plaintiff
has owned the premises.  (Id.,
¶4.)  He states that Defendant has been
month-to-month since the Lease term expired on December 31, 2020 as shown in
paragraph 4 of the last amendment to the Lease. 
(Id., ¶5.)  He states that
because the parties were unable to agree upon the terms of a new lease or for
an extension of the Lease, Plaintiff sought to take back the space after entering
into a new lease for the premises with a new tenant and that new lease provides
for a rental amount of $9,796.00 per month.  (Id., ¶6.)  Mr. Wilson states that after letters were
sent back and forth with Defendant concerning the need for the return of the premises,
it became clear that Defendant was not going to vacate as requested.  (Id., ¶7.)  He states that on December 8, 2023, he served
a 30-Day Notice to Terminate Tenancy (“Notice”) on Defendant in accordance with
the provisions of the Lease by forwarding the same according to the notice
provision of the Lease to Defendant at the premises via FedEx (delivery
confirmed as of December 11, 2023).  (Id.)  He states that the Notice required Defendant
to quit the premises within 30 days after
service of the Notice.  (Id., Ex.
B [Notice with FedEx confirmation].)  Mr.
Wilson states that the action was not filed sooner than April 2024 because
Plaintiff was trying to find a different space for the new tenant so that
Defendant could possibly remain in the premises if the parties could reach an
agreement on the terms; however, that did not happen.  (Id., ¶8.)  He states that while the parties have been
negotiating an extension, they never reached an agreement on terms, there is no
writing signed by the parties extending the Lease and no new lease between the
parties for the premises.  (Id.,
¶10.)  He states that “Defendant has
simply claimed to have some sort of agreement without any approval from Plaintiff.”  (Id.) 

Mr. Wilson
states that Defendant is still in possession of the premises despite more than
30 days passing since service of the Notice and Plaintiff has not accepted any
rent for the premises since the Notice was served.  (Id., ¶9.)  Mr. Wilson states that the rent called for in the
new lease ($9,796.00 per month) is the reasonable rental value of the premises,
as that is the most recent arms-length transaction for this exact space and
based upon that monthly rent, the daily value of the premises is $322.06
(calculated by taking the monthly rent of $9,796.00 and multiplying it by 12
months and then dividing that by 365 days). 
(Id.)  Mr. Wilson states,
however, because Plaintiff asked for $321.53 in the complaint, Plaintiff will
use that lower amount.  (Id.)  
Here, Plaintiff has established its burden
establishing that Defendant has continued in possession of the premises after
the Lease expired.  Paragraph 4 of the
Fourth Amendment of the Lease states that the term respecting Suite 130 shall
expire on December 31, 2020.  After the
tenancy became a holdover month-to-month tenancy, Plaintiff served the Notice
on December 8, 2023 (confirmed delivery by FedEx on December 11, 2023).  However, as stated by Mr. Wilson in his
declaration, Defendant did not vacate the premises within 30 days and the
parties were unable to agree upon a Lease extension or a new lease.  Thus, Plaintiff has established the elements
of an unlawful detainer claim for the real property at issue.  
As such, the burden shifts to Defendant to
raise a triable issue of material fact.  Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not
entitled to summary judgment solely because the Lease expired.  Defendant argues that it has partially
performed the terms of a fully negotiated and agreed-to Fifth Amendment.  (Schubert v. Lowe (1924) 193 Cal. 291, 295 [“While the defendant was not entitled to a
judgment in the present proceedings decreeing specific performance of the
agreement to execute the lease, nevertheless the part performance of such an
agreement can be interposed as an equitable defense to the plaintiff's attempt
to wrest from him the possession of the premises by the summary proceedings in
unlawful detainer.”]; Pearsall v. Henry (1908) 153 Cal.
314, 318 [“The question whether there has been a part performance of the oral
agreement is necessarily one of fact to be determined by the trial court.”].)[1]
In support of the
opposition, Defendant provides the declaration of Harout Keuroghlian, the owner of
Defendant, and a copy of the unexecuted Fifth Amendment.  Mr. Keuroghlian states that as of September
2021, Defendant was responsible for leasing: (a) Suite 130 (lease expired
December 31, 2020), which was approximately 2,930 square feet; (b) Suite 660
(lease expired January 31, 2022), which was approximately 1,662 square feet;
and (c) Suite 701 (lease to expire on August 31, 2023), which was approximately
2,241 square feet.  (Keuroghlian Decl.,
¶5.)  He states that in September 2021,
Anneke Greco, the Executive Vice President of Jones Lang LaSalle, the
authorized agent of Plaintiff, proposed that Defendant surrender Suites 660 and
701 early as a part of negotiations for an extension of Suite 130.  (Id., ¶6.)  He states that in reliance on the terms being
negotiated, Defendant voluntarily and prematurely surrendered possession of the
Giveback Premises (Suites 660 and 701, set to expire 4 months and 2 years
later, respectively) and Defendant ceased paying rent for those spaces.  (Id., ¶7.)  Mr. Keuroghlian states that on March 22,
2022, Ms. Greco sent Defendant a proposed Fifth Amendment to the Lease back
dated to January 2022, honoring most of the mutually agreeable terms during the
previous Suite 130 negotiations.  (Id.,
¶8.)  On October 24, 2022, Ms. Greco sent
a revised Fifth Amendment, which contained all of the terms needed for the
Lease but had one mistake; Mr. Keuroghlian stated that he informed Ms. Greco
that he was willing to execute the extension. 
(Id., ¶9, Ex. 1 [Fifth Amendment].)  He states that in November and December 2022,
Defendant continuously attempted to contact Plaintiff to finalize execution of
the new Lease for Suite 130 and that Ms. Greco responded on December 21, 2022,
stating that she needed an accounting reconciliation.  (Id., ¶¶10-11.)  He states that he attempted to contact
Plaintiff until July 2023 and continued to pay monthly base rent which
Plaintiff routinely accepted, believing that he was performing under the Fifth
Amendment.  (Id., ¶11.)  Mr. Keuroghlian states that on July 21, 2023
(nearly a year later), Ms. Greco’s associate responded to Defendant’s July 28,
2022 correspondence regarding reconciliations. 
(Id., ¶12.)  On July 25,
2023, Defendant sent correspondent to Ms. Greco requesting an update on the
Lease execution.  (Id., ¶13.)  He states that Ms. Greco responded on July
26, 2023, stating that Plaintiff leased Suite 130 to another tenant who agreed
to a longer-term period.  (Id.,
¶14.)  On September 12, 2023, Defendant
received a Notice of Termination; on November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
complaint; and on December 14, 2023, Plaintiff issued the December 8, 2023
Notice.  (Id., ¶¶15-17.)  
While Defendant argues that Plaintiff is
not entitled to summary judgment because Defendant partially performed under
the Fifth Amendment by surrendering the Give Back Space and paying rent,
Defendant has failed to present evidence in support of its burden in
opposition.  At most, Defendant provides
Mr. Keuroghlian’s declaration and the unsigned Fifth Amendment, but Defendant
fails to provide any documentary evidence of the parties’ communications
(emails, letters, etc.) and fails to state what amount of rent was paid—whether
it was the rent under the last lease amendment or the Fifth Amendment—or
provide documentary evidence through canceled checks or bank statements of the
rental amounts paid.  It is Defendant’s
shifted burden to provide opposing evidence of a triable issue of material fact
and Defendant has failed to do so here.  
In addition, as pointed out by Plaintiff
in the reply brief, Defendant cannot rely on an oral modification, as the Lease
at section 30.8 states that the terms cannot be modified orally.  (Conley v. Matthes (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1453, 1465 [“Oral modifications of written agreements are
precluded only if the written agreement provides for written modification.”]; Mot., Ex. A
[December 19, 2011 Office Lease at § 30.8].)[2]  Plaintiff preemptively raised this in the
motion papers on page 5 and again raised this in the reply brief, but Defendant
did not address the integrated nature of the Lease (and its subsequent
amendments) in the opposition brief.  The
cases cited by Defendant also fail to include a factually similar situation as
this case.  
As such, the Court finds that Defendant
has not raised a triable issue of material fact in its shifted burden on this
motion for summary judgment.  As such, Plaintiff’s
motion for summary judgment is granted.  
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER  
            Plaintiff
330 North Brand, Inc.’s motion for summary judgment is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to lodge with the Court
and serve on Defendant a proposed judgment within ten (10) days and to provide
notice of this order.
            Plaintiff
shall provide notice of this order.
