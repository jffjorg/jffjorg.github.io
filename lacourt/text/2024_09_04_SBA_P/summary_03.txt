Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motions to quash service of summons, finding that the plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proof to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendants. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to file a Proof of Service of Summons, which is required to establish service of summons. As a result, the court has no jurisdiction over the defendants and the demurrer to the complaint is moot. The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
