BACKGROUND
On
6/12/2024, plaintiff Rocco A. Mondello, individually and as trustee of The 2002
Mondello Family Trust (“Plaintiff”) commenced this action by filing an Unlawful
Detainer Complaint against defendants Caroline Londergan (“Londergan”), Karmic
Energy, Inc. (“Karmic Energy”), and Does 1 to 20. 
 
On
6/26/2024, Londergan and Karmic Energy (collectively, “Defendants”) each filed
a motion to quash service of summons. 
 
On
7/29/2024, Defendants filed a demurrer to the Complaint. 
 
On
8/26/2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the demurrer. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            Defendants have filed
motions to quash service of summons as well as a demurrer. 
 
“It has long been the rule in California that ‘a
party waives any objection to the court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction
when the party makes a general appearance in the action.’  [Citations.]”  Air Machine Com SRL v. Superior Court
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 414, 419 (“Air Machine”); Code Civ. Proc., §
410.50, subd. (a) (“A general appearance by a party is equivalent to personal
service of summons on such party”).
 
A defendant makes a general appearance in an action
when the defendant files a demurrer.  Code
Civ. Proc., § 1014 (“A defendant appears in an action when the defendant
answers, demurs, files a notice of motion to strike, files a notice of motion
to transfer pursuant to Section 396b, moves for reclassification pursuant to
Section 403.040, gives the plaintiff written notice of appearance, or when an
attorney gives notice of appearance for the defendant”). 
 
However, “[a] defendant or cross-defendant may make
a motion [to quash service of summons] and simultaneously answer, demur, or
move to strike the complaint or cross-complaint.”  Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (e).
 
If a party files a motion to quash service of
summons “before or simultaneously with an act that would otherwise constitute a
general appearance, under subdivision (e) of section 418.10 [above] that party
will not be deemed to have ‘generally appeared’ in the action, but instead will
be deemed to have ‘specially appeared’ and not waived the party’s
jurisdictional challenge.”  Air
Machine, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th at p. 426.
 
A.   
Standard for the Motions to Quash Service
of Summons
 
“A motion to quash service is the proper method for
determining whether the court has acquired personal jurisdiction over the
defendant through service of the five-day unlawful detainer summons.”  Delta Imports, Inc v. Municipal Court
(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1035 (“Delta Imports”).  “If the municipal court erroneously refuses
to quash service, the defendant is entitled to a writ of mandate from the
superior court.  Ibid.; Code Civ.
Proc., § 418.10, subd. (c).  
 
B.    
Demurrer Standard
 
“The
rules by which the sufficiency of a complaint is tested against a general
demurrer are well settled. We not only treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but also give the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.”  Guclimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty
Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38 (internal quotes omitted).  For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, the
complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the
facts pleaded.  Wilner v. Sunset Life
Ins. Co. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 952, 958.
 
            A demurrer is properly sustained
only when the complaint, liberally construed, fails to state facts sufficient
to constitute any cause of action.  Kramer
v. Intuit Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574, 578; Delta Imports, supra,
146 Cal.App.3d at p. 1036 (“A motion to quash service is the only method by
which the defendant can test whether the complaint states a cause of action for
unlawful detainer and, thereby, supports a five-day summons.  A general demurrer only tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action for something even if it is on a theory
other than unlawful detainer” [italics removed]). 
 
            Meet and confer is not required
before filing of a demurrer.  Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (d)(2).  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Londergan, an
individual, and Karmic Energy, a corporation, move to quash service of summons.

 
            As
an initial matter, the court finds the motions to quash timely because they
were filed within five (5) days of the alleged service on June 21, 2024.  Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1) (“A defendant, on or before the last day of
his or her time to plead … may serve and file a notice of motion …  ¶ (1) To quash service of summons on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her”);   Butenschoen
v. Flaker (2017) 16
Cal.App.5th Supp. 10, 14 (“Butenschoen“) (““The summons in an unlawful
detainer complaint calls for a response in five days (Code Civ. Proc., § 1167),
as opposed to the usual 30 days provided for in other civil cases (Code Civ.
Proc., § 412.20)”). 
 
Service may be
effectuated on an individual through personal service.  Code Civ. Proc. § 415.10 (“A summons may be
served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to
the person to be served. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete
at the time of such delivery.  ¶ The date upon which
personal delivery is made shall be entered on or affixed to the face of the
copy of the summons at the time of its delivery.  However, service of a summons without such
date shall be valid and effective”).   
 
Service may also be
effectuated on an individual through substituted service.  Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20, subd. (b).  
 
“A summons may be served on a
corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and the complaint by any of the
following methods:
 
(a)     
To
the person designated as agent for service of process as provided by any
provision in Section 202, 1502, 2105, or 2107 of the Corporations Code (or
Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the
Corporations Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to
corporations to which they remain applicable).
(b)     
To
the president, chief executive officer, or other head of the corporation, a
vice president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant
treasurer, a controller or chief financial officer, a general manager, or a
person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process.
(c)     
If
the corporation is a bank, to a cashier or assistant cashier or to a person
specified in subdivision (a) or (b).
(d)     
If
authorized by any provision in Section 1701, 1702, 2110, or 2111 of the
Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to
6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976,
with respect to corporations to which they remain applicable), as provided by
that provision.
 
Code Civ.
Proc., § 416.10; Corp. Code, §§ 1701 (delivery
to agent or corporate agent), 1702 (service upon secretary of state pursuant to
a court order), 2110 (concerning foreign defendants), or 2111 (service upon
secretary of state pursuant to a court order if the agent cannot be found).
 
“It
is axiomatic that strict compliance with the code’s provisions for service of
process is not required.”  Ramos v.
Homeward Residential, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1442 (Ramos).
 “‘[S]ubstantial compliance is
sufficient.’  [Citation.]”  Ramos, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1443.  “In general, substantial
compliance with the code occurs when, although not properly identified in a
proof of service, the person to be served in fact actually received the
summons.”  Ramos, supra,
223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1443 (italics in original). 
 
“‘[W]hen
the defendant is a corporation, the “person to be served” is one of the
individuals specified in section 416.10. Therefore, [a plaintiff] could be held
to have substantially complied with the statute if, despite his failure to
address the mail to one of the persons to be served on behalf of the
defendants, the summons was actually received by one of the persons to be
served.’  [Citation.]”  Ramos, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1443.  “[M]ere receipt of the
summons by an unknown employee of the corporation who is not a person specified
in section 416.10 does not necessarily establish substantial compliance.
[Citation.]”  Ibid.
 
            In
support of the Defendants’ motions to quash, Londergan (on behalf of herself
and as Chief Executive Officer of Karmic Energy) testifies as follows.  At no point were the Defendants personally
served with the Summons and Complaint in this matter, and at no point did Karmic
Energy’s agent for service of process inform Londergan that the corporate defendant
had been served with a lawsuit.  Londergan’s Motion, Londergan Decl., ¶ 3;
Karmic Energy Motion, Londergan Decl., ¶ 4. 
Apparently, on June 21, 2024, Karmic Energy’s independent contractor
Nicole Pavone (“Pavone”) was teaching a Pilates class at Karmic Energy’s Manhattan
Beach location, when she noticed someone drop off and tape to the door “the
lawsuit in this matter.”  Motions, Pavone
Decl., ¶ 3.  However, Pavone is not in
charge of that office, an officer of Karmic Energy, or authorized to accept
service on behalf of the Defendants. 
Pavone Decl., ¶¶ 3, 5, 6. 
Londergan testifies that she found about the lawsuit from Pavone and the
Defendant never received a copy of the summons in the mail.  Londergan’s Motion, Londergan Decl., ¶ 7; Karmic
Energy Motion, Londergan Decl., ¶ 4.  
 
“When a defendant challenges [personal]
jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is on the plaintiff to
prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite
to an effective service.”  Dill v.
Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439–1440. 
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to meet
that burden.  Indeed, Plaintiff has not
filed any Proof of Service of Summons or opposition to the motions. 
 
            Therefore, Defendants’ motions to
quash are GRANTED.
 
            Defendants also demur the Complaint,
arguing that Plaintiff has failed to allege compliance with or exemption from the
Tenant Protection Act of 2019. 
 
“[O]nce a motion to quash is granted the court may
not review the merits of the underlying action, at least as far as they pertain
to the defendant that prevailed on the motion to quash.”  Shisler v. Sanfer Sports Cars, Inc.
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.  
 
If a court denies a motion to quash service of
summons, the defendant may file an answer or demurrer to the complaint.  Butenschoen, supra, 16
Cal.App.5th Supp. at pp. 14-15. 
 
Here, the Court has granted the motion to quash. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer is moot. 
 
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
