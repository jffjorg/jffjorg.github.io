And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge concludes that the First Amended Cross-Complaint states a cause of action for indemnification against Express Employment Professionals, despite the fact that Active Transport, LLC has not yet been found liable to John Hernandez, the Plaintiff. The Judge notes that the elements of a cause of action for indemnity are a showing of fault on the part of the indemnitor and resulting damages to the indemnitee, and that the First Amended Cross-Complaint adequately pleads these elements. The Judge also rejects Express Employment Professionals' contention that the matter is unripe, since no judgment has been entered against Active Transport, LLC.

```

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Express Employment Professionals to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) of Defendant Active Transport, LLC. The demurrer argued that the FAXC failed to state a cause of action for indemnification because Active Transport has not yet been found liable to Plaintiff John Hernandez. The Judge found that the FAXC sufficiently states a cause of action for indemnification and that the demurrer was misplaced. The Judge also found that the second cause of action for declaratory relief was not derivative of the indemnity claim. The demurrer was therefore overruled and Cross-Defendant was ordered to answer within 30 days.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has overruled the demurrer of Cross-Defendant Express Employment Professionals to the first amended cross-complaint of Defendant Active Transport LLC. The Cross-Defendant had argued that the first cause of action for indemnification was defective because Active Transport had not yet been found liable to Plaintiff John Hernandez. However, the Judge found that the first amended cross-complaint had rectified the defects of the original cross-complaint and stated sufficient facts to support the indemnification claim. The Judge also found that it is customary for defendants to plead equitable indemnity against cross-defendants prior to an ultimate adjudication, and that the Cross-Defendant had not cited any authority to support its claim that the matter was unripe. The Cross-Defendant is ordered to answer the first amended cross-complaint within 30 days.
