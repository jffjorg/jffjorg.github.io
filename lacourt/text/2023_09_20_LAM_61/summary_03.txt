And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has ruled that Express Employment Professionals' demurrer to Active Transport, LLC's First Amended Cross-Complaint is OVERRULED. The Judge concludes that the First Amended Cross-Complaint states a cause of action for indemnification against Express Employment Professionals, despite the fact that Active Transport, LLC has not yet been found liable to John Hernandez, the Plaintiff. The Judge notes that the elements of a cause of action for indemnity are a showing of fault on the part of the indemnitor and resulting damages to the indemnitee, and that the First Amended Cross-Complaint adequately pleads these elements. The Judge also rejects Express Employment Professionals' contention that the matter is unripe, since no judgment has been entered against Active Transport, LLC.
