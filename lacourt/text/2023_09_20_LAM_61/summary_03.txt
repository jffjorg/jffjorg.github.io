The Judge notes that the elements of a cause of action for indemnity are a showing of fault on the part of the indemnitor and resulting damages to the indemnitee, and that the First Amended Cross-Complaint adequately pleads these elements. The Judge also rejects Express Employment Professionals' contention that the matter is unripe, since no judgment has been entered against Active Transport, LLC.

```

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Express Employment Professionals to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) of Defendant Active Transport, LLC. The demurrer argued that the FAXC failed to state a cause of action for indemnification because Active Transport has not yet been found liable to Plaintiff John Hernandez. The Judge found that the FAXC sufficiently states a cause of action for indemnification and that the demurrer was misplaced. The Judge also found that the second cause of action for declaratory relief was not derivative of the indemnity claim. The demurrer was therefore overruled and Cross-Defendant was ordered to answer within 30 days.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has overruled the demurrer of Cross-Defendant Express Employment Professionals to the first amended cross-complaint of Defendant Active Transport LLC. The Cross-Defendant had argued that the first cause of action for indemnification was defective because Active Transport had not yet been found liable to Plaintiff John Hernandez. However, the Judge found that the first amended cross-complaint had rectified the defects of the original cross-complaint and stated sufficient facts to support the indemnification claim. The Judge also found that it is customary for defendants to plead equitable indemnity against cross-defendants prior to an ultimate adjudication, and that the Cross-Defendant had not cited any authority to support its claim that the matter was unripe. The Cross-Defendant is ordered to answer the first amended cross-complaint within 30 days.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: 

**Case Number:** 22STCV22519
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Department:** 61

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** John Hernandez
* **Defendant:** Active Transport LLC
* **Cross-Defendant:** Express Employment Professionals

**Issues:**

* Cross-Defendant Express Employment Professionals (Cross-Defendant) demurs to Active Transport LLC's (Defendant) First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC).
* Defendant's FAXC alleges two causes of action: 
    * Indenification
    * Declaratory Relief

**Judge's Reasoning:**

* A demurrer should only be sustained if the pleading is legally insufficient.
* The court must interpret the complaint liberally, assuming all factual allegations are true.
* The court rejected Cross-Defendant's argument that the indemnification claim is premature because no judgment has been entered against Defendant. 
* The court found that the FAXC adequately states a claim for indemnification by alleging Cross-Defendant's liability for employment retaliation.
* The court also found the declaratory relief claim is not derivative of the indemnification claim and therefore not defective.

**Ruling:**

* Cross-Defendant's demurrer to Defendant's FAXC is **OVERRULED**.
* Defendant is ordered to answer the FAXC within 30 days.


**English Summary:**

The judge has decided to overrule the demurrer filed by Express Employment Professionals. This means that the judge believes Active Transport LLC's cross-complaint has sufficiently stated its claims for indemnification and declaratory relief. 

The judge rejected the argument that the indemnification claim was premature because no judgment had yet been entered against Active Transport LLC.  The judge found that Active Transport LLC adequately alleged Express Employment Professionals' liability in the employment retaliation case.  Therefore, Express Employment Professionals must now file an answer to the cross-complaint within 30 days.

### English Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling
The judge has overruled the demurrer filed by Express Employment Professionals, the cross-defendant, in response to the first amended cross-complaint filed by Active Transport LLC, the defendant. The demurrer claimed that the cross-complaint was defective because Active Transport LLC had not yet been found liable to the plaintiff, John Hernandez, and that insufficient facts were pleaded to support the indemnification claim. However, the judge found that the cross-complaint had rectified the defects of the original cross-complaint and stated sufficient facts to support the indemnification claim. The judge also noted that it is customary for defendants to plead equitable indemnity against cross-defendants prior to an ultimate adjudication, and that the demurrer was therefore overruled. As a result, Express Employment Professionals must answer the cross-complaint within 30 days.
