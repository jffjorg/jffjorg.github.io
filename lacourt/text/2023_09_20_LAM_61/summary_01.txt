```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Farmers Insurance Corporation's motion for leave to intervene in the action. The motion was granted because Farmers has a direct interest in the action as the liability insurer for the defendant, Dennis Sprague. Since Sprague has become non-communicative, Farmers needs to intervene to protect its interests. The court found that intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation and that the reasons for the intervention outweigh any opposition by the present parties.
