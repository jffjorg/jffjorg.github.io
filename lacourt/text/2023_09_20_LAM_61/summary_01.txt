**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:**  *Not specified in provided text*
* **Defendant:** Dennis Sprague
* **Defendant in Intervention:** Farmers Insurance Corporation 

**Significant Statements:**

* The Judge grants Farmers Insurance Corporation's motion to intervene in the case.
* Farmers Insurance Corporation is the liability insurer for Defendant Dennis Sprague.

* Dennis Sprague is elderly and unable to communicate.
*  Farmers Insurance Corporation, Sprague's liability insurer, seeks to intervene in the case.

**Legal Arguments:**

* Farmers Insurance Corporation argues it has a direct interest in the case due to its potential liability under Insurance Code § 11580, subd. (b)(2).
* Farmers Insurance Corporation cites *Royal Indemnity Co. v. United Enterprises, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 194* to support its argument that intervention is appropriate when an insurer must defend its insured who is not able to do so.
*  The Plaintiffs do not oppose the motion to intervene.

**Ruling:**

**English Summary:**

The Judge has decided to allow Farmers Insurance Corporation to participate in the lawsuit against Dennis Sprague.
