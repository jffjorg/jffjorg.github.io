## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion by the City of Palmdale to compel further document production from CV Communities, LLC in a case involving a Joint Community Facility Agreement. 

The judge finds that the City's arguments regarding the Plaintiff's responses are mostly unpersuasive because many of the objections were not discussed during the meet-and-confer process. 

The judge grants the motion to compel as to six specific requests (Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 16, and 17), requiring the Plaintiff to provide a privilege log for documents withheld based on privilege claims. 

The judge denies the motion for the remaining requests and does not impose sanctions on either party.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Case No. 20STCV10953

**Case Number:** 20STCV10953
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Dept:** 61

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** CV Communities, LLC

**Facts and Disputes:**

* Defendant moved to compel further responses to Requests for Production (RFPs) served by Plaintiff.

* Defendant argued these responses were defective because they required guessing which documents already produced to other parties were responsive.
* Defendant also claimed Plaintiff's objections were improper and required a privilege log for withheld documents.

**Legal Analysis:**

* The Judge found that Defendant's motion was mostly defective because it did not adequately address the meet-and-confer process. 
* The Judge noted that two arguments raised in the motion were previously discussed during meet-and-confer, but no attempt was made to discuss the new issues raised in the motion.
* The Judge found that Plaintiff's responses to RFPs No. 1, 4, 5, 6, 16, and 17 required a privilege log because they indicated documents were being withheld based on privilege.

**Outcome:**

* The motion is granted in part, requiring Plaintiff to produce a privilege log for the specified RFPs.
* The motion is denied in all other respects.
* No sanctions are awarded.



**English Summary:**

The judge partially granted the City of Palmdale's motion to compel further responses from CV Communities, LLC.
