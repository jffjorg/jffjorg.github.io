## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion by the City of Palmdale to compel further document production from CV Communities, LLC in a case involving a Joint Community Facility Agreement. 

The judge finds that the City's arguments regarding the Plaintiff's responses are mostly unpersuasive because many of the objections were not discussed during the meet-and-confer process. 

The judge grants the motion to compel as to six specific requests (Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 16, and 17), requiring the Plaintiff to provide a privilege log for documents withheld based on privilege claims. 

The judge denies the motion for the remaining requests and does not impose sanctions on either party.
