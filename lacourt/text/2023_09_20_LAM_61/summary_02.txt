* A motion to compel further must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer declaration.
* Only six responses -- Requests No. 1, 4, 5, 6, 16, and 17 -- indicate documents are being withheld pursuant to objections.
* A privilege log is required for responses that indicate materials are being withheld pursuant to objections based on privilege.

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants Palmdale's motion to compel further responses to requests for production as to specific requests (1, 4, 5, 6, 16, and 17), and denies the motion otherwise. The ruling notes that Palmdale's arguments are mostly defective, focusing on objections to which statements of compliance were made subject, and that the parties did not meet and confer on these issues. The Judge also notes that only six responses indicate documents are being withheld pursuant to objections, and that a privilege log is required for responses that indicate materials are being withheld due to privilege. No sanctions are awarded.
