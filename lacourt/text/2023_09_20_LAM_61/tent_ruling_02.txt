I.               
MOTION TO
COMPEL FURTHER – PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
 
“A party may demand
that any other party produce . . . a document that is in the possession,
custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.010(b).) The demanding party may move for an order compelling further
response to the demand if the demanding party deems that (1) a statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete, (2) a representation of inability to
comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or (3) an objection in the
response is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a).) “The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand,” and “[t]he motion shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(b).) 
 
A motion to compel
a further response to an inspection demand must set forth specific facts
showing “good cause” justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1); Kirkland
v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) Unless there is a
legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney work product, that burden is
met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance. (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th
443, 444.) Once the moving party demonstrates good cause for the discovery, the
burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully
respond to the inspection demand.  (Coy v Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d
210, 220.) 
 
Defendant City of
Palmdale (Palmdale) moves to compel further responses to Requests for Production
No. 1–29, served upon Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant CV Communities, LLC
(Plaintiff). These requests sought information concerning the negotiation of
the Joint Community Facility Agreement (JCFA) that is one of the underlying
agreements in this matter. Plaintiff responded to these requests mainly with
various statements of compliance, each response (save that for Request No. 3)
stated that documents it has not already produced would be made available to
Plaintiff. (Separate Statement.) Palmdale argues that these responses are
defective because they offer to produce “additional” documents “not already
produced,” thus requiring Palmdale to guess which of the many documents already
produced to other parties in this action are responsive to the request at
issue. (Motion at pp. 5–6.) Palmdale also contends that the objections
prefacing each response are improper, and to the extent any response is
predicated on the production of “non-privileged” documents, Plaintiff must
provide a privilege log for documents being withheld. (Motion at pp. 8–12.)
 
This motion is
mostly defective, as the bulk of Palmdale’s arguments concern the objections to
which statements of compliance were made subject, without any indication that
documents would be withheld pursuant to those objections, or else concern
purported defects in these statements of compliance which Palmdale never
discussed in its meet-and-confer efforts prior to the instant motion.
 
A motion to compel
further must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2031.310, subd. (b).) Here, Plaintiff’s initial responses were served on June
8, 2023. (Mackprang Decl. ¶ 3.) The parties met and conferred concerning
Palmdale’s asserted defects in the responses, none of which concerned
Plaintiff’s reference to documents already produced. (Mackprang Decl. ¶¶ 4–9,
Exhs. 3–9.) Amended responses were served on June 26, 2023, in which changes
were made in response to Palmdale’s specific concerns. (Mackprang Decl. ¶ 11,
Exh. 10.) It appears that between that date and the filing of this motion on
July 20, 2023, a period of more than three weeks, no attempt was made to meet
and confer on the issues raised in the present motion.
 
There are two
arguments made in the present motion that were previously covered in the
parties’ meet and confer efforts. The first concerns the validity of
Plaintiff’s prefatory objections to discovery, and the second concerns the
necessity of a privilege log for documents withheld pursuant to an objection.
 
Palmdale’s
arguments with respect to Defendant’s objections are unpersuasive, as there are
only six responses — Requests No. 1, 4, 5, 6, 16, and 17 — that indicate
documents are being withheld pursuant to objections. A motion to compel further
may be brought where a statement of compliance is incomplete, a representation
of inability to comply is inadequate, or where “[a]n objection in the response
is without merit or to general.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).) There
is no reason to entertain a motion to overrule objections made to discovery
queries where the objection is merely prefatory to a statement of compliance,
and where no evidence exists that responsive information is being withheld
pursuant to the objection. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240, subd. (b)
[describing process for identifying documents withheld pursuant to objections];
see also American Federation of State,
County & Municipal Employees v. Metropolitan Water Dist. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 247, 268 [addressing requests for
admission].)
 
It is only with respect to Requests No. 1, 4, 5, 6, 16, and
17, each of which provided a statement of compliance as to all “non-privileged”
responsive documents, that Plaintiff’s responses indicate materials are being
withheld pursuant to objections based on privilege. Such a response requires a
privilege log. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240, subd. (c).) The parties conferred
on this issue, and Plaintiff stated that it would produce a privilege log. (Mackprang
Decl. Exh. 7..) Plaintiff contends it shall do so before the hearing on this
motion.  (Opposition at p. 15, fn. 12.)
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED as to Requests No. 1, 4,
5, 6, 16, and 17, unless Defendant produces a privilege log prior to the
hearing on the motion. The motion is otherwise DENIED.
 
II.   SANCTIONS
Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon
a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response
to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for
admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
Palmdale seeks sanctions in the amount of $3,555.00,
representing nine hours of attorney work at $395 per hour. (Mackprang Decl. ¶¶
14–18.) Plaintiff seeks $6,250.00 in sanctions, representing seven hours of
attorney work at $550 per hour, plus five hours of attorney work at $600 per
hour. (Mircheff Decl. ¶¶ 19–21.) No sanctions are awarded.
