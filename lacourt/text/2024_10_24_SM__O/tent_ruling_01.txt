RULING
            Defendant
Babak Taheri’s Demurrer to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
and 5th causes of action in Plaintiff Babak Taheri’s FAC is
OVERRULED. Plaintiff has properly plead compliance with the statute of
limitations for each cause of action. Plaintiff has properly plead all the
necessary elements of the causes of action. 
  
 
REASONING
As a general matter, in a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the
evidence or facts alleged.” (E428.50Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes
the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)
 
Plaintiff is only required to
allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (See Committee on Children's
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212 [“the
complaint should set forth the ultimate facts constituting the cause of action,
not the evidence by which plaintiff proposes to prove those facts”); 1 Cal.
Affirmative Def. § 10:2 (2d ed.) [allegations of agency, course and scope of
employment, etc. qualify as ultimate facts].) Plaintiff’s allegations must be
accepted as true on demurrer. (See Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp.
(2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924 [“For purposes of reviewing a demurrer, we accept
the truth of material facts properly pleaded in the operative complaint”].)
 
1.    
Demurrer to the 1st, 2nd,
3rd, and 5th causes of action based on Statute of
Limitations—OVERRULED
 
“The statute of limitations usually
commences when a cause of action ‘accrues,’ and it is generally said that ‘an
action accrues on the date of injury.’ [Citation.] Alternatively, it is often
stated that the statute commences ‘upon the occurrence of the last element
essential to the cause of action.” (Bernson v. Browning–Ferris Industries
(1994) 7 Cal.4th 926, 931.) “These general principles have been significantly
modified by the common law ‘discovery rule,’ which provides that the accrual
date may be ‘delayed until the plaintiff is aware of her injury and its
negligent cause.” (Ibid.) Now, under the discovery rule, “the statute of
limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that
her injury was caused by wrongdoing, that someone has done something wrong to
her.” (Id. at p. 932.)
 
To rely on the discovery rule,
plaintiff must specifically allege facts showing “(1) the time and manner of
discovery and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite
reasonable diligence.  In assessing the sufficiency of the allegations of
delayed discovery, the court places the burden on the plaintiff to ‘show
diligence’; ‘conclusory allegations will not withstand demurrer.’”  (Fox
v. Ethicon Endo–Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 C4th 797, 808.)
 
“Part payment is deemed to be a
sufficient acknowledgment of a “continuing contract” to take the case out of
the statute of limitations . . . . The acknowledgment of a debt before the
statute has run, however, does not create a new obligation as of the time of
the acknowledgment; it merely continues the original obligation through a new
statutory period.” (Eilke v. Rice (1955) 45 Cal.2d 66, 73; see Code Civ.
Proc., § 360.) 
 
Defendant Babak Taheri (“Taheri”)
argues that the statute of limitations began to run on the breach of promissory
note claims on 12-1-16 because Plaintiff Jim Delshad’s (“Delshad”) Complaint
states that Taheri “would make monthly payments of interest from December 1,
2011 to December 1, 2016. (FAC, ¶ 14.) Taheri argues the effective date when
Delshad was allegedly injured was on 12-1-16, and thus the statute of
limitations began to run at that time. However, this argument ignores the
allegation that Taheri “continued to pay Delshad $2866.66 every month until
April 2023, when Taheri simply ceased making payments on the Note.” (FAC, ¶
16.) Thus, Delshad pleads that the date of injury was in April of 2023 when
Taheri stopped making payments on the loan, not what was allegedly originally
contracted for in the original promissory note. Delshad further pleads that “Taheri’s
cessation of monthly interest payments and his failure and refusal to pay off
the Note has caused Delshad to be harmed in the amount of $430,000, plus
interest.” (FAC, ¶ 17.) 
 
Delshad’s allegations of partial
payment up until April of 2023, which must be accepted as true at this stage,
create the assumption that the statute of limitations began to run in April of
2023 for all claims, as the April 2023 date is the alleged initial date of
injury. Delshad filed the complaint on 4-26-24, around a year after the statute
of limitations began to accrue, thus the Complaint was filed well within the
four year statute of limitations for breach of promissory note (Code Civ.
Proc., § 337, subd. (a)), three year statute of limitations for fraud (Code
Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (d)), and four-year statute of limitations for
financial elder abuse (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15657.7.)
 
Thus, Taheri’s Demurrer as to the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, and 5th causes of action based on the
Statute of Limitations is OVERRULED. 
 
2.    
Demurrer to the 1st cause of action
for breach of promissory note—OVERRULED
Taheri argues that the 1st
cause of action for breach of promissory note is vague and uncertain because
the FAC does not identify “terms of this purported second agreement” regarding
the continuation of the promissory note payments. (Demurrer, p. 9:9–22.) 
 
"Demurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a
defendant cannot reasonably respond . . . . We strictly construe such demurrers
because ambiguities can reasonably be clarified under modern rules of
discovery." (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135. ["demurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored"].)
 
"A cause of action for
nonpayment on a promissory note is one for breach of contract." (Poseidon
Development, Inc. v. Woodland Lane Estates, LLC (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th
1106, 1112, as modified (July 24, 2007).) The essential elements of breach of
contract are “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to the plaintiff." (D'Arrigo Bros. of California v. United
Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790, 800.)
 
Not only are demurrers for
uncertainty disfavored, Delshad successfully pleads all the elements of a beach
of promissory note cause of action. Delshad alleges that Taheri executed the
promissory note attached to the complaint, made payments on the note for 12
years, and then ceased making payments in 2023, thereby breaching the terms of
the Note and causing harm to Delshad. (See FAC, ¶¶ 13–17.) Additionally,
Delshad alleges after Taheri told Delshad that he would not be able to repay
Delshad by the original maturity date of the Note, they "thus agreed to
extend the maturity date of the Note and that Taheri could continue to pay
interest only until such time that he could afford to pay Delshad the $430,000
principal." (See FAC, ¶ 16.)
 
Taheri’s Demurrer to the 1st
cause of action for breach of promissory note is OVERRULED. 
 
3.    
Demurrer to the 2nd cause of action
for Financial Elder Abuse—OVERRULED
 
The elements of
a cause of action for financial elder abuse are
(1) the defendant took, hid, appropriated, obtained or retained plaintiff's
property; (2) plaintiff is at least 65 years of age or a dependent adult; (3)
the defendant took, hid, appropriated, obtained or retained plaintiff's
property for a wrongful use, with the intent to defraud, or by undue influence;
(4) the plaintiff was harmed; and (5) the defendant's conduct was a substantial
factor in causing plaintiff's harm. (See CACI No. 3100.)
 
“Under the Elder Abuse and
Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (Welf. & Inst.Code, § 15600 et seq.),
an elder is “any person residing in this state, 65 years or older [citations] .
. . . ” Section 15610.30 broadly defines financial abuse of an elder as
occurring when a person or entity “[t]akes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or
retains real or personal property of an elder” for “a wrongful use or with
intent to defraud, or both,” as well as “by undue influence....” (Paslay v.
State Farm General Ins. Co. (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 639, 656.)
 
 Welf. & Inst.Code Subdivision
(b) of  Section 15610.30 provides a
person or entity is “deemed to have taken, secreted, appropriated, obtained, or
retained property for a wrongful use if, among other things, the person or
entity takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains possession of property
and the person or entity knew or should have known that this conduct is likely
to be harmful to the elder ... adult.” (Welf. & Inst.Code§ 15610.30, subd.
(b).) The provision further specifies that a person or entity “takes, secretes,
appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal property when an elder or
dependent adult is deprived of any property right, including by means of an
agreement....” (§ 15610.30, subd. (c).) . . . . Thus, a party may engage in
elder abuse by misappropriating funds to which an elder is entitled under a
contract.” (Paslay, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at p. 656.)
 
Delshad alleges he over 65, Taheri
retained money due Delshad under the terms of the Note, that Taheri did so
"with the intent to defraud Delshad or for a wrongful use, including the
fact that Taheri knew or should have known that his conduct was likely to harm
Delshad," that “Delshad was harmed by Taheri’s retaining the money that
was due to Delshad,” and that “Taheri’s conduct was a substantial factor in
causing Delshad’s harm.” (See FAC, ¶¶ 6, 11, 13, 19, 21, 22–25.)
 
Thus, Delshad has plead all the
necessary elements of a financial elder abuse cause of action. Taheri’s
Demurrer to the 2nd cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
 
4.    
Demurrer to the 3rd cause of action
for Fraud—OVERRULED
 
"A complaint for fraud must
allege the following elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the
defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable
reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting damages. Every element must be
specifically pleaded. [citations omitted]" (Service by Medallion, Inc.
v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816.)
 
“Promissory fraud is a subspecies
of the action for fraud and deceit. A promise to do something necessarily
implies the intention to perform; hence, where a promise is made without such
intention, there is an implied misrepresentation of fact that may be actionable
fraud.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638.) An action
for promissory fraud may lie where a defendant fraudulently induces the plaintiff
to enter into a contract.” (Ibid.) “Recovery, however, may be limited by the
rule against double recovery of tort and contract compensatory damages.” (Ibid.)
 
“[T]he facts constituting the fraud
must be alleged with sufficient specificity to allow defendant to understand
fully the nature of the charge made.” (Roberts v. Ball, Hunt, Hart, Brown
& Baerwitz (1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 104, 109.) Fraud actions against
corporations require the plaintiff “to allege the names of the persons who made
the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom
they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.” (Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.) However,
the specificity requirement is “relaxed when the allegations indicate that the
defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the
controversy or when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the opposite party.”
(Ibid., citations omitted.)
 
Delshad alleges all the necessary
elements of fraud, or promissory fraud, in the FAC with the requisite
specificity as required to plead a fraud cause of action. Delshad alleges the
following:
 
1.    
Delshad alleges specific facts regarding the background
of the complaint which gave rise to the fraud cause of action, (See FAC, ¶¶
6–10.)
2.    
Delshad alleges “On or about December 1, 2011, Taheri
promised Delshad that, if Delshad relinquished his ownership interest in IPC
and the other company, he would personally repay Delshad the $430,000,” and
attached the alleged Note to the FAC which shows Taheri’s signature (FAC, ¶¶
11, 13, 29; Ex. A.)
3.    
Delshad alleges “[a]t the time Taheri promised Delshad
that he would pay Delshad $430,000, Taheri did not actually intend to do so,” “Taheri
intended that Delshad would rely on his promise,” and “Delshad reasonably
relied on Taheri’s promise by, among other things, relinquishing his ownership
interest in IPC.” (FAC, ¶¶ 30–32.)
4.    
Delshad alleges “Taheri failed to perform his promise
to pay Delshad $430,000,” and “Delshad was harmed as a result of Taheri’s
failure to pay Delshad as promised.” (FAC, ¶¶ 33, 34.)
 
Thus, Taheri’s Demurrer to the 3rd
cause of action for fraud is OVERRULED.  
 
5.    
Demurrer to the 5th cause of action
for Unjust Enrichment—OVERRULED
 
“The elements for a claim of unjust
enrichment are receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the
expense of another. [Citation.] The theory of unjust enrichment requires one
who acquires a benefit which may not justly be retained, to return either the
thing or its equivalent to the aggrieved party so as not to be unjustly
enriched.” (Lyles v. Sangadeo-Patel (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 759, 769.)
 
“Unjust enrichment is synonymous
with restitution.” Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
1350, 1370.) Under the law of restitution, [a]n individual is required to make
restitution if he or she is unjustly enriched at the expense of another.
[Citations.] A person is enriched if the person receives a benefit at another's
expense. [Citation.] [Citation.] However, [t]he fact that one person benefits
another is not, by itself, sufficient to require restitution. The person
receiving the benefit is required to make restitution only if the circumstances
are such that, as between the two individuals, it is unjust for the
person to retain it.” (Ibid., emphasis in original, quotes omitted.)
 
Taheri’s argument that a claim for
unjust enrichment is not recognized as a cause of action in California is
correct, however, a claim for unjust enrichment is synonymous with restitution,
which is a cause of action in California. 
 
Delshad pleads that “Delshad paid
the Lenders $430,000 on Taheri’s behalf and thus conferred A benefit on Taheri.”
(FAC, ¶ 43.) Delshad pleads “Taheri knowingly accepted and retained the benefit
that Delshad conferred upon Taheri,” and “Taheri has been unjustly enriched by
the benefit conferred by Delshad.” (FAC, ¶¶ 44–45.) Thus, Delshad has properly
plead all the elements of unjust enrichment, or restitution. 
 
Taheri’s Demurrer to the 5th
cause of action is OVERRULED.
