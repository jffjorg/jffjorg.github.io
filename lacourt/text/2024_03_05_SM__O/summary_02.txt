```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Vinotheesan Thavarajavel, has moved to strike the words "willful and wanton" and the prayer for punitive damages from the complaint of the plaintiffs, Tyler Prescott and Rachele Prescott. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs have not properly pleaded a claim for punitive damages under Taylor v. Superior Court, as they have not alleged a history of prior arrests, convictions, or mishaps that would heighten the probability and foreseeability of an accident. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded a claim for punitive damages by alleging that the defendant drove while under the influence of alcohol and caused injury to the plaintiffs, and that this conduct constitutes an act of malice under California Civil Code ยง 3294. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to strike.
