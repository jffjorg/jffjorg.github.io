And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants (Rand Shalabi, Elvis A. Ortiz-Wayland, and Housekey Real Estate Corp) against the plaintiff (Henry Shin Yang). The defendants have demurred to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th causes of action of the Third Amended Complaint, arguing that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against them or is uncertain. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff's causes of action fail for uncertainty due to inconsistent factual allegations regarding the existence or lack of an agency relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants. The judge has also granted the motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint.
