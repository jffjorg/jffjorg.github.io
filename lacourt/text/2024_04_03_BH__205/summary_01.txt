And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"Based on the evidence presented, the court grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants. The court awards default judgment in the amount of $57,563.11 in favor of the plaintiff. The court declines to award attorneys' fees to the plaintiff as they failed to specify the contractual or statutory basis for the fees. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for costs totaling $831, as they were not itemized as required. The court finds that the plaintiff has established its entitlement to the relief requested and grants default judgment in the amount of $57,563.11 in favor of the plaintiff."
