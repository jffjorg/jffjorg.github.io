And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motions of Oceanus Decor & Flooring, Inc. and Zhigang Cui to vacate the default judgments entered against them. The court finds that the motions were timely filed, and that Oceanus and Cui were not at fault for the default judgments. The court also finds that the default judgments were caused by Oceanus's bilingual employees summarily translating the summons and complaint to Cui, which Cui did not fully understand due to his limited English proficiency. The court exercises its discretion to resolve the close question in favor of Oceanus and Cui, and grants their motions to vacate the default judgments. The proposed answer and cross-complaint submitted with their motion are deemed filed as of the date of the ruling, and Oceanus and Cui are ordered to file separately the answer and cross-complaint.
