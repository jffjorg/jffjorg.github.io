English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to order the defendant to deposit rent payments with the court. The plaintiff, Cynthia A. Blanks, as trustee of two trusts, seeks declaratory relief and accounting against the defendant, Devanand Sharma aka Frank Martini. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant has taken possession of rent payments and is using them for personal expenses. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiff is improperly using the procedure and that the plaintiff does not have standing to seek relief. The court denied the motion without prejudice, finding that the rent payments are not in the defendant's possession or control and that the plaintiff is seeking an accounting for rent that has been collected, but not for future rent payments.
