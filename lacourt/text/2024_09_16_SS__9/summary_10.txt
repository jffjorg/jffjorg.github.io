And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a name change petition. The petitioner must review the proposed decree with their new name to ensure it is accurately written and spelled. If the proposed decree is satisfactory, the petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the proposed decree is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must attend the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Additionally, once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
