And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for a name change. The judge is requiring the petitioner to review and double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the name is correct and legible, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The judge has granted the petition, and a copy of the signed decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
