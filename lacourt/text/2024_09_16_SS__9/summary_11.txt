The judge has granted the petition for a name change, but with some conditions. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the new name meets these standards, the Petitioner need not appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
