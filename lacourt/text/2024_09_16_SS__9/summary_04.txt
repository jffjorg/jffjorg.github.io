And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a name change petition. The petition is granted, but the petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is correctly written and spelled. If the new name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date of September 16, 2024.
