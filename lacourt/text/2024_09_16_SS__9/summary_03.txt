And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition to change name. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the petitioner is satisfied with the new name, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. After the hearing, a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
