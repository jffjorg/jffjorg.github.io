However, if the proposed decree is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
