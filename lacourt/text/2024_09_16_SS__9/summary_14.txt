And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a petition to change name. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the petitioner is satisfied with the proposed decree, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
