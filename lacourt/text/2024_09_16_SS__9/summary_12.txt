And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where a Petitioner is seeking to change their name. The Judge has granted the petition, but has also specified certain conditions that the Petitioner must follow. Specifically, the Petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the new name is correct and legible, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
