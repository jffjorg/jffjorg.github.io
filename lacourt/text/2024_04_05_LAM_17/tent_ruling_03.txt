 Case Number:  23VECV05263    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  17 Superior Court of California County of Los  Angeles   DEPARTMENT 17   TENTATIVE RULING      WEN XIE                 vs.   RAVINDERS S. GREWAL         Case    No.:  23VECV05263          Hearing Date:  April 5, 2024                   Defendant’s  demurrer is SUSTAINED, WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.    On  11/28/2023, Plaintiff Wen Xie (Plaintiff) filed suit against Ravinders S.  Grewal, Glenwind Enterprises, Inc., Happy Day, Inc., the Law Office f/k/a  Mendlovitz/Foster Lawyers as successors-in-interest to the Law Offices of  Mendlovitz & Sanchez, alleging: (1) breach of written contract; (2)  conversion; (3) promissory estoppel; (4) imposition of constructive trust; and  (5) declaratory relief.   On 1/30/2024,  Defendant Michael A. Foster (Defendant) demurred to Plaintiff’s Complaint.    Discussion                Defendant  argues that Plaintiff’s fourth and fifth causes of action (the only claims  asserted against Defendant here) are moot.                Plaintiff’s  Complaint concedes that “once [Defendant] ha[s] deposited the original stock  certificates into the Court's trust or 3rd party escrow, [Defendant] would have  no further obligations owed in connection with this litigation.” (Complaint,  ¶65.)               Here,  on 11/21/2023, Defendant filed a complaint to interplead the Stock Certificates  with the Court and has disclaimed all interest in the Stock Certificates. (See,  Concurrently Filed Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”), Exh. 1 [Complaint in  Case No. 23STCV28588].) As such, the relief sought Plaintiff—i.e., an order  compelling Defendant to deposit with the Court or other approved 3rd party  escrow holder the Stock Certificates—has already been performed by Defendant.  “A case becomes moot when a court ruling can have no practical impact or cannot  provide the parties with effective relief.” (Simi Corp. v. Garamendi  (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1496, 1503.)    RGC Gaslamp,  LLC v. Ehmcke Sheet Metal Co., Inc. (2020) 56  Cal.App.5th 413 (RGC) is instructive. There, a subcontractor filed a mechanic’s  lien on a luxury hotel project, prompting the project owner to sue for quiet  title, among other causes of action. (Id., at p. 417.) After the project  owner filed his complaint, the subcontractor withdrew the mechanic’s lien.  (Id., at p. 432.) The court determined that since the subcontractor released the  lien, the project owner’s cause of action for quiet title was moot. (Id.,  at p. 433.) Here, in the same way, Plaintiff’s claims 4 and 5 against Defendant  are now moot, as Defendant has filed a complaint to interplead the Stock  Certificates with the Court and has disclaimed all interest in the Stock  Certificates. (RJN, Exh. 1 [Complaint in Case No. 23STCV28588].)               Based  on the foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend.    It is so ordered.    Dated:  April     , 2024                                                                                                                                                                Hon.
