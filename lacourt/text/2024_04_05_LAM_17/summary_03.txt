Here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling is about a lawsuit between Wen Xie (Plaintiff) and Ravinders S. Grewal (Defendant) alleging breach of contract, conversion, promissory estoppel, imposition of constructive trust, and declaratory relief. The Defendant demurred to the Plaintiff's Complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff's fourth and fifth causes of action are moot. The court agrees, finding that the relief sought by the Plaintiff has already been performed by the Defendant, who has interpleaded the Stock Certificates with the Court and disclaimed all interest in them. The court cites Simi Corp. v. Garamendi and RGC Gaslamp, LLC v. Ehmcke Sheet Metal Co., Inc. to support its decision. The court sustains the Defendant's demurrer, without leave to amend.
