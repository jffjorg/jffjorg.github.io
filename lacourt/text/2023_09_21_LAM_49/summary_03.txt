The defendant, San Carlos Enterprises, Inc. (dba Los Balcones Del Peru), has moved to bifurcate the trial into two phases: one to determine whether the alleged conduct of defendant Sam Martinez was within the course and scope of his employment, and another to determine whether plaintiff Jane Doe is entitled to recover punitive damages. The court grants the motion to bifurcate the punitive damages phase of the trial, but denies the motion to bifurcate the issue of whether defendant Martinez was acting within the course and scope of his employment. The court finds that bifurcation of this issue would result in significant duplication of evidence and would not promote judicial efficiency or economy.

**English Summary:**

The judge has tentatively ruled on motions filed by Defendant San Carlos Enterprises, Inc. (SCE). The judge granted SCE's request to bifurcate the trial for punitive damages, meaning this issue will be decided separately from the main liability trial. The judge denied SCE's request to bifurcate the issue of whether Defendant Sam Martinez was acting within the scope of his employment when the alleged incident occurred.

The judge explained that bifurcating the scope of employment issue would lead to significant overlap in evidence and witness testimony, making it less efficient.  

The judge's ruling allows the main trial to proceed with the core issues of liability, while the punitive damages phase will be addressed separately if SCE is found liable.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling, written by Judge Randolph M. Hammock, addresses a motion to bifurcate issues at trial in the case of Jane Doe vs. Sam Martinez and San Carlos Enterprises, Inc. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Sam Martinez, a senior manager at the Parker Room, which is owned by San Carlos Enterprises, Inc. The defendant, San Carlos Enterprises, Inc., has moved to bifurcate two issues at trial: (1) whether Sam Martinez's conduct was within the course and scope of his employment, and (2) whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover punitive damages. The court has granted the motion to bifurcate the punitive damages phase of the trial, but denied the motion to bifurcate the issue of whether Sam Martinez's conduct was within the course and scope of his employment. The court found that bifurcating the latter issue would result in significant duplication of necessary testimony and would not promote judicial efficiency or economy. The defendant has been ordered to give notice, unless waived. Any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email, but if they do, they will have waived their right to be present at the hearing.

### English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling

A tentative ruling was made in the case of Jane Doe versus Sam Martinez, et al. (case number BC719217). Jane Doe alleged she was sexually assaulted by Sam Martinez, a senior manager at The Parker Room, on April 28, 2017. Doe filed a complaint against Martinez and San Carlos Enterprises, Inc., the company that owns The Parker Room, citing various causes of action, including sexual battery, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. San Carlos Enterprises, Inc. moved to bifurcate or separate the trial into two parts: (1) determining whether Martinez's conduct was within the scope of his employment and (2) whether Jane Doe is entitled to punitive damages from the company. The court granted the motion to bifurcate the punitive damages phase but denied the motion regarding Martinez's employment scope due to substantial overlap in evidence. This ruling means the jury will decide the company's liability before determining whether to award punitive damages, but both the issues of company liability and the employment scope will be considered together due to their interrelated nature and potential for undue prejudice. The parties can still submit arguments to the court on this tentative ruling, with any decision on it taking place after submissions.
