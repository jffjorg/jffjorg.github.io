And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, San Carlos Enterprises, Inc. (dba Los Balcones Del Peru), has moved to bifurcate the trial into two phases: one to determine whether the alleged conduct of defendant Sam Martinez was within the course and scope of his employment, and another to determine whether plaintiff Jane Doe is entitled to recover punitive damages. The court grants the motion to bifurcate the punitive damages phase of the trial, but denies the motion to bifurcate the issue of whether defendant Martinez was acting within the course and scope of his employment. The court finds that bifurcation of this issue would result in significant duplication of evidence and would not promote judicial efficiency or economy.
