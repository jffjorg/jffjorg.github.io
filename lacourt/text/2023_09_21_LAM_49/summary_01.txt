## Tentative Ruling Summary: Tadevosyan v. LA Fine Motors, LLC

**Case Number:** 23STCV07706

**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023

**Court:** Department 49

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Arman Tadevosyan
* **Defendant:** LA Fine Motors, LLC and Capital One Auto Finance

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over the sale of a 2011 BMW. Plaintiff Tadevosyan alleges that LA Fine Motors misrepresented the car's condition, sold it with defective lights, and failed to honor promised repairs. He filed a lawsuit alleging various causes of action, including violations of consumer protection laws. 

Defendants LA Fine Motors and Capital One Auto Finance moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sale Contract Tadevosyan signed. 

The judge granted the motion to compel arbitration, finding:

* **Existence of Agreement:**  A valid arbitration agreement existed in the contract Tadevosyan signed.
* **No Waiver:** Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that Defendants waived their right to arbitration. 

**Key Points:**

* **Arbitration Agreement:** The contract contained a clear and enforceable agreement to arbitrate any disputes.
* **Plaintiff's Arguments:** Plaintiff argued that Defendants waived their right to arbitration by delaying discovery responses and that the arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable. The court rejected both arguments.
* **Judge's Ruling:** The case is stayed pending the outcome of arbitration. A status review is scheduled for September 23, 2024. 

**Significance:** The ruling underscores the strong public policy in California favoring arbitration agreements and the burden on parties seeking to avoid arbitration to demonstrate a valid defense.
