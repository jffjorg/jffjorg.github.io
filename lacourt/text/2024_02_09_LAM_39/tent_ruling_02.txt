v. Pathway Vet Alliance, et al.
Case No.
20STCV36230
 
Order #1 of 2
Motion for New
Trial
 
            Plaintiff
Dr. James J. Isaacs (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Pathway Vet
Alliance (“Defendant”).  At trial,
Plaintiff presented evidence that he boarded his cat, Little Tiger, with
Defendant when his family and he visited San Francisco.  While in Defendant’s care, Little Tiger
suffered an injury to his eye, which eventually led to his death.  Plaintiff proceeded to trial on claims for
intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and trespass to
chattels.  The Court granted Defendant’s motion
for nonsuit on the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The jury returned a verdict in favor of
Plaintiff on the remaining causes of action and awarded a total of $255,000 in
damages based upon $5,000 in economic damages, $150,000 in past non-economic
damages, and $100,000 in future non-economic damages.  
 
            Defendant
moves for a new trial.  “The right to a
new trial is purely statutory . . . .”  (Fomco,
Inc. v. Joe Maggio, Inc. (1961) 55 Cal.2d 162, 166.)  Defendant cites Code of Civil Procedure
section 662.5, which establishes the procedure if the Court grants a motion for
new trial based on excessive damages.  Defendant
references the insufficiency of the evidence. 
Therefore, the Court construes this motion as having been filed under
Code of Civil Procedure section 657, subdivisions (5) and (6).  The Court may grant a new trial based on “[e]xcessive
or inadequate damages” or “[i]nsufficiency of the evidence to justify the
verdict or other decision[.]”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 657, subds. (5), (6).)  “A new
trial shall not be granted upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to
justify the verdict or other decision, . . . unless after weighing the evidence
the court is convinced from the entire record, including reasonable inferences
therefrom, that the court or jury clearly should have reached a different
verdict or decision.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 657.)  If the damages are excessive,
the Court may grant a remittitur.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 662.5(a)(2).)
 
            The Court
cannot conclude that the jury’s award of emotional distress damages was
excessive.  By definition, emotional
distress is difficult to quantify.  The
fact that the jury only awarded $250,000 makes clear that the jury considered
only Plaintiff’s emotional distress and did not base the award on damages to
family members who were not plaintiffs to this action. 
 
Nor can the Court conclude that the
evidence did not support the verdict.  The
Court cannot weigh the evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses on
motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  (Hauter v. Zogarts (1975) 14 Cal.3d
104, 110.)  Plaintiff is “entitled to the
benefit of every favorable inference which may reasonably be drawn from the
evidence and to have all conflicts in the evidence resolved in his favor.”  (Castro v. State of Calif. (1981) 114
Cal.App.3d 503, 507.)  Defendant’s counsel
argues that the jury could not award emotional distress damages based upon an
injury to Plaintiff’s cat.  The law in
California does not support that argument, as the Court previously ruled: A
plaintiff may recover emotional distress damages for injury to an animal that
forms the basis of a claim for trespass to chattel.  (See, e.g., Plotnick v. Meihaus (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1590, 1607-1608.)  The Court
finds that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict, especially
considering Civil Code section 1838:
 
“If a
thing is . . . injured during its deposit, and the depositary refuses to inform
the depositor of the circumstances under which the loss or injury occurred, so
far as he has information concerning them, or willfully misrepresents the
circumstances to him, the depositary is presumed to have willfully . . .
permitted the . . . injury to occur.”
 
(Civ. Code, § 1838.)  Based upon the record, the jury reasonably
could have found that Defendant was not forthcoming about the circumstances of
Little Tiger’s injury or willfully misrepresented its culpability.
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the Court denies Defendant’s
motion for new trial.  The Court’s clerk
shall provide notice.      
 
 
Order #2 of 2
Motion to Tax
Costs
 
            Plaintiff
submitted a memorandum of costs in the amount of $7,472.19.  Defendant challenges the following costs: (1)
Filing fees of $2,881.17, (2) Attachment costs of $527.11, and (3) Costs for
models, enlargements, and photocopies in the amount of $2,085.96.  Plaintiff’s opposition contains no
documentation to support these requests, but according to Defendant’s counsel’s
declaration, filed on January 16, 2024, Plaintiff submitted documentation
directly to him.  The Court rules as
follows:  
 
            1.         Filing Fees – Plaintiff’s request
includes payment for messenger services, which the Court may approve.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(4).)  The Court finds that these services were
reasonably necessary to Plaintiff’s prosecution of this case.  The Court approves $1,235.89 and taxes Plaintiff’s
costs in the amount of $1,645.28.
 
            2.         Attachment Costs – There were no
attachment proceedings, and the Court cannot determine whether these costs are
proper and reasonably related to the prosecution of this case.  Therefore, the Court taxes this cost of
$527.11.
 
3.         Models/Enlargements/Photocopies
- “Models and enlargements of exhibits
and photocopies of exhibits may be allowed if they were reasonably helpful to
aid the trier of fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(13).) 
The costs Plaintiff seeks include $227.24 for enlargements, $430.85 for
enlargements and $299.25 for exhibit books, which the Court considered
reasonably helpful.  “[I]t would be
inequitable to deny as allowable costs exhibits any prudent counsel would
prepare in advance of trial.”  (Benach v. County of Los Angeles
(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 836, 856.)  However, Plaintiff does not explain the
$1,058.65 in costs Plaintiff incurred for printing.  Accordingly, the Court approves $1,027.31 and
taxes Plaintiff’s costs in the amount of $1,058.65. 
 
4.         Conclusion and Order –
Defendant’s motion to tax costs is granted in part and denied in part.  The Court taxes costs in the total amount of
$3,231.04.  Plaintiff shall recover
$4,241.15 in costs.  The Court’s clerk
shall provide notice.
