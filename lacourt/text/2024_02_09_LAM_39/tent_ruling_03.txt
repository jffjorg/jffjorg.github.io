 Case Number:  20STCV47075    Hearing Date:   February 9, 2024    Dept:  39 Sean
Suh v. Royce Clayton, et al., Case No. 20STCV47075
 
Defendants’
counsel moves to be relieved from representing Royce Clayton and the California
Marijuana Company, Inc.  The motions are set for hearing on May 9, 2024,
at 8:30 a.m.  Defendants’ counsel filed an ex parte application to advance
the hearings.  The ex parte application is granted.  The Court
advances the motions from May 9, 2024, to March 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
The
Court issues an Order to Show Cause why the Court should not strike the answer
of the California Marijuana Company, Inc., and dismiss the California Marijuana
Company, Inc. as a cross-complainant.  Because this party is an entity, it
cannot appear as a self-represented party and requires counsel.  The OSC
hearing shall be held on March 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. at the following
location:
 
Stanley
Mosk Courthouse
111
North Hill Street
Department
#39 (Goorvitch, J.)
Los
Angeles, California 90012
 
The
parties may appear remotely or in-person.  The Court provides notice: If
the Court grants Defendants’ counsel’s motions to be relieved, and the
California Marijuana Company, Inc. does not have new counsel, absent good
cause, the Court will strike its answer, which would permit Plaintiff’s counsel
to seek entry of default, and will dismiss the California Marijuana Company,
Inc. as a cross-complainant.  The Court authorizes a prospective attorney
to make a special appearance on behalf of this party if she is considering
representing this party but requires additional time to finalize the
representation.
 
Counsel
for Defendants shall provide notice to all parties, including his
clients.  Counsel for Defendants shall file a proof of service that makes
clear that both Plaintiff’s counsel and his clients were served with this
minute order.
