And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case between the City of Knowledge and the Estate of Mirza Hassan Mirza Mousa Al-Sulaimi. The court has denied the Al-Sulaimi Estate's motion to strike the complaint and impose sanctions against the City of Knowledge. However, the court has granted the Al-Sulaimi Estate's motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens. Additionally, the court has awarded the Al-Sulaimi Estate attorney fees and costs in the amount of $1,252.50.

The court's ruling is based on the evidence presented in the case, including the allegations made by the City of Knowledge and the Al-Sulaimi Estate. The court has determined that the City of Knowledge's quiet title claim lacks probable validity and that the Al-Sulaimi Estate's motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens is justified.

The court has also denied the Al-Sulaimi Estate's request for attorney fees and costs related to the motion to strike the complaint. However, the court has awarded the Al-Sulaimi Estate attorney fees and costs in the amount of $1,252.50 related to the motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens.
