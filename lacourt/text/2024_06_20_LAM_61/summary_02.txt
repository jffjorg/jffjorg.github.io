And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"Plaintiff A. Blackman seeks to compel further responses from Defendant El Pollo Loco, Inc. and W.K.S. Restaurant Group to her Request for Production of Documents, Set One, No. 21. The request seeks all pages of all insurance policies that may provide coverage for any claim alleged in this lawsuit. The court finds that the request is not overbroad and that insurance policy information is directly relevant and discoverable. The court denies the motion as the defendant's supplemental response is sufficient. The court also notes that the defendant's objections are boilerplate objections with no application to the request at issue."
