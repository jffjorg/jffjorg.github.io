Defendants OSCAR BAUTISTA and BAUTISTA’s TRUCKING MIDWEST,
INC.’s Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint is DENIED
in part and GRANTED in part with 30 days leave to amend. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This action for wrongful death was filed by Plaintiffs on
February 10, 2023. On June 29, 2023, the operative First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) was filed. 
 
Plaintiffs allege that “[t]he tortious conduct giving rise
to this action resulted in a collision occurring on September 12, 2022, on
southbound Interstate-15 (the ‘Interstate’)… in which EDGAR RIVELINO LOPEZ
VASQUEZ and JORGE CISNEROS AGUILA (‘the decedents’) were killed and Plaintiff
RODOLFO ABUNDIZ BRAVO was injured.” (FAC ¶1.) ”On
or about November 17, 2008, Defendant BAUTISTA negligently operated the TRUCK-TRAILER,
carelessly and recklessly failed to keep a reasonable speed while also failing to
keep a lookout for traffic conditions ahead, failed to slow the TRUCK and
TRAILER at any point before the collision, was inattentive and failed to ensure
that no vehicle was too close in proximity, including the SILVERADO. Defendant
BAUTISTA negligently disregarded the safety ofthe decedents and Plaintiff BRAVO
while traveling with Defendants' LOAD on I-15 southbound during the subject
incident.” (FAC ¶47.)
 
The FAC asserts the following causes of action: 
 
(1) Wrongful
Death; 
(2) Survival
Action; 
(3) Negligence;

(4) Negligence
Per Se; 
(5) Negligence
– Loss of Consortium; 
(6) Negligent
Entrustment 
 
Defendants OSCAR BAUTISTA and BAUTISTA’s TRUCKING MIDWEST,
INC. (collectively “Defendants”) move to strike the following language from
Plaintiffs’ FAC: (1) ¶38 stating “As California Highway Patrol Officer B.
Voegele, ID 21205 recommended Defendant Oscar Bautista be charged with the
following violation(s): 192(c)(1) PC- Vehicular Manslaughter with Gross
Negligence – 2 COUNTS”; (2) ¶2 of p. 14, lines 8-9 whereby Plaintiffs pray for
“…funeral and burial expenses…”; and (3) ¶8 of p. 14 whereby Plaintiffs’ pray
for punitive damages. 
 
A motion to strike lies either when (1) there is “irrelevant, false or
improper matter inserted in any pleading”; or (2) to strike any pleading or
part thereof “not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule or order of court.” (CCP §436.)
 
The motion to strike allegations
contained in ¶38 regarding Officer Voegele’s recommendation that Defendant
Bautista be charged with violations under the Penal Code is DENIED. Defendants’
moving papers fail to cite any authority or make any argument regarding these
allegations.  Defendants do so for the
first time in their reply brief.  In any
event, the Court
cannot make factual determinations in response to a Motion to Strike. (See Aubry
v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The Court must
accept the factual allegations set forth in the FAC as true at this stage in
the litigation.
 
The motion to strike Plaintiffs’
prayer for funeral and burial expenses is DENIED. The wrongful death statute
“has long allowed the recovery of funeral expenses in California wrongful death
actions.” (CACI 3921; Vander Lind v. Sup. Ct. (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 358,
364.) 
 
The motion to strike punitive
damages is GRANTED with 30 days leave to amend. The FAC fails to plead facts
that support a recovery of punitive damages because only nondeliberate (i.e.
negligent) conduct is alleged. (FAC ¶47.) “In a personal injury action the
notion of conscious disregard of the safety of others logically may be
substituted for that of disregard of the rights of others… [C]onscious
disregard of safety as an appropriate description of the animus malus which may
justify an exemplary damage award when nondeliberate injury is alleged.” (G.D.
Searle & Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 22, 29.)
