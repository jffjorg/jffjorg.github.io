And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The Judge denies the motion to strike allegations regarding Officer Voegele's recommendation that defendant Bautista be charged with violations under the Penal Code, as the defendant failed to provide any authority or argument in support of the motion. The Judge also denies the motion to strike the prayer for funeral and burial expenses, as the wrongful death statute allows for the recovery of such expenses.

However, the Judge grants the motion to strike punitive damages, as the First Amended Complaint fails to plead facts that support a recovery of punitive damages. The Judge grants the defendant 30 days leave to amend the complaint to plead such facts.
