Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge grants Defendant Tri-Counties Association for the Developmentally Disabled, Inc.'s (TCRC) motion for summary judgment/adjudication on all causes of action asserted against it. The Judge concludes that TCRC owes no legal duty of care to Plaintiff Gloria Valles and that there is no special relationship between TCRC and Plaintiff. The Judge finds that TCRC's duties under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Act run to disabled individuals, not third parties like Plaintiff. The Judge also concludes that there is no duty to prevent criminal third-party conduct and that liability here would be adverse to public policy.
