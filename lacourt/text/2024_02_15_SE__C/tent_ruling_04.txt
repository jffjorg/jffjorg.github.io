Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Oppositions filed as of February 13, 2024. 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed fails to respond at
all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers
thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the
discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond
has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party
is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the
matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial
discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely
filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all
objections. 
 
Here,
Defendant has shown that Form Interrogatories (set one), Special
Interrogatories (set one), and Request for Production of Documents (set one)
were properly served onto Plaintiff on May 26, 2023. The deadlines to respond
have expired, and no responses of any kind have been provided.  These Motions were filed August 31, 2023— about
three months after service of the discovery. As of February 13, 2024, no
Oppositions have been filed to the subject Motions. 
 
Therefore,
the Motions to Compel are GRANTED,
and Plaintiff ROBERT MENDOZA is ORDERED
to provide verified responses and documents, without objection by no later
than 15 days from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may
be extended by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it
will be tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this
Court’s order. 
 
Reasonable Sanctions
are GRANTED in the amount of $1,230.00. Plaintiff ROBERT MENDOZA is ORDERED to
pay Defendant and Defendant’s Counsel of Record sanctions in the amount of
$1,230.00, payable within 30 days of the date of the Court’s issuance of this
Order.
