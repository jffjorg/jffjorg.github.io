And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jakeline Gastelum v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The case involves a "lemon law" action filed by Gastelum, alleging that Honda did not disclose and actively concealed defects in her 2021 Honda Accord vehicle. The judge has overruled Honda's demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleged fraudulent inducement. The judge has also denied Honda's motion to strike punitive damages. The judge has concluded that Gastelum's complaint sufficiently pleads malicious conduct by concealment and that less specificity is required at the pleading stage. The case will proceed to the merits stage, where the judge will assess the allegations of concealment and breach of warranty.
