```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by General Motors LLC. The Judge has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges fraudulent concealment, and sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which alleges a violation of the California Law against Defrauding Consumers. The Judge has also denied General Motors's motion to strike the punitive damages allegations from the First Amended Complaint. The Judge has ruled that the plaintiff, Carlos, has properly pled a claim for fraudulent concealment because General Motors had exclusive knowledge of the transmission defect. However, the Judge has ruled that Carlos's claim under the California Law against Defrauding Consumers fails because Carlos did not comply with the notice period requirement.
