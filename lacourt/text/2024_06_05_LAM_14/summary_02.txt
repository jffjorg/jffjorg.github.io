And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Deluxe Lifecote's motion to set aside default and permit it to file a responsive pleading. The Defendant claims it was not properly served with the lawsuit and that its CEO, Sagi Steven Adirim, was not aware of the lawsuit until March 13, 2024. The Plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc., alleges that the Defendant failed to pay for the installation, rental, and removal of scaffolding. The Court finds that while the Defendant's CEO's conduct may have been negligent, the strong public policy in favor of trying cases on their merits warrants setting aside the default. The Defendant is entitled to its day in court, and the motion is granted.
