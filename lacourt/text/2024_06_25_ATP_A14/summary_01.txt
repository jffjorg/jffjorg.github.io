Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to amend the complaint, allowing the plaintiffs to add four new causes of action to their Second Amended Complaint. The new causes of action are: Negligent Hiring, Training, Supervision, and/or Retention; Constructive Fraud; Intentional Misrepresentation; and Negligent Misrepresentation. The Court notes that the plaintiffs' original motion for leave to amend was deficient, but that the new proposed Second Amended Complaint addresses the deficiencies. The Court also notes that the defense's opposition to the motion was more suitable for a demurrer than a motion for leave to amend. The Court orders the plaintiffs to file a proposed Second Amended Complaint within 10 days.
