And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Mark T. Risner, counsel for the Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants. The Motion was filed on February 7, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The Judge found that the Motion complies with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and that Counsel has provided notice of withdrawal and has repeatedly cautioned his clients about the potential consequences of being unrepresented. Although the Court is aware of possible prejudice to the Plaintiffs, including the risk of being unrepresented and the need for new counsel to quickly catch up on the case, the Judge has decided to grant the Motion as the Plaintiffs have not opposed it and there is still sufficient time for them to obtain new counsel.
