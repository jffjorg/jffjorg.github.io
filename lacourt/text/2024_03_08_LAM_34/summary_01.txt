And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions to compel independent medical examinations (IMEs) filed by LA Valley Management, LLC and David Carlin. The judge also denied the requests for sanctions filed by the defendants. The judge granted the motion for terminating sanctions in part, ordering the plaintiff to complete her deposition within 14 days of the issuance of the order. The judge noted that the plaintiff has been litigating in propria persona and has not filed an opposition to the motions.

The judge found that there was no good cause to compel the plaintiff to undergo independent medical examinations, as the plaintiff has not requested any personal injury damages and has already undergone one IME. The judge also found that the defendants' requests for IMEs were made too late in the litigation process and were not justified by any evidence of the plaintiff's mental or physical condition.

The judge noted that the plaintiff has been cooperative in the litigation process and has complied with the court's orders, including completing her deposition. The judge also found that the plaintiff's failure to complete her deposition was not willful and did not warrant the imposition of terminating sanctions.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a mixed decision, denying some of the defendants' motions while granting others. The judge's decision reflects a cautious approach to imposing sanctions and a recognition of the plaintiff's efforts to cooperate in the litigation process.
