CASE:                         Jaleel Melendez v. Pinetree Terrace Apartments, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 BC692559
 





















 
MOTION
TO DISMISS SUMMARY JUDGMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Jaleel Melendez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
 
            On February 1, 2018, Plaintiff, Jaleel Melendez[1],
initiated this action against Defendants, Pinetree Terrace Apartments and Mabry
Management Co., Inc., for injuries arising from a slip and fall on the common
area staircase of Defendants’ premises.  Plaintiff
filed the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on April 17, 2018.  The FAC asserted causes of action for (1) General
Negligence and (2) Premises Liability.  
 
            On January
12, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition.  The motion was heard on May 5, 2023.  Plaintiff appeared at the hearing and
proceeded to recite portions of deposition testimony to show there were triable
issues of material fact.  The Court
continued the hearing to consider the narrow question of whether presentation
of evidence during oral argument may defeat a summary judgment motion when a
separate statement of disputed facts had not been filed in opposition.  The Court directed the parties to submit
further briefing.  
 
            The parties
submitted additional briefing on May 11, 2023, and May 12, 2023.  Upon consideration of the briefing, the Court
granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on May 17, 2023.
 
            On July 12,
2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to dismiss the summary judgment.
 
            On August
7, 2023, judgment was entered in favor of Defendants.
 
            Plaintiff’s motion is a procedural
anomaly.  If Plaintiff seeks to oppose
summary judgment, that time has passed. 
The Court considered the parties’ briefing and granted Defendants’ summary
judgment motion on May 17, 2023.  If Plaintiff
seeks an order for reconsideration of the May 17, 2023 ruling, that time has
also passed.  A motion for
reconsideration must be brought within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)  Here,
Plaintiff was served with notice of the May 17, 2023 ruling on the same
day.  Defendants also served Plaintiff
notice of the ruling on May 25, 2023. 
Whether construed as opposition to Defendants’ summary judgment motion
or as a motion for reconsideration, this motion is untimely.[2]
 
            Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
