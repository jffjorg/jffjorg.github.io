MOTIONS
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Thomas
Sands, The Sands Law Group, APLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
On May 16, 2023, Thomas Sands, counsel for Defendants Jadel
Oneida Tejeda, Gor Karapetian, Ara Karapetian, and Narine Petrossian, filed these
Motions to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
The Motions were heard on July 17, 2023.  The Court could not grant the Motions because
they incorrectly indicated that the hearing was to take place in Stanley Mosk
Courthouse at 111 North Hill Street.  Given
the defective notices of motion and that, at the time of the hearing, trial was
scheduled for July 24, 2023, the parties stipulated to continue the trial date
to April 17, 2024, to allow Counsel to address the defect identified in the
Court’s order.
 
The Court notes that Counsel has not filed amended Motions
or proofs of service.  
 
Accordingly, the Motions are CONTINUED to October 25, 2023,
at 1:30 PM.  Counsel is to file amended
Motions and proof of service of the amended Motions no later than 5 court days
before the rescheduled hearing.  The
Court sets an OSC Re: Sanctions of $250 for failure to comply with the Court’s
orders.
 
Moving party to give notice.
