english:
The case number is 21STCV16532 and the hearing date is September 26, 2023. The plaintiff, Martha Ann Presley, is suing the defendants, Walmart Inc. and Cintas Corporation No. 2, for injuries she sustained when she tripped and fell on a floor mat in a Walmart store. The defendants filed an application to continue trial, which was granted in part and denied in part by the court. The trial was continued to September 27, 2023, but discovery and related dates remained tied to the original trial date of June 30, 2023. The defendants served plaintiff with demands for exchange of expert designations on April 11 and April 19, 2023, respectively. Cintas served plaintiff with expert designations on May 11, 2023, but Walmart did not designate any experts. Plaintiff did not serve expert designations.

On June 27, 2023, plaintiff filed an application to continue FSC and trial dates and to extend all related dates, including defendant's motion for summary judgment. When Walmart filed opposition to the application and referenced plaintiff's failure to exchange expert designation, plaintiff's counsel realized for the first time that she failed to timely designate experts. Plaintiff then prepared and served Walmart and Cintas with an expert witness designation on June 30, 2023.

Plaintiff filed a motion for a tardy expert designation, which was denied by the court on July 13, 2023, due to lack of exigency. Plaintiff then filed an application to continue walmart's motion for summary judgment, which was granted in part and denied in part by the court.

The court must grant leave to a party to file a tardy expert designation if all the conditions are met. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.720.) In this case, plaintiff meets all the conditions, and her motion for tardy expert designation is granted. Plaintiff must immediately make her experts available for deposition and pay the costs. Plaintiff is limited to offering one liability expert witness. Defendants Walmart, Inc. and Cintas Corporation No. 2's designation of supplemental and responsive experts and discovery cut-off related thereto shall be tied to the February 8, 2024, trial date.

**Tentative Ruling**
=====================

**Case Number:** 21STCV16532
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Department:** 27

**Judge:** Kerry Bensinger, Department 27

**Case:** Martha Ann Presley v. Walmart, Inc., et al.

**Background:** The plaintiff, Martha Ann Presley, initiated this action against Walmart, Inc. and Cintas Corporation No. 2 for injuries she sustained when she tripped and fell on a floor mat in a Walmart store. The defendants had served the plaintiff with demands for exchange of expert designations, but the plaintiff failed to timely designate experts. The plaintiff has now filed a motion for tardy expert designation.

**Legal Standards:** Any party may demand a mutual and simultaneous exchange of a list containing the name and address of any person whose oral or deposition testimony in the form of an expert opinion any party expects to offer in evidence at the trial. The court may grant leave to submit expert witness information on a later date if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the court has taken into account the extent to which the opposing party has relied on the absence of a list of expert witnesses; (2) the court has determined that any party opposing the motion will not be prejudiced in maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits; (3) the court has determined that the moving party did all of the following: (a) failed to submit the information as the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (b) sought leave to submit the information promptly after learning of the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; and (c) promptly thereafter served a copy of the proposed expert witness information described in Section 2034.260 on all other parties who have appeared in the action.

**Discussion:**

A. Meet and Confer: The plaintiff's counsel has satisfied this requirement.

B. Analysis:

1. Reliance on the Expert Witness List: The court finds that the plaintiff is not entitled to an order relieving her of her waiver to submit an expert witness designation. The defendants failed to designate any experts, and the plaintiff's failure to submit an expert witness designation did not prejudice the defendants.
2. Prejudice: The court finds that the plaintiff has proposed solutions to resolve any potential prejudice to the defendants, including allowing the defendants to designate experts, making two of the plaintiff's experts available for deposition, and paying for the defense depositions of the plaintiff's experts.
3. Excuse: The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated all of the following: (a) failed to submit the information as the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (b) sought leave to submit the information promptly after learning of the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; and (c) promptly thereafter served a copy of the proposed expert witness information described in Section 2034.260 on all other parties who have appeared in the action.

**Conclusion:** The motion for tardy expert designation is granted. The plaintiff must immediately make her experts available for deposition and is responsible for the costs of the depositions. The plaintiff is limited to offering one liability expert witness. The defendants may designate supplemental and responsive experts, and discovery cut-off related thereto shall be tied to the February 8, 2024, trial date.
