english:
The case number is 21STCV16532 and the hearing date is September 26, 2023. The plaintiff, Martha Ann Presley, is suing the defendants, Walmart Inc. and Cintas Corporation No. 2, for injuries she sustained when she tripped and fell on a floor mat in a Walmart store. The defendants filed an application to continue trial, which was granted in part and denied in part by the court. The trial was continued to September 27, 2023, but discovery and related dates remained tied to the original trial date of June 30, 2023. The defendants served plaintiff with demands for exchange of expert designations on April 11 and April 19, 2023, respectively. Cintas served plaintiff with expert designations on May 11, 2023, but Walmart did not designate any experts. Plaintiff did not serve expert designations.

On June 27, 2023, plaintiff filed an application to continue FSC and trial dates and to extend all related dates, including defendant's motion for summary judgment. When Walmart filed opposition to the application and referenced plaintiff's failure to exchange expert designation, plaintiff's counsel realized for the first time that she failed to timely designate experts. Plaintiff then prepared and served Walmart and Cintas with an expert witness designation on June 30, 2023.

Plaintiff filed a motion for a tardy expert designation, which was denied by the court on July 13, 2023, due to lack of exigency. Plaintiff then filed an application to continue walmart's motion for summary judgment, which was granted in part and denied in part by the court.

The court must grant leave to a party to file a tardy expert designation if all the conditions are met. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.720.) In this case, plaintiff meets all the conditions, and her motion for tardy expert designation is granted. Plaintiff must immediately make her experts available for deposition and pay the costs. Plaintiff is limited to offering one liability expert witness. Defendants Walmart, Inc. and Cintas Corporation No. 2's designation of supplemental and responsive experts and discovery cut-off related thereto shall be tied to the February 8, 2024, trial date.
