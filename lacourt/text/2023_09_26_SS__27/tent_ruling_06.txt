CASE:                                Ivan Mendez v. Tessa Nicole Vaughn
 
CASE NO.:                 21STCV24748
 





















 
MOTION
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Tessa Vaughn
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On July 28, 2023, Defendant, Tessa Vaughn, filed this motion
to compel Plaintiff, Ivan Mendez,[1]
to provide responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two.  Defendant does not seek sanctions. 
 
The motion is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
DISCOVERY
 
If a party to
whom interrogatories were directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  Failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)   
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendant served
Plaintiff with the Special Interrogatories, Set Two, on February 24, 2023.  Having not received responses, Defense counsel
met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel and provided a courtesy extension to
provide responses.  Plaintiff’s prior
counsel later filed a motion to be relieved as counsel, which the Court granted
on June 14, 2023.  To date, Plaintiff has
not provided responses.  (See Kahen Decl.) 
Therefore, all objections to the interrogatories are waived.  
 
As Defendant
properly served the discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to serve responses,
the Court finds Defendant is entitled to an order directing Plaintiff to
provide responses to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories, Set Two. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motion is granted.  
 
Plaintiff Ivan Mendez is ordered to provide verified,
objection-free responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two,
within 30 days of this order. .
 
Moving party to give notice.
