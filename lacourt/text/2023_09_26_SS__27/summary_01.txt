And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Edik Minassian v. Jadel Oneida Tejeda, et al. (Case No. 19STCV18995). The case involves a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Thomas Sands, counsel for the defendants. The motion was heard on July 17, 2023, but was continued due to defective notices of motion. The parties stipulated to continue the trial date to April 17, 2024, to allow counsel to address the defects. The judge notes that counsel has not filed amended motions or proof of service as required. As a result, the motions are continued to October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM, and counsel is ordered to file amended motions and proof of service no later than 5 court days before the rescheduled hearing. The judge also sets an OSC (Order to Show Cause) Re: Sanctions of $250 for failure to comply with the court's orders.
