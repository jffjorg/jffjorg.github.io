## English Summary

Judge Kerry Bensinger's tentative ruling addresses Thomas Sands' motions to be relieved as counsel for four defendants in the case of Edik Minassian v. Jadel Oneida Tejeda, et al.  

The motions were initially heard on July 17, 2023, but could not be granted due to errors in the notices.  Trial, originally scheduled for July 24, 2023, was continued to April 17, 2024, to allow Sands to correct the notice issues.

However, Sands has not yet filed the amended motions or proof of service.  Therefore, the judge is continuing the motions hearing to October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM. Sands must file the amended motions and proof of service by October 20, 2023.

The judge also issued an Order to Show Cause (OSC) for sanctions of $250 if Sands fails to comply with the court's orders.
