And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Jaleel Melendez's motion to dismiss the summary judgment granted in favor of Defendants Pinetree Terrace Apartments and Mabry Management Co., Inc. The motion is a procedural anomaly as it was filed after the time to oppose the summary judgment motion had passed. The Court had previously granted the summary judgment motion on May 17, 2023, and Plaintiff was served with notice of the ruling on the same day. The motion is therefore untimely and is denied. The Court notes that the parties' briefing was considered and the summary judgment motion was granted based on the lack of opposition.
