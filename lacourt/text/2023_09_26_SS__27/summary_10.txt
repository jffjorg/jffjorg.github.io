And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling, written by Judge Kerry Bensinger, pertains to the case of Jaleel Melendez vs. Pinetree Terrace Apartments and Mabry Management Co., Inc. (Case No. BC692559). The plaintiff, Jaleel Melendez, initiated the action on February 1, 2018, after slipping and falling on the common area staircase of the defendants' premises. The plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on April 17, 2018, asserting causes of action for general negligence and premises liability.

The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on January 12, 2023, which was heard on May 5, 2023. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion but appeared at the hearing and presented evidence. The court continued the hearing to consider the narrow question of whether presentation of evidence during oral argument can defeat a summary judgment motion when a separate statement of disputed facts had not been filed in opposition.

After considering additional briefing from the parties, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on May 17, 2023. The plaintiff then filed a motion to dismiss the summary judgment on July 12, 2023, which the court deemed a procedural anomaly. The court ruled that the plaintiff's motion was untimely, as it was filed after the deadline for opposing the summary judgment motion or seeking reconsideration of the previous ruling.

The court denied the plaintiff's motion, stating that the time for opposing the summary judgment or seeking reconsideration had passed. The court ordered the moving party to give notice, and the parties were instructed to submit their intentions to the court via email if they wished to submit on the tentative ruling.
