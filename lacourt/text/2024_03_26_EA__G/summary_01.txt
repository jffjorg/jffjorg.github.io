And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the plaintiff's application for default judgment against the defendant, pending the plaintiff's filing of proof of service of the unredacted expert report of Dr. Joseph Smith on the defendant's counsel. The case involves allegations of trade secret misappropriation and threats made by the defendant against the plaintiff. The plaintiff had previously filed several applications for default judgment, which were denied, but has now provided additional evidence and expert testimony to support its claims. The judge has found that the plaintiff's application for default judgment is now sufficient and grants it tentatively, subject to the plaintiff's compliance with the conditions set forth in the ruling.
