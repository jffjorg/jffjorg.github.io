English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a hearing scheduled for March 26, 2024. The case involves a lawsuit filed by Kelly Chu and Ken Chu against Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center (PVHMC) alleging dependent adult abuse and neglect. The lawsuit stems from an incident in which PVHMC staff utilized a sequential compression device on Kelly Chu, who suffered a stroke, and failed to monitor her skin condition after using the device, allegedly causing a medical device-related pressure injury. PVHMC has filed a demurrer and motion to strike, arguing that the allegations in the complaint do not state a cause of action. The court has sustained PVHMC's demurrer and granted its motion to strike, finding that the allegations in the complaint do not constitute egregious abuse or neglect as required by the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (EADACPA). The court has also denied the Chus' request for attorney fees and punitive damages.
