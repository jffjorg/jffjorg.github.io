And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nicholas Muso, et al. v. Sevadham Management, LP, et al. The Plaintiff, Nicholas Muso, had moved for terminating sanctions against the Defendant, Sevadham Management, LP, alleging that Sevadham had failed to comply with discovery orders.

The Judge denied the motion for terminating sanctions, finding that Sevadham's failures to comply with its discovery obligations were not willful or intentional. The Judge accepted Sevadham's counsel's explanation that his personal and family medical issues had disrupted his law practice and caused the delay in responding to discovery requests.

The Judge ordered Sevadham to comply with its discovery obligations within 30 days and to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days. The Judge did not find that terminating sanctions were warranted at this time, as Sevadham's counsel's personal and family medical issues appeared to be the sole cause of the disruption to his law practice.
