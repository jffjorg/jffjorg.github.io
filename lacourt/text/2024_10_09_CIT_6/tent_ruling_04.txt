TENTATIVE
RULING 
The Court DENIES the motion of Mia Hong to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff without prejudice. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of
service of same within five calendar days. 
BACKGROUND 
This is a personal injury action. On April 12, 2024, plaintiff
April Ayala (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Gisselle Moreno,
Benito Moreno Baltazar, and Does 1 through 50, alleging the sole cause of
action for negligence. On June 7, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed defendant Benito
Moreno Baltazar from this action without prejudice. 
On September 6, 2024, Mia Hong of Karns & Karns, LLP moved to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. The motion is unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
The Court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 403-407.) 
A motion to
be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of
Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite
forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that have appeared in
the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
Mia
Hong of Karns & Karns, LLP (Counsel) seeks to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff. Counsel contends there has been a communication breakdown between
Counsel and Plaintiff, that Plaintiff’s boyfriend at one point called Counsel’s
office stating that Plaintiff did not want to be represented by Counsel, and
that Counsel has attempted to effect a substitution but to no avail. (Hong Decl.,
¶ 2.) 
The Court finds sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal here.
Grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation include the
client’s conduct that, “renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to
carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of Professional
Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) A breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship is also grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate
of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) Counsel has also submitted
the application, declaration, and proposed order on Judicial Council forms
MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c),
(e).) 
However, the Court notes there is no proof of service of the
moving papers on Plaintiff. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) While
Counsel indicates having been unable to confirm Plaintiff’s current address,
Counsel still must attempt to effect service. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subd. (d); Hong Decl., ¶ 3, subds. (b), (c).) Moreover, the proposed
order is almost entirely incomplete. (Proposed Order (9/6/24).) Counsel must
submit a completed proposed order, which would be effective upon the filing of
the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. 
Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the motion of Mia Hong to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff without prejudice. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of
service of same within five calendar days.
