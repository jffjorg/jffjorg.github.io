And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Mia Hong, counsel for plaintiff April Ayala, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion is unopposed, but the court notes that there is no proof of service of the moving papers on the plaintiff. Counsel must attempt to effect service and submit a completed proposed order. The court orders counsel to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service within five calendar days. The ruling is based on the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the client's conduct, which renders it difficult for counsel to carry out representation effectively.
