21STCV24174
Defendant’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff
 
Tentative
Motion is granted. The request for sanctions is
granted in part.
Background
On June 29, 2021, Daniel Gomez (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint Andrew Gutierrez (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 for motor
vehicle negligence arising out of an accident on July 1, 2019.
 
On October 9, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
 
On December 5, 2024, Defendant filed
the motion to compel the deposition and production of documents of Plaintiff. No
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
On October 9,
2023, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for February 7, 2024; the
deposition was taken off-calendar due to delayed responses to written
discovery. (Hakopian Decl., ¶¶ 2, 4.) On February 6, 2024, Defendant served the
amended noticed of taking Plaintiff’s deposition set for April 30, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 6.) On May 6, 2024, Defendant served a notice for taking Plaintiff’s
deposition for June 10, 2024. (Id., ¶ 8.) On July 2, 2024, Defendant
served the third notice for taking Plaintiff’s deposition for July 23, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 13.) On September 19, 2024, Defendant served the fourth noticed for taking
Plaintiff’s deposition for October 16, 2024. (Id., ¶ 18.) On November 8,
2024, Defendant served the fifth notice of taking Plaintiff’s deposition set for
November 26, 2024. (Id.¸¶¶ 23, 24.) Plaintiff has yet to appear for
deposition. 
 
The Court finds Defendant
has properly noticed Plaintiff’s deposition multiple times; Plaintiff has
failed to proceed with it. Plaintiff has also not filed any objections to the
deposition or the attached request for production.  
 
Accordingly, the
motion to compel Plaintiff’s attendance for deposition and to provide responses
to the request for production is GRANTED.
 
The request for
sanctions is granted in part.  The Court
sets sanctions in the amount of $861.99, based on two hours of attorney time,
multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $160.17 per hour, plus one
hour of legal assistant time at a reasonable billing rate of $75 per hour, plus
$406.65 in court reporter fees and a $60 filing fee. (See Hakopian Decl., ¶ 32.)
