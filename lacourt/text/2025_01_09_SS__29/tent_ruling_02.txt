Background
On June 16, 2021, Laurie Cohen and Mark Cohen
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against White Gloves Logistics
Inc. dba Luca’s Logistics, Waiel Luca Elbyr (collectively “Defendants”), and
Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of action for negligence, negligent
hiring, supervision, and retention, and conversion arising out of property
damage in connection with a move on September 21, 2020.
On August 17, 2021, Defendants filed an
answer to the complaint.
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”).  On June 11
and 18, 2024, Defendants filed answers to the FAC.
On December 4, 2024, Defendants filed these two
motions to compel. 
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See Id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) 
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On September 3, 2024, Defendants
served Plaintiffs with Special Interrogatories (Set Two), and Requests for
Production of Documents (Set Three). (Wilson Decls., ¶ 4; Exhs. B.) Plaintiffs
served unverified responses on October 7, 2024, and Plaintiffs’ counsel (new
counsel who recently substituted in) has been unresponsive to requests for
verifications. (Id., ¶¶ 5, 7.)
 
Defendants move to compel
responses.  No opposition has been filed.
 
Responses to interrogatories and
requests for production must be verified. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.250 & 2031.250.)  Unverified responses are tantamount to no
response at all.  Accordingly, the motions
to compel are granted.  
 
The requests for sanctions are
denied.  In the chapters of the Civil
Discovery Act governing interrogatories and requests for production, sanctions
may be awarded in connection with a motion to compel initial responses “against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290
& 2031.300.)  Here, Plaintiffs have
not opposed the motion.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS the motions to
compel.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiffs Laurie
Cohen and Mark Cohen to serve verified written responses to Defendants’ Special
Interrogatories (Set Two) within 10 days of notice.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiffs Laurie
Cohen and Mark Cohen to serve verified written responses to Defendants’ Requests
for Production (Set Three) within 10 days of notice.
 
The Court DENIES Defendants’ requests
for sanctions.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
