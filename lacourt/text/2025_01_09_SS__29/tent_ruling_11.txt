Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Defendant Zhores Markaryan’s Counsel
Bradley J. Yourist.
 
Tentative
Motion is granted.
Background
On September 30, 2022, Alexis Naber (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Zhores Markaryan (“Markaryan”) and Granada Hookah Lounge (“GHL”)
for intentional tort and general negligence causes of action arising out of an
altercation on February 16, 2022.
 
On July 31 2023, default was entered against both
Defendants. On January 25, 2024, a stipulation to vacate the default as to GHL
was filed. On April 2, 2024, a stipulation to vacate the default as to
Markaryan was filed.
 
On January 30, 2024, GHL filed an answer.
 
On May 6, 2024, Markaryan filed an answer.
 
On December 5,
2024, Bradley J. Yourist (“Counsel”) filed
this motion to be relieved as counsel for Markaryan. No opposition has been
filed.
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration and Order on December 5, 2024. Counsel represents
there has been a material breakdown in the attorney client relationship.
Counsel verified Markaryan’s current address by conversation. Service of this
motion was made on all parties in addition to Markaryan.
The Court finds
Counsel has met all substantive and procedural requirements. The motion is GRANTED.

Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED. The order is effective upon filing with the
Court a proof of service showing service of the signed order (not just the
minute order) on the clients.
The Judicial
Assistant is directed to modify the proposed order to reflect that the future
hearings in this matter are in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
Moving counsel
is ordered to give notice.
