And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court will consider the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests (Set One) and will ask counsel to discuss several issues. The court is concerned about the defendant's failure to attend the discovery conference (IDC) on December 6, 2024, and believes that most issues could have been resolved through the IDC process. The court also wants to know if the defendant served verified responses to the discovery requests on December 26, 2024, and if there are any issues with these responses. The court notes that plaintiff has suspicions about the verifications and suggests that any issues regarding the verifications could be addressed through the deposition of the defendant. The court also wants to know if the defendant plans to bring a motion to relieve the waiver of objections and why it hasn't been filed yet. Finally, the court is unsure about the basis for awarding sanctions to the plaintiff if the defendant resolves all or most of the issues before the hearing.
