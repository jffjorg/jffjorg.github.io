And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was sought primarily to obtain a court order to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Harrison. Defendant had filed three motions to compel this deposition, but failed to appear at the hearing for the third motion. The judge notes that the issues relating to the deposition of Plaintiff Harrison, which were the basis for the last trial continuance, do not establish good cause for yet another trial continuance. The judge has considered all relevant facts and circumstances, including the proximity of the trial date, the availability of alternative means to address the problem, and the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance. The judge has concluded that Defendant has not shown good cause for a continuance and has denied the motion.
