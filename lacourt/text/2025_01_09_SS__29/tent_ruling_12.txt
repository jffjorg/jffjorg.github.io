 Case Number:  22STCV37222    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  29 Henderson v. City of Los Angeles
22STCV37222
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.  The Court cannot grant relief as against a party
who has died.
Background
On November 28, 2022, Patricia Henderson (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“City”), Richard Garcia, and
Does 1 through 10, asserting a cause of action for motor vehicle negligence arising
out of an accident on February 21, 2022. 
 
On January 26, 2023, Plaintiff died.
 
On April 10, 2024, City filed an answer. 
 
On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff and City filed a
stipulation to continue trial, which the Court granted.  Among the reasons for the continuance cited
by the parties was the death of Plaintiff; the efforts of Plaintiff’s counsel
to have a personal representative appointed; and the need to file an amended
complaint.
 
On August 28, 2024, City served Plaintiff’s counsel with form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production.  (Valadez Decl., ¶ 5 & Exhs. C-F.)  On October 30, Plaintiff’s counsel served
responses verified by Arvinola Scott, the administrator of Plaintiff’s
estate.  (Id., ¶ 6 & Exhs. G-J.)
 
On November 22, 2024, City filed this motion to compel
Plaintiff to respond to the written discovery requests. 
 
Administrator. Scott filed an opposition on December 26.
 
No reply has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not
provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See Id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
A party
must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
 
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
 
Discussion
 
City
seeks to compel Plaintiff to its Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One).
Plaintiff
has died.  The Court does not have the
power to order a dead person to respond to discovery.
 
Accordingly,
the motion is denied.

Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES City’s motion to compel.
 
The Court further advises City that it should not purport
to combine, into a single motion, motions to compel three separate discovery
requests.  Although in no way part of the
basis for this ruling, City is informed that, in the future, a separate motion
to compel must be filed for each set of discovery requests. 
 
Moving
Party is to give notice.
