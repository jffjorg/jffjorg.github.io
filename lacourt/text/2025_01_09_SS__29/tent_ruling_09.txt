 Case Number:  22STCV20863    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  29 Chavez v. Tuggle
22STCV20863
Defendant’s Motion to Continue 
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On June 27, 2022, Plaintiffs Jennifer Chavez and Johnish
Harrison (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint against Jacqueline
Tuggle (“Defendant”), Keishia Caldwell, and Does 1 through 50, for negligence.
 
On October 30, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. On December 27, 2023,
Defendant filed a cross-complaint against Jennifer Chavez. On May 8, 2024, the
cross-complaint was dismissed.
 
On November 27, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to
continue this matter. 
No opposition has been filed.
On filing, the case was assigned a trial date of December
26, 2023.  In December 2023, on Defendant’s
motion, the Court continued trial to April 18, 2024.  In February 2024, on the stipulation of the
parties, the Court continued trial to November 4, 2024.  In September 2024, on Defendant’s motion, the
Court continued trial to February 7, 2025.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Defendant seeks to
continue trial based primarily on the need to obtain a court order to compel
the deposition of Plaintiff Harrison.  (Motion,
at p.3; Goodwin Decl., ¶ 9.)  But Defendant
first filed a motion to compel this deposition on August 6, 2024; the motion
was set for hearing on September 10 and was taken off calendar by
Defendant.  Defendant filed another
motion to compel this deposition on October 2, 2024; the motion was set for
hearing on November 5 and was again taken off calendar by Defendant.  Defendant filed a third motion to compel this
deposition on November 27; the motion was set for hearing on December 19, but
Defendant failed to appear and the Court placed the motion off calendar.
Thus, it appears
to the Court that one of two things must be true: either the dispute regarding
the deposition of Plaintiff Harrison has been resolved, or Defendant is not acting
diligently in seeking a court order for the deposition to be taken.  In either event, the issues relating to the
deposition of Plaintiff Harrison – which were the very issues that provided a
basis for the last trial continuance – do not establish good cause for yet
another trial continuance.
Defendant has not
shown good cause.  The motion is denied.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to
continue trial. 
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
