Defendant’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted. The request for sanctions
is granted.
Background
On April 13, 2022, Hector Castillo (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Kaifa Best (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 20 for
negligence, negligence per se (Vehicle Code section 22450), negligence per se (Vehicle
Code section 22350), and statutory liability arising out of an accident on
April 13, 2020. 
 
On January 8, 2024, Defendant filed her answer.
 
On November 22, 2024, Defendant filed
this motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“Any party may obtain discovery … by taking
in California the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the
action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)  Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the requirements for
(among other things) what must be included in a deposition notice, when and
where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice must be
served. 
“The service of a deposition notice … is
effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party to attend and to testify, as
well as to produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing for inspection and copying.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section 2025.410, subdivision (a), requires
any party to serve a written objection at least three days before the
deposition if the party contends that a deposition notice does not comply with
the provisions of sections 2025.210 through 2025.280.
Section 2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under
Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for¿inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” 
Any such motion to compel must show good
cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has failed to
appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).) 
When a motion to compel is granted, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act,
section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process”
to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the
discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of
“the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On January 5,
2024, Defendant served a deposition notice for Plaintiff, which was later taken
off-calendar. (Michaelson Decl. ¶ 3, 4.) On June 21, 2024, Defendant served
another notice of deposition, set for July 18, 2024. (Id. ¶ 7, Exh. C.) Plaintiff
did not appear for the July 18, 2024 deposition. (Id., ¶ 8.) Defense
counsel reached out to Plaintiff’s attorney about alternative dates but did not
receive any. (Id., ¶ 10.)
 
The Court finds Defendant
properly noticed Plaintiff’s deposition, that Plaintiff did not serve objections,
and that Plaintiff failed to appear.
 
Accordingly, the
motion to compel Plaintiff’s for deposition is GRANTED.
 
The request for
sanctions is granted.  The Court sets sanctions
in the requested amount of $610.70, calculated based on two hours of attorney
time multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $200 per hour, plus a $150.70
non-appearance fee and a $60 filing fee. ( Michaelson Decl., ¶ 11.)
