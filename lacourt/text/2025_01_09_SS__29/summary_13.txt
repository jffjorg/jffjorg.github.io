Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by Otis Elevator Company and Pacific Coast Elevator Corporation is overruled. The judge found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state causes of action against the defendants, and that the use of Doe pleading under Code of Civil Procedure section 474 is proper. The judge also found that the complaint is not incomprehensible and can be clarified under modern discovery procedures. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff had actual knowledge of their identities prior to filing the complaint, and therefore the use of Doe pleading was improper, but the judge rejected this argument. The case will proceed to the next stage, where the parties will engage in discovery and potentially file additional pleadings.
