```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of cross-defendant Anthony Cruz to set aside the entry of default. The default was entered against Cruz on December 22, 2022, but Cruz filed an answer to the cross-complaint on December 29, 2022, and the parties have been conducting discovery and litigating based on the assumption that Cruz was not in default. The judge finds that the unusual circumstances of the case, including the fact that Cruz filed an answer to the cross-complaint more than two years ago, and the strong public policy in favor of resolution of disputes on the merits, support granting the motion. The default is set aside, and the answer to the cross-complaint remains on file.
