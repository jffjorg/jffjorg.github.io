## English Summary

The judge denied Plaintiff Stewart Lucas Murrey's motion to authorize third-party discovery to identify the defendants in his case.  

The judge found the motion defective because Murrey:

* **Did not specify the discovery he sought**: He did not provide the court with a subpoena or other discovery requests aimed at Facebook.
* **Did not clearly identify the individuals he wanted to discover**: His complaint lists 10 named defendants, 50 potential Doe defendants, and claims Facebook and its administrators/moderators are defendants. He also mentions numerous other women and Facebook moderators in his declaration without specifying who he wants to discover.
* **Did not attempt to notify defendants**:  Before seeking discovery of anonymous defendants, a plaintiff must make reasonable efforts to notify them of the request. Murrey did not attempt to do this.

The judge emphasized that in cases involving anonymous speech, the plaintiff must first demonstrate that the speech is actionable before being allowed to discover the speaker's identity.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to authorize third-party discovery to identify defendants who made anonymous statements about him on Facebook groups. The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is defective because he has not presented the court with the discovery documents he seeks to use, nor has he notified the defendants of his attempts to secure their information. The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint lists 10 individual defendants, 50 potential Doe defendants, and Facebook itself as defendants, making it unclear who the plaintiff is seeking to identify. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not shown that discovery is necessary to identify some of the defendants, and that the potential scope of the discovery is incredibly broad. The judge cites the case of Glassdoor, Inc. v. Superior Court (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 623, which holds that a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that the speech in question is actionable before being allowed to discover the speaker's identity.

English text summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Stewart Lucas Murrey's motion for limited third-party discovery to identify Defendants. The Judge finds the motion defective due to Plaintiff's failure to clearly specify the discovery sought, failure to attempt notifying Defendants of the discovery, and unnecessary discovery for some individuals. Plaintiff's case arises from statements made in Facebook groups accusing him of being involved in his ex-wife's murder, vexatious litigation, and unpleasant conduct. The Judge cites California law requiring Plaintiff to make a prima facie showing that the speech in question is actionable before seeking to discover the speaker's identity. The Judge also notes that if the Defendant has not received notice of the attempt to lift the shield of anonymity, the Plaintiff must make reasonable efforts to provide such notice.
