And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied plaintiff Cedric L. Price's motion for the appointment of a receiver to manage two properties, located in Woodland Hills and Los Angeles, which were purchased through forgeries perpetrated by defendant Jarrell Davis. The judge found that Price has not made a sufficient showing of entitlement to a receiver, as there is no evidence that the properties are subject to waste or deterioration. The judge also noted that Price has not articulated the harm that would be suffered from the waste of the properties, and that the request for a receiver is ill-supported and founded on speculation. The judge further noted that the appointment of a receiver is a drastic and costly remedy that should be exercised sparingly and with caution.
