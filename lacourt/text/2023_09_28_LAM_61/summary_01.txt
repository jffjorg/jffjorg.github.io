The judge found that Price has not made a sufficient showing of entitlement to a receiver, as there is no evidence that the properties are subject to waste or deterioration. The judge also noted that Price has not articulated the harm that would be suffered from the waste of the properties, and that the request for a receiver is ill-supported and founded on speculation. The judge further noted that the appointment of a receiver is a drastic and costly remedy that should be exercised sparingly and with caution.

**English Summary:**

The judge has denied Plaintiff Cedric Price's motion to appoint a receiver for two properties.  Price alleges that Defendant Jarrell Davis fraudulently purchased the properties in Price's name and transferred them to a trust he controls. Price sought a receiver to manage the properties and potentially sell them, arguing that avoiding waste would partially offset his damages.  

However, the judge found Price's request unsubstantiated, noting that he lacked evidence of waste or deterioration and failed to articulate the harm that would result. The judge emphasized that appointing a receiver is a drastic measure, to be used only when necessary and other remedies are inadequate.  Since Price's request was based on speculation, the motion was denied.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion for appointment of a receiver to manage two properties, located on 5096 Llano Drive in Woodland Hills and 1836 Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles, which are the subject of this litigation. The plaintiff, Cedric L. Price, had requested the appointment of a receiver, Danielle Brinkman, to collect rents and potentially sell the properties, with the proceeds to be held in escrow or interpleaded pending the resolution of this litigation. However, the Judge found that Price had not made a sufficient showing of entitlement to a receiver, and that the appointment of a receiver would be a drastic and costly remedy that is not necessary in this case. The Judge also noted that Price had not presented any evidence that the properties are subject to waste or deterioration, and that the request for a receiver is based on speculation. The defendants, Coldwell Banker and Shayan Ghalari, had offered a conditional opposition to the motion, seeking conditions that any receiver appointed not be permitted to hire an attorney, that the receiver be solely paid by Price, and that Coldwell Banker and Ghalari be permitted to raise Plaintiff's failure to mitigate damages by delaying the bringing of this receivership motion. The Judge's denial of the motion means that the properties will not be placed under the management of a receiver at this time.
