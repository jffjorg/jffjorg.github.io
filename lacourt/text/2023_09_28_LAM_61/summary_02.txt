And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to strike the complaint filed by Plaintiff Plentiude Transportation, Inc. against Defendants SSA Terminals, LLC, SSA Terminals (Pier A), Pacific Maritime Services, LLC, and Frank Hall. The defendants argued that the complaint was filed without the notice of related case required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.300 and in violation of the court's order entered on March 1, 2023, directing that no further pleadings be filed prior to adjudication of the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The judge found that the relation of the cases was a foregone conclusion given the same factual allegations and the defendants' obvious knowledge of same. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's tactics, including dismissing the original action and filing a new complaint, were likely intended to file a new pleading with new attorneys who possessed no conflicts, rather than to evade the court's order. As a result, the judge found that striking the pleading was not warranted and denied the motion to strike.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendants' motion to strike the complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Plentiude Transportation, Inc. The Defendants, SSA Terminals, LLC, SSA Terminals (Pier A), Pacific Maritime Services, LLC, and Frank Hall, had argued that the complaint was filed without the required notice of related case and in violation of a prior court order. However, the Judge found that striking the complaint would accomplish little, as the cases have already been deemed related. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's decision to dismiss the prior action and file a new one was likely due to the discovery of conflicted counsel, rather than an attempt to obtain a new judge or evade the court's order. The motion to strike is therefore denied.
