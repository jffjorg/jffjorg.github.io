MOTION TO
VACATE DEFAULT
 
Motion filed on 5/10/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Fawn M. Grant
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff LCS Capital, LLC
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
vacating the default entered on 11/15/23 against Defendant Fawn M. Grant. 

 
RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 10/4/23, Plaintiff LCS Capital, LLC (Plaintiff) filed
this action against Defendants Fawn M. Grant (Grant) and Richard Renken
(Renken) (collectively, Defendants) for breach of contract.  On 10/15/23, Grant was personally served with
the summons and complaint in this matter. 
(See Proof of Service filed 11/15/23).  On 11/15/23, default was entered against
Grant.  On 11/20/23, while represented by
their former counsel, Defendants filed a joint answer to the complaint.
 
On 3/19/24, Defendants substituted in their current
counsel.  Unaware that default had been
entered against Grant, thereafter, Defendants filed a Motion for Leave to Amend
Answer which is scheduled for hearing on 10/2/24 and a Motion to Compel
Arbitration which is scheduled for hearing on 10/3/24.
 
Grant did not become aware of the default entered against
her until 3/27/24 when Plaintiff’s counsel informed Grant’s current counsel in
an email.  (Grant Decl.; Michel Decl.).  Since Defendants had just served a 30-day
notice of intent to arbitrate pursuant to the contract, Grant waited to file
and serve the instant motion.  (Grant
Decl.; Michel Decl.).  There was an
additional delay because of a family medical emergency experienced by Grant’s
counsel.  (Michel Decl.).
 
Thereafter, on 5/10/24, Grant filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order vacating the default entered on 11/15/23
against Defendant Fawn M. Grant.  The
motion was originally scheduled for hearing on 12/27/24, but was advanced,
pursuant to Grant’s ex parte application, to 8/19/24.  (See 7/11/24 Minute Order).  Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court may vacate a default and default judgment
entered as a result of a defendant’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
excusable neglect, if the motion is made within a reasonable time, not
exceeding 6 months from the entry of default, and the motion is accompanied by
a copy of the pleading the defendant proposes to file upon the setting aside of
the default.  See CCP 473(b).  
 
The Court finds that Grant has made a sufficient showing
that the default was entered as a result of her mistake, inadvertence, surprise
and/or excusable neglect and the motion was made within a reasonable time (and
less than 6 months after the entry of the default) after Grant learned of same
and based on other relevant circumstances. 
(See Grant Decl.; Michel Decl.). 
Grant has also provided a copy of her proposed (first amended) answer to
the complaint.  (See Grant Decl.,
Ex.A).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
The Court notes that the pleading Grant proposes to file is actually and
First Amended Answer to the Complaint made on behalf of Grant and Renken.  (See Grant Decl., Ex.A).  Since Renken is not in default the original Answer
filed on 11/20/23 is still operative as to him and a Court order would be
required to allow the filing of an amended answer by Renken.  
 
At the hearing, the Court will discuss with counsel whether
Plaintiff is willing to stipulate to allow the First Amended Answer to be filed
on behalf of both Grant and Renken at this time.  If not, Grant will be ordered to separately file
a revised answer to the complaint on behalf of herself only and Renken will
have to proceed with the motion to amend answer.
