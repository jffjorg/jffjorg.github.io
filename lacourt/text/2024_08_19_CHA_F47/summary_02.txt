And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the default entered against her on November 15, 2023. The default was entered due to the defendant's mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect, and the motion was filed within a reasonable time after the defendant became aware of the default. The defendant has provided a copy of her proposed first amended answer to the complaint, which will need to be filed if the default is vacated. The judge notes that the original answer filed by the defendants on November 20, 2023, is still operative as to the other defendant, Richard Renken, and a separate order would be required to allow the filing of an amended answer on his behalf. The judge will discuss with counsel at the hearing whether the plaintiff is willing to stipulate to allow the first amended answer to be filed on behalf of both defendants, or if the defendant will need to file a revised answer separately.
