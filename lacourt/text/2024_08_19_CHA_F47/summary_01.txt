And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has placed the motion to quash or limit the scope of the deposition subpoenas off calendar due to several defects. The most significant issue is that the evidence does not establish that the Plaintiff had notice of the 8/19/24 hearing date, and there is no response to the motion by the Plaintiff to cure this defect. Additionally, the motion filed and served on the Plaintiff on 6/11/24 indicated a hearing date of 2/25/25, and the Notice of Non-Opposition filed on 8/12/24 did not provide the required notice to the Plaintiff. Furthermore, the motion improperly combined three separate motions into one, and the counsel for the parties failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the declaration filed in support of the motion as required by the California Rules of Court. As a result, the motion is placed off calendar.
