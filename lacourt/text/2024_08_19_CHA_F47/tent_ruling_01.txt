CONSOLIDATED MOTION
TO QUASH CIVIL SUBPOENAS
 
Motion filed on 6/11/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Walmart, Inc. and The Clorox
Company
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Valeria Segoviano Hernandez
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
quashing or appropriately limiting the scope of the Deposition Subpoenas for
Production of Business Records (the Subpoenas) issued by Plaintiff Valeria
Segoviano Hernandez (Plaintiff) to the California Division of Occupational
Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA), the California Highway Patrol Los Angeles and the
Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department.
 

RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.        
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of an incident that occurred on
5/25/20 at a Walmart located in Stevenson Ranch, California.  On that date at the Walmart, Plaintiff
Valeria Segoviano Hernandez  (Plaintiff)
grabbed a bottle of Clorox bleach from the top shelf.  Plaintiff claims that the cap on the bottle
was not secured causing it to spill all over her right arm causing her injury
and permanent scarring.  
 
Plaintiff’s operative Third Amended Complaint against
Defendant Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and Defendant The Clorox Company (Clorox),
filed on 1/10/24, contains causes of action for: (1) Strict Liability – Design
Defect (against Walmart, Clorox and Does 1-25), (2) Negligence – Failure to
Recall (against Clorox and Does 1-25) and (3) Negligence (against Clorox,
Walmart and Does 1-25).
 
On 5/23/24, Plaintiff served Defendants with three
subpoenas directed to: (1) California Division of Occupational Safety and
Health (Cal/OSHA), (2) the California Highway Patrol Los Angeles, and (3) the
LA Sheriff’s Department (the Subpoenas). 
(Manetti Decl., Ex.A).  The
Subpoenas each have a production deadline of 6/17/24.  Id. 
On 5/31/24, Walmart and Clorox (collectively, Defendants) served
Plaintiff and the subpoenaing entity with objections to the Subpoenas.  (Id., Ex.B, C).   Defendants’ counsel also sent meet and
confer letters to Plaintiff’s counsel asking them to withdraw or correct the
Subpoenas.  Plaintiff rejected
Defendants’ objections and did not respond to the meet and confer letters.  (Id., Ex.D).
 
On 6/11/24, Defendants filed and served the instant “consolidated
motion” seeking an order  quashing or
appropriately limiting the scope of the Deposition Subpoenas for Production of
Business Records (the Subpoenas) issued by Plaintiff Valeria Segoviano
Hernandez (Plaintiff) to the California Division of Occupational Safety and
Health (Cal/OSHA), the California Highway Patrol Los Angeles and the Los
Angeles Sheriff’s Department.  The motion
was originally scheduled for hearing on 2/25/25.  On 6/28/24, Defendants rescheduled the
hearing to 8/19/24.  No opposition or
other response to the motion has been filed. 
On 8/12/24, Defendants filed and served a Notice of Non-Opposition to
the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Several defects in the motion warrant taking the matter
off calendar.
 
Most importantly, the evidence before the Court does not
establish that Plaintiff had notice of the 8/19/24 hearing date and there is no
response to the motion by Plaintiff to cure this defect.  The motion filed and served on Plaintiff on
6/11/24 indicated a hearing date of 2/25/25. 
There is no evidence in the Court’s file (eCourt) that after Defendants
rescheduled the hearing on the motion to 8/19/24 that they provided notice of
the new hearing date to Plaintiff (i.e., A notice of new hearing date was not
filed).  While Defendants did serve
Plaintiff with the Notice of Non-Opposition on 8/12/24, that notice did not
provide Plaintiff with the requisite 16 court days, plus 2 court days, notice
required when a motion is electronically served.  See CCP 1005(b); CCP 1010.6(a)(3)(B).  Moreover, the Notice of Non-Opposition incorrectly
lists the hearing date as “8/19/25,” not 8/19/24.  (See Notice of Non-Opposition filed
8/12/24).
 
Additionally, Defendants have improperly combined/consolidated
what should be three motions into one. 
The motion addresses three different subpoenas served on three different
entities.  As such, three separate
motions should have been filed.  While
the issues and arguments in the motion may be similar, it cannot be determined
whether opposition arguments would be similar, thereby causing undue burden on
Plaintiff by being limited to 15 pages in opposing one motion (if Plaintiff had
proper notice of same and chose to oppose it) which should have been three and
on the Court by overbooking its law and motion calendar (i.e., reserving one
motion when it should have been three).
 
Further, Defendants’ counsel has, again, failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the declaration filed in
support of the motion as required by CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel for the parties have previously been
warned, more  than once, that the failure
to comply with this rule may result in matters being continued, papers not
being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.  (See 6/5/24 Minute Order, p.4; 6/9/23
Minute Order, p.6).        
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is placed off calendar.
