DISCUSSION
The Court takes judicial notice that
Plaintiff petitioned for relief from the Government Claims Act’s claims
presentation requirements in a different proceeding. (See D.RJN Exh. E.) The
Court on its own motion now takes judicial notice of the entire record of that
proceeding, and notes that a dispositive hearing has been set for June 28,
2024. (See 05-08-2024 Minute Order, LASC Case No. 23STCP04028.) (The individual
defendants have been dismissed with prejudice from Plaintiff’s petition.)
Defendants argue Plaintiff’s petition for
relief qualifies as “another action pending between the same parties on the
same cause of action” for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section
430.10(c).
“A plea in abatement pursuant to section
430.10, subdivision (c), may be made by demurrer or answer when there is
another action pending between the same parties on the
same cause of action.” (Plant Insulation Co. v.
Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 787 (“Plant
Insulation”).) “Abatement . . . is recognized to prevent a multiplicity of
suits and unnecessary vexatious litigation. (Hamm v. San Joaquin & Kings
River Canal Co. (1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 47, 56.) 
Abatement “is based in part upon the
practical supposition that the first suit is effective and affords an ample
remedy to the party and hence that the second action is unnecessary and
vexatious.” (Hilton v. Reed (1941) 46 Cal.App.2d 449, 454.) Thus,
“[a]batement is not appropriate where the first action cannot afford the relief
sought in the second.” (Plant Insulation, supra, 224 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.) “It must also be
borne in mind that the plea of another action pending is in its nature a
dilatory plea, and is not favored.” (Hilton v. Reed, supra,
46 Cal.App.2d at p. 454.)
Plaintiff’s petition for relief from the
GCA does not seek the same relief as his suit here. The petition cannot achieve
the same relief he seeks in this action. Abatement is improper here, but a
continuance is warranted.
