(“Defendants”); and DOES 1 through 100, for: (1) Breach of Express and Implied Contract; (2) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing/Breach of Express/Implied Warranty of Habitability; (3) Nuisance; (4) Fraud, Negligent Misrepresentation, Concealment; (5) Negligence – Premises Liability; (6) Negligence, Negligent Supervision, Negligent Management; (7) Violation of Business and Professions Code §17200; (8) Violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act; (9) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (10) Assault; (11) Violation of Civil Code §§51, et seq., 52.1; (12) Violation of Government Code §12955, et seq; and (13) Violation of LARSO. The Complaint alleges Plaintiffs were injured as a result of the misconduct of Defendants due to discriminatory, harassing, retaliatory, unsafe, uninhabitable, unhealthy conditions on premises were Plaintiffs resided.            On April 25, 2023, Defendants served Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) on Plaintiffs. (Fassonaki Decl., ¶2.)            On June 29, 2023, Plaintiffs served their responses. (Fassonaki Decl., ¶4.)            On August 14, 2023, Defendants filed the instant motions to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One).            On April 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed oppositions.            On April 8, 2024, Defendants filed replies. DISCUSSIONApplicable Law            Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a) authorizes a party propounding interrogatories to move for an order compelling a further response if that party deems that “[a]n answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete,” “[a]n exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate,” or “[a]n objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (CCP § 2030.300(a).) Application to Facts(1)  Form Interrogatories (Set One)At issue here were Nos. 1.1, 2.1-2.13, 4.1-4.2, 6.1-6.7, 7.1-7.3, 8.1-8.8, 9.1-9.2, 10.1-10.3, 11.1-11.2, 12.1-12.7, 13.1-13.2, 14.1-14.2, and 50.1-50.6The Court finds that Plaintiffs served further responses on April 2, 2024. Furthermore, Defendant 3J1M LLC concedes this point and indicates that the Defendants Ironwood Velvet LLC; and Aperto Property Management Inc. did not serve Form Interrogatories on Plaintiffs. As such, an order compelling Plaintiffs to serve further responses to Defendant 3J1M LLC’s Form Interrogatories (Set One) listed above is no longer necessary.Therefore, the motion to compel further form interrogatories (set one) is DENIED as moot. (2)  Special Interrogatories (Set One)At issue here are Nos. 1-84. Each Defendant propounded the exact same amount of Special Interrogatories on Plaintiffs.“If an objection is made to an interrogatory or to a part of an interrogatory, the specific ground for the objection shall be set forth clearly in the response. If an objection is based on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be clearly stated. If an objection is based on a claim that the information sought is protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.” (CCP § 2030.240(b).)In response to Nos. 1-35, Plaintiffs objects on the grounds that the interrogatories are compound in form, unintelligible, call for information equally available to Defendants,  and seek information protected under the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. (Plfs. Sep. Stmt. at pp. 2-41.)The Court disagrees with Defendants that this response to the first thirty-five interrogatories is too general and/or without merit.Here, Plaintiffs state the specific ground for the objections with case and statutory authority cited. Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ response clearly state the attorney-client privilege is being invoked. Similarly, Plaintiffs expressly assert that the information being sought by these interrogatories are protected under work product doctrine. Moreover, Defendants fail to demonstrate in their moving and reply papers how Plaintiffs objections are without merit. Additionally, Plaintiffs’ did not provide any answers to the interrogatories referring to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230, which would require Plaintiffs to specify the writings from which an answer may be derived or ascertained.Therefore, the motion is DENIED as to Nos. 1-35. Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.040, subdivision (a) states in pertinent part, “any party who attaches a supporting declaration as described in Section 2030.050 may propound a greater number of specially prepared interrogatories to another party if this greater number is warranted because of any of the following: (1) The complexity or the quantity of the existing and potential issues in the particular case; (2) The financial burden on a party entailed in conducting the discovery by oral deposition; [or] (3) The expedience of using this method of discovery to provide to the responding party the opportunity to conduct an inquiry, investigation, or search of files or records to supply the information sought.” (CCP § 2030.040(a).) Each factor that is relied on must be stated, as well as the reasons why the factor relied on is applicable to the instant lawsuit. (CCP § 2030.050.)In response to Nos. 36-84, Plaintiffs objects to these interrogatories on the grounds that Defendants have exceeded the permissible limit of thirty-five special interrogatories and failed to submit a declaration in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.040 and 2030.050. (Plfs. Sep. Stmt. at pp. 43-106.)The Court disagrees with Defendants that this response to these remaining interrogatories are without merit.Here, Defendants declaration for additional discovery does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.040 and 2030.050. First, the declaration fails to state the number of interrogatories previously propounded on Plaintiffs and the number of which were not official form interrogatories. Also, the declaration merely states the factors described in section 2030.040 that is relied on but fails to provide the reasons why the factors relied on are applicable to the instant lawsuit.Therefore, the motion is also DENIED as to Nos. 36-84. (3)  Request for Monetary SanctionsThe applicable statute mandates the imposition of sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2030.300(d).)Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subdivision (a), “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (CRC, rule 3.1348(a).)“[T]he burden is on the moving party to show (by declarations) the facts essential to an award of sanctions: e.g., the opposing party's failure to make discovery, reasonable efforts to resolve the matter informally, etc. The burden then shifts to the party against whom sanctions are being sought to establish some excuse or justification for the conduct in question.”  (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide:  Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2021 Update) ¶ 8:2015.)            Here, Defendants request monetary sanctions of $1,005.00 in connection with the motion re: Form Interrogatories (Set One) and $900.00 in connection with the motion re: Special Interrogatories (Set One). (Fassonaki Decl. Re: FROGs ¶11; Fassonaki Decl. Re: SROGs ¶11.) Sanctions are warranted in connection to the motion re: Form Interrogatories (Set One). Although Plaintiffs served supplemental responses prior to hearing on this matter, Plaintiffs waited over a year to provide the supplemental response to Defendant 3J1M LLC. Plaintiffs also failed to provide the Court with any excuse or justification for waiting this long to serve the supplemental responses. On the other hand, sanctions are not warranted in connection with the motion re: Special Interrogatories (Set One) despite a sufficient meet and confer between the parties to address these issues informally. (Fassonaki Decl. Re: SROGs ¶¶5-8, Exs. 4-7.) As discussed above, Plaintiffs have shown that their objections are valid and code-compliant.  By contrast, Defendants have not demonstrated how and why Plaintiffs’ otherwise valid objections are without merit.            Therefore, the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,005.00 [4.5 hours @ $210.00/hr + $60.00 filling fee] in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs and their attorneys of record, Rand & Rand-Lewis, PC.            CONCLUSION                        The Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) is DENIED.                        The Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) is DENIED.In connection with the motion re: Form Interrogatories (Set One), the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,005.00 in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs and their attorneys of record, Rand & Rand-Lewis, PC, payable within 20 days.            The request for sanctions in connection with the motion re: Special Interrogatories is DENIED.            Defendants to give notice.            If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear in person.
