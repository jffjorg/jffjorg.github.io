NOTICE:
 

The Court is not
requesting oral argument on this matter.  The Court is guided by
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1308(a)(1) whereby notice of intent to appear
is requested.  Unless the Court directs argument in the Tentative Ruling,
no argument is requested and any party seeking argument should notify all other
parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the hearing of the
party’s intention to appear and argue.  The tentative ruling will become
the ruling of the court if no argument is received.   
 
Notice may be given
either by email at BurDeptA@LACourt.org or by telephone at (818) 260-8412.
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
On July
19, 2024 the Los Angeles Superior Court suffered a cyber security attack which
resulted in the significant impairment of most Court systems. Due to this complication,
additional time is required for the Court to review these motions and issue a
tentative ruling. The Court, on its own motion, thus continues the motions for
summary judgment brought by the City of Los Angeles to August 14, 2024 at 9:00
a.m.

RULING:
 
In the
event the parties submit on this tentative ruling, or a party requests a signed
order or the court in its discretion elects to sign a formal order, the
following form will be either electronically signed or signed in hard copy and
entered into the court’s records.
