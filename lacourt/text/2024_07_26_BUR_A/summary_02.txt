(San Diego Gas & Elec. Co. v. Superior Ct. (2007) 146 Cal. App. 4th 1545, 1553)

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Hovanesyan's motion for summary judgment, finding that he did not breach the standard of care in prescribing Plavix to Decedent. The court found that Hovanesyan's actions were within the standard of care, as demonstrated by the expert testimony of Dr. Michael L. Chaikin. The court also found that Plaintiffs have produced no evidence to the contrary and that a non-opposition was filed. As the survival action assumes the medical negligence of Hovanesyan, it too presents no triable issue of fact. The court denied Co-Defendants' opposition to Hovanesyan's motion for summary judgment, finding that they lack standing to contest the summary judgment.
