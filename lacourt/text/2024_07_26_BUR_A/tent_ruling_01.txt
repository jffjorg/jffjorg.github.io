MOTION

Los Angeles Superior Court
Case # 22BBCV00226

 
MP:    THE MANIJUE SHAMS TRUST AND MANIJEH SHAMS
(Plaintiff)
RP:     FARIBA
JAVAHEROUR, ET AL (Defendant)
 
All parties are requested to
appear either in person or via LA Court Connect to address the tentative
ruling.
Brief Summary of Requested
Relief
The Court has read and considered
Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement, Defendant’s opposition, as well as
Defendant’s Further Opposition to the Motion.
The parties entered into a
settlement as set forth in Plaintiff’s moving papers, which included a CCP
§664.6 provision.  Defendant has declined
to sign the written settlement agreement until Plaintiff amends her trust to
reflect that the settlement of $60,000 will inure to the benefit of the
Plaintiff’s grandchildren, specifically the children of Plaintiff’s deceased
son, Massoud Bahmanyar.
The parties appear to be at an
impasse.
Ruling on Motion
to Enforce Settlement
Pursuant to CCP §664.6, a Court
has continuing jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement.  As such, the Court exercises its authority
under CCP §664.6 and orders the following be completed within the next 30 days:
1.    
Plaintiff Manijeh Shams is to create a new irrevocable
trust: The Manijeh Shams Irrevocable Grandchild Trust in which she is the
primary beneficiary, and the children of Massoud Bahmanyar are the contingent
beneficiaries.  Manijeh Shams shall be
the initial trustee, with a successor trustee to be named by Ms. Shams in the
trust.
 
2.    
The terms of the trust will include that the
$60,000 settlement, as well as any earnings, may be used for the direct support
of the settlor, and upon settlor’s death will inure to the benefit of Massoud
Bahmanyar’s children in equal parts per stirpes. In the event that any
grandchild predeceases the settlor, that grandchild’s share shall inure to the
grandchild’s children per stirpes.  
In the event that a deceased grandchild has no children, the share shall
be divided equally among the remaining living grandchildren.
 
3.    
Defendant Fariba Javaherpour shall deposit the total
sum of $60,000 into the newly established trust within ten days of being
informed that the new irrevocable trust has been established and a bank account
in the name of the new trust is set up.
 
4.    
The Manijeh Shams Irrevocable Grandchild Trust
shall be subject to Part 4, Chapter 1 of the California Probate Code, beginning
at §16060 et seq., including but not limited, to §§16062 and 16063.  Upon request from any contingent beneficiary,
the contingent beneficiaries shall have a right directly, or through their
representative if minors, to have an accounting no more than annually.  The accounting may be informal, and the cost
of the accounting shall be incurred by the trust.  Any contingent beneficiary has the right to
petition the court for a formal accounting if there is a prima facie basis to
believe that the informal accounting does not properly reflect the trust distributions
and expenses.
 
5.    
The individual trustee shall not be entitled to
compensation for administration of the trust, nor shall any bond be required of
any individual trustee.  A professional or
commercial trustee shall be entitled to compensation as permitted by law.
Manijeh Shams may propose
specific language to the Court if necessary, with objections and alternative
language being proposed by Defendant Fariba Javaherpour. 
The Court sets a Status
Conference Re: Settlement Agreement compliance for August 8, 2024 at 10:00 AM.
