And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the transcript of two depositions, those of Sergeant David Vasquez and Bobby Olivares, and is unable to make a ruling on the defendant's objections to the plaintiff's additional deposition designations because crucial pages are missing from the transcripts.

The judge has also reviewed the defendant's motions in limine, numbers 15 and 16, and has tentatively decided to deny motion 15 and grant motion 16. The court will give both sides an opportunity to address the motions before making a final ruling.
