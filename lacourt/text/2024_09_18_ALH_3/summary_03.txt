Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: Defendant Ford Motor Company's motion for a protective order and Plaintiff Jose Rodriguez's motion to compel further responses. With respect to the protective order, the Court grants the motion in part, modifying paragraphs 7, 8, and 21 of the Los Angeles Superior Court's Model Order. The modified order restricts access to confidential information and requires that all non-lawyer employees sign a certification before accessing confidential documents.

With respect to the motion to compel further responses, the Court grants the motion in part, ordering Defendant to serve further responses to Requests for Production Nos. 16 to 24 within 20 days. The Court declines to impose sanctions on Defendant because some of Plaintiff's requests were overbroad and because Defendant's privilege objections were timely asserted. The Court reminds Defendant that if it is withholding any documents on the basis of privilege, then it must provide a privilege log.
