And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, William A. Crowfoot, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yihsuan Wu (Plaintiff) vs. Zhuming Zhang (Defendant). The case concerns a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Defendant, which the Plaintiff did not oppose. The Judge has found that the Plaintiff's form complaint fails to state a cause of action because it lacks the necessary attachment for the intentional tort alleged and does not plead any facts in support of the complaint. Therefore, the Judge has granted the Defendant's motion with 30 days leave to amend. The case will be heard on September 18, 2024, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the Court by the specified date.
