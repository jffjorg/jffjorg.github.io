      CASE NO.: 22AHCV00668
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSES AND PRODUCTION OF
   DOCUMENTS TO FIRST SET OF FORM INTERROGATORIES
 
Dept.

Defendant Dilys Jones, trustee of the
Louis Petrie Separate Property Trust, moves for an order compelling Plaintiff
Café on Lemon (“Plaintiff”) to serve responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
which were propounded on March 12, 2024. Defendant also seeks monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1,995 against Plaintiff. 
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) A party that fails to serve timely
responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on
privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff did not oppose the Motion and
it is undisputed responses were not served. Defendant’s
Motion is therefore GRANTED and Plaintiff
is ordered to serve verified responses without objections to Defendant’s
 Form Interrogatories (Set One) within 20 days of the date of this
Order. 
The Code of Civil Procedure provides
that the court shall impose a monetary sanction against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) The Court finds evidence of neither. 
Accordingly,
 Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED and imposed
against Plaintiff in the reduced amount of $285
for 1
hour at defense counsel’s hourly rate of $285,
to be paid within 20 days of the date of this Order.
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 18th
day of September 2024
