And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff Zvi Kriple's motion to compel defendant Holly Hawk to serve responses to Form Interrogatories â€“ General (Set One). The motion was initially denied because the proof of service for the Form Interrogatories was incomplete, specifically because it did not identify the date the Form Interrogatories were served. Despite the plaintiff's recent filings, including a declaration from Louis Francis, the Court still has no evidence of when the Form Interrogatories were actually served on the defendant. Therefore, the motion and request for sanctions are denied without prejudice. The plaintiff may bring a renewed motion to compel a response if they can show that the Form Interrogatories were served on the defendant and that the defendant failed to respond within the timeframe.
