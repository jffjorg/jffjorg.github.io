The judge ordered that the Lead Case be the lead case and all papers be filed in that action, and that all dates in the Related Case be vacated.

## English Summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to consolidate two cases, 22AHCV00192 (the "Lead Case") and a related case (23STCV18152).  Both cases involve disputes over a single-family residence ("Subject Property") and are connected through shared parties and issues. 

While the defendant in the related case had not yet been served, the Judge found that the motion to consolidate was appropriate because the cases involve overlapping issues and related parties (including a controlling figure named Chong Ding). Consolidation will streamline the legal process, avoid duplication of efforts, and ensure consistent rulings on the same legal issues.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling, written by Judge William A. Crowfoot, grants Pauline Yip's motion to consolidate the Lead Case (22AHCV00192) and the Related Case (23STCV18152) for all purposes, including trial. The Lead Case involves a dispute over the sale of a single-family residence located at 37 Twiggs in Irvine, California, while the Related Case involves claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and quiet title relating to the same property. The Court finds that both cases involve similar issues and parties, and that consolidation will promote efficiency and avoid inconsistent resolutions of the same legal or factual issue. The Court rejects Eastern Horizon's argument that consolidation is premature, as the defendants in the Related Case have been served and have appeared. The Court orders that all papers be filed in the Lead Case and that all dates in the Related Case be vacated.
