Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to consolidate two cases: the Lead Case, which involves a breach of contract relating to a single-family residence, and the Related Case, which involves fraud, negligent misrepresentation, quiet title, cancellation of instrument, declaratory relief, and equitable indemnity relating to the same Subject Property. The judge found that the two cases involve common questions of law and fact and that consolidation will avoid unnecessary duplication of proceedings and inconsistent resolution of the same legal or factual issue. The judge noted that the defendants in the Related Case have been served and are represented by the same counsel as the defendants in the Lead Case. The judge ordered that the Lead Case be the lead case and all papers be filed in that action, and that all dates in the Related Case be vacated.
