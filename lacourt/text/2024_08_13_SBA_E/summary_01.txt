Summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by the defendants and has determined that the plaintiff's claims for premises liability and general negligence are defective and must be dismissed. The Court has sustained the demurrer as to these claims, with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court has also overruled the demurrer as to the gross negligence and dereliction of duty claims, finding that these claims are moot. The Court has not ruled on the defendant's demurrer as to the landlord liability claim, as this claim is fundamentally flawed and lacks a cognizable duty owed by the defendants to the plaintiff.
