RULING
Defendant’s Motion to Disqualify
is DENIED.
 
BACKGROUND
            On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff
Simyoung Lee filed a complaint against Defendants JRDTSP LLC dba Scott Robinson
Chrysler Dodge, Jeep, FCA US LLC, and Does 1 through 10, alleging violations of
the Song Beverly Act (Breach of Express and Implied Warranty) and Negligent
Repair.
 
            On July 3, 2024, Defendant FCA US
LLC filed a notice of motion to disqualify Plaintiff’s counsel and firm. On
August 1, 2024, Plaintiff opposed. To date, no reply has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“A judge’s authority to disqualify an attorney has its origins in the
inherent power of every court in the furtherance of justice to control the
conduct of ministerial officers and other persons in pending judicial
proceedings.”¿(Neal v. Health Net, Inc.¿(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 831,
840;¿see also¿Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(5) [“Every court shall have the
power to . . . control in furtherance of justice, the conduct of its
ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected with a
judicial proceeding before it, in every matter pertaining thereto”].) “The
power is frequently exercised on a showing that disqualification is required
under professional standards governing avoidance of conflicts of interest or
potential adverse use of confidential information.”¿(Responsible Citizens v.
Superior Court¿(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1717, 1723-1724.)¿ 
¿ 
“Motions to disqualify counsel present competing policy
considerations. On the one hand, a court must not hesitate to¿disqualify an
attorney when it is satisfactorily established that he or she wrongfully
acquired an unfair advantage that undermines the integrity of the judicial
process and will have a¿continuing effect on the proceedings before the court.
[Citations.] On the other hand, it must be kept in mind that disqualification
usually imposes a substantial hardship on the disqualified attorney’s innocent
client, who must bear the monetary and other costs of finding a replacement. A
client deprived of the attorney of his [or her] choice suffers a particularly
heavy penalty where ... his [or her] attorney is highly skilled in the relevant
area of the law.”¿(Gregori v. Bank of America (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 291,
300.) “The paramount concern must be to preserve public trust in the scrupulous
administration of justice and the integrity of the bar. The important right to
counsel of one’s choice must yield to ethical considerations that affect the
fundamental principles of our judicial process.”¿(People ex rel. Dept. of
Corporations v. SpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1135,
1145.) Generally, the disqualification of an attorney vicariously disqualifies
his or her firm.¿(William H. Raley Co. v. Superior Court (1983)¿149
Cal.App.3d 1042, 1048–1049.)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
On a preliminary note, the
Court declines to rule on Defendant’s requests for judicial notice as it failed
to file a separate motion with a proposed order pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 9.252(a)(1).
 
Logan Hensley is an attorney
that works at Plaintiff’s counsel’s firm. He previously worked at Defendant’s
counsel’s firm. (Yasuzawa Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.) Hensley worked for RoseWaldorf for
1.5 years, during which he allegedly defended FCA US in numerous cases under
California’s lemon law and signed a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure
Agreement. (Yasuzawa Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5.) Hensley joined Plaintiff’s counsel’s firm,
The Lemon Daddy (Drake Law), four business days after leaving RoseWaldorf.
(Yasuzawa Decl. ¶¶ 7, 18.) Defendant argues that this swift transition, along
with Hensley’s failure to obtain FCA US’s consent for his new representation,
violates ethical rules and undermines the integrity of the legal profession.
(Yasuzawa Decl. ¶¶ 18, 29.) Defendant also raises concerns about Hensley’s
conduct after leaving RoseWaldorf, including his failure to update his State
Bar profile and potential misuse of confidential information. (Yasuzawa Decl.
¶¶ 25, 26, 27.) Thus, Defendant seeks the disqualification of Hensley and his
new firm from representing Plaintiff.
 
Under California Rules of
Professional Conduct, an attorney cannot represent a new client whose interests
are adverse to a former client in a substantially related matter without
informed written consent. Defendant argues that Hensley’s representation of Plaintiff
against FCA US violates this rule because he possesses confidential information
from his prior representation of FCA US, which creates a conflict of interest.
(Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct, rule 1.9(a), (b)). Defendant further asserts that
Hensley breached his duties of confidentiality and loyalty to FCA US by
representing Plaintiff in the same matter he was previously defending. Additionally,
Defendant argues that Hensley acquired significant confidential information
during his time representing FCA US, which is directly relevant to the current
case, and the substantial relationship between his former and current
representations justifies his disqualification. Defendant also contends that
Hensley’s disqualification should be imputed to his new firm, The Lemon Daddy,
because there is no evidence that the firm has implemented any screening
procedures to prevent Hensley from participating in FCA US matters. California
law generally requires that if one attorney in a firm is disqualified, the
entire firm is vicariously disqualified, especially when the attorney possesses
confidential information from the opposing side in the same lawsuit. (California
Self-Insurers’ Security Fund v. Superior Court (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 1065,
1072). Defendant highlights that Lemon Daddy failed to provide written notice
of any screening procedures, further demonstrating a disregard for ethical
obligations. (Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct, rule 1.10.) 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that the motion to disqualify should be denied for several reasons. First,
RoseWaldorf has not met the high burden of proving that Hensley received any
confidential information material to the case. Plaintiff points out that
previous rulings, including the Khani v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 215
Cal.App.4th 916, have rejected similar “playbook” arguments, and collateral
estoppel should apply since a similar motion was already denied in a related
case, Ryan Michael Nelson v. FCA US LLC (Case No. 23TRCV04158).
Additionally, Plaintiff argues that the issue of disqualification is now moot
because The Drake Law Firm has implemented comprehensive screening procedures
to isolate Hensley from any cases involving FCA, including the current matter.
Within the first six weeks of Hensley’s employment, the firm established
measures that exceed the requirements of Rule 1.10(a)(2) of the California
Rules of Professional Conduct. (Serrano Decl., Ex. A & B.) These steps
ensure that Hensley has no access to case files, emails, or communications
related to FCA, and he works remotely, approximately 60 miles away from the
firm’s main office. (Hensley Decl. ¶ 6.) Additionally, Hensley is not involved
in any fee-sharing related to FCA cases. (Hensley Decl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff asserts
that these robust procedures create an effective ethical barrier, preventing
any conflict of interest and ensuring compliance with the rules. (Rule
1.10(a)(2); Kirk v. First American Title Ins. Co. (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
776, 813-814.) The firm has also ensured that all employees are aware of and
adhere to the screening measures, which include prohibiting communication
across the screen and blocking Hensley’s access to any FCA-related materials.
(Serrano Decl. ¶ 9-11, Ex. A & B; National Grange of Order of Patrons of
Husbandry v. Cal. Guild (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 706, 715.) Therefore,
Plaintiff contends that there is no basis for disqualification, as the firm has
fully satisfied the requirements of Rule 1.10(a)(2).
 
Plaintiff argues that the
vicarious disqualification of The Drake Law Firm is not justified because all
elements of California Rule of Professional Conduct 1.10(a)(2) have been met.
First, Hensley’s participation in FCA matters was minimal, primarily involving
non-substantial tasks such as handling appearances and filling out templated
documents without direct communication with FCA or involvement in strategic
decisions. (Hensley Decl. ¶ 8-14.) Given his limited role, Plaintiff contends
that Hensley’s previous work does not qualify as substantial participation in
any FCA-related matter. Second, The Drake Law Firm has implemented timely and
robust screening procedures to ensure that Hensley is completely isolated from
any cases involving FCA, which further justifies the firm's continued
representation of the plaintiff. Additionally, Hensley has not shared any
confidential information with his new firm, and no evidence has been presented
to suggest otherwise. Third, Plaintiff asserts that written notice of the screening
procedures was promptly given to FCA, satisfying the requirements of Rule
1.10(a)(2). The notice was provided within six weeks of Hensley’s employment,
well within the timeframe considered prompt by legal standards. (Serrano Decl.
Ex. A & B.) 
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff argues
that disqualification would impose an undue hardship on the client, who has the
right to choose their counsel, and that the motion appears to be motivated by
personal animus and retaliation against Hensley for leaving RoseWaldorf. The
motion lacks substantial evidence and relies on speculative claims, making it
an inappropriate and abusive use of the disqualification process. Plaintiff
concludes that, given the lack of substantial participation by Hensley in FCA
matters, the proper and timely screening procedures, and the potential harm to
the client, the motion to disqualify The Drake Law Firm should be denied.
 
In Kirk v. First American
Title Ins. Co., the court addressed the requirements for an effective
ethical screen when an attorney within a law firm is tainted with confidential
information that could lead to a conflict of interest. Once the moving party in
a motion for disqualification has established that an attorney is tainted with confidential
information, there is a rebuttable presumption that this information has been
shared with others in the firm. The burden then shifts to the law firm to prove
that the attorney has been effectively screened from any involvement in the
litigation. (Kirk, supra, at 809-810.) The court outlined
that an effective screen must be timely implemented as soon as the conflict
arises, and it must include preventive measures that guarantee confidential
information will not be disclosed. (Id.) Simply asserting that
information was not conveyed is insufficient; practical and formal screening
measures are necessary. (Id.) “The typical elements of an ethical wall
are: [1] physical, geographic, and departmental separation of attorneys; [2]
prohibitions against and sanctions for discussing confidential matters; [3]
established rules and procedures preventing access to confidential information
and files; [4] procedures preventing a disqualified attorney from sharing in
the profits from the representation; and [5] continuing education in
professional responsibility.” (Id. at 811 [internal quotations
removed].) 
 
Here, the facts indicate that Hensley is not the
attorney assigned to this case, that he was screened within six weeks of his
employment, and that Plaintiff gave timely notice of the screening to
Defendant. The screening measures implemented by The Drake Law Firm are sufficient
and in compliance with the requirements of California Rule of Professional
Conduct 1.10(a)(2). Plaintiff shows that Hensley has no access to any
FCA-related case files. (Serrano Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. A & B.) The Drake Law Firm
uses Clio, an electronic case management software, where Hensley has been
blocked from accessing any FCA files. (Id.) Additionally, the firm has
prohibited any communication across the screen, ensuring Hensley does not
receive any emails or communications referencing FCA. (Serrano Decl., ¶ 10, Ex.
B.) All staff, including lawyers and support personnel, have been instructed
not to communicate with Hensley regarding any FCA matters, further preventing
information sharing across the screen. (Serrano Decl., ¶ 11.) Moreover, Hensley
works remotely, approximately 60 miles away from the firm’s main office,
reducing the risk of unintentional disclosure due to physical separation. (Hensley
Decl. ¶ 6.) Lastly, Hensley has no fee-sharing arrangement with the firm for
FCA cases, ensuring no financial conflict. (Hensley Decl. ¶ 7.). These
comprehensive measures constitute a compliant ethical wall sufficient to
satisfy the requirements for timely screening and maintaining the integrity of
the screening process. (See Rule 1.10(a)(2).) Plaintiff also indicates that
written notice of the screening was provided, and Defendant does not set forth
any arguments in reply. 
 
Thus, the Court DENIES
Defendant’s motion to disqualify.
