And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies, without prejudice, the motion to compel production of documents filed by Javaherian (judgment creditor) against Moradi et al. (judgment debtors). Javaherian had served post-judgment requests for production of documents, seeking bank statements, profit and loss statements, and other financial records, but the debtors failed to adequately respond to the requests. The law allows judgment creditors to serve inspection demands for documents to aid in the enforcement of the money judgment. The creditor argues that the debtors' responses were "woefully deficient" but does not specify how or what documents were missing. The tentative ruling denies the motion, requiring the creditor to re-file with a separate statement comparing each request to the debtor's production.
