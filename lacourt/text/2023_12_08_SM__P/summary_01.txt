And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion and demurrer in the case of Tenser v. Ryan et al. The plaintiff, Tenser, is suing the defendants for defamation, invasion of privacy, fraud, and RICO, alleging that the defendants published a podcast discussing his conduct during a highly publicized murder trial. The defendants argue that the statements made in the podcast are protected speech about a public figure on a matter of public interest. The court finds that the trial was an issue of public interest, as it received substantial media coverage, and that Tenser was a "figure in the public eye." Therefore, the anti-SLAPP motion is granted, and the burden shifts to Tenser to show a reasonable probability of prevailing. Since Tenser filed no opposition, the motion is granted. The demurrer is moot due to the granted anti-SLAPP motion.
