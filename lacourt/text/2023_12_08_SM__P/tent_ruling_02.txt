Javaherian v.
Moradi et al., Case No. SC128455
Hearing Date
December 8, 2023 
Motion to Compel
Responses to Post Judgment Demand for Production of Documents (UNOPPOSED)   
 
On February 23, 2023
the court entered judgment against defendants/judgment debtors for
$2,180,728.88. On August 7, 2023 judgment creditor served post-judgment
requests for production of documents, seeking bank statements, profit and loss
statements, and other financial records. Motion, exhibits B and C. Creditor
states debtor failed to adequately respond to the requests and moves to compel
production of the documents. 
 
A judgment
creditor may serve inspection demands for documents in the possession, custody,
or control of the debtor if the demand requests “information to aid in
enforcement of the money judgment.” Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §708.030.
Inspection demands under this section may be enforced in the same manner as
inspection demands in a civil action. Id at (c). 
 
Creditor argues
debtor’s responses were “woefully deficient.” Creditor does not specify how the
responses are deficient, nor which documents debtor should have produced but
did not. There is no separate statement accompanying the motion comparing each
request to debtor’s production. 
 
DENIED without
prejudice.
