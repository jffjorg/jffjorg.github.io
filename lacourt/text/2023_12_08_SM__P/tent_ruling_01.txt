Tenser v. Ryan et
al., Case No. 23SMCV04014
Hearing Date
December 8, 2023 
Defendants
Audiochuck LLC and Flowers’ Special Motion to Strike Complaint; Defendants
Audiochuck LLC and Flowers’ Demurrer/Motion to Strike Complaint (UNOPPOSED) 
 
Plaintiff attorney
Tenser represented Blake Leibel in a highly publicized murder trial. Tenser sues
for defamation and invasion of privacy, fraud and RICO, alleging defendant
Townsend made defamatory statements during a podcast about the trial. Plaintiff
alleges the episode was broadcast by defendants Audiochuck and its managing
member Flowers. Defendants Flowers and Audiochuck demur and move to strike all
claims under the anti-SLAPP statute. Defendant Townsend joins. Defendants also
demur to the complaint. Plaintiff filed no opposition.
 
Courts
resolving anti-SLAPP motions under Cal. Civ. Code §425.16 follow a two-step
process. Jarrow Formulas, Inc. v.
LaMarche (2003) 31 Cal.4th 728, 733. In prong one, the court determines
whether the conduct underlying plaintiff’s cause of action arises from
defendant’s constitutional rights of free speech or petition. Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal. 5th 376,
395. This is a threshold issue; if moving party fails to show the conduct is
constitutionally protected, the court need not address prong two. Jarrow, supra, 31 Cal.4th at 733. Under
the second prong, the burden shifts to plaintiff to prove a legally sufficient
claim and to prove with admissible evidence a reasonable probability of prevailing.
E.g., Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29
Cal.4th 82, 88. Plaintiff cannot rely on the allegations of the complaint but
must produce evidence admissible at trial. HMS
Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212.
 
Under Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. §425.16(e)(4), “conduct in furtherance of the constitutional right
of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public
interest” constitutes protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. To
determine what constitutes a matter of public interest, courts look to a
variety of factors, including whether the subject of the speech or activity was
“a person or entity in the public eye, “could affect large numbers of people
beyond the direct participants,” and whether the activity “occur[red] in the
context of an ongoing controversy, dispute or discussion[.]” FilmOn.com Inc.
v. DoubleVerify, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.4th 133, 145.  
 
In determining
whether a claim is based on protected activity, the court looks to “the
gravamen or principal thrust of the claims asserted[.]” Martinez v.
Metabolife Int’l., Inc. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 181, 188. 
 
The gravamen of
Tenser’s claims is that defendants published a podcast discussing him and his
conduct during the trial. The Audiochuck defendants argue statements made in
the podcast constitute protected speech about a public figure on a matter of
public interest. 
 
A legal proceeding
that garnered publicity is an issue of public interest, and statements made
about the proceeding are covered under the anti-SLAPP statute. Hall v. Time
Warner, Inc. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1343. The Audiochuck defendants argue
the trial attracted substantial media coverage, making it an issue of public
interest. They present 46 examples of media coverage, including articles about
the murder, trial and sentencing in major media publications (e.g., Los Angeles
Times, Tornoto Sun, Daily Mail, Hollywood Reporter and People Magazine).
Ramallo decl., exhs. 13-59. This establishes the trial received heavy publicity
and qualifies as an issue of public interest.
 
Audiochuck
provides evidence Tenser gave interviews about the trial to media outlets. Id. Exhs.
61-72. With respect to the trial, Tenser was a “figure in the public eye,” and a
podcast discussing his public conduct constitutes protected activity. The first
anti-SLAPP step is fulfilled; the burden shifts to Tenser to show a reasonable
probability of prevailing. As Tenser filed no opposition, he does not meet his
burden. GRANTED.
 
Demurrer
Since the
anti-SLAPP motion was granted as to all causes of action naming the moving
defendants, the demurrer is MOOT.
