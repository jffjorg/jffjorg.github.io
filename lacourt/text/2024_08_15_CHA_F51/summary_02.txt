And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion to quash the defendant's deposition subpoena for production of business records. The plaintiff alleges elder abuse and negligence against the defendants, and the defendants served a deposition subpoena on non-party deponent Physicians Preferred Hospice, Inc. seeking the production of the plaintiff's complete medical and billing records from 2022 to 2023. The plaintiff argues that the request is irrelevant, overbroad, and seeks private medical information. The judge agrees with the plaintiff, finding that the document subpoena seeks information outside the scope of the instant action and that the defendants have failed to meet their burden to show that the requested documents are directly relevant to the claims in the instant action. The judge also notes that the defendants failed to oppose the motion, and therefore grants the motion to quash the deposition subpoena.
