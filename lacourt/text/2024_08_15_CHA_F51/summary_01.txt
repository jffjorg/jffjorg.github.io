```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motions for orders to show cause re: contempt are moot because the defendants have complied with the court's orders by providing supplemental discovery responses. The judge finds that the defendants' counsel admits to having already violated the court's orders at the time the motions were filed and presents no justification for the delay. The judge awards the plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500.00 to be imposed against the defendants and their counsel, payable within 30 days.
