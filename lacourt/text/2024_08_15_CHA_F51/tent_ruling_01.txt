Robinson (collectively, “Defendants”) NOTICE: OK  RELIEF REQUESTED: Orders  to show cause as to why Defendants should not be held in contempt of court for  violating this Court’s 12/20/23 and 3/14/24 orders granting Plaintiff’s motions  to compel Defendants’ further discovery responses. Plaintiff further requests  terminating sanctions and a total of $11,320.00 in monetary sanctions and  attorney fees to be imposed against Defendants.  TENTATIVE RULING: The motions are off calendar as moot. The Court imposes  monetary sanctions against Defendants and their counsel in the amount of $1,500.00, payable within 30 days.   BACKGROUND¿    This is a  legal malpractice action wherein Plaintiff alleges that on 12/7/22, it entered  into a legal services agreement with Defendant Jay William Smith to represent  Plaintiff in Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 19STCV08264. (Compl. ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff alleges that all communications regarding the retainer and legal  representation were conducted between Plaintiff and Defendant David M.  Robinson, and the retainer fee was paid to Robinson’s personal account. (Id.  at ¶¶ 6–8.) Plaintiff alleges that neither Defendant “notified Plaintiff in  writing or verbally that ROBINSON is a disbarred attorney from April 14, 2011  at any time.” (Id. at ¶ 9.)   Plaintiff  further alleges that it learned that 11 Motions to Compel Discovery had been  filed against it in LASC Case No. 19STCV08264 due to Defendants’ failure to  respond to discovery requests on Plaintiff’s behalf. (Id. at ¶¶ 12–14.)  “Plaintiff has been harmed in amounts of $7,500.00 in legal fees paid, plus  interest at 7% per annum, plus another $30,000.00 in legal fees to retain new  counsel with the need to expedite file review in 19STCV08264 where 11 motions  to compel are still on calendar that need to be opposed as well as the  discovery requests answered, plus punitive damages in the amount of $100,000.00  for the purposeful and malicious act of concealing the fact that the de facto  individual performing 95% of the representation of Plaintiff, ROBINSON, is a  disbarred attorney whom is forbidden to be the sole client contact, to give  legal advice, and to accept legal fees directly into their own personal  account.” (Id. at ¶ 15.)    On 5/22/23,  Plaintiff filed its complaint, alleging against Defendants the following causes  of action: (1) Fraud; (2) Violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200;  (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; and (4) Negligent Misrepresentation.   On 12/20/23,  the Court granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel Defendants’ further responses  to Plaintiff’s Demand for Production, Set Two. On 3/13/24, the Court partially  granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel Defendants’ further responses to  Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One.   On 1/23/24  and 4/17/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motions for orders to show cause re:  contempt against Defendants for failure to comply with the Court’s 12/20/23 and  3/13/24 orders. On 8/2/24, Defendants filed their oppositions. On 8/6/24, Plaintiff  filed its replies.   ANALYSIS   A.     Contempt   “Disobedience of any lawful judgment, order, or process of  the court” qualifies as contempt of court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1209, subd. (a).)  “When the contempt is not committed in the immediate view and presence of the  court, or of the judge at chambers, an affidavit shall be presented to the  court or judge of the facts constituting the contempt.” (Code Civ. Proc. §  1211, subd. (a).) If the Court is satisfied with the sufficiency of the  affidavit, the next step is for the judge to issue an order to show cause re:  contempt that is directed to the accused, in which the date and time for a  hearing are specified. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1212.)   Here, Plaintiff’s counsel filed supporting declarations  stating under penalty of perjury that no supplemental discovery responses were  served, in violation of the Court’s orders for Defendants to do so. (Decl.  Brian W. Lee ¶ 3–4.) Defendants argue in opposition that the instant motions  are moot because they have complied with the Court’s orders by providing  Plaintiff with supplemental responses to the subject discovery requests on  8/2/24. (Decl. of Jay W. Smith ¶ 4.) Due to Defendants’ service of further responses  to the subject discovery requests on 8/2/24, the Court finds that the issuance  of orders to show cause re: contempt and related fines against Defendants is  not warranted at this time. Accordingly, the motions are off calendar as moot.   B.      Monetary  Sanctions   “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that  conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,  incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030,  subd. (a).)   Here, Plaintiff requests $3,660.00 in monetary sanctions,  per motion, to be imposed against Defendants and/or their counsel. This  encompasses: (1) 5 hours of Plaintiff’s attorney’s time spent preparing each  motion; (2) an anticipated 3 hours reviewing each of Defendants’ oppositions  and filing a reply; and (3) an anticipated 4 hours appearing for each instant  hearing, at counsel’s hourly rate of $300.00 per hour. (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 7–9.) Plaintiff  also seeks to recover $60.00 in filing fees per motion. (Ibid.)   The Court finds that monetary sanctions against Defendants  and their counsel are warranted as Defendants’ counsel admits that despite the  Court’s orders requiring further responses to be respectively served by 1/19/24  and 4/12/24, Defendants did not provide any supplemental responses until 8/2/24.  (Smith Decl. ¶ 4.) As such, Defendants and their  counsel had already violated the Court’s 12/20/23 and 3/13/24 orders at the time the instant motions were filed. The Court notes  that Defendants present no justification for their delay in complying with the  Court’s orders.   Based on the foregoing, the Court awards Plaintiff monetary  sanctions in the total amount of $1,500.00 to be imposed against Defendants and  their counsel, payable within 30 days.     CONCLUSION   The motions are off calendar as moot. The Court imposes  monetary sanctions against Defendants and their counsel in the amount of $1,500.00, payable within 30 days.
