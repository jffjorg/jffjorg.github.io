And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to continue the hearing. The parties have agreed to continue the motion, citing CCP section 595.2, which states that the court must continue the motion upon request. However, the judge is unsure if the statute means that the court must adjust its law and motion or trial calendar. Fortunately, the judge does not need to reach that question, as the statute is considered directory, not mandatory. The judge notes that there is no solid basis for continuing the motion, but the parties have cooperated to try to resolve the issue without further court intervention. Taking this into account, the judge has decided to exercise its discretion and accept the stipulation, continuing the hearing.
