And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a discovery motion filed by the defendant to compel the deposition of a third-party witness, Jessie Guthrie. The plaintiff opposes the motion, which was filed one day late. The judge has considered both the opposition and the reply.

The judge notes that the deposition will be granted if a date certain is provided for the deposition, and the witness will be required to be present remotely at the agreed-upon date and time. If no date is provided, the motion will be granted, and the court will describe the method for setting the date.

The judge also addresses a request for sanctions filed by the defendant. The judge finds that the only evidence presented is related to the fees and time spent by Mr. Shiri, and not by Mr. Barton, who filed an untimely declaration claiming he spent time on the case. The judge disregards the Barton declaration and denies the request for sanctions.

The judge urges the parties to stop engaging in discovery battles and to resolve the case. The judge suggests that the parties engage in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) before the trial and final status conference.
