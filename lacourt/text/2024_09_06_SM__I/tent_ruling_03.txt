 Case Number:  22STCV30200    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for closing arguments.  At the conclusion of the trial, the court
asked for closing briefs to be filed on August 19, 2024.  Defendants filed their brief timely.  Plaintiffs filed their brief on September 4,
2024—two days before the hearing.  The
court has not yet had time to digest it fully, and the defense will be given an
opportunity to respond to it.  In part,
that is a question of fundamental fairness given that plaintiffs had three
weeks with defendants’ brief before filing. 
The court will discuss with the parties how best to proceed.  The court has some concern as to plaintiffs’
counsel.  The late-filed brief is
uncharacteristic, especially when coupled with the unusual status report.  The court does not intend to delve deeply
into that matter given likely privacy concerns, and if necessary—due to privacy
concerns—the court would consider an in camera hearing, although perhaps
one with opposing counsel present.  But
the court does need to see how best to move forward.
