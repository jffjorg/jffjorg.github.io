The judge has issued a tentative ruling for a future court hearing on September 6, 2024. Assuming no objections, the court will continue the further settlement conference (FSC) and trial dates previously discussed. The court will not hear motions for summary judgment or adjudication, but will hear motions that are currently on the calendar and any other properly filed motions. The judge reminds the parties to comply with the court's FSC and trial policies, which can be found online, and warns that failure to comply will result in sanctions. The court also urges the parties to begin the process of preparing for the FSC at least 2 months in advance to ensure timely filing of documents and completion of exchanges and meet-and-confer sessions.
