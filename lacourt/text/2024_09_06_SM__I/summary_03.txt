And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is preparing for the September 6, 2024 hearing and has concerns about the behavior of the plaintiffs' counsel. The defendants filed their closing briefs on time, while the plaintiffs filed theirs two days before the hearing, giving the defense less time to respond. The judge is concerned that this is unfair and plans to discuss with the parties how to proceed. Additionally, the judge is puzzled by the unusual status report and late filing of the brief and may consider an in-camera hearing to address these issues.
