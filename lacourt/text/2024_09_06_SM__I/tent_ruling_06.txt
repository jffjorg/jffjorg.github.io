 Case Number:  24SMCV00349    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  I The parties have stipulated to continue the motion.  They have cited to CCP section 595.2, arguing
that the court must continue the motion upon request so long as the request
comports with the statute.
 
If the statute really meant that, the court would have
serious doubts as to its constitutionality. 
It is not clear that the Legislature can compel the court to adjust its
law and motion or trial calendar in such a way, although maybe it could.  (Lorraine v. McComb (1934) 220 Cal.
753.)  Fortunately, the court need not
reach that question.  The statute,
despite its language, is directory, not mandatory.  (Pham v. Nguyen (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th
11.)  The court notes that there is no
solid basis set forth in the stipulation warranting a continuation of the
motion.  The court would, therefore, be
within its rights to deny the request and hear the motion.
 
That said, unless one did research on the topic, the statute
certainly does read as if it were mandatory, and the court is also of the view
that on scheduling issues not involving a trial date, the court should do what
it can to accommodate cooperation among counsel.  Here, counsel have cooperated to try and
continue the hearing, presumably in an effort to resolve the issue without
further court intervention.  Therefore,
although the court is not required to do so, the court believes that the
exercise of sound discretion suggests that the stipulation should be accepted
and the matter continued.  The court will
therefore ACCEPT the stipulation and CONTINUE the hearing.  The court will discuss the new hearing date
with counsel.
