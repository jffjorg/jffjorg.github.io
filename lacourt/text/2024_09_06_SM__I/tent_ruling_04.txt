 Case Number:  23SMCV02282    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to compel initial responses is
GRANTED.  Discovery was served on March
26,2024.  No responses were received so
defendant wrote to plaintiff’s counsel.  Plaintiff
responded saying that responses had been served, but defendant did not receive
them.  The responses were forwarded the
next day, but they were almost completely objections and no responses at all to
some discovery.  Defendant sent a meet
and confer letter but plaintiff failed to respond.  These motions followed and there has been no
opposition.  The motions are
GRANTED.  Plaintiff will serve verified
responses without objection other than privilege within 5 court days.  These motions are only to compel initial
responses, not further responses.  But
the court has looked at the responses that were given.  Plaintiff’s counsel would be well advised not
to press a hearing on the good faith (or patent lack thereof) of the responses
that were tendered unless plaintiff can really defend the objections.  The five day period is short and deliberately
so.
 
The requests for sanctions are GRANTED.  There is no justification for the failure to
respond and the amounts are reasonable. 
They are in the total amount of $1123.30 and are against plaintiff, but
not counsel.  They are payable within 30
days.
