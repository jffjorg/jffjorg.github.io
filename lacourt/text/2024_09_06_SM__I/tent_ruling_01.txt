  Case Number:  21STCV02566    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  I Mr. Way has signed the declaration.  Assuming no objections, the  court will CONTINUE THE FSC AND TRIAL DATES
to the dates discussed at the last hearing. 
Discovery deadlines remain tied to the prior trial date but without
prejudice to a motion to re-open (the more laser-like the motion, the more
likely to succeed).  The court will not
hear motions for summary judgment or adjudication.  The court will hear the motions now on the
calendar and any other properly filed motions.
 
The court reminds the parties to be mindful of the court’s
FSC and trial policies, which can be found on line.  Failure to comply will result in
sanctions.  If some parties are attempting
to comply both others are not, the sanctions could be evidentiary in
nature.  The court urges the parties to
begin the process 2 months or so before the FSC to ensure that all documents
are timely filed and that all exchanges and meet and confers are done.
