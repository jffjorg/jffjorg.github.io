And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion to compel initial responses from the plaintiff. The discovery was served on March 26, 2024, but the defendant did not receive any responses. The plaintiff responded to the defendant's inquiry, stating that responses had been served, but the defendant only received almost entirely objections and no responses to some discovery. The defendant sent a meet and confer letter, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The Judge grants the motion, ordering the plaintiff to serve verified responses without objection (except for privilege) within 5 court days.

Additionally, the Judge grants the requests for sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $1123.30, payable within 30 days. The Judge notes that there is no justification for the failure to respond and advises the plaintiff's counsel not to press a hearing on the good faith of the responses unless the plaintiff can defend the objections.
