And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to change the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to Ventura County. The judge finds that the venue in Los Angeles County is improper because the defendant resides and practices law in Ventura County. The judge also denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, but orders the plaintiff to pay the fees and costs of transferring the action. The judge orders the plaintiff to pay a transfer fee of $50.00 to the Los Angeles Superior Court and a filing fee to the Ventura County Superior Court within 30 days. The defendant is ordered to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service.
