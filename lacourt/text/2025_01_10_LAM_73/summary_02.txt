Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains Respondent's demurrer to the Amended Petition of Writ of Mandate without leave to amend, and grants Respondent's motion to strike the second, third, and fourth causes of action alleged in the Amended Petition of Writ. The court also grants Respondent's motion to strike Petitioner's request for judicial notice. The court finds that the Amended Petition does not state a cause of action, and that Petitioner has added new causes of action beyond the scope authorized by the court's order allowing leave to amend.
