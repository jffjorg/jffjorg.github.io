[motion TO DECLARE VEXATIOUS LITIGANT] (filed November 27, 2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant Braswell’s Colonial Care’s motion to declare Plaintiff a
vexatious litigant is GRANTED in its entirety. The Court will discuss briefing schedule for security
amount at the time of the hearing.
 
 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from Defendant Braswell’s Colonial Care alleged
lack of medical care to Plaintiff Janice Deutsch’s mother (Decedent) prior to
her death. 
 
On September 18, 2024, Plaintiff Janice Deutsch (Plaintiff) filed
a complaint in pro per against Defendant Braswell’s Colonial Care (Defendant) alleging
causes of action for: (1) Intentional Tort, (2) Fraudulent Concealment, (3)
Deception, and (4) Intentional Misrepresentation. 
 
On November 27, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to declare
Plaintiff a vexatious litigant. No opposition was filed.  
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 391
subdivision (b) defines a vexatious litigant as a person engaged with the court
and conducting any of the following activities:  
 
“(1) In the immediately
preceding seven-year period has commenced, prosecuted, or maintained in propria
persona at least five litigations other than in a small claims court that have
been (i) finally determined adversely to the person or (ii) unjustifiably
permitted to remain pending at least two years without having been brought to trial
or hearing. 
(2) After a
litigation has been finally determined against the person, repeatedly
relitigates or attempts to relitigate, in propria persona, either (i) the validity
of the determination against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the
litigation was finally determined or (ii) the cause of action, claim,
controversy, or any of the issues of fact or law, determined or concluded by
the final determination against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the
litigation was finally determined. 
(3) In any
litigation while acting in propria persona, repeatedly filed unmeritorious
motions, pleads, or other papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages in
other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. 
(4) Has
previously been declared to be a vexatious litigant by any state or federal
court of record in any action or proceeding based upon the same or
substantially similar facts, transaction, or occurrence.”
 
“The trial court exercises its
discretion in determining whether a person is a vexatious litigant. Review of
the order is accordingly limited and the Court of Appeal will uphold the ruling
if it is supported by substantial evidence.  Likewise, a court's decision
that a vexatious litigant does not have a reasonable chance of success in the
action is based on an evaluative judgment in which the court weighs the
evidence. If there is any substantial evidence to support the court's
determination, it will be upheld.”  (Singh v. Lipworth (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 813, 828.)
 
“Evidence that a litigant is a
frequent plaintiff or defendant alone is insufficient to support a vexatious
litigant designation.”  (Morton v. Wagner (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th
963, 969.)  Where a pro per plaintiff repeatedly files motions revisiting
issues that have already been determined, procedurally defective motions,
constantly revisits issues and files voluminous supplemental and amended briefing,
the Court may deem him a vexatious litigant under Code of Civil Procedure,
section 391 subdivision (b)(3).  (See Singh, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th
at 828.; see also Golin v. Allenby (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 616, 638-639.)

Properties, et al., Case No. 24STCV24180, filed on September 18, 2024.
Although a court may take judicial notice of
court records and files, judicial notice is limited to matters that are
indisputably true. (Evid. Code, section 452(d); Arce v. Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 482.) The truth of the
matters asserted in these records is not subject to judicial notice. (Arce,
supra, 181 Cal.App.4th at p. 483.) However, the court may take judicial
notice of a document’s legal effect. (Julian Volunteer Fire Co. Assn. v.
Julian-Cuyamaca Fire Protection Dist. (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 583, 600 [“In
taking judicial notice of an official document, a court may take notice not
only of the fact of the document but also facts that can be deduced, and/or
clearly derived from, its legal effect, such as the names and dates contained
in the document, and the legal consequences of the document. This is different
from taking judicial notice of the truth of specific factual representations
within a document.”].)
Thus,
the Court takes judicial notice of above as to their existence and legal effect
but not as to the truth of the matters asserted in them. 
 
C.     
Discussion
 
Defendant moves for (1) an order
declaring Plaintiff a vexatious litigant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
391 subdivision (b); (2) Requiring Plaintiff to provide
security to assure payment of Defendant’s litigation costs, including
attorney’s fees, incurred defending this frivolous action; (3) Staying this action until such time as Plaintiff has
provided the security; and (4) issuing a prefiling order
prohibiting Plaintiff from filing any new litigation in California state courts
in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the Presiding Judge of the
court in which the litigation is proposed to be filed pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 391.7. 
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff should be declared as a
vexatious litigant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 391 subdivision (b)(1) because in the past seven
years, Plaintiff has commenced and prosecuted at least five civil cases no in
small claims court that were all adjudicated against her and dismissed. 
 
Further, Defendant argues that Plaintiff
should be declared as a vexatious litigant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 391 subdivision (b)(2)
because Plaintiff has file and litigated an action in 2021 against Defendant
for alleged false imprisonment and mistreatment of Decedent at Defendant’s
skilled nursing facility from October 2012 to August 2015. (See Janice
Deutsch, Estate of Patricia Deutsch, Duff Shidaker v. Braswell’s Colonial Care,
LASC Case No. 21STCV36154 (hereinafter “2021 action”), filed on October 1, 2021
at Request for Judicial Notice ¶ 8.) The complaint in the
2021 actionalleged the following causes of action: General
negligence, violation of due process, unlawful seizure of person, violation of
6th Amendment, obstruction of justice – frustration of a subpoena and violation
of Patient’s Bill of Rights, Title 22 Section 72527. (Motion, Exhibit A.) After a sustained demurrer with leave to amend and Plaintiff filing a
first amended complaint, the Court on July 28, 2023 sustained Defendant’s
demurrer without leave to amend as all the causes of action in the first
amended complaint were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.
Defendant now contends that the instant action and alleges identical causes of
action and contemplates the same underlying facts as the 2021 matter, given
that the instant action deals with Defendant’s alleged unlawful
confinement of Plaintiff’s mother, Patricia Deutsch, in its care facility from
October 2012 until her death on July 21, 2015. 
 
The Court agrees with Defendant. Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 391 subdivision (b)(1), Plaintiff is considered
a vexatious litigant. In the last seven years, Plaintiff has filed five pro per
civil lawsuits that were all adjudicated against her: 
 
(1)  
Janice
Deutsch v. Rick Hill, Case No. ED CV 19-824-JLS (KS) (C.D.
Cal.) filed on May 2, 2019, which resulted in a judgment of dismissal. (Request
for Judicial Notice (JN), ¶¶ 6-7 and Exhibits 3 and 4.)
(2)  
Janice
Deutsch v. NBC News Los Angeles, LASC Case No.
21BBCV00309, filed on March 30, 2021, which resulted in the granting of an
anti-SLAPP motion filed by NBC. (JN ¶ 1.) 

(3)  
Janice
Deutsch v. CBS News Los Angeles, LASC Case No.
21BBCV00312, filed on April 1, 2021, which resulted in the granting of an
anti-SLAPP motion filed by CBS. (JN ¶ 3.) 
(4)  
Janice
Deutsch, Estate of Patricia Deutsch, Duff Shidaker v. Mission Hospital,
LASC Case No. 21STCV36156, filed on October 1, 2021, which resulted in a
sustained demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend. (JN ¶
5)
(5)  
Janice
Deutsch, Estate of Patricia Deutsch, Duff Shidaker v. Braswell’s Colonial Care,
LASC Case No. 21STCV36154, filed on October 1, 2021, which resulted in a
sustained demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend based
on the applicable statutes of limitations barring the alleged causes of action.
(JN ¶ 8.)
 
Further, in addition to the instant
action, Plaintiff has filed six other pro per actions in Los Angeles Superior
Court. (JN ¶¶ 9-14.) 
 
Plaintiff is also considered a vexatious
litigant under Code of Civil Procedure section 391 subdivision (b)(2). 
 
“What constitutes ‘repeatedly’ and
‘unmeritorious’ under subdivision (b)(3), in any given case, is left to the
sound discretion of the trial court.”  (Morton, supra, 156
Cal.App.4th at 971 [three motions over three years involving two separate
judgments did not qualify as repeated filing of unmeritorious motions].) 
“While there is no bright-line rule as to what constitutes ‘repeatedly,’ most
cases affirming the vexatious litigant designation involve situations where
litigants have filed dozens of motions either during the pendency of an action
or relating to the same judgment.”  (Id. at p. 972 [citing Bravo
v. Ismaj (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 211, 225 [court found that
approximately 20 motions constituted “repeated” because they all arose during
the same action and many of the motions were identical to motions previously
brought and denied]].) In the
event a plaintiff’s conduct satisfies the above test, the court may require
them to furnish security and/or dismiss the litigation. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
391, 391.1).
 
The 2021 action against Defendant alleged similar causes of
action and was based on identical facts as the instant action: Defendant’s alleged
false imprisonment and mistreatment of her mother at its skilled nursing
facility from October 2012 to August 2015. The ultimate outcome of the 2021
action was a sustained demurrer
without leave to amend, due a statutes of limitations defense, which qualifies
as a “final determination against the same
defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally determined.”
(Code Civ. Proc, § 391(b)(2).) 
 
Additionally, Plaintiff has
no reasonable probability of prevailing against Defendant in the instant action
for the same reasons that the 2021 action failed. The instant action asserts
identical causes of action as the 2021 action, arising from conduct that
occurred prior to Decedent’s death on July 21, 2015
and is filed an additional 3 years after the 2021 action and more than 9 years
after the alleged offending acts. Because the 2021 action was fully barred by
the statute of limitations, the instant action, arising from the same conduct
as the 2021 action, would also reasonably be barred by the applicable statutes
of limitations, given that the instant action is filed three years after the
2021 action. Further, as Defendant contends, the doctrine of res judicata
precludes recovery by Plaintiff in a lawsuit involving claims which were
previously asserted, litigated and adjudicated in Defendant’s favor.
 
Lastly, the Court notes that Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition. 
 
The Court next considers the viability
of the subject case presented for purposes of determining the necessity of
posting security in order to proceed. “The motion for an order requiring
plaintiff to furnish security shall be based upon the ground, and supported by
a showing, that the plaintiffs is a vexatious litigation and that there is not
a reasonable probability that he or she will prevail in the litigation.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 391.1(a), 391.3(a).) 
 
As stated above, based on the outcome
of the 2021 action and its identical nature to the instant action, there is not
a reasonable probability that Plaintiff will prevail against Defendant.
Therefore, the Court orders the posting of a security. 
 
The
statute requires the plaintiff to furnish security “for the benefit of the
moving defendant, security in such amount and within such time as the court
shall fix.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 391.3(a).) “The vexatious litigant statutes
were enacted to require a person found a vexatious litigant to put up security for
the reasonable expenses of a defendant who becomes the target of one of these
obsessive and persistent litigants whose conduct can cause serious financial
results to the unfortunate object of his attack. The purpose of the statutory
scheme is to deal with the problem created by the persistent and obsessive
litigant who has constantly pending a number of groundless actions, often
against the judges and other court officers who decide or were concerned in the
decision of previous actions adversely to him.” (Holcomb v. U.S. Bank
Nat. Assn.
(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1504.) Given the complaint is against Defendant,
damages come from a potentially successful claim and attorney fees defending
the action. (Muller v. Tanner (1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 445, 452 [“the amount of the security is
defined as the moving party’s ‘reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees
and not limited to taxable costs, incurred in, or in connection with’ the
litigation”].)  
 
The Court cannot determine
the reasonable expenses for attorney fees and costs at this point. The Court
will therefore set a supplemental briefing schedule to determine the amount of
security. Defendant is ordered to submit a supplemental brief in support of the
security amount. Plaintiff’s failure
to comply with the security order could lead to dismissal of the action. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 391.4.)  
 
“In addition to any other relief
provided in this title, the court may, on its own motion or the motion of any
party, enter a prefiling order which prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing
any new litigation in the courts of this state in propria persona without first
obtaining leave of the presiding justice or presiding judge of the court where
the litigation is proposed to be filed. Disobedience of the order by a
vexatious litigant may be punished as a contempt of court.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
391.7(a).) The presiding judge “shall permit the filing of that litigation only
if it appears that the litigation has merit and has not been filed for purposes
of harassment or delay” and “may condition the filing of the litigation upon
the furnishing of security for the benefit of the defendants. (Id. §
391.7(b).) 
 
The Court enters a prefiling order
prohibiting Plaintiff from filing any new litigation in the courts of this
state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the court.  
 

III.
DISPOSITION
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to declare Plaintiff a
vexatious litigant is GRANTED in its entirety. The Court will discuss briefing
schedule for security amount at the time of the hearing.
 
Defendant is to give notice.
