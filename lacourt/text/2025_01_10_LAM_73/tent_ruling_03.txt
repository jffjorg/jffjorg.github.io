I. BACKGROUND
 
On January 26, 2024, plaintiffs Claire Donahue (Plaintiff) filed
her complaint against defendants 427 S Mariposa Partners LP, La Urban Living
LLC, Jeclim LLC, Jeremy Miller, Philip G. Miller, and Annie Boxell
(collectively, Defendants). Plaintiff alleged the following causes of action:
(1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability, (2) Nuisance, (3) Breach of
Contract, (4) Negligence, (5) Negligent Misrepresentation, (6) Constructive
Eviction, (7) Premises Liability, (8) Fraud, and (9) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress.  These causes of
action arise out of a water leak and mold growths in Plaintiff’s bedroom
ceiling.
 
On August 7, 2024, Partners filed a Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Monetary
Sanctions, arguing:
·               
The
court is authorized to compel further responses to Partners’ Special
Interrogatories under California Code of Civil Procedure[1]
2030.300.
o   Under section 2030.300, subd. (a)(1), a propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that “an answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete.” (§ 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
·               
Plaintiff’s
responses are deficient and require an order compelling further responses.
o   Plaintiff provided one responsive document seemingly meant to respond to
each defendant’s Special Interrogatories, even though Partners’ requests were
different than those from other defendants.
o   Plaintiff only prepared responses to 35 interrogatories out of the 104
interrogatories propounded on her, and it is unclear which interrogatories she
prepared responses to because Plaintiff’s responses do not correctly identify
any of the Interrogatories propounded on her.
o   Plaintiff’s responses are incomplete, evasive,
non-responsive, and produced in violation of section 2030.210(a). 
·               
Partners
made a good faither effort to resolve the discovery issues.
o   This type of motion “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (§ 2030.300, subd. (b).) A meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion. (§ 2016.040.)
o   On April 25, 2024, Partners’ counsel sent an email to Plaintiff’s
counsel, Armand Jaafari of Grand Park Law Group, APC, to confer about
Plaintiff’s failure to respond to their written discovery requests due on April
24, 2024.
§  Less than an
hour later, Plaintiffs’ attorney responded and claimed that Partners failed to
serve their written discovery requests in violation of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1010.6, subd. (b)(3). 
§  On the same
day, Partners’ counsel offered to grant Plaintiff an extension on her
responses. 
§  On April 30,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel said that he would accept documents served
electronically from April 30, 2024 onward. 
§  Partners’
counsel agreed to a June 4, 2024 due date.
o   On June 7,
2024, Partners had still not received Plaintiff’s answers and sent a second
meet and confer letter, allowing Plaintiff to respond by June 14, 2024 with
verified answers without objections. 
o   On June 18,
2024, Plaintiff electronically served their responses to the Special
Interrogatories, Set One.
§  Partners’
alleges the responses were deficient as described above.
o   On July 29,
2024, Partners sent a third meet and confer letter, describing the deficiencies
in Plaintiff’s responses. 
o   On August 5,
2024, Partners’ counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel to arrange for an informal
discovery conference and requesting an extension of time to file any required
motions to compel further responses. 
o   At time of
filing this motion, Plaintiff has not responded to any communication.
·               
Monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff are warranted for failure to properly respond to
legitimate discovery and for necessitating the motion. 
o   “To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing
may impose … sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of
the discovery process…” (§ 2023.030.) 
o   “Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to . . .
(e) Making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to
discovery . . . (f) Making an evasive response to discovery . . . (h) Making or
opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to
compel or to limit discovery . . ..” (§ 2023.010.) 
o   “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (§ 2030.290(c).) 
o   The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party
who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion
was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, 3.1348(b).)
§  Partners cites to older rule 3.1030(a), but their statement is correct.
·               
Partners’
counsel asks for $2,140 in monetary sanctions: 
o   4.5 hour for preparation of the motion and related
documents x $260 per hour = $1,170
o   1.0 preparing for preparing a reply to Plaintiff’s
anticipated opposition x $260 per hour = $260
o   2.5 hours for preparing for and attending a hearing
on this motion x $260 per hour = $650
 Partners
states that:
·               
Plaintiffs has not filed her opposition and
requests their “Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Defendant’s
Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Monetary Sanctions filed and
served on August 7, 2024 be granted.” (Notice of Non-Opposition p. 2.)
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for Motion to Compel Further Reponses to Special Interrogatories
 
Similarly, upon receipt of responses to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if they deem the responses to be “evasive or incomplete” or if “[a]n
objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (§§ 2030.300,
subd. (a)(1); 2030.300 subd. (a)(3).)  A motion to compel further
responses to interrogatories must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (§§ 2016.040; 2030.300 subd.
(b)(1).) The motion must also be accompanied by a separate statement containing
the text of the interrogatories at issue, the text of each response at issue,
and a statement of the reasons why a further response is required, though the
court may permit a party to submit “a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute” in lieu of a separate statement. (§
2030.300(b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, 3.1345(b).)¿¿ 
 
“To show an interrogatory seeks relevant, discoverable
information ‘is not the burden of [the party propounding interrogatories].’ As
a litigant, it is entitled to demand answers to its interrogatories, as a
matter of right, and without a prior showing, unless the party on whom those
interrogatories are served objects and shows cause why the questions are not
within the purview of the code section." (West Pico Furniture Co. v.
Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 422; see Greyhound Corp. v.
Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 378.) While the party propounding
interrogatories may have the burden of filing a motion to compel if it finds
the answers it receives unsatisfactory, the burden of justifying any objection
and failure to respond remains at all times with the party resisting an
interrogatory. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221.)” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal. 5th 531, 541.) 
 
B.      Discussion
 
To prevail on
a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories, a propounding party
must show (i) the responding party’s responses were evasive or incomplete, (ii)
a meet-and-confer declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at
an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion,” and (iii) a
separate statement of the reasons why further response is required.
 
1.                 
Plaintiff’s
Responses Are Evasive or Incomplete.
 
Plaintiff’s
responses are evasive or incomplete for the reasons Partners provided. Plaintiff
provided one responsive document addressed to all defendants, not to Partners. (Motion,
Exh. C p. 1.) By not addressing a single party, the responses are evasive as to
whom Plaintiff is answering. 
 
Plaintiff
only responded to 35 interrogatories out of the 104 interrogatories propounded
on her. (Motion, Exh. C pp. 3-10.) Plaintiff’s answers are therefore
incomplete.
 
It
is unclear which interrogatories Plaintiff responded to because Plaintiff’s
responses do not correctly identify any of the Interrogatories propounded on
her. (Motion, Exh. C pp. 3-10.) As an example, Partners’ Special Interrogatory
No. 17 asks “Please state
the total amount of all economic damages you assert you are entitled to recover
as a result of DEFENDANT’s conduct.” (Motion, Exh. A, p. 5.) Plaintiff’s
responsive document states that Special Interrogatory No. 17 is “Please state
all facts in support of the contentions asserted in the paragraph 23 of your.” (Motion, Exh. C p. 6.). Because the Plaintiff’s responses
do not correctly identify or match the first 35 special interrogatories,
Plaintiff’s answers are incomplete and evasive. 
 
As
the court finds Plaintiff’s responses evasive and incomplete, there is good
cause to compel Plaintiff’s responses. 
 
2.                 
Defendant
Attempted to Meet and Confer.
 
A motion to
compel further responses to requests for production must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under section 2016.040. (§ 2031.310.) Such a
declaration must state facts a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (§ 2016.040.) A party may
meet the informal resolution requirement by showing an exchange of letters or a
telephone call. (§ 2023.010, subd. (I) - providing that “failing to confer in
person, by telephone, or by letter” constitutes misuse of discovery
process.) 
 
Partners’
meets the second requirement, because it has provided a declaration showing
that it attempted to resolve its issues with the responses in reasonable and
good faith. Partners attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel through
email on April 15, June 7, and July 29 of last year. (Decl. Ghattas ¶¶ 4, 9,
11.) Each time Partners’ counsel offered to or granted an extension. (Decl.
Ghattas ¶¶ 4, 9, 11.) Partners’ meet and confer letter from July 29, 2024
described its issues with Plaintiff’s response. Those issues are the same ones
described above. 
 
Therefore, Partners
has shown a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the
issue regarding responses to the special interrogatories. 
 
3.                 
Defendant’s
Separate Statement
 
Partners’ meets the last requirement, because the
motion must also be accompanied by a separate statement containing the text of
the interrogatories at issue, the text of each response at issue, and a
statement of the reasons why a further response is required. (Separate
Statement pp. 2-29.) Partners either claims “Plaintiff did not provide a
response to this interrogatory” or Plaintiff’s response “was nonresponsive to
the interrogatory actually propounded by the defendant” and “[t]hus,
Plaintiff’s response is entirely nonresponsive to the interrogatory posed.” As
the separate statement includes the text of the interrogatories, the text of
the responses, and its issues with the responses, the third requirement is met.

 
Thus, Partners meets all three elements and has shown good
cause to compel further responses to written discovery and an attempt at
resolving the issues outside of court. Partners' efforts having failed, the court
will GRANT the Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One.
 
C.      Legal
Standard for Request for Monetary Sanctions
 
Attorney’s
fees are mandatory against a “party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel further response[s]” unless the court finds
that the one to be sanctioned “acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (§ 2031.310,
subd. (h).) 
 
D.     Discussion
 
“The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, 3.1348(b).) “When the trial court
is informed of the extent and nature of the legal services rendered, it may
rely on its own experience and knowledge in determining their reasonable
value.” (In re Marriage of Huntington (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1524.)
 
Partners’ requests $2,140 in monetary sanctions for the motion at a rate
of $260 per hour plus $60 to file. (Decl. Ghattas ¶¶ 14, 15.) Partners’ counsel contends that it took 4.5 hour for
preparation of the motion and related documents, 1.0 preparing for preparing a
reply to Plaintiff’s anticipated opposition, and 2.5 hours for preparing for
and attending a hearing on this motion. (Decl. Ghattas ¶ 14.) The court finds the claimed hours to exceed the
reasonable range for the execution of the tasks described. The motion is
simple and the reply is less than a page long.
 
Instead, the court finds it proper to award Attorney Ghattas 7 hours of
attorney work at a rate of $260 per hour. This comes to a total of $1,880, with
$60 for filing. Sanctions are to be paid within thirty (30) days from the date
of Plaintiff serving a notice of this Order. 
 

III. DISPOSITION
 
The court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request
for Monetary Sanctions, compliance within 
20 days
 
The court AWARDS Attorney Ghattas 7 hours of attorney
work at a rate of $260 per hour. This results in a total of $1,880, with $60 for
filing, payable within 20 days.
