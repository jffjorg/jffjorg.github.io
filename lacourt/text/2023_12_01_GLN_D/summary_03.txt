And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to open a Superior Court file and establish jurisdiction over an underinsured motorist arbitration matter. The petition was filed by Blue Hill Specialty Insurance Company, but the judge notes that the petition fails to establish that the court is a proper court to assume jurisdiction under Insurance Code § 11580.2(f). The judge will hear argument and consider evidence on the jurisdiction issue, including whether Los Angeles County is a proper county for the filing of a suit for bodily injury and whether Los Angeles County is a county specified in the policy or a policy endorsement as a proper county for arbitration or an action. If the court is not satisfied with the showing submitted, the petition will be dismissed without prejudice.
