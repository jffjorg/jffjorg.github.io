English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion for terminating sanctions and requests for issue and evidentiary sanctions, as well as monetary sanctions. The motion is brought by Plaintiff Norma Orozco against Defendant Bodega Latina Corporation, alleging that the Defendant willfully destroyed or concealed security camera footage that would have supported Plaintiff's sexual harassment claims. The Court finds that Plaintiff has not shown a willful failure to comply with a court order and denies the motion for terminating sanctions. The Court also denies Plaintiff's request for issue and evidentiary sanctions, finding that the motion was procedurally improper. As for monetary sanctions, the Court grants Defendant's request for $1,000.00 against Plaintiff and her counsel, finding that the amount of time spent by Defendant's counsel on the opposition was excessive.
