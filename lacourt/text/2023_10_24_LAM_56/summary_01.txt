Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Holly J. Fujie regarding a motion to compel responses to supplemental special interrogatories served on defendants by plaintiffs. The motion is denied in part and granted in part. The request to compel defendants' responses is denied as the request is moot since defendants have finally provided the discovery. However, the court grants the request to impose monetary sanctions of $1,710 against defendants for their failure to respond to discovery and for waiting until after the motion was filed to serve their responses.
