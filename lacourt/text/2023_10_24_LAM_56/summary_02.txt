And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from the plaintiffs. The defendant had asked the court to compel the plaintiffs to provide further responses to the interrogatories because the plaintiffs' initial responses were evasive and incomplete. The judge found that the plaintiffs' objections to the interrogatories were meritless and that the interrogatories seek relevant information related to the allegations in the pleadings. The judge also noted that the motion was unopposed and that the defendant had satisfied the meet and confer requirement. The judge ordered the plaintiffs to provide further responses to the interrogatories and ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
