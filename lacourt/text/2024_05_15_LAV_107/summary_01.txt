English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant's motion to be relieved from deemed admissions and denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The case involves a premises liability negligence lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Mary Howard against Defendant El Camino Shopping Center, et al. The dispute centers on whether Defendant's responses to Plaintiff's requests for admission were timely. The Court finds that Defendant's mistake, inadvertence, or neglect in failing to timely respond to the requests for admission was inexcusable. The Court also finds that Plaintiff would not suffer any prejudice if the motion were granted, as both trial and the discovery cut-off have been rescheduled to August 26, 2024. Finally, the Court denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions, as there is no statute that independently authorizes the imposition of sanctions for discovery misconduct.
