[1] This and the
following cases all refer to § 476, not § 2033.300, but the terms
"mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect" are understood to have
the same meaning in the two statutes and cases analyzing motions under
§ 2033.300 regularly cite from cases analyzed under § 476. (New
Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1418,
1420.)
