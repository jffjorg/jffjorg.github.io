Summary:

The document is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a motion for terminating sanctions and issue and evidentiary sanctions filed by the Plaintiffs/Cross-Parties against the Defendants/Cross-Defendants. The Judge holds that the motion is taken off-calendar because it was filed late, after the deadline for hearing discovery motions had passed. The Judge also notes that the parties' remedy for late receipt of written discovery is a motion in limine to exclude the evidence, or for a relevant jury instruction, or some other trial-related sanction. The Judge concludes that the motion for sanctions is denied.
