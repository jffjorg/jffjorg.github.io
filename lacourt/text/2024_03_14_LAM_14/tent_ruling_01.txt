  Case Number:  18STCV02568    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  14 Case Background
 
Plaintiff Kerry Moy (“Kerry”) and
Defendant Kin Hui (hereinafter “Hui”) are business partners; each owns half of their
set of Chinese restaurants. Apparently, Plaintiff Kerry also works for
Cross-Defendant Morgan Stanley. Plaintiff Kerry alleges that Defendant Hui is
keeping the restaurants from paying their leases and certain large loans.
Defendant Hui alleges that he only entered the business venture because he
thought it was part of an investment program run by Morgan Stanley. Defendant
Hui further alleges that Plaintiff Kerry mismanaged construction on the
restaurants and forced Defendant Hui to finish the projects.

Trial Date
 
Jury Trial is currently set for March
14, 2024.
 
Instant Motion
 
Plaintiffs Moy LLC and Kerry,
together with Cross-Parties M2K California, Kwan, Zao, QPack, Volcano, and M2K Delaware,
now move the court for an order imposing terminating sanctions against
Defendants/Cross-Defendants Monkee Entities, Triple 8 Entities, Tasty Dining,
Hoover, Hui, and Huis Investment. In the alternative, the moving parties seek
issue and evidentiary sanctions. This motion was filed on March 5, 2024.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is TAKEN OFF-CALENDAR.
 
Discussion
 
            Discovery
closed in this case on March 25, 2023. The sole exception, through multiple
court orders, has been the taking of a series of depositions to which counsel
agreed on March 20, 2023. That agreement, and the subsequent court orders,
referenced only the taking of depositions, not document discovery. The only
written discovery re-opened by the court was the exchange of expert
information. (Order filed January 8, 2024).
 
In fact, the parties no longer have
a right to bring this motion. Motions “concerning discovery” must be heard at
least 15 days before trial. Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.020(a); Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1585-90. This includes motions for discovery sanctions. This motion for
sanctions was filed on March 5, 2024, the day after this case was called
for trial. 
 
The last request to re-open
discovery in this case was made to this court via a motion which was heard on
January 8, 2024. In its order on that motion, this court directed that non-expert
discovery must be completed by February 9, 2024. (Order filed January 8, 2024,
p. 8). The court directed that expert discovery should be completed by February
22, 2024. (Id.). No special adjustment was made to the motion deadline. The
order also warned counsel that, after those deadlines ran, “the case must be
settled or tried, in whatever state it may be.” (Id.). 
 
On February 22, 2024, counsel for
the various parties brought three ex parte applications regarding non-expert
discovery. But by then, both the court’s February 9, 2024, deadline and the
statutory 15-day deadline had already passed. None of the three ex parte
applications requested that the court re-open discovery proceedings, and all
were denied. Only a fourth application, seeking to shorten time for a hearing
on a motion for leave to amend the complaint, was granted.
 
At this point, counsel’s remedy for
the late receipt of written discovery is a motion in limine to exclude the
evidence, or for a relevant jury instruction, or some other trial-related
sanction. Likewise, counsel’s remedy for refusal to sit for deposition, or
evasion or refusal to answer certain questions, is a motion in limine to
restrict testimony, or for a relevant jury instruction, or some other trial-related
sanction.
 
Even had the motion been filed and set
for hearing in a timely fashion, the court would still have directed the
parties to proceed by motion in limine. Orders that limit or shape the evidence
to be presented at trial should be made at trial, to ensure that (a) the
sanctions are appropriately tailored to the case as it has been developed and
(b) they achieve the intended goals.
 
Conclusion
 
            Discovery
is now closed. The deadline for hearing discovery motions has passed. No timely
request to re-open was made. Therefore, the court cannot hear a motion for
discovery sanctions. But even if it could, the court would direct counsel to
present their sanctions requests as motions in limine at the time of trial. Handling
evidentiary issues in advance of trial is difficult; the better practice is to
address them at time of trial when all the evidence can be marshaled and
discussed at once. 
 
            For all
these reasons, the motion for sanctions filed on March 5, 2024, is TAKEN
OFF-CALENDAR.
