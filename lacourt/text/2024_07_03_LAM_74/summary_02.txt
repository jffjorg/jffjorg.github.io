And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Farmers Insurance Company, Inc., et al., to the complaint filed by plaintiff Danny Young. The judge has found that the complaint is not uncertain and therefore overrules the demurrer on that ground. However, the judge has sustained the demurrer on the grounds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. The judge has ruled that the defendants do not owe a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff and that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to impose liability against the defendants under either of the two theories of aiding and abetting liability. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint and has ordered the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
