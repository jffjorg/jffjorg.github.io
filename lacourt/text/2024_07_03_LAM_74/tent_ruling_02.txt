 Case Number:  23STCV22385    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  74 Danny Young
v. Farmers Insurance Company, Inc., et al.
Defendants’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s
Complaint.
 
Uncertainty
A
demurrer for uncertainty will “not be sustained if the allegations are
sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues that must be met,
even if the allegations of the complaint may not be as clear and detailed as
might be desired.” (Bacon v. Wahrhaftig (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 599, 606.)
“A demurrer for uncertainty will not lie where the ambiguous facts alleged are
presumptively within the knowledge of the demurring party.” (Ibid.)
Here,
the Court does not find that the Complaint is uncertain and therefore OVERRULES
the demurrer of Defendants on the grounds of uncertainty. The Complaint
differentiates between the parties and Defendants are apprised of the issues
that they must meet. 
Sufficiency
of the First Cause of Action 
To
state a cause of action for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,
Plaintiff must allege the following: (1) a third party’s breach of fiduciary
duties owed to Plaintiff; (2) Defendants’ actual knowledge of that breach of
fiduciary duties; (3) substantial assistance or encouragement by Defendants to
the third party’s breach; and (4) Defendants’ conduct was a substantial factor
in causing harm to Plaintiff. (Nasrawi v. Buck Consultants LLC (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 328, 343.) 
 “[A]n insurer is not a fiduciary, and owes no
obligation to consider the interests of its insured above its own.” (Village
Northridge Homeowners Assn. v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. (2010) 50
Cal.4th 913, 929.) An insurance adjuster also does not owe a fiduciary duty to
the insured with whom the dispute lies. (Thompson v. Cannon (1990) 224
Cal.App.3d 1413, 1418.) 
“[A]n
insurer’s breach of its fiduciary-like duties is adequately redressed by a
claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the
insurance contract.” (Tran v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th
1202, 1212.) “[C]ivil liability for aiding and abetting the commission of a
tort, which has no overlaid requirement of an independent duty, differs
fundamentally from liability based on conspiracy to commit a tort.” (Berg
& Berg Enterprises, LLC v. Sherwood Partners, Inc. (2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 802, 823, fn. 10.) 
“[T]here
are two different theories pursuant to which a person may be liable for aiding
and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.” (American Master Lease LLC v.
Idanta Partners, Ltd. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1451, 1477.) “One theory, like
conspiracy to breach a fiduciary duty, requires that the aider and abettor owe
a fiduciary duty to the victim and requires only that the aider and abettor provide
substantial assistance to the person breaching his or her fiduciary duty.” (Ibid.)
“The second theory for imposing liability for aiding and abetting a breach of
fiduciary duty arises when the aider and abettor commits an independent tort.”
(Ibid.) “This occurs when the aider and abettor makes a conscious
decision to participate in tortious activity for the purpose of assisting
another in performing a wrongful act.” (Ibid.) 
Here,
given that Defendants Behm and Farmers do not owe a fiduciary duty to
Plaintiff, the Court finds that Plaintiff cannot impose liability against
Defendants under the first theory of aiding and abetting liability pursuant to American
Master Lease, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th 1451, 1477. Plaintiff does not
dispute the principle of law or argument advanced by Defendants that neither
Defendant Farmers nor Defendant Behm owed Plaintiff a fiduciary duty. 
The
Court also finds that the allegations of the Complaint are insufficient to
impose liability against Defendants under the second theory articulated in American
Master Lease, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th 1451, 1477. (Complaint, ¶¶
55-59.) Plaintiff has failed to allege that actions of Defendants constituted an
independent tort or identify an independent tort committed by Defendants. (Id.)

The
Court therefore SUSTAINS the demurrer of Defendants to the Complaint with leave
to amend. The Court finds that there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. 
 
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court sustains Defendants’ demurrer to the Complaint with
20 days’ leave to amend. 
Defendants shall give
notice.
