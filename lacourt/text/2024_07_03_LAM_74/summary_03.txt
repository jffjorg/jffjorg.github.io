And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Defendant Global-IP Cayman's motion to compel further responses to the first set of Request for Production of Documents (set one) and privilege log. The court orders Plaintiff Chris Chen to serve, verified, supplemental responses to request for production of documents (set one) and produce a privilege log within 10 days. The court also imposes sanctions of $9,000 on Plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of this order.

The court finds that Plaintiff's responses to certain RFPs are not code-compliant and fail to provide sufficient factual information. The court also finds that Plaintiff's objections to the requests are invalid and that the communications requested are relevant to bias and credibility. The court orders Plaintiff to serve supplemental responses and produce a privilege log to support his claims of privilege.

The court also imposes sanctions on Plaintiff's counsel for $9,000, reduced from the requested $14,760, due to the motion's lack of complexity. The court notes that Plaintiff did not provide code-compliant responses and that no other circumstances suggest imposing sanctions would be unjust.
