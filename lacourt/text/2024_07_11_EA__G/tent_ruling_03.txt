Respondent: Plaintiff Yueh Chun Tseng
 
TENTATIVE
RULING

Defendant Lori
Lonchin Chuang’s Demurrer to Complaint is OVERRULED.
 
Defendant Chuang
is ordered to file an Answer to the First Amended Complaint in ten (10) days. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a quiet title and negligence action. Plaintiff Yueh
Chun Tseng alleges Tseng is the sole owner of a property in Walnut. In March
2020, Tseng alleges Defendant Lori Lonchin Chuang notarized Tseng’s signature
on a grant deed for the Walnut property when Tseng never appeared before Chuang
to sign any documents. In April 2020, Tseng alleges Defendant Randy Chan
recorded an illegitimate grant deed that claimed ownership of Tseng’s property.
 
On December 11, 2023, Tseng filed a complaint against Chan,
Chuang, and Does 1-25, alleging causes of action for (1) quiet title and (2)
negligence.
 
On February 1, 2024, Tseng filed a First Amended Complaint
(FAC) against the same defendants alleging the same causes of action.
 
On April 2, 2024, Chan filed a cross-complaint against
Tseng, Chuang, and Roes 1-20, alleging a single cause of action for equitable
lien.
 
On April 9, 2024, Chuang filed a cross-complaint against
Roes 1-50, alleging causes of action for (1) negligence, (2) conversion, (3)
equitable indemnity, and (4) equitable contribution.
 
On May 9, 2024, Chuang filed the present demurrer. On June
20, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the present demurrer for parties
to further meet and confer. On June 24, 2024, Chuang’s counsel attempted to
meet and confer telephonically with Tseng’s counsel. (Feazell Suppl. Decl., ¶ 6-8.)
 
A hearing on the present demurrer and a case management
conference are set for July 11, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS

Chuang demurs to Tseng’s second cause of
action for negligence on the grounds that the FAC fails to establish Chuang
owed Tseng a duty of care. For the following reasons, the Court OVERRULES Chuang’s demurrer.
 
Legal Standard

Demurrer
 
A party may demur to a complaint on the
grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept
all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
 
Negligence
 
The basic elements of a negligence claim are
(1) duty, (2) breach, (3) causation, and (4) damages. (Leslie G. v. Perry
& Associates (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 472, 480.) Because “[a]llegations of
negligence have long been exempted from the code pleading requirement to state
the facts constituting the cause of action,” it may be pleaded generally. (McCoy
v. Gustafson (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 56, 102.)
 
Discussion

In this case, the FAC alleges that on March
31, 2020, Chuang notarized Tseng’s signature on a grant deed. (FAC, ¶ 12.) The
FAC further alleges Tseng never appeared before Chuang to sign any documents
and that Chuang breached a duty of care in failing to confirm the individual
appearing before Chuang was Tseng. (FAC, ¶ 12-13.) In demurring to the FAC,
Chuang essentially argues the FAC fails to plead these facts with specificity.
(Demurrer, p. 6:19-24.) But this argument ignores the rule that negligence may
be pleaded generally. Because notaries have a duty to confirm the identities of
those whose signatures they notarize, the court finds these facts are
sufficient to state a cause of action for negligence. (See Garton v. Title
Ins. & Trust Co. (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 365, 377-378.)
 
To the extent Chuang also demurs to the first
cause of action against another defendant and attempts to contradict the FAC
with unsupported facts from outside the four corners of the FAC, the court
disregards these arguments as improper. 
 
Accordingly, Chuang’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, Chuang’s demurrer to Tseng’s FAC is OVERRULED. 
Defendant Chuang
is ordered to file an Answer to the First Amended Complaint in ten (10) days.
