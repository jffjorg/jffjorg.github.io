And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to determine the value of the Pomona property and send a buyout notice. The property was acquired through a grant deed in April 1994 and mortgaged through Travelers and MERS. After the death of Maria Luisa Sandoval in October 2022, the relationship between the plaintiff, Ramiro S. Lopez, and the defendant, Sandra Garcia, deteriorated. The plaintiff failed to provide a copy of the appraisal referenced in the motion and did not establish why a court-ordered appraisal is cost-prohibitive. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to meet the statutory standard and therefore denies the motion.
