And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Lori Lonchin Chuang's demurrer to Plaintiff Yueh Chun Tseng's complaint. The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint states a cause of action for negligence against Defendant Chuang. The complaint alleges that Defendant Chuang notarized Plaintiff's signature on a grant deed without Plaintiff's presence, and that Defendant Chuang breached a duty of care in failing to confirm the individual appearing before her was Plaintiff. The Judge found that these facts are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligence, despite Defendant Chuang's argument that the complaint fails to plead these facts with specificity. As a result, Defendant Chuang is ordered to file an answer to the first amended complaint within 10 days.
