And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for a trial preference. The plaintiff, Amy Dolores Chavez, is 86 years old and alleges that she was injured as a result of the defendants' negligence. The plaintiff has submitted medical documentation showing that she has ongoing medical issues and will likely continue to decline in health. The judge finds that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the action and that her health and age are such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The judge has ordered that the case be set for trial in late January or early to mid-February 2025, and has encouraged counsel to consider negotiating a case management stipulation and order to shorten usual discovery and deadlines to accommodate the expedited trial setting and facilitate alternative dispute resolution before the final status conference.
