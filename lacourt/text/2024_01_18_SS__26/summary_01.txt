The judge has tentatively ruled that the Motion for Attorney's Fees filed by Plaintiff Pritpal Walia's successor in interest, Manmohan Walia, is continued to March 21, 2024. The plaintiff is required to file and serve a supplemental brief addressing the standard for determining a prevailing party under Government Code section 12965 by February 29, 2024. The defendant is required to file and serve a responsive brief by March 7, 2024. The judge has also decided that the Motion is brought pursuant to the statutory right to attorney's fees under Government Code section 12965, but has continued the hearing to allow the parties to further brief the issue of the "prevailing party" under that statute.
