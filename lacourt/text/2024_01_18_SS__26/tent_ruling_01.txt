ANALYSIS: 
 
This action arises
from the employment of Plaintiff Pritpal Walia (“Plaintiff”) as an afternoon
aid for Defendant Azusa Unified School District (“Defendant”). On August 5,
2019, Plaintiff filed the operative Complaint for (1) FEHA discrimination, (2)
FEHA retaliation, (3) FEHA failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation,
(4) FEHA failure to provide reasonable accommodations, (5) FEHA failure to
engage in the interactive process, (6) declaratory relief, and (7) failure to
permit inspection of personnel and payroll records. The action was initially
filed as an unlimited civil case. 
 
Plaintiff passed away during the pendency of
this action and a stipulation was filed allowing their successor-in-interest,
Manmohan Walia (“Plaintiff’s successor”), to substitute into the case. (Stip
and Order, 05/18/21.) On March 21, 2022, the action was reclassified to the
limited jurisdiction court. 
 
On November 19, 2019, trial in this matter
was set for August 17, 2020. Trial was then continued multiple times until
October 25, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the Court held a hearing on Defendant’s
Motion to Quash Trial Subpoenas, at which time it set an Order to Show Cause
regarding Bench Trial v. Jury Trial for October 11, 2022. (Minute Order,
10/04/22.) On October 11, 2022, the OSC was continued to November 3, 2022.
(Minute Order, 10/11/22.) 
 
On October 25, 2022, the Court did not call
the matter for trial and placed it off calendar. (Minute Order, 10/25/22.) On
November 3, 2022, the Court set a Motion to Determine Bench Trial vs Jury Trial
for January 10, 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Court set the matter for jury
trial. (Minute Order, 01/10/23.) On August 4, 2023, the parties filed a 998
offer to compromise and the Court entered judgment accordingly on August 28,
2023. (Offer to Compromise, filed 08/04/23.) Judgment was entered in the amount
of $7,999.99 in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant. (Judgment, 08/28/23.)
Notice of entry of judgment was filed on October 20, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs on
October 24, 2023. Defendant filed a Motion to Tax and/or Strike Costs on
November 8, 2023, which is set for hearing on January 25, 2024. On December 11,
2023, Plaintiff filed  a Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, then a revised Motion for Attorney’s Fees on December 15,
2023. Defendant filed an opposition on January 4, 2024 and Plaintiff replied on
January 11, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
Timing of
Motion
 
A motion for attorney’s fees must be filed
and served with the time for filing a notice of appeal under Cal. Rules of
Court Rule 8.822. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1702(a).) Cal. Rules of Court
Rule 8.822 states that an appeal must be filed within either (1) 30 days after
the trial court clerk served the party filing the motion with notice of entry
of judgment; or (2) 90 days after entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court
8.822(1).) The parties can stipulate to extend the deadline by 30 days in a
limited civil case. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1702(a)(1)(A). 
 
Notice of entry of judgment was served on
Defendant on October 17, 2023. (Notice of Entry of Judgment, filed 10/20/23, p.
4, ¶3.) 30 days thereafter was November 16, 2023, however, the initial Motion
for Attorney’s Fees was not served until December 8, 2023, nor filed until
December 11, 2023. (Proof of Service, filed 12/11/23, p. 2.) The revised and
instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees was not filed or served until December 15,
2023. Plaintiff is correct that the 30-day deadline is not jurisdictional: under
Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1702(d), the Court may extend the time for filing an
attorney’s fees motion for good cause. The Motion argues that good cause exists
because Defendant will not be prejudiced by the extension, Plaintiff has
incurred significant fees, and preparation of this motion was exceedingly
time-consuming.
 
“Rule 3.1702(d) is ‘remedial’ and is to be
given a liberal, rather than strict interpretation. [Citation.]” (Lewow v.
Surfside III Condominium Owners Assn., Inc. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 128, 135,
137 Cal.Rptr.3d 376 (Lewow).) Flexibility is built into Rule 3.1702 through
subdivision (d), which allows a judge “ ‘[f]or good cause’ ” to “extend the
time for filing a motion for attorney's fees in the absence of a stipulation or
for a longer period than allowed by stipulation.” A court may grant a request
for extension of time to file a motion for attorney's fees even if the motion
is not filed until after the deadline for filing an attorney's fees motion
under Rule 3.1702. (Ibid.) Even a claim of inadvertence, if it is not
prejudicial, may constitute good cause for a late filing. (Pollard v. Saxe
& Yolles Dev. Co. (1974) 12 Cal.3d 374, 381, 115 Cal.Rptr. 648, 525 P.2d 88
(Pollard) [cost bill].)
 
(Robinson v. U-Haul Co. of California
(2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 304, 326.) Under these circumstances, the Court finds good
cause for bringing the instant Motion after the 30-day deadline. 
 
Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
 
On the substantive basis for attorney’s fees,
the parties’ 998 agreement provides that “Plaintiff will have the right
to seek attorney’s fees and costs by filing a motion with the Court.” (Offer to
Compromise, filed 08/04/23, p 1:27.) Plaintiff points to Government Code
section 12965 for the statutory right to attorney’s fees, which states in
relevant part: “In civil actions brought under this section, the court, in its
discretion, may award to the prevailing party . . . reasonable attorney's fees
and costs . . . .” (Govt. Code, § 12965, subd. (c)(6).) The Court notes that
the Motion refers to Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b) as the
relevant provision, but that the statute was revised effective January 1, 2024.
The judgment entered pursuant to that order further states that Plaintiff
“shall recover his costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees from Defendant Azusa
Unified School District in an amount to be determined by a Memorandum of Costs
and Motion for Attorneys’ Fees that Plaintiff may hereinafter file.” (Judgment,
08/28/23, p. 2:16-19.)
 
It
is not clear from Plaintiff’s arguments on what basis exactly he contends
entitlement to attorney’s fees. First, the Notice of Motion refers to
Government Code section 12965 and Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1702. Rule 3.1702
does not set forth any grounds for the Court to determine whether a party is
entitled to attorney’s fees; it only provides the procedural mechanism to do
so. Government Code section 12965 for the statutory right to attorney’s fees
under FEHA, states in relevant part: “In civil actions brought under this
section, the court, in its discretion, may award to the prevailing party . . . reasonable
attorney's fees and costs . . . .” (Govt. Code, § 12965, subd. (c)(6).) The
Court notes that the Motion refers to Government Code section 12965,
subdivision (b) as the relevant provision, but that the statute was revised
effective January 1, 2024. 
 
The
Motion does not analyze the definition of “prevailing party” under Government
Code section 12965. Instead, Plaintiff cites Code of Civil Procedure section
1032 for the definition of that phrase, which includes the party with the net
monetary recovery. (Motion, p. 11:20-21 [citing Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(a)(4)].) The Motion, however, cites no authority applying the “prevailing
party” definition from Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 to an motion for
attorney’s fees under FEHA. In fact, Code of Civil Procedure section 1032
defines a prevailing party with respect to an award of costs, not attorney’s
fees, and furthermore, does not apply in the context of a FEHA action for
attorney’s fees. (Huerta v. Kava Holdings, Inc. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th
74, 81 [“Section 1032, subdivision (b) does not apply in FEHA actions”]; Williams
v. Chino Valley Independent Fire Dist. (2015) 61 Cal.4th 97, 105 [“We
conclude Government Code section 12965(b) is an express exception to  Code of Civil Procedure section 1032(b) and
the former, rather than the latter, therefore governs costs awards in FEHA
cases”].
 
Plaintiff’s
reply doubles down on his reliance on the definition under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1032 by citing DeSaulles v. Community Hospital of Monterey
Peninsula (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1140. In DeSaulles, the California
Supreme Court defined a prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section
1032 as the party with the net monetary recovery even when achieved by a
stipulated judgment. (DeSaulles v. Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula
(2016) 62 Cal.4th 1140, 1147.) The Court does not find that Desaulles
controls this action, however. First, DeSaulles did not involve a
request for attorney’s fees; the plaintiff only sought costs under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1032. (Id. at 1144.) A party deemed to be
“prevailing” under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 must still demonstrate
a right to attorney’s fees under contract, law, or statute. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) 
 
In
this respect, DeSaulles is instructive:
 
Section
1032's definition of “prevailing party” does not control, however, when another
statute provides for different means of allocating costs. (Williams v. Chino
Valley Independent Fire Dist. (2015) 61 Cal.4th 97, 114, 186 Cal.Rptr.3d 826,
347 P.3d 976.) The definition of “prevailing party” in section 1032 is
particular to that statute and does not necessarily apply to attorney fee
statutes or other statutes that use the prevailing party concept. (Heather
Farms Homeowners Association v. Robinson (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1572, 26
Cal.Rptr.2d 758.) Moreover, section 1032 establishes only a default rule. (§
1032, subd. (c) [section 1032 does not “prohibit parties from stipulating to
alternative procedures for awarding costs”].) When parties settle a case, they
are free to allocate costs in any manner they see fit, although they must do so
in language specifically addressing such allocation. (Cf.  *1148 Chinn, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at pp.
184–185, 82 Cal.Rptr.3d 586 [compromise offer was silent on costs and therefore
did not preclude the plaintiff from seeking costs].)
 
(DeSaulles
v. Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1140,
1147–1148.) The reply goes on to point to the language of the 998 offer and
resulting judgment to contend the parties agreed Plaintiff could recover
attorney’s fees. (Reply, pp. 3:2-10, 4:6-9.) This argument was not made in the
Motion and is not supported by any legal authority regarding how the language
of a 998 offer controls entitlement to attorney’s fees. It suggests that the
998 offer creates a contractual right to attorney’s fees in this case, but
again, cites no authority. (Ibid.) 
 
In
opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not the prevailing party in this
action because the 998 offer included no admission of liability or concession
of Plaintiff as the prevailing party. In support of its position, Defendant
cites case law interpreting the attorney’s fees provision in Civil Code section
52, subdivision (a) of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (“the UCRA”). Specifically, in Doran v. North State Grocery,
Inc. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 484, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial
court’s award of attorney’s fees because “the plain language of section 52,
subdivision (a), requires a finding that the defendant has denied the plaintiff
rights guaranteed by section 51, 51.5, or 51.6 [of the UCRA] before the
plaintiff can recover attorney fees under section 52.” (Id. at 491.) The
Court of Appeals went on to hold that the judgment based on the offer of
compromise did not constitute a finding of liability against the defendant. (Ibid.)
Finally, Doran was precluded from obtaining any such finding of liability “because
a compromise settlement operates as a bar to reopening the controversy.” (Id.
at 92.)
 
Contrary
to Defendant’s position, the Court does not find that Doran “exactly”
reflects the facts of this case. In fact, Doran is quite
distinguishable, and therefore, inapplicable to this action. The language of
the UCRA attorney’s fees provision is markedly different from that of
Government Code section 12965, subdivision (c). The former requires a finding
of liability, which must be made before the controversy closes; the latter
requires a determination of which party is the prevailing party, which cannot
be made before the controversy closes. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a scenario
in which the prevailing party determination is made before the controversy
closes.
 
Ultimately,
the Motion is brought pursuant to the statutory right to attorney’s fees under
Government Code section 12965. However, as neither party cites relevant legal
authority regarding the issue of the “prevailing party” under that statute, the
hearing is continued for further briefing. Plaintiff is to file and serve a supplemental
brief, not to exceed three pages, addressing the standard for determining a
prevailing party under Government Code section 12965 and analyzing it with
respect to this case. Defendant is to file and serve a brief in response, also
not exceeding three pages.
