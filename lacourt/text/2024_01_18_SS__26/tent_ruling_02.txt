ANALYSIS:
 
Cross-Defendants Creditors
Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“CAB, Inc.”) and American Textile Maintenance  Company (“ATMC”) served Cross-Complainant KC
Branaghans, Inc. dba KC Branaghans dba KC Branaghan’s Irish Pub &
Restaurant (“Cross-Complainant”) with Special Interrogatories, Sets One, and
Request for Production of Documents, Sets One, on July 26, 2023. (Motions,
Brown Decl., Exh. 1.) Following a meet and confer effort, the Cross-Complainant
still did not serve responses. (Id. at Exh. 2.) Cross-Defendants filed
the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Monetary Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions; (3)
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Monetary Sanctions; and (4) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions, on
September 13, 2023. Cross-Complainant filed an opposition declaration on
October 30, 2023 and Cross-Defendants replied on November 1, 2023. 
 
Although
Cross-Complainant contends it served timely objections to the Special
Interrogatories, Sets One, it did not timely respond to Cross-Defendants’ meet
and confer letter sent on September 8, 2023 and asking for the responses by
September 11, 2023. (Motions, Brown Decl., Exh. 1.) Instead, Cross-Complainant
waited until September 13, 2023 to respond to the meet and confer letter.
Cross-Complainant also contends that it had a two-week extension of the time to
provide responses to the Request for Production, Sets One, but attaches no copy
of this agreement. (Opp., Loe Decl., ¶4.) Responses to all the discovery were
served on October 26, 2023. (Id. at Exh. B.) Cross-Defendants
acknowledge receipt of the responses. (Reply, Brown Decl., ¶7.)  Therefore, the Court finds that the discovery
motions are moot.  
 
Cross-Defendants
maintain that they never received Cross-Complainant’s responses served on
August 25, 2023 and request monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,572.75 per
motion based on an hourly rate of $500.00 and $72.75 in costs. (Motions, Brown
Decl. ¶5.) Cross-Complainant does not address the requests for monetary
sanctions in its opposition. Nor does it deny that it served responses after
the deadlines. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to monetary
sanctions. As each motion to compel is substantially similar, the Court finds
that each Cross-Defendant is entitled to total sanctions of $1,572.75.
