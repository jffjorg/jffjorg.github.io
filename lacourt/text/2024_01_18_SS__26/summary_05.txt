**English-text summary:**

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for fraud, which alleges that the defendant misrepresented their ability to remove sunspots from the plaintiff's face and failed to disclose that the treatments would not be covered by insurance. The Judge finds that the allegations do not meet the requirements of fraud and that the representations are non-actionable opinions. The Judge also grants the motion to strike the portion of the Second Amended Complaint in which the plaintiff seeks emotional distress damages, as this is improper in a breach of contract action. The Judge denies leave to amend the complaint, as the plaintiff has had previous opportunities to correct the defects and has not shown a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
