And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling dismissing the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award filed by Qiang Fang against Thomas T. Chen. The ruling is based on the failure of Fang to meet the statutory requirements for service of the petition and notice of hearing, as well as the failure to provide proof of service of the arbitration award. The judge notes that the arbitration award was issued on August 18, 2022, and Fang filed the petition on June 15, 2023, but no response or additional papers have been filed in response to the petition. As a result, the judge is unable to confirm the arbitration award and is dismissing the petition. The judge also notes that Fang requested attorney's fees and costs, but as Fang is representing himself pro per, such fees would be denied.
