SUBJECT:                 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OR
IN THE ALTERNATIVE DISCRETIONARY RELIEF UNDER CCP § 437(B)
MOVING
PARTY:   Plaintiff Jane Doe, C.S.
RESP.
PARTY:         Defendants Justin
Raanan, D.D.S., MMSC, et al. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff Jane Doe, C.S.’s Motion for Reconsideration is
DENIED. Plaintiff’s Motion for Discretionary Relief under CCP § 437(b) in
the alternative is GRANTED.   Plaintiff’s counsel’s conduct of failing to
review the 7-25-23 Minute Order amounted to excusable neglect. Plaintiff’s
counsel acted with diligence in filing this motion, and granting the motion
will not prejudice the Defendants.   
 
            On July 25, 2023, the Court heard Defendants motion for
an order directing the Plaintiff Jane Doe to file an amended complaint using
her true name.  The Court’s tentative
ruling was to grant the motion.  At the
hearing Plaintiff’s counsel requested leave to file a supplemental declaration
in opposition to Defendant’s motion to show “the risk plaintiff faces if her
name is revealed.”    The Court orally continued the hearing to
October 31, 2023.  In lieu of permitting Plaintiff
to file a supplemental declaration in opposition to Defendants’ motion, the
Court directed Plaintiff to file the appropriate motion for Plaintiff to
proceed anonymously, to be heard at the same time as Defendant’s continued
motion.  After the hearing the Court
issued a minute order changing the date of the continued hearing from October
31, 2023 to August 31, 2023.
 
            As of August 31, 2023, Plaintiff had not filed her motion
to proceed anonymously and failed to appear at the August 31, hearing.  At that hearing the Court adopted it prior tentative
ruling and granted the Defendant’s motion.
 
            CCP “[S]ections 437c, subdivision (f)(2), and 1008
prohibit a party from making renewed motions not based on new facts or
law, but do not limit a court's ability to reconsider its previous
interim orders on its own motion, as long as it gives the parties notice that
it may do so and a reasonable opportunity to litigate the question.” (Le
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1096–1097, as modified (June
10, 2005).)
 
            Mr. Goldberg argues his failure to appear at the 8-31-23
hearing, plus the failure to “carefully review” the 7-25-23 Minute Order amounts
to excusable neglect because he reasonably believed that the hearing would
occur on 10-31-23 “as the Court repeatedly stated at the hearing.” (Motion, pp.
12–13; Goldberg Decl., ¶ 18.) Under the circumstances of this case the Court
finds Mr. Goldberg’s failure to appear at the hearing on August 31 to be
excusable neglect.  
 
            The Court, therefore, vacates is order of 8-31-2023 granting
Defendant’s motion, without prejudice to rehearing that motion concurrently with
the Plaintiff’s motion to proceed anonymously, as was contemplated by the Court
in the Court’s July 25, 2023 minute order. 
The Court will hear argument on both of those motions on November 30,
2023.  No tentative ruling regarding those
motions will be posted before the hearing.
