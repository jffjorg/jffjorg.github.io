And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Ally Bank's application for a Writ of Possession without prejudice. The reason for the denial is that the substitute service was mailed to the incorrect apartment, and the Plaintiff did not include a declaration identifying the specific location of the property. Additionally, the Plaintiff failed to submit a proposed order and did not provide evidence to support the application. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff did not attach the declaration mentioned in the application, and did not address whether a bond is necessary. The case is set for a hearing on November 30, 2023.
