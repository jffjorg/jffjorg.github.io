```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration and granting the motion for discretionary relief under CCP ยง 437(b). The plaintiff's counsel failed to review the July 25, 2023 minute order, which led to the counsel's failure to appear at the August 31, 2023 hearing. However, the judge finds this failure to be excusable neglect due to the counsel's reasonable belief that the hearing would occur on October 31, 2023, as previously stated by the court. As a result, the court is vacating its August 31, 2023 order granting the defendant's motion and will hear argument on both motions on November 30, 2023.
