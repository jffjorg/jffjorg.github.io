TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff Ally Bank’s Application for Writ of Possession
is DENIED, without prejudice.  
Substitute service was
mailed to the incorrect apartment. The Defendant’s mailing address is 9663
Santa Monica Blvd Apt 731 Beverly Hills, CA 90210, however the substituted
service was effected on 9663 Santa Monica Blvd #73 Beverly Hills, CA 90210.
Plaintiff did not include a declaration identifying the specific location of
the property. Furthermore, no proposed order was submitted. Plaintiff should
also address whether a bond is necessary, i.e. whether Defendants have any
equity in the collateral/equipment.  More
importantly, there is no evidence submitted in support of the application. The application states there is an attached
declaration, but no declaration was attached to the submitted application
documents. (Application, p. 1.) Furthermore, Ally did not submit a proposed
order.
