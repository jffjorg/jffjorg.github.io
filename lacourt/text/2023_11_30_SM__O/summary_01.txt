Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Cross-Defendant Amy Lerner-Hill's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $84,881.63 against Cross-Claimant Adam Jeremy Tenser. The ruling also denies Cross-Claimant Adam Jeremy Tenser's motion for a protective order and motion to strike the Law Office of Jeremy Tenser Limited's answer. The judge finds that Lerner-Hill is the prevailing party on the Anti-SLAPP motion and is entitled to a mandatory award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs under CCP ยง425.16(c). The judge also finds that Tenser's arguments regarding Lerner-Hill partially prevailing and the fees being inflated lack merit.
