Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to compel the deposition of the defendant, Jerome Winfield. The case arises from a motor vehicle accident on January 16, 2021, in Los Angeles. The plaintiffs, Uriel Calzada Martinez and Aracely De Los Santos, had served two notices to take the defendant's deposition, but the defendant failed to appear on both occasions. The defendant's objection to the first deposition notice was based on a scheduling conflict, but the judge finds that this was not the reason for the defendant's nonappearance. The judge orders the defendant to appear for and give testimony at his deposition on May __, 2024, at 10 am, by remote means.
