Background
On January 26, 2023, Jennfier Long
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Jing Luo and Lukens Realty, LLC
(collectively “Defendants”), as well as Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of
action for negligence and premises liability arising out of slip and fall
occurring on April 11, 2021.  
 
Defendants filed their answer on
March 20, 2023.  On the same day,
Defendants served Plaintiff with written discovery, including Form Interrogatories
(Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set
One).  (Powers Decls., ¶ 4 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id., ¶ 8.)
 
On June 22, 2023, Defendants filed these
motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One),
Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Request for Production (Set One).  Defendants also seek sanctions.  
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.
(Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to
compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Requests for admission may be
propounded on a party without leave of court 10 days after the service of the
summons on, or appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On March 20, 2023, Defendants served form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production on
Plaintiff. (Powers Decls., ¶ 4 & Exhs. A.) Plaintiff
has not responded. (Id., ¶ 8.)
 
Defendants need show nothing more. The motions to compel are GRANTED,
 
Defendants’ requests for sanctions are DENIED. 
Defendants’ request for sanctions is
DENIED. 
Defendants seek sanctions under section
2030.290, subdivision (c); section 2031.300, subdivision(c); sections
2023.010, et seq.  Section 2030.290, subdivision (c), and
section 2031.300, subdivision (c) authorize an award of sanctions against a
party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to compel
initial responses; here, no opposition was filed.  Sections 2023.010 does
“not independently authorize the trial court to
impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.”  (City of Los
Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
504.)  (The Court is aware that the California Supreme Court has
granted review of the City of Los Angeles case, but the Court notes that the
order granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states that pending review,
the appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its persuasive
value.”  The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor in the City
of Los Angeles case to be persuasive.)
