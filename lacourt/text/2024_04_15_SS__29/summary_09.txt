And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Arizona Pipeline Company. The court found that the cross-complaint arises out of the same series of occurrences as the plaintiff's complaint, a dog bite incident that occurred on January 4, 2021. The defendants seek to hold Arizona Pipeline Company liable for the incident, alleging that the company failed to tell the plaintiff about the dog. The court found that granting the motion will not cause any undue prejudice to the plaintiff, and the court granted the motion. The defendants are granted leave to file the cross-complaint within 10 days of the hearing.
