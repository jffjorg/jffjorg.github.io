The defendants failed to provide dates for the deposition, and the plaintiff served multiple notices for the deposition. The plaintiff finally took the deposition of Mr. Hui Hui on April 3, 2024. The plaintiff contends that Mr. Hui Hui did not produce some or all of the requested documents, and the plaintiff also seeks sanctions. The court will hear from counsel.
