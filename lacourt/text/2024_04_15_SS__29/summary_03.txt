English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to special interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to respond to the interrogatories, and the defendants' motion was unopposed. The court finds that the defendants need not show anything more to demonstrate that the plaintiff has failed to respond to the interrogatories. The court grants the motion to compel and orders the plaintiff to serve written, code-compliant, verified responses to the defendants' special interrogatories within 30 days of notice. The court denies the defendants' request for sanctions.
