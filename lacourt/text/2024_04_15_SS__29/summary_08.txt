**Facts**

* The incident occurred on October 20, 2020, when three individuals assaulted and robbed Plaintiffs Jacqueline Duclos, Sumoya Michael, and Jane Doe (a minor child) while they were staying at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles.
* The defendants, IHG Management (Maryland) LLC and Hanjin International Corp., argued that they are not liable for the intentional torts committed by their employee, Ronald Elie, as he was not acting within the scope of his employment.
* The defendants also argued that they did not breach any duty owed to Plaintiffs in hiring, supervising, and retaining Elie.

**Ruling**

The court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication on the following grounds:

1. **Respondeat Superior**: The court found that there was a triable issue as to whether Elie's intentional torts were within the scope of his employment, as the defendants were aware of the risks of intentional torts and had trained their employees on those risks.
2. **Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention**: The court found that there was a triable issue as to whether the defendants breached their duty of care in
