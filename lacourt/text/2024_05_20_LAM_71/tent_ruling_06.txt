(Notice Motion Attorney Fees, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§685.040, 685.080.)
 
Background
In March 2008, Judgment Creditor 8451 Melrose
and Debtor Sina Akhtarzad (“Sina”) executed a written lease of the commercial
premises located at 8451 Melrose Avenue, West Hollywood, California
(“Property”). That lease provided for an eleven-year term at a base annual rent
of $660,000, payable in monthly installments of $55,000, with 3% annual
increases. 8451 Melrose is the owner of the Property and was the lessor under
the lease.  Sina was the nominal sole
tenant under the lease. 
Shortly after the lease took effect, Sina demolished
the interior of the Property, ostensibly for the purpose of constructing tenant
improvements. Such improvements never were constructed. Instead, the tenant
abandoned the Property, leaving it stripped of drywall, light fixtures, plumbing
fixtures and ducting. The rent payable for January 2009 and the subsequent
months was not paid.
On June 2, 2009, 8451 Melrose filed this action
against Sina for breach of the lease.  On
June 14, 2018, after two trials and an appeal, this Court entered a money
judgment in favor of 8451 Melrose and against Sina in the amount of
$12,248,584.85, inclusive of prejudgment interest, attorneys’ fees and costs.
(The attorneys’ fees and costs were awarded to Judgment Creditors,
jointly.)  Following a second appeal, in
which the judgment was affirmed in its entirety, the Court awarded an
additional $261,960.80 in attorneys’ fees and $8,937.03 in costs.  Only about $3.8 million has been paid toward
the satisfaction of the judgment. The unpaid balance of the judgment is
accruing post-judgment interest at the rate of 10% per annum.
In 2011, during the course of the litigation, Sina
filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition. The parties stipulated to relief from
stay to allow the amount of Sina’s liability to be determined. A relatively
small fraction of the judgment was paid out of a reserve established for that
purpose by the Bankruptcy Court. The judgment is otherwise unsatisfied.
In an effort to collect the balance of the
judgment, Judgment Debtors prosecuted a contested creditor’s claim in the
Bankruptcy Court and initiated an adversary proceeding to seek a determination
that the judgment is not dischargeable by Sina’s bankruptcy.

Motion
to Amend Judgment
Evidentiary Objections
Judgment Creditors’ 5/13/24 evidentiary
objection to the Declaration of Sina Akhtarzard (“Sina”) is overruled as to No.
1, and sustained as to Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and

Procedural History
Judgment Creditors filed the instant motion on
December 11, 2023.  Partnership
Non-parties filed their opposition on May 9, 2024.  Judgment Creditors filed their reply on May
13, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing
Sina has not filed an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §187 provides:
When jurisdiction is, by the Constitution or this Code, or by any
other statute, conferred on a Court or judicial officer, all the means
necessary to carry it into effect are also given; and in the exercise of this
jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be not specifically pointed out by
this Code or the statute, any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be
adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this Code.
 
“Pursuant to section 187, a trial court has jurisdiction
to modify a judgment to add additional judgment debtors.”  (McClellan v. Northridge Park Townhome
Owners Assn., Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 746, 752; see also Carr v.
Barnabey’s Hotel Corp. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 14, 20.)  An amendment of a judgment to add a judgment
debtor liable for the original defendant’s obligations is included within
§187’s provision for the use of “any suitable process” in the exercise of the
trial court’s jurisdiction.  (JPV I
L.P. v. Koetting (2023) 88 Cal.App.5th 172, 188.)  C.C.P. §187 may be used at any time so that
the judgment will properly designate the real defendants.  (Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Weinberg
(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1, 7.)  “In order
to see that justice is done, great liberality is encouraged in the allowance of
amendments brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 187.”  (Misik v. D’Arco (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th
1065, 1073.)
“Code of Civil Procedure section 187
contemplates a noticed motion. The trial court is not required to hold an
evidentiary hearing. [Citation] Evidence in the form of declarations or
deposition testimony is sufficient.”  (Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., 227 Cal.App.4th at pg. 9.)
The power to amend a judgment under §187 is
typically exercised to add a judgment debtor on the ground that the new
judgment debtor is an alter ego of the original judgment debtor.  (McClellan, 89 Cal.App.4th at pg. 752.)
 “[E]ven if all the formal elements
necessary to establish alter ego liability are not present, an unnamed party
may be included as a judgment debtor if ‘the equities overwhelmingly favor’ the
amendment and it is necessary to prevent an injustice.” (Carolina Casualty
Insurance Co. v. L.M. Ross Law Group, LLP (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1188-1189,
quoting Carr, 23 Cal.App.4th at pg. 22.)
 
Discussion
Judgment Creditors’ motion is granted.
Here,
Sina nominally entered into the Lease as an individual, but the evidence obtained
in the bankruptcy proceedings shows that he always intended to obtain the Lease
for the benefit of his family’s Partnership.  The evidence demonstrates Sina intended to
have the Partnership assume the responsibility for the Lease expenses, and, to
the limited extent that expenses were paid, it did.  (Decl. of Taitelman ¶26, Exh. J [“Depo. of
Sina”] 113:22-114:9; 116:11-25; 117:6-10; 139:17-22.) 
While
Sina was the nominal tenant under the terms of the Lease, he intended to have
the Lease be part of his family’s partnership business.  (Depo. of Sina, 79:15-80:24; 101:15-23;
113:15-21.)  Sina’s testimony in his
deposition taken on April 20, 2023, made clear his intent:
Q       My question was if – if you needed money to perform under the
8451 lease, the money, the source of those funds would be the family business,
right?
A       It’s a family business.
Q       So that would be the source of funds?
A       Yes.
. . .
 
Q       Just to be clear, when you signed -- at the time you signed the
lease, your intent was that the family business would be the source of funds that
you would use to pay the rent and other things?
A       Sure.
 
(Depo.
of Sina, 116:11-25; 117:6-10.)
Sina
testified that he did not intend use his own income to pay contractors who
worked at the Property.  (Depo. of Sina,
139:17-23.)  The Partnership’s payments
to 8541 Melrose were for Partnership business, and therefore did not constitute
loans to the nominal tenant, Sina.  (Decl.
of Sina, 79:15-25.)
 The advance rent and the security deposit,
which totaled $330,000, were paid from SRS account, the Partnership’s “mother account.”
 (See Decl. of Simantob ¶5, Exh. B;
Depo. of Sina 53:15-18; 148:11-22; 167:2-13.)  Property tax and insurance reimbursement was
paid by Amey Enterprises, a partnership-associated entity.  (See Decl. of Simantob ¶6, Exh. C.)  Other Lease-related expenses were charged to
Amey Enterprises in the Partnership’s accounting records.  (See Decl. of Taitelman ¶28, Exh. L.)  Sina unequivocally testified his intention
for Amey Enterprise to act as the tenant: “Q So when you signed the 8451 lease,
was it your intent that Amy would act as the tenant under that lease? [¶] A
Yes.”  (Depo. of Sina, 112:19-22.)  Sina testified that Amey Enterprise typically
acts as the tenant when properties are leased for the Partnership.  (Depo. of Sina, 82:24-83:2.)
Each
general partner of a partnership is an agent of the partnership for the purpose
of its business.  (Corp. Code §16301(1).)
 Sina entered into the Lease for purposes
of conducting the Partnership’s business, thereby acting as an agent of the
Partnership.  “Principals may be liable
for contracts executed by agents, even where the principal is not disclosed in
the contract.”  (Aluma Systems
Concrete Construction v. Nibbi Bros. Inc. (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 620, 628.)  Thus, liability under the Judgment properly
rests with the Partnership.
Generally,
each partner in a general partnership is jointly and severally liable for
partnership obligations.  (Corp. Code
§16306(a).)  As partners in the family
partnership, Yousef, Kourosh, Shirin, and Shahpar are proper debtors on a judgment
based on a Partnership obligation.  The
Judgment in this case is such a judgment.
Amey
Enterprise is also liable additional judgment debtor. Sina intended to have it be
the Partnership entity that would act as the tenant.  Amey Enterprise paid Partnership expenses,
including the property tax and insurance reimbursements. Sina went so far as to
have Amey sublet part of the Property to Vera Wang Bridal House, LLC, further
evidencing the intent to have it act as the tenant under the master Lease.  (Decl. of Taitelman ¶25, Exh. I; Depo. of
Sina, 101:1-23.)  A judgment against an
individual can be amended to add an artificial entity, such as Amey Enterprise,
as an additional defendant.  (Curci
Investments, LLC v. Baldwin (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 214.)
While
the individual partners were not separately represented at trial, the
Partnership itself was virtually represented through Sina, one of its members.  Each of the partners was part of a single enterprise:
the “one-for-all” Partnership.  (Decl. of
Taitelman ¶35, Exh. O at 56:12-16.)  When
a judgment is entered against one piece of a single enterprise, and the person
who controlled the litigation on behalf of that piece dominates the enterprise,
the other parts of the enterprise are necessarily virtually represented in the
litigation.  (Greenspan v. LADT LLC
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 509.)
Sina
was the partner charged with handling leases for the Partnership like the one
involved in this case.  (Depo. of Sina, 45:22-46:3;
121:4-19.)  When it comes to leasing property,
Sina dominates the Partnership enterprise. He had charge of the litigation of
this on behalf of the Partnership. The attorneys hired for his defense were
paid from a Partnership account. The Partnership, and by extension, its
individual members, were thus virtually represented in this case.  Amey Enterprise was virtually represented by
Sina, who had acted as its sole manager. It was the entity through which the
Partnership handled the properties they leased, and Sina was the partner who
was in charge of such leases.
Sina’s
representation in this litigation was vigorous, contesting liability on the
merits of the case through two trials and two appeals.  Sina’s interest in the underlying dispute was
the same as the interests of the Partnership and Amey Enterprise. There thus is
no unfairness in adding the other parties who were responsible under the Lease
to the Judgment.
The
bankruptcy court has already issued a discharge order in Sina’s bankruptcy
case. (Decl. of Taitelman ¶13.)  Unless
Sina’s debt is determined to be nondischargeable in the pending adversary
proceeding in the bankruptcy court, the judgment will become uncollectable.  (Id.)  The discharge order would preclude further
collection efforts against Sina, leaving 8451 Melrose without a plain, adequate
and speedy remedy. Such an unfair result can be avoided by adding the remaining
partners and Amey Enterprise as judgment debtors.
Partnership
Non-parties’ argument that Judgment Creditors’ motion should be denied based on
laches is unavailing.  “Laches is an equitable,
affirmative defense which requires a showing of both an unreasonable delay by
the plaintiff in bringing suit, ‘plus either acquiescence in the act about
which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the
delay.’”  (Highland Springs Conference
& Training Center v. City of Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 267, 282.)  “Prejudice is never presumed; rather it must
be affirmatively demonstrated by the defendant in order to sustain his burdens
of proof and the production of evidence on the issue.”  (Miller v. Eisenhower Medical Center (1980)
27 Cal. 3d 614, 624.)
Partnership
Non-parties have not carried their burden of proof on the issue of laches.  First, they have not shown an unreasonable
delay in bringing the motion to amend the judgment, which occurred within a few
months after Judgment Creditors’ discovery of the “one-for-all” Family
Partnership.  Second, they have not shown
any acquiescence in the non-payment of the Judgment.  Finally, Partnership Non-parties have not
offered any evidence that they suffered any form of prejudice.
Similarly,
Partnership Non-parties’ argument that Judgment Creditors’ motion violates the
Order of Discharge in In re Akhtarzad, Case No. 11-bk-61640-BB in favor
of Sina and Ramesh.  However, the Order
of Discharge states, “[t]he debtor has no personal liability for personal
liability for debts discharged under 11 U.S.C. Section 727 (or) 1141, except
those debts determined by order of a court of competent jurisdiction not to be discharged.”
 (JC-RJN, Exh. CC at ¶1.)  The Order of Discharge forbids creditors from
collecting discharged debts “as personal liabilities of the debtor.”  (JC-RJN, Exh. CC at ¶3.)  The Discharge Order is silent as to
liabilities of non-debtors for the same debts.
Partnership
Non-parties’ citation to 11 U.S.C. §524 is inapposite. 11 U.S.C. §524 includes
a provision that a discharge order operates as an injunction against seeking to
collect a discharged debt “as a personal liability of the debtor.”  (11 U.S.C. §524(a)(2).)   The statute has another provision that
specifies that the injunction does not apply to enforcement of the debt against
other people who were not bankruptcy debtors: “Except as provided in subsection
(a)(3) of this section, discharge of a debt of the debtor does not affect the
liability of any other entity on, or the property of any other entity for, such
debt.”  (11 U.S.C. §524(e).)  Here, the exception to the general rule is
inapplicable because 11 U.S.C. §524(a)(3) applies only to community claims
against the spouse of the debtor.
It has
repeatedly been held that 11 U.S.C. §525(e) “precludes bankruptcy courts from discharging
the liabilities of non-debtors.”  (In
re Lowenschuss (9th Cir. 1995) 67 F.3d 1394, 1401.)  Section 524(e) “plainly provides that the
discharge only protects the debtor and not any other person who is liable with
the debtor.”  (In re RS Air, LLC (BAP
9th Cir. 2023) 651 B.R. 538, 544.)  That limitation
on the scope of the discharge applies even when the other person is alleged to
be an alter ego of the debtor.  (Id.
at pgs. 544-546.)  Therefore, the Order
of Discharge has no impact on the instant motion.
The
equities favor having Sina’s partners share in the liability under the
Judgment.  Therefore, the Judgment is
amended to join Yousef, Kourosh, Shirin, Shahpar, and Amy Enterprise as
additional Judgment Debtors.
 
Conclusion
Judgment Creditors’ motion to amend the
Judgment is granted.  The Judgment is amended to join Yousef,
Kourosh, Shirin, Shahpar, and Amy Enterprise as additional Judgment Debtors.

Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees
Procedural History
Judgment Creditors filed the instant motion on July
28, 2022.  The parties stipulated to
continue the motion on several occasions. 
Sina filed his opposition on May 6, 2024.  Judgment Creditors filed their reply on May
13, 2024.
 
Discussion
C.C.P.
§685.040 provides:
The judgment creditor
is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment. . .
. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs
collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney’s
fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of
subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.
 
(C.C.P.
§685.040.)
C.C.P.
§1033.5(a)(10)(A) provides for the recovery of contractually authorized
attorneys’ fees as an element of costs. Thus, when the underlying judgment
provides for recovery of attorneys’ fees pursuant to a contract, the
judgment
creditor is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees incurred in enforcing that
judgment.
          Here, the Judgment provides for
recovery of attorneys’ fees pursuant to
§29.21
of the Lease that was the subject of the litigation.  (Judgment, pgs. 2-3.) Accordingly, Judgment
Creditors are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in
enforcing the Judgment.  Judgment
Creditors specifically move for attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the
enforcement of the judgment between July 29, 2020, and June 30, 2022, within
the two-year window specified by §685.080. 
(Motion, pgs. 4-5.)
Accordingly,
Judgment Creditors are entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees.
 
Reasonable Fees
To calculate a lodestar amount, the Court must
first determine the reasonableness of the hourly rates sought by Judgment
Creditors’ counsel. The Supreme Court of California has concluded that a
reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for private attorneys
“conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Judgment Creditors’ Counsel declares the following
hourly rates for attorneys who worked on this case: (1) Lewis R. Landau ($545/hour
in 2020, $595/hour in 2021, and $645/hour in 2022); (2) Michael Taitelman ($450/hour
in 2020, $500/hour in 2021, and $550/hour in 2022); (3) Steven E. Formaker ($450.00/hour);
and (4) Tamar Yeghiayan ($395.00/hour).  (Decl.
of Landau ¶¶9, 11, Exh. A; Decl. of Taitelman ¶¶7-10, 12, Exh. B.)  Judgment Creditors have sufficiently
demonstrated their counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of
practice in their specialized area of law. 
(Decl. of Landau ¶¶9, 11, Exh. A; Decl. of Taitelman ¶¶7-10, 12, Exh. B.)  
Judgment Debtor argues Judgment Creditors’ motion
should be denied because Judgment Creditors have already been paid everything
to which they are entitled under a stipulation made in his bankruptcy case. However,
the stipulation in question, at Paragraph 17, preserves Judgment Creditors’
rights with respect to the dischargeability proceeding, stating: “This
Stipulation does not prejudice, and shall not impair any of the Debtors’ or Melrose’s
rights concerning their claims in adversary proceeding number 2:12-ap-01538 BB
or Superior Court case number 20STCV39690.” 
(Decl. of Rosenstein ¶2, Exh. A [“Stipulation”] at ¶17.)
The adversary proceeding in the Stipulation is
Judgment Creditors’ dischargeability proceeding. Paragraph 17 of the
Stipulation empowers Judgment Creditors to proceed with their effort to obtain
a determination that the judgment rendered in this action is not dischargeable.
If such a determination is obtained, Judgment Creditors will be free to fully
enforce their judgment, which means Judgment Creditors will be able to recover
any attorney’s fees awarded pursuant to C.C.P. §685.040.  Therefore, the Stipulation thus does not
preclude an award of the attorneys’ fees sought by this motion.
Judgment Debtor does not challenge Judgment
Creditors’ counsel’s hourly rates and thereby concedes Judgment Creditors’ counsel’s
rates are reasonable.
 
Billed Hours
The party seeking fees and costs bears the burden
to show “the fees incurred were allowable, were reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994)
31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
In this case, the declarations and billing records
provided by Judgment Creditors’ counsel are sufficient to meet the burden of
proving the reasonableness of the claimed fees in terms of amounts and tasks.
To satisfy this burden, evidence and descriptions of billable tasks must be
presented in sufficient detail, enabling the court to evaluate whether the case
was overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific claims, and the
reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Judgment Creditors’ counsel requests compensation
for 456.50 hours billed for a total of $267,917.50 for Landau.  (Decl. of Landau ¶¶9, 11, Exh. A.)  Judgment Creditors’ counsel from Freedman and
Taitelman requests compensation for 250.80 hours billed and requests a combined $119,572.15 for attorneys’ fees and reimbursable
expenses, which is not of great assistance to the Court in calculating the
lodestar for attorneys’ fees.  (See Decl. of Taitelman ¶¶14, 15, Exh. B.)
          Judgment
Debtor objects to Judgment Creditors’ hours billed on the grounds it is
difficult to determine how much time Judgment Creditors’ counsel actually spent
on many of the discrete tasks billed due to rampant “block billing,” which is
well taken.  (Heritage Pacific
Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1011.)  Accordingly, the Court reduces Judgment
Creditors’ requested fees by $20,000.00 for each billing attorney, for a total
reduction of $40,000.
Accordingly, Judgment Creditors’ requested fees are
granted in the reduced amount of $347,489.65.
 
Costs
Judgment Creditors request $1,248.00 in costs
advanced by Landau.  (Decl. of Landau
¶¶10-11, Exh. A.)  Judgment Creditors’ counsel from Freedman and
Taitelman does not provide a standalone value for its request for costs and
expenses.  Therefore, the Court is only
inclined to grant costs requested by Landau and not Freedman and Taitelman.
Accordingly, Judgment Creditors’ requested costs
are granted in the reduced amount of $1,248.00.
 
Conclusion
Judgment Creditors’
motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in the total reduced amount of $348,737.65,
comprised of reduced attorneys’ fees in the amount of $347,489.65, and reduced
costs in the amount of $1,248.00.
