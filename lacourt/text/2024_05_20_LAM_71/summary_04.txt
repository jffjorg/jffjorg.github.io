And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant JAMS, Inc.'s motion to dismiss the plaintiff's petition to vacate the arbitration award is granted. The plaintiff, Annunziata Crupi, seeks to vacate the arbitration award, but the judge finds that the petition is improper because it seeks to vacate interim rulings, which are not final awards. The judge cites various court cases and statutes to support the conclusion that interim arbitration rulings are not subject to judicial review. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's petition is impermissibly based on two interim rulings that did not address the merits of the underlying whistleblower controversy.
