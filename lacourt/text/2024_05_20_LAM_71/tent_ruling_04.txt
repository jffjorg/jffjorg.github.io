         vs.
 
JAMS,
  et al.


 Case No.: 
  23STCP03048
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 20, 2024



 
Defendant
JAMS, Inc.’s motion to dismiss pro per Plaintiff Annunziata Crupi’s petition
to vacate arbitration award is granted.  
 
Defendant JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”) (“Defendant”)
moves for an order dismissing pro per Plaintiff Annunziata Crupi’s
(“Crupi”) (“Plaintiff”) petition to vacate arbitration award (“Petition”) on
the following grounds: (1) JAMS is not a proper party pursuant to C.C.P. §1285;
(2) this Court does not have jurisdiction to vacate interlocutory arbitration
rulings pursuant to C.C.P. §1283.4; (3) the doctrine of arbitral immunity bars
the Petition insofar as it seeks to hold JAMS liable for actions taken in its
official capacity as an adjudicator; and (4) the litigation privilege bars the Petition
insofar as it seeks to hold JAMS liable for rendering the interim rulings at
issue.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P.
§1285.2.)

Petition to Vacate filed on October 2, 2023; and (2) Notice and Acknowledgment
of Receipt executed by counsel for JAMS on January 9, 2024, are denied because
this Court does not need to take judicial notice of filings on the instant
docket.
 
Background
Plaintiff’s Petition arises out of an
arbitration between Plaintiff and the University of Southern California (“USC”)
over which JAMS is presiding, JAMS Case No. 5220000062 (“the Underlying
Arbitration.”)  Plaintiff appears to take
issue with two interim rulings issued by JAMS’ Hon. Jackson Lucky in the
Underlying Arbitration, both of which were related to Plaintiff’s request to
remove the case from JAMS.
 
Procedural History
The Underlying Arbitration, which was initiated
on November 12, 2021, and is still pending, involves a whistleblower employment
dispute between Plaintiff and the University of Southern California.  (D-RJN, Exh. A.)  Plaintiff alleges two claims against USC: (1)
a claim for whistleblower retaliation in violation of Labor Code §1102.5, and
(2) a claim for wrongful constructive termination.
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request to
remove the case from JAMS. (D-RJN, Exh. B.) 
On January 18, 2023, Hon. Jackson Lucky issued a ruling denying the
request for removal, finding that Plaintiff’s request failed both procedurally
and substantively, in part because Plaintiff had waived her right to request
removal.  (D-RJN, Exh. C.)  Plaintiff then informally requested an appeal
of Hon. Jackson Lucky’s decision regarding removal.  (D-RJN, Exh. D.)  On July 26, 2023, Hon. Jackson Lucky denied
the request for appeal, explaining that Plaintiff did not have a right to
appeal the ruling.  (D-RJN, Exh. E.)
On August 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed her
Petition to Vacate.
JAMS
filed the instant motion on January 19, 2024. 
Petitioner filed her opposition on February 8, 2024.  JAMS filed its reply on May 13, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
There is no statutory authority for using a
motion to dismiss as a method to challenge opposing pleadings.  Under the C.C.P., dismissal motions are
expressly authorized only on specified grounds, including nonjoinder of
necessary parties (C.C.P. §389(b)), failure to pay fees after a venue transfer
order (Stasz v. Eisenberg (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1032, 1037), and delay
in service of summons or prosecution of the action (see C.C.P. §§581,
583.110 et seq.).
However, several cases hold a motion to dismiss may
serve the same function as a general demurrer. 
Despite lack of statutory authority, courts may assert their inherent
judicial power to dismiss cases in which no valid cause of action or
defense is stated.  (See C.C.P.
§581(m) [grounds stated in dismissal statute not “an exclusive enumeration of
the court’s power to dismiss an action or dismiss a complaint”]; Citizens for Parental Rights v. San
Mateo County Board of Education (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 1, 38 [motion
to dismiss the “legal equivalent of a general
demurrer”].)
Courts
routinely grant motions to dismiss petitions to vacate arbitration awards when
the subject of the petition is not a final award.  (See e.g., Cinel v. Christopher
(2013) 203 Cal.App.4th 759, 767.) 
Therefore, this Court will consider JAMS’ motion to dismiss.
 
          Discussion
          Plaintiff’s Petition is improper
because it does not seek to vacate a final arbitration award.  Generally, only final awards can be subject
to petitions to vacate.  (See C.C.P.
§1283.4 [defining “award” as a “determination of all the questions submitted to
the arbitrators the decision of which is necessary in order to determine the
controversy”]; see also MapleBear, Inc. v. Busick (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th
394, 407 [affirming trial court’s dismissal of petition to vacate “partial
final award” for lack of jurisdiction because award did not address merits of
the case or “essential dispute.”]  
Courts
have no jurisdiction over a petition to vacate an arbitration award if the
ruling at issue is not a final award.  (See
e.g., Lonky v. Patel (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 831, 844 [stating,
“whether a ruling constitutes an ‘award’ [under C.C.P. §1285] is what confers jurisdiction
upon the trial courts.”]  A final award
is one that “resolve[s] every part of the parties’ controversy that can be
resolved at the time.”  (Id. at
845.)  Furthermore, courts have
repeatedly cautioned against permitting judicial review of interim arbitration
rulings – specifically, courts have stated that it would “open the door wide to
piecemeal judicial review.”  (MapleBear,
26 Cal.App.5th at pg. 407; see also Lonky, 51 Cal.App.5th at pg. 844
[stating, if judicial review of interlocutory arbitration rulings was allowed,
it “would slow down the dispute resolution process as the parties bounce back
and forth between the arbitral and judicial fora.”]
Here,
Plaintiff’s Petition is impermissibly based upon two interim rulings – specifically,
an order denying Plaintiff’s request to remove the case from JAMS and an order
denying Plaintiff’s subsequent informal appeal request, neither of which
addressed the merits of the underlying whistleblower controversy. (D-RJN, Exhs.
C, E.)  These interlocutory rulings “left
much of the parties’ controversy unresolved,” as the heart of the dispute was
not addressed (i.e., the whistleblower retaliation and wrongful constructive
termination claims.)  (Lonky, 51
Cal.App.5th at pg. 846.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Petition must be dismissed.
 
Conclusion
JAMS’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s Petition is
granted.  
Moving Party to give notice.
