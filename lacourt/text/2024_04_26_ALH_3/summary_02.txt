```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by defendant Sharon Wei. The judge has overruled the demurrer, allowing the plaintiff's claims for breach of implied contract, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting the breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, and constructive trust to move forward. The judge has determined that the plaintiff has stated sufficient facts to support these claims. The judge has also declined to sustain Wei's demurrer on the grounds that the allegations are uncertain, vague, and ambiguous. The case will proceed to the next stage.
