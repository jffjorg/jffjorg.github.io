[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: APPLICATION
  FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
 
Dept. 3
8:00 a.m.
April 26, 2024



 
On
February 10, 2021, plaintiff Donald J. Matson (“Plaintiff”) and the Law Offices
of Donald J. Matson (“Law Firm”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) brought this
action against defendants Chao Li aka Chao Alex Li aka Alex Li aka Alex Li
Chao, Chao Alex Li dba City Law Center, and Alex Li Xhao dba www.citylaw.com
(collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiffs’ first amended complaint (“FAC”),
filed on February 16, 2022, asserts causes of action for: (1) theft [Civil Code
§ 3344 & Penal Code § 496]; (2) theft [Penal Code §§ 484 & 496]; (3)
trade libel; (4) infringement of trade name; (5) fraud; (6) indemnification;
(7) conversion; (8) civil conspiracy; (9) accounting; (10) unfair business
practices; (11) declaratory relief; and (12) injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs alleges Defendants used Plaintiff’s
law firm name and trade insignia to practice law without a license and
otherwise defraud potential clients. Plaintiffs’ FAC prays for $750,000 in
compensatory damages and “at least” $2,250,000 in punitive damages.
On
May 16, 2022, default was entered as to Defendants on the FAC. The Court now
considers Plaintiffs’ default package submitted on March 15, 2024, in which Plaintiffs
request a court judgment in the amount of $70,284.58, consisting of $50,000 in
general damages, $1,221.68 in costs, and $19,062 in attorney’s fees. While the
monetary judgment requested is GRANTED, the request for a permanent injunction
is DENIED. Plaintiff’s Twelfth Cause of Action in the FAC did not request a
permanent injunction. Instead, Plaintiff alleged that “[u]nless Defendants are
immediately enjoined from using Plaintiff’s name, law firm name, and
professional corporation pending the final determination in this action,
Plaintiff will suffer great and irreparable harm.” (FAC, ¶ 10.) Also, the
proposed judgment is ambiguously worded with respect to Plaintiffs’ request for
a declaratory judgment. The proposed judgment states that “Defendants shall
immediately cease and desist using Plaintiffs’ practices, law firm and
professional corporation of Law Offices of Donald J. Matson, P.C.” (Proposed
Judgment, p. 2, ¶ 5.) However, in the FAC, Plaintiffs request a declaration
that Defendants “cease and desist using Plaintiff’s name, law firm name. and
professional corporation name.” (FAC, ¶ 100.) Accordingly, the hearing is
CONTINUED to May 17, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. so that Plaintiffs may submit a revised
proposed judgment correcting the language of the declaratory judgment to be
consistent with the FAC and removing the request for a permanent injunction.
The revised proposed judgment should be filed no later than 5 days before the
date of the hearing. 
         Dated this 26th day of April
2024
