I.       INTRODUCTION
          On
February 22, 2023, plaintiff Yi Mao (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
defendants Sharon Wei (“Wei”), Yi Zhang Zhou (“Zhou”), 161 Alice St. Arcadia
LLC (“161 Alice LLC”), and 9416 Broadway LLC (“9416 Broadway”) asserting causes
of action for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting
the breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, and constructive trust.
Plaintiff alleges he owned interests in property located at 161 Alice Street in
Arcadia, California (the “Alice Property”), and 9416 Broadway in Temple City
(the “Broadway Property”). 
          On
November 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).
On December 21, 2023, Wei filed this demurrer to Plaintiff’s Third Cause of
Action for Breach of Implied Contract. 
          Plaintiff
filed an opposition brief on April 12, 2024, and Wei filed a reply brief on April
19, 2024. 
II.     LEGAL
STANDARDS
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of the pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on
its face. (City of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,
Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.) “We treat the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint
as true and also consider matters which may be judicially noticed. [Citation.]”
(Mitchell v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th
1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true,
however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
III.    DISCUSSION
A.          
The
Allegations of the SAC
1.          
The
Alice Property
Plaintiff alleges that in July 2020,
Wei solicited him to invest in the Alice Property and proposed that Plaintiff
and Zhou would each own a 50% interest in the Alice Property if they each
invested $350,000. (SAC, ¶ 20.) As part of this investment project, Wei would
serve as the project manager and would be compensated with 20% of the net
profit after the Alice Property was developed and sold, as long as the net
profit from the sale was at least $400,000. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff agreed to invest in the Alice
Property and on or about August 4, 2020, $350,000 was transferred from his bank
account to Wei’s account at East West Bank. (Id., ¶ 21.) The money was
transferred using Plaintiff’s check which was signed and endorsed by Wei
pursuant to a limited power of attorney executed on March 14, 2012. (SAC, ¶ 21,
Exs. A-B.) Plaintiff did not discover until October 2022 that Wei wrote “Gift”
on the check, which Plaintiff claims constitutes a material breach of her
fiduciary duties. (SAC, ¶ 22.) 
Wei and Zhou then signed and executed
an investment project and loan agreement (the “Investment Agreement”). (SAC, ¶
24.) The Agreement identified Wei as the project manager and listed Zhou and
Plaintiff as “Investor/Lender.” (Ibid.) While Plaintiff is listed as a
party to this agreement, Plaintiff alleges he did not learn of this Investment
Agreement until September 30, 2022. (SAC, ¶ 26.) 
On or about August 12, 2020, Wei asked
for an additional loan from Plaintiff in the amount of $180,000 for the Alice
Property, and induced Plaintiff into signing documents which falsely claimed
that the loan was a gift and that Wei was Plaintiff’s sister. (SAC, ¶¶ 32-35.) Plaintiff
alleges that Wei failed to fulfill her promise to repay the loan by September
12, 2020. (SAC, ¶ 36.) 
Plaintiff alleges that Wei committed
fraud on or about October 29, 2020, by putting her name on the transfer deed
for the Alice Property instead of listing Plaintiff and Zhou. (SAC, ¶ 38.) 
On or about November 19, 2020, Wei
solicited Plaintiff to invest in the Broadway Property. (SAC, ¶ 39.) Shortly
after, Wei and Zhou formed 161 Alice LLC. (SAC, ¶ 40.) Wei filed articles of
organization on or about November 29, 2020, and Zhou filed a statement of
information that listed herself and Wei as managers or members without
including Plaintiff. (SAC, ¶¶ 40-41.) Then, on April 20, 2021, Wei transferred
title to the Alice Property to herself and Zhou; Wei and Zhou then transferred
title and ownership to 161 Alice LLC. (Id., ¶¶ 45-46.) 
2.          
The
Broadway Property
From July 20 to July 27, 2022,
Plaintiff travelled to Los Angeles from Toronto, CA (which the Court previously
assumed referred to “Canada”, not “California”) to inspect his properties and
bank accounts. (SAC, ¶ 49.) On this trip, Plaintiff discovered that Wei never
returned the loan of $180,000 and confronted her, demanding immediate repayment
with 2 years of interest. (SAC, ¶¶ 50-51.) Wei claimed that she invested the
money into the Broadway Property on Plaintiff’s behalf and represented that
Plaintiff now owned a 50% interest in the Broadway Property. (SAC, ¶ 52.) 
Around October 1, 2022, Zhou, Wei, and
Plaintiff met in person. (SAC, ¶ 54.) Wei and Zhou reiterated that Plaintiff’s
$180,000 loan was invested in the Broadway Property and that he was a 50% owner
in both the Alice Property and the Broadway Property; Wei and Zhou also
promised to transfer 50% of each property to Plaintiff. (SAC, ¶ 54.) Zhou and
Plaintiff also jointly decided to put the Alice Property up for sale. (SAC, ¶
55.) 
On or about October 7, 2022, Zhou filed
another statement of information for 161 Alice LLC. (SAC, ¶ 56, Ex. F.) Again,
Zhou failed to list Plaintiff as a member of the LLC and only listed herself
and Wei, thereby essentially representing that they were the only two owners of
the Alice Property. (SAC, ¶¶ 56-57.) The same day, Zhou filed a statement of
information for 9416 Broadway LLC which also listed herself and Wei as members
or managers, without including Plaintiff. (SAC, ¶ 60, Ex. G.) 
3.  
Sale
of the Alice Property and Failure to Repay Loans
On or about October 21, 2022, the Alice
Property was listed for sale at the price of $1.7 million. (SAC, ¶ 64.) On or
about January 6, 2023, unbeknownst to Plaintiff, Wei and Zhou lowered the
asking price for the Alice Property to $1.45 million. (SAC, ¶ 70.) 
On January 27, 2023, Plaintiff’s loan
to Wei for $350,000 matured but Wei failed to repay the money to Plaintiff. (SAC,
¶ 71.) On February 14, 2023, Plaintiff sent formal demand letters to Zhou and
Wei demanding that they restore to him his 50% interest in the Alice and
Broadway Properties, but Zhou and Wei failed to do so, resulting in the filing
of this action.  (SAC, ¶¶ 72-73.)
B.          
Wei’s
Demurrer
Wei argues that Plaintiff fails to
state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for breach of implied
contract. By way of background, the Court notes that it previously found that
Plaintiff’s allegations in the First Amended Complaint supported a claim for
breach of implied contract and granted Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint
to identify the cause of action as such. 
In this demurrer, Wei complains that
Plaintiff asserts “irreconcilable allegations” because Plaintiff refers to the
Investment Agreement as a source of the terms of the contract as well as Wei’s
oral statements. However, these are not “irreconcilable allegations.” Rather,
Plaintiff is alleging the various circumstances and representations which
create the basis for an implied contract. 
Wei also claims that the allegations
are too uncertain, vague, and ambiguous. However, the Court declines to sustain
Wei’s demurrer on this ground. “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Chen v.
Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822, [quoting Khoury v. Maly's of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616].)
IV.    CONCLUSION
The demurrer is OVERRULED.
