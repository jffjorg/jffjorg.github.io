SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of injuries suffered by Plaintiff Julia
Witt, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem, Katherine Witt (Plaintiff)
when hot tea, purchased at one of Defendant Starbucks Corporation’s (Defendant)
stores, spilled on her wrist.
 
Plaintiff, who was 15-years old at the time of the
incident, alleges that on 11/2/23, she picked up her two drink order, a Venti
Citrus Mint Tea (the hot tea) which was double cupped, and a Grande Praline
Latte, which was not.  (Complaint
¶10).  Plaintiff alleges that the
Defendant employee who handed her the drinks did not warn her of the hot tea’s
scalding hot temperature.  Id.  Plaintiff exited the store and walked about
one block when the lid popped off the hot tea and the tea spilled on
Plaintiff’s wrist causing severe burns.  Id.
 
On 6/17/24, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
for: (1) Negligence, (2) Strict Liability- Manufacturing Defect, (3) Strict
Liability – Design Defect, (4) Strict Liability – Failure to Warn; (5) Negligence
– Product Liability; (6) Negligence – Duty to Warn; (7) Breach of Implied
Warranty of Merchantability; (8) Breach of Implied Warranty of Fitness for a
Particular Purpose and (9) Negligent Hiring, Supervision or Retention of
Employee.  After meet and confer efforts
failed to resolve the issues Defendant had with the complaint, on 8/21/24,
Defendant filed and served the instant demurrer to the 2nd – 9th
causes of action on the grounds that these causes of action fail to state
sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and/or are uncertain.  CCP 430.10(e), (f).  Plaintiff has opposed the demurrer and
Defendant has filed a reply to the opposition. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
Strict Liability – Manufacturing Defect, Design Defect
& Failure to Warn (2nd, 3rd & 4th
causes of action)
 
To hold a defendant liable for its product, plaintiffs
must show a defect in the product that caused their
injuries.  Scott (2014) 231 CA4th
763, 773.  

 
The opposition states that “[t]he manufacturing defect in
this lawsuit is not the defectiveness of the lid or cup which was never alleged
in the Complaint, but the manufacturing and serving temperature of the beverage
which was intended for safe consumption and handling.”  (See Opposition,
p.4:21-24; Complaint ¶24).  Plaintiff
notes that “[a] manufacturing defect in the context of product liability is
defined as a flaw in the manufacturing process that results in a product
differing from the manufacturer's intended result or from other ostensibly
identical units of the same product line.” 
(See Opposition, p.4:8-13 citing In re Coordinated Latex Glove
Litigation  (2002) 99 CA4th 594; Barker
(1978) 20 C3d 413; Johnson (2015) 240 CA4th 22;  Garrett (2013) 214 CA4th 173).  
 
With regard to the 2nd and 3rd
causes of action, Plaintiff has failed to allege facts which support a finding
that Defendant defectively manufactured/made or designed the hot tea.  Plaintiff offers no facts to support the
conclusory allegations that the tea was “overheated,” “dangerously hot,”  “scalding,” and/or “not at a safe temperature
for human consumption or handling.”  (See
Complaint ¶¶18, 24, 29).  It is common
knowledge that hot tea is made with boiling hot water.  The gravamen of Plaintiff’s complaint is that
the hot tea was served at temperature that was not safe for consumption
and handling which sounds in negligence. 
(See Opposition, p.4:21-24; Complaint ¶24).  The fact that the hot tea was
manufactured/made in conformance to the manufacturer’s design or specifications
is further supported by Plaintiff’s argument that Defendant should have warned
of the high temperature, offered a cup carrier, or allowed the beverage to cool
behind the counter before being served to Plaintiff.  (See Opposition, p.7:15-17 argument in
relation to Plaintiff’s claim that the unreasonably dangerous temperature was
not open and obvious to a 15-year old).   
 
The elements of a strict liability claim based on failure
to warn are: (1) the defendant manufactured the product, (2) the product had
potential risks that were known or knowable in light of the scientific and
medical knowledge that was generally accepted in the scientific community at
the time of manufacture, (3) the potential risks presented a substantial danger
when the product is used or misused in an intended or reasonably foreseeable
way, (4) ordinary consumers would not have recognized the potential risks, (5)
defendant failed to adequately warn or instruct of the potential risks, (6)
plaintiff was harmed, and (7) the lack of sufficient warnings was a substantial
factor in causing plaintiff’s harm.  CACI
1205.
 
It has been held that “[t]here is no duty to warn of
known risks or obvious dangers.”  Chavez
(2012) 207 CA4th 1283, 1304.  Further,
widely known risks associated with hot beverages include that they can spill
and burn skin.  See Shih
(2020) 53 CA5th 1063, 1067.  The “obvious
danger rule” is an objective test without regard to the product user’s
subjective knowledge.  See Johnson
(2008) 43 C4th 56, 65-66.  Plaintiff
cites no authority for the proposition that a 15-year old, such as Plaintiff,
does not have the capacity to understand the dangers that hot beverages can
spill resulting in injury.  Further,
making such a finding would place an undue burden on businesses – i.e., to verify
the age of consumers before serving them hot beverages or risk being held strictly
liable if minors spill hot drinks on themselves.
 
Negligence - Product Liability & Failure to Warn (5th
& 6th causes of action)
 
As with strict product liability, under a negligent
product liability claim, plaintiffs must also show a defect in the product that
caused their injuries.  Scott
(2014) 231 CA4th 763, 773.  However,
under a negligence theory, plaintiffs must also prove that the product defect
was due to the negligence of the defendant. 
Id.; Chavez, supra at 1304-1305.  
 
For the same reason the strict liability claims fail, so
do the negligent product liability and negligent failure to warn claims
fail.  The hot tea was not negligently manufactured/made
or designed because it was made as intended and designed – i.e., to be hot
tea.  Plaintiff has also failed to allege
sufficient facts to establish that Defendant did not warn of a particular risk
for reasons which fell below the applicable standard of care.  See Chavez, supra at
1305; Webb (2016) 63 C4th 167, 181. 

 
Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability &
Breach of Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Purpose (7th
& 8th causes of action)
 
In California, a plaintiff claiming breach of an implied
warranty of merchantability must show that the product did not possess even the
most basic degree of fitness for ordinary use.  Tae Hee Lee (C.D. Cal. 2014) 992
F.Supp.2d 962, 979.  Plaintiff has not
pled sufficient facts to support the conclusion that the tea was “not safe or
suitable for human consumption and/or transportation and did not conform to the
quality established by the parties’ prior dealings or by usage of trade in that
the beverage was scalding hot and likely to cause severe burns if transported
and or consumed.”  (Complaint ¶59).  Rather, Plaintiff alleges that the tea was
served too hot which sounds in negligence. 

 
Negligent Hiring, Supervision or Retention of Employee
(9th cause of action)
 
Liability for negligent hiring will be imposed on an
employer if the employer knew or should have known that hiring the employee
created a particular risk or hazard and that particular harm materializes.  Phillips (2009) 172 CA4th 1133, 1139.  To establish a claim for negligent
supervision, a plaintiff must show that a person in a supervisorial position
over the actor had prior knowledge of the actor’s propensity to do the bad
act.  Z.V. (2015) 238 CA4th 889,
902.
 
Plaintiff has failed to plead any specific facts regarding
how Defendant negligently hired, supervised or trained any specific employee.  (See Complaint ¶75).  No facts are pled to show  that the incident was anything but a one-time
occurrence.
 
CONCLUSION 

   
The demurrer is sustained with 30 days leave to
amend.  Due to the liberal policy of
allowing leave to amend and because this is only the original complaint,
Plaintiff is given the opportunity to try to cure the defects in her
pleading.
