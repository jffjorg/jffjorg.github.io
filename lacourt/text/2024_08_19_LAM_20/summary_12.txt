And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to demur to the fraud claim in the Cross-Complaint filed by the Defendants against the Plaintiffs. The Judge has sustained the Demurrer, meaning the fraud claim is defective and cannot proceed as is. The Judge has given the Defendants 20 days to amend the claim. The Judge has also granted the Motion to Strike the punitive damages claim, again giving the parties 20 days to amend. The Judge encourages counsel to submit on the tentative if possible, and if not, to appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
