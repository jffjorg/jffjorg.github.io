And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Anastasiia Arseneva, who seeks to inspect Zambrano's law offices. Arseneva wants to take measurements, photos, and videos to establish whether she is the person in Zambrano's security footage of a subject burglary, which is relevant to determining whether the signatures on her employment agreement were forged. The judge has agreed to allow a 30-minute inspection, but only for the purpose of taking photos. The inspection must take place within 30 days and cannot exceed 30 minutes. Arseneva will not be allowed to inspect any documents or confidential client information. Zambrano may call the police to be present for the inspection if there are safety concerns. The judge has also declined to award sanctions to either party.
