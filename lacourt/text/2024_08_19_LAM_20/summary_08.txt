And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions to compel further responses to requests for production. The first motion is brought by the plaintiff, Andrea Skibbs, who seeks to compel Maritz Motivation, Inc. to produce contracts and agreements related to her employment. Maritz Motivation, Inc. objected to the request, claiming that it is vague and overbroad. The judge has ordered that a privilege log be provided to explain the redactions, and that the company produce contracts that could be used to compute Skibbs' commissions. The judge has also denied the company's request to redact information related to other employees who could be witnesses.

The second motion to compel is brought by Maritz Motivation, Inc., which seeks to compel Skibbs to produce documents and communications related to discrimination, harassment, and retaliation at subsequent employers. The judge has denied this motion, finding that the request is overbroad and that the company can learn about alternative sources of emotional distress through deposition questions.

The judge has given notice that if counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
