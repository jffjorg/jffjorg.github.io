And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Elmicha Cecil v. Angela Lunt, concerning an automobile accident and the alleged hit and run. The defendant has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) and a motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The court has considered the standards for IIED and punitive damages and has found that the plaintiff's complaint fails to allege that the hit and run caused additional damages beyond those sustained in the accident itself. Therefore, the court is sustaining the demurrer to the IIED cause of action and granting the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The plaintiff has been granted leave to amend the complaint if she can allege that the hit and run caused additional damages.
