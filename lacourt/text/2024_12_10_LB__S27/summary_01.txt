And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to clarify and expand on the allegations concerning the parties involved and to add a new cause of action for violation of the Covid-19 Tenant Protection Act. The Judge finds that the motion is granted due to the liberal standard in favor of leave to amend, as long as the proposed amendment does not fail to state a valid cause of action as a matter of law. The Plaintiff is ordered to file a separate copy of the Second Amended Complaint within ten days, and any defendant who wishes to file an answer to the SAC must do so within the statutory time thereafter.
