CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV29213 JOHN LUNDGREN vs
MARK ALAN WALSH
Moving Party: Defendant Mark Walsh 
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS GRANTED.
 
Background
 
On July 11, 2024, the Court granted Defendant
Mark Walsh's Motion to Compel Plaintiff's in Person Deposition, ordering Plaintiffto
appear for his deposition within 20 days of the Court's order. On July 12,
2024, Defendant electronically served Plaintiff with the Notice of the Court's
ruling and noticed Plaintiff's deposition for July 23, 2024. Plaintiff did not
appear at the court-ordered deposition on July 23, 2024, resulting in a
certificate of nonappearance being issued.
 
On August 1, 2024, the Court issued three
orders granting Defendant's Motion for an Order Compelling Plaintiff to Respond
to Defendant's Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, within 20 days of the Court's
orders. On August 2, 2024, Defendant electronically served Plaintiff with the
Notice of the Court's rulings.
 
The deadline for Plaintiff's written discovery
responses was August 21, 2024. As of August 23, 2024, Defendant has not
received the written discovery responses, nor has he taken Plaintiff's
deposition, nor has there been any communication from Plaintiff regarding the
discovery at issue. Defendant now moves the Court for terminating sanctions.
Plaintiff did not file an opposition.
 
Legal Standard 
¿ 
Code of Civil
Procedure § 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against
anyone engaging in a misuse of the discovery process. Misuse of the discovery
process includes failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or
disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subds. (d), (g).) A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking
pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default
judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a discovery
order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions. Collison
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620. 
 
The court should consider the
totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if
the actions were willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman
(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a
greater sanction is warranted. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser
sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate
sanction.” (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.) Before any sanctions
may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there has been a willful
failure of the party to serve the required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior
Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of
diligence may be deemed willful where the party understood its obligation, had
the ability to comply, and failed to comply. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d
at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County
(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.) The party who failed to comply with
discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure was not
willful. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa
Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.)
 
Discussion
The Court finds that
there is a history of discovery abuse in this case, as Plaintiff failed to
provide discovery responses and make himself available for deposition, leading
to the filing of motions to compel deposition and initial responses. Even after
the Court granted these motions, Plaintiff still failed to sit for his
deposition or provide discovery responses. The Court finds Plaintiff’s
violations to be willful. Plaintiff did not file an opposition contesting the
present motion or present any argument how his discovery violations were not
willful. Furthermore, based on his conduct leading up to this motion, including
failure to attend the hearing for the two discovery motions and failing to file
an opposition to the present motion for terminating sanctions, it appears to
the court that Plaintiff has abandoned his case. A lesser sanction would not
likely curb further discovery abuses. Therefore, the Court grants the present
motion.
