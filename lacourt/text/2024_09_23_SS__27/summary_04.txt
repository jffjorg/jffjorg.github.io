And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to provide discovery responses, make himself available for deposition, and communicate regarding discovery, despite multiple court orders and motions to compel. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failures were willful and that a lesser sanction would not likely curb further discovery abuses. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has abandoned his case. As a result, the judge is granting the defendant's motion and will strike the plaintiff's pleadings and enter default judgment.
