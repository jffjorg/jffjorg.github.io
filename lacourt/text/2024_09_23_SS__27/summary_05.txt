The judge is granting the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Yair Morales, who was served a deposition subpoena on May 7, 2024, but failed to attend the scheduled deposition. The defendant has attempted to contact Morales multiple times, but has received no responses. The court finds that all requirements to compel Morales' deposition have been met, including personal service of the subpoena and failure to object. As a result, Morales is ordered to sit for his deposition within 20 days of the hearing date.
