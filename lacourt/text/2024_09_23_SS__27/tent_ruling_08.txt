CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV36023 IVON
NESTOLY vs FLORA LUGO LOPEZ  
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel
Shaun Bauman
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS
COUNSEL IS GRANTED. 
 
 
Background 
 
Attorney Shaun Bauman represents
Plaintiff. Bauman moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion¿ 
¿ 
Bauman has filed Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). Bauman seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff on the
grounds that there has been an irreconcilable difference and a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for
withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the
attorney to withdraw).)  
 
The Court notes that, within the
past 30 days, Plaintiff's address was confirmed to be current by counsel
through a phone call. 
 
The Court
notes that the next hearing is an OSC set for 11/14/24, which
should be sufficient time for Plaintiff to retain new counsel. Alternatively,
if Plaintiff or new counsel needs additional time to prepare for trial,
sufficient time exists for Plaintiff to take action to seek a continuance of any
upcoming date. Thus, the present motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED
effective upon service of the order on this motion on Plaintiff.
