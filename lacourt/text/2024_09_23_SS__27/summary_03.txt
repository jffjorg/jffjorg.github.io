And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for leave to intervene filed by Travelers Insurance, a non-party to the case. The motion was unopposed, and the court finds that Travelers Insurance has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation under Section 11580 of the Insurance Code. The court notes that Jyve Corporation, the insured, is currently out of business and its CEO has declined to participate in the lawsuit. The court also finds that Travelers Insurance's intervention is justified to protect its own interests, as it may be obligated to pay any judgment rendered against its insured. The court sets a hearing date for September 23, 2024, and notes that parties may submit to the tentative ruling or appear remotely or in person to argue.
