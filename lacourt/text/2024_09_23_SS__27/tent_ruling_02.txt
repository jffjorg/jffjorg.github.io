[1] Substantively,
the Court is not persuaded by Defendant’s arguments.  First, Defendant argues that there is a diligence requirement to
schedule Plaintiff’s PMQ or employees’ depositions. Defendant has not provided
any legal authority on such a requirement, and the Court is not aware of any.
The current discovery cut-off date is October 18, 2024, and Plaintiff is
entitled to conduct discovery prior to that cut-off date.
 
Second, Defendant argues that the deposition notices did not
provide enough time between when the notice was served and when the depositions
will take place. Defendant cites to CCP § 2025.270 (c); however, this section
governs deposition subpoenas. The depositions of Jordan Morgan and Jeff Cole,
who are both employees of Defendant, and Defendant’s PMQ are governed by CCP §
2025.270(a), which requires that “an oral deposition shall be scheduled for a
date at least 10 days after service of the deposition notice.” The notices at
issue were served on May 3, and the depositions were to take place on May 17
and May 21, more than 10 days after the notices were served.
