And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the order imposing a monetary sanction of $940.00 against the plaintiff and her attorney. The motion was filed because the plaintiff claimed that a clerical error prevented the court from examining her opposition to the defendant's motion to compel her deposition. The judge found that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification in providing her deposition dates, and that the court's previous decision was not altered by the plaintiff's declaration. The judge ordered the sanction to compensate the defendant for the attorney's fees expended to file the motion to compel the deposition, which was necessary to obtain the plaintiff's deposition. The motion for reconsideration was denied.
