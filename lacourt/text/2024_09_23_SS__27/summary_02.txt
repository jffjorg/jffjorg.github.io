And here is the summary in English text:

The court is not persuaded by the defendant's arguments against the deposition scheduling. The defendant claims that there is a diligence requirement for scheduling depositions, but has failed to provide any legal authority to support this claim. The court notes that the current discovery cut-off date is October 18, 2024, and the plaintiff is entitled to conduct discovery prior to that date. The defendant also claims that the deposition notices did not provide enough time between service and the deposition dates, but cites to a section of the California Code of Procedure that governs deposition subpoenas, not employee depositions. The notices in question were served on May 3, with depositions scheduled for May 17 and May 21, exceeding the 10-day minimum required by CCP ยง 2025.270(a). The court tentatively rules in favor of the plaintiff.
