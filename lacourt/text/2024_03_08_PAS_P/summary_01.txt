The motion was filed on December 1, 2023, and no opposition was filed by the deadline of February 23, 2024.

The court has also determined that there is no triable issue of material fact as to the remaining causes of action, including conspiracy to commit assault and battery, negligence, loss of consortium, abuse of process, extortion and blackmail, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court has ordered Defendant Mkhitaryan to lodge and serve a proposed judgment within five days.
