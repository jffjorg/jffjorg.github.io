And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Counsel Jilbert Tahmazian, representing Craftscape Creations, LLC and Craftscape Designs LLC. The judge found Counsel's reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory, as Craftscape has failed to pay Counsel's fees, making it unsustainable for Counsel to continue representing the clients. The judge also found that Counsel has properly served the motion papers on the clients and all other parties who have appeared in the case. The next scheduled hearing is a status conference regarding bankruptcy, set for October 30, 2024.
