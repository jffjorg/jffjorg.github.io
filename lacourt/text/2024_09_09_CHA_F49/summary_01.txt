And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, set one, and a request for monetary sanctions. The motion was filed by plaintiff Pablo Gaspar on May 13, 2024, and the opposition was filed by defendant Cole Baber on August 28, 2024. The court finds that defendant failed to serve timely responses to the special interrogatories, but that defendant's subsequent responses were in substantial compliance with relevant code of civil procedure sections. The court also finds that defendant's failure to serve timely responses was due to excusable neglect, and therefore grants defendant relief from the waiver that would preclude him from asserting any objections to the interrogatories. The court denies the motion as moot and grants in part the request for monetary sanctions, ordering defendant to pay $311.65.
