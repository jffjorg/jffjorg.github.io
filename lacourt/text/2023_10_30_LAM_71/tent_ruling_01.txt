bring a motion for relief from this Court’s May 11, 2023, order granting

Background
On January 4, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the
operative complaint alleging three causes of action: (1) violation of the Song
Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly”) – breach of express warranty,
(2) violation of Song-Beverly – breach of implied warranty, and (3) violation
of Song-Beverly – §1793.2.  Defendant
filed the operative Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs on January 3, 2023.  
On May 11, 2023, this Court granted
Defendant’s unopposed Motion for summary judgment of Plaintiff’s claims.
Plaintiffs filed the instant motion on June
12, 2023. Defendant filed its opposition on October 17, 2023.  Plaintiffs filed their reply on October 23,
2023.
 
Discussion
A
party may seek mandatory relief under C.C.P. §473(b) on the grounds of an
attorney’s “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect”  when an attorney’s actions “(1) result[] [in
a] default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will
result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) result[] [in a] default judgment
or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the
default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” 
(C.C.P. §473(b).)
A
party may seek discretionary relief from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her under C.C.P. §473(b) on grounds of
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (C.C.P. §473(b).)  A party who seeks discretionary relief under
C.C.P. §473(b) on the basis of mistake or inadvertence of counsel must
demonstrate such mistake, inadvertence, or general neglect was excusable.  (Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc.
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 258.)  “In
determining whether the attorney’s mistake or inadvertence was excusable, the
court inquires whether a reasonably prudent person might have made the same
mistake under the same or similar circumstances.”  (Henderson v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 215, 229, citing Zamora, 28 Cal.4th at pg.
258.)  However, “[c]onduct falling
below the professional standard of care, such as failure to timely object or to
properly advance an argument, is not therefore excusable. To hold
otherwise would be to eliminate the express statutory requirement of
excusability and effectively eviscerate the concept of attorney malpractice.’”
 (Id.)
Plaintiffs’
reliance on Avila v. Chua (2006) 57 Cal.App.4th 860 and Marriage of
Hock & Gordon- Hock (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1438, for entitlement to the
mandatory relief provision of C.C.P. 473(b) is misplaced.  Subsequent rulings disapprove the holdings in
both cases.  (See English v.
IKON Business Solutions, Inc. (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130; see also
Prieto v. Loyola Marymount University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 290; Henderson,
187 Cal.App.4th 215; Urban Windlands Group, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (2017)
10 Cal.App.5th 993, 1000 [“We agree with Retired Associate Justice McAdam’s
cogent analysis and disapprove of our mandatory relief discussions in Avila and
Hock.”].)
The
Court in Prieto v. Loyola Marymount University stated the following:
The heart of the matter
is that the mandatory relief provision [of C.C.P. §473(b)] was enacted because
trial courts were found to be reluctant to grant discretionary relief from
default judgments because of increased case loads. [Citations.] The policy goal
sought to be effectuated [was] to relieve innocent clients from losing their
day in court because the attorneys they hired to defend them inexcusably
fail[ed] to file responsible papers. [Citations.] To achieve this goal, the
Legislature expressly limited the scope of the mandatory provision of section
473(b) to require relief from default judgments only.
 
(Prieto,
132 Cal.App.4th at pg. 295-296.)  Summary
judgment/adjudication is neither a “default,” a “default judgment,” nor a
“dismissal” within the meaning of §473(b).  (Henderson, 187 Cal.App.4th at pg. 215.)
 As such, Plaintiffs cannot seek
mandatory relief under
§473(b).
          Plaintiffs demonstrate they are
entitled to discretionary relief because Plaintiffs’ counsel failed to properly
calendar the opposition deadline to Defendant’s Motion as a result of using a
new case managing and calendaring system and not timely catching the mistake
before the deadline to file the opposition and the hearing on the motion.  (See Decl. of Sambra ¶¶5-9.)  Good cause exists for this Court to grant
relief under C.C.P. §473(b) by providing Plaintiffs with an opportunity to
oppose Defendant’s Motion and to rule on the merits of Motion after considering
arguments from both parties.  Further,
Defendant fails to specify the prejudice they will experience from granting the
instant motion.
          Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion for
relief from this Court’s May 11, 2023, order is granted.
 
Attorneys’
Fees
A
Court that relieves a party from a judgment, dismissal, Order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her under C.C.P. 473(b) may do so on any terms
as may be just.  (C.C.P. 473(b).) The
phrase “on any terms as may be just” as used in C.C.P. 473(b) allows the Court
to require the moving party to pay costs or attorneys’ fees to the adverse
party to compensate him or her for any losses or expenses suffered by the
granting of the Motion for relief.  (Jade
K. v. Viguri (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1474.)
When
relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, the Court is required
to direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to
opposing counsel or parties.  (C.C.P.
473(b).)  Plaintiff’s characterization of
Defendant’s request for reimbursement as a request for a windfall (Reply 3:12-15)
ignores that Plaintiff’s counsel’s error has imposed costs and expenses on
Defendant.  
Defendant
argues its counsel has spent 2.3 hours reviewing Plaintiffs’ Motion,
researching, and drafting the Opposition, and anticipates billing approximately
1.5 hours for reviewing Plaintiffs’ reply and attending the hearing.
Defendant’s counsel’s hourly rate is $285.00. 
Defendant’s request to be reimbursed $1,083.00 for fees reasonably
incurred in opposing the instant motion is granted.  
 
Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside this Court’s May
11, 2023, ruling on Defendant’s unopposed Motion for summary judgment of
Plaintiff’s claims is granted.  The Court
sets a new hearing on the Motion for summary judgment on December 12, 2023, at
8:30 a.m.  Plaintiff’s opposition will be
due per the Code of Civil Procedure.  Trial
will be March 18, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. and the Final Status Conference will
be March 8, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. 71.  Discovery remains cut off.  
Defendant’s
request to be reimbursed $1,083.00 for fees reasonably incurred in opposing the
instant motion is granted.
Moving Party to give notice.
