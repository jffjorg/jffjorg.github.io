And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions filed by Jeremiah Reynolds, counsel for the defendants, to be relieved as counsel. The motions were filed on June 9, 2023, and the judge found that the counsel had provided completed MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 forms, as required by California Rule of Court rule 3.1362, and had served the motion papers on the clients. The judge also found that the clients had not obtained new counsel despite prior communications and requests, and that counsel had advised the clients to obtain new counsel to avoid any prejudice. The judge concluded that the motions should be granted as the counsel's withdrawal would not cause prejudice to the clients and would not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
