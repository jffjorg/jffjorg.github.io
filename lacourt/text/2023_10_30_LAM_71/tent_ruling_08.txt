[1] Defendants’ notice of motion indicates parties demur
on the basis of C.C.P. §430.10(c).  However, Defendants’ motion demurs on the
basis of C.C.P. §430.10(e).  (Compare
Notice of Motion, pg. 2 with Demurrer, pgs. 3-4.)


[2] The Court also notes Defendants’ reply is overlong,
but Defendants attempted to circumvent the requirement in CRC,
Rule 3.1113(d) that a reply cannot exceed 10 pages by including text on the
caption page.  Defendants are admonished
for violating filing length conventions dictated in the CRC.  While Plaintiff’s opposition also includes
text on the caption page, her opposition is well within the page limit and does
not merit comparison.


[3] The Court notes Defendants do not demur to the 2nd,
5th, 6th, or 15th causes of action.
