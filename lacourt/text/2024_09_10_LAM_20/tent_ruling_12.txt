On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff Pearlie Kate Miller, Jr., a pro per litigant, filed the operative Complaint against Defendant County of Los Angeles for (1) negligence, (2) negligent misrepresentation, (3) intentional misrepresentation, (4) concealment, (5) defamation/IIED, and (6) deceit.  Plaintiff alleges that she is an independent filmmaker that has been investigating the death of Michael Jackson and it is her contention that Michael Jackson did not die—rather, the LA County coroner’s office disseminated false facts about a body-double to fool the public and disparage Plaintiff as a conspiracy theorist among other things.  Defendant seeks judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Plaintiff did not file a timely government claim, fraud is not specifically pleaded, the elements for Plaintiff’s claims have not been pleaded, and Plaintiff lacks standing. “A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to state a cause of action against that defendant. A motion for judgment on the pleadings ‘is equivalent to a demurrer . . . .’ Leave to amend ‘is properly denied if the facts and nature of plaintiffs’ claims are clear and under the substantive law, no liability exists.’ ”  (Templo v. State¿(2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 730, 735.)  Whether due to a lack of specificity, a general failure to plead sufficient facts, a failure to exhaust, the application of the statute of limitations, or lack of standing, the Complaint is inherently defective.  Thus, the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is granted, without leave to amend. Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
