Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Pearlie Kate Miller, Jr., filed a complaint against the County of Los Angeles alleging negligence, misrepresentation, concealment, defamation, and deceit related to the death of Michael Jackson. The plaintiff claims that Michael Jackson did not die, but rather a body-double was used to deceive the public. The defendant argues that the complaint is defective due to lack of specificity, failure to plead sufficient facts, and lack of standing. The judge agrees with the defendant, finding that the complaint is inherently defective and granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings.
