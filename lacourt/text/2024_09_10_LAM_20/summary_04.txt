And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Dean Isaacson. The Court dismissed the action on July 12, 2024, after Defendant Trancas PCH LLC asserted that trial had not occurred within 5 years and 6 months. Plaintiff seeks reconsideration, arguing that the Court's order was erroneous and that the Court should have granted a motion to compel deposition. However, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate new facts or law that could not have been presented before. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied. The moving party is instructed to give notice, and counsel are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
