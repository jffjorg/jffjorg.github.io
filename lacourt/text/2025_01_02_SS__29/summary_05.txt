And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition for approval of a minor's compromise and proposed orders filed on December 9, 2024. However, the judge has found several issues that must be addressed before the petition can be granted. These issues include the lack of a doctor's report in Attachment 8, unclear medical expenses and liens, and incomplete or incorrect information in the proposed orders. The judge has also noted that the petition has paid $5,200 in medical expenses but is not seeking reimbursement. To allow the petitioner to address these issues, the judge has continued the hearing to a later date and instructed the moving party to give notice.
