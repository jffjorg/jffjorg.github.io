And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Los Angeles's motion for leave to serve a late designation of expert witnesses. The City had served a demand for the exchange of witness information that required the mutual exchange to occur by February 29, 2024, but due to a variety of circumstances, it did not serve its designation until November 22, 2024. The Court has found that the City did not timely serve its expert designation as a result of its counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The Court has also found that the City sought leave promptly after learning of its error and promptly thereafter served the proposed designation.

The Court has granted the motion, but conditionally, requiring the City to make all designated experts available for deposition by no later than January 17, 2025. The Court has taken into account the extent to which the opposing party has relied on the absence of a list of expert witnesses and finds that there has been such reliance, but its extent is limited. The Court has also considered any potential prejudice to the opposing party and finds that there is no unfair prejudice in allowing the tardy designation.
