And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by APPA Real Estate LLC and has determined that it will be overruled. The court finds that Plaintiff Cyber on Demand, Inc. has alleged sufficient facts to show that APPA Real Estate LLC assumed the obligations of Zwick Construction Company pursuant to the Agreement. The court notes that APPA Real Estate LLC's notice of abandonment states that it is assuming the work on behalf of Zwick and is seeking information from Plaintiff, which suggests that APPA Real Estate LLC has assumed the obligations of Zwick. The court also notes that Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to support the claim that APPA Real Estate LLC has assumed the obligations of Zwick.

The court orders APPA Real Estate LLC to file an answer or other responsive pleading within 20 days' notice. The court also notes that the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so, and that parties intending to appear are encouraged to appear remotely.
