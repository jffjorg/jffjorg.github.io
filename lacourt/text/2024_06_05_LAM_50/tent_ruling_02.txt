[1]As an initial matter, GM cites to, inter alia,
a time entry from June 16, 2021 for 1.0 hours to “[r]eview file in preparation
for deposition.: Review file; prepare to defend deposition of Plaintiff.”
(Barry Decl., ¶ 47, Ex. 6.) This time entry does not pertain to drafting a
“memo to file.” GM similarly cites to another time entry for 0.5 hours to “[r]eview
file in preparation for Case Management Conference.” (Barry Decl., ¶ 47, Ex. 6,
8/19/2021 time entry.) The Court does not see how these are “clerical tasks,”
as GM appears to assert.
