And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for judgment filed by KCB TOWERS, INC. and cross-defendants JAYSCO, INC. and Agustin Arreola Perez d/b/a Mr. Welder (collectively referred to as "Cross-Defendants") against ANGELES CONTRACTOR, INC. et al. The motion is based on the grounds that ANGELES has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the breach of a tort duty or evidence in support of the other elements of its negligence cause of action and that the negligence cause of action is barred by the economic loss rule.

After reviewing the evidence presented, the judge agrees with Cross-Defendants that ANGELES has failed to establish a tort duty separate and apart from the contractual duties arising from the subcontract agreement and that the economic loss rule applies. The judge also finds that ANGELES has not provided sufficient evidence to establish causation against JAYSCO and Mr. Welder.

The judge concludes that Cross-Defendants' motion for judgment pursuant to CCP § 631.8 should be granted, and the third cause of action for negligence brought by ANGELES should be dismissed.

Note: The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after hearing from the parties and considering any further evidence or arguments.
