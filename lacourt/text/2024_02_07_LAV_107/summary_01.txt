Here is a summary of the tentatively ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by the moving party, which is a real estate developer. The moving party demurred to the first amended complaint (FAC) on several grounds, including that the FAC fails to state a cause of action for tortuous breach of the warranty of habitability, nuisance, unfair business practices, and negligence.

The judge sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for tortuous breach of the warranty of habitability, the third cause of action for nuisance, the fourth cause of action for unfair business practices, and the fifth cause of action for negligence against the moving party.

However, the judge granted leave to amend to the plaintiff, allowing them to re-plead their causes of action and address the deficiencies in the FAC. The judge noted that it is at least possible that additional pled facts related to the moving party's relationship to the premises or to the other defendants could cure the defects of the FAC.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further briefing and oral argument.
