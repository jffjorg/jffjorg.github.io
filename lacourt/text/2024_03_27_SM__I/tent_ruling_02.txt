 Case Number:  20SMCV00596    Hearing Date:   March 27, 2024    Dept:  I The motion is CONTINUED. 
Defendant seeks $128,571.89 in fees (exclusive of sanctions previously
awarded).  The theory is that under the
pertinent CC&Rs, they are entitled to fees because they are prevailing
parties in an action “to enforce or interpret, or otherwise related to or in
connection with, the Governing Documents.” 
(CC&R sec.11.6.)  State law
also allows the prevailing party to recover fees in an action to enforce the
association’s governing documents.  (Civ.
Code sec. 5975.)  Much of Virk’s claim
falls squarely within these provisions. 
But it is not clear that the interference claim does.  In fact, the court’s general view is that the
assertion that defendants interfered with Virk’s economic advantage seems to
fall outside the scope.  The same seems
to be true of the alleged interference with Virk’s contract with Sazegar.  In contrast, the cause of action for breach
of contract is within the scope.
 
The court will continue the motion to allow defendants to
withdraw any time related to those causes of action from the amount they
seek.  Supplemental brief will be due in
10 court days and Virk will have 5 court days to respond thereto.  Each brief shall not exceed 10 pages.  The court will set the new hearing date.  Defendant should also include a statement
confirming that the fees sought were in fact billed without deduction and paid
without deduction.
