And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is inclined to grant the motion to quash in part and deny it in part. The motion involves a subpoena upon NHH's tax preparer, seeking certain tax records. The court concluded that the November Agreement provided for the dilution of HIG's economic interest if it failed to make a capital call. To determine the proper new economic interest, the court needs to know the capital contributed by HIG and the total capital following the capital call. The evidence in Phase I of the trial showed that the parties acted informally, making loans and acknowledging them without paperwork. The court is not confident in NHH's books and records due to errors and sloppiness.

HIG seeks certain tax documents, including the K-1, K-1 summary worksheets, and reconciliation of partners' basis worksheets, to get a definitive answer to the question of how much capital was contributed. The court agrees that documents pertaining to capital, including schedules and worksheets, should be produced, and denies the motion to the extent that it seeks those documents. The court also grants the motion to the extent that it seeks documents not pertaining to capital, such as the first pages of the returns and statements as to distributions of income or loss paid out.

The court recognizes that there is a qualified privilege for tax papers, but notes that it is not without its limits. The court finds that HIG's economic interest in NHH outweighs NHH's interest in keeping information private, and that NHH has put this at issue by claiming that the proper dilution turns on capital. The court also finds that HIG has an economic interest in NHH and has certain rights under the various agreements to certain information.

The court denies the requests for sanctions as there was substantial justification on both sides.
