 Case Number:  23SMCV01704    Hearing Date:   March 27, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to continue this motion to allow the
Supreme Court to decide the Rattigan case (and perhaps comment on Dhital).  Rattigan has been fully briefed for a while,
including amici, although the matter will not be heard until the June
calendar at the earliest (it is not set for April and the Court has stated that
it will not be set for May).
