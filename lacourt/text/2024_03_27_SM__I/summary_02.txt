And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling on the motion for fees is to continue the motion. The Defendant seeks $128,571.89 in fees, claiming they are entitled to them under the pertinent CC&Rs and Civil Code. The Court agrees that much of Virk's claim falls within these provisions, but it is unclear whether the interference claim does. The Court will continue the motion to allow the Defendant to withdraw any time related to the causes of action that fall outside the scope. A supplemental brief will be due in 10 court days, and Virk will have 5 court days to respond. The Court will set a new hearing date. The Defendant must also provide a statement confirming that the fees were billed and paid without deduction.
