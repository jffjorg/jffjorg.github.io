Significant Statements:

  - "A breach of bailment occurs when the party having custody either refuses to return the property or there is damage to it."
  - "Negligence per se is just another way of saying negligence."
  - "The court has no doubt but that had defendants failed to do that, plaintiff would have sued for that failure."
  - "Because plaintiff—the promisee—suffered a detriment in reliance on the promise (she became indebted to the emergency facility), there is consideration."
  - "The court simply does not see how any of defendants’ conduct is sufficiently oppressive, malicious, or fraudulent to warrant punitive damages even as a pleading matter."

Hearing Date: March 27, 2024
Dept: I
Summary: The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case involving a tragic fire at a pet boarding facility where the plaintiff's cat, Cannon, was severely burned. The judge has overruled the defendants' demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action, which are for bailment, negligence, and negligence per se. The judge has also overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which is for negligent misrepresentation, but has sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, which is for trespass to chattels, with leave to amend. The judge has granted the motion to strike punitive damages, but has denied the motion to strike emotional distress and attorneys' fees. The plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint, and the defendants have 30 days to answer or respond to the complaint.
