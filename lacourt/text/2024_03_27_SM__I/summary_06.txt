And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a dispute over whether service of process was proper. The plaintiff's process server served Lea Nahabedian, a receptionist at MASH Accounting and Consulting Group, on October 4, 2023. The defendant contends that service was not proper because the receptionist did not have the authority to accept service on their behalf. The Judge has reviewed the declarations of the receptionist and Vigram Shalvardzhyan, who claims to be the employer of the receptionist. The Judge finds it difficult to believe that the process server just made up the whole story and concludes that the papers were likely dropped off and given to Mr. Shalvardzhyan or informed him that they had been served. The Judge is inclined to grant the defendant's motion to set aside the default, but sets a very early trial date. The Judge is also aware of a strong public policy favoring trial on the merits.
