And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Jimmy Guzman, filed a notice of motion to quash the deposition subpoena for personal appearance and production of business records to Dr. Ben Tantayanubutr, M.D. However, the motion is procedurally defective because it was not accompanied by a supporting memorandum as required by the California Rules of Court. Additionally, the plaintiff did not provide a copy of the deposition subpoena or specify what it demands. Without this information, the court cannot rule on the merits of the motion. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena is denied.
