## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Jimmy Guzman's motion to quash a subpoena for Dr. Ben Tantayanubutr. 

The Judge finds the motion procedurally defective because Guzman failed to file the motion itself, a supporting memorandum, or a copy of the subpoena.  California Rules of Court require these documents for a motion to be properly considered.  Without knowing the specific demands of the subpoena, the court cannot rule on its merits.

The judge has denied Jimmy Guzman's motion to quash a deposition subpoena for personal appearance and production of business records for Dr. Ben Tantayanubutr, M.D. The motion was procedurally defective because Guzman only filed a notice of motion, but failed to file the actual motion and a supporting memorandum as required by California Rules of Court. Additionally, Guzman did not provide a copy of the deposition subpoena or specify what the subpoena demands. Without this information, the court cannot rule on the merits of the motion.
