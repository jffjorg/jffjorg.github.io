And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denied plaintiff Dana Moon's motion for issue and evidence sanctions against defendant Chong Park, finding that plaintiff did not show good cause for the sanctions. The court also denied plaintiff's motion to terminate sanctions against defendants Chong Park and Howard Park.

The court granted defendant Howard Park's motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Dana Moon, finding that plaintiff did not serve a valid objection under section 2025.410 and that the deposition notice was effective to require plaintiff to attend and testify.

The court imposed $4,461.65 in sanctions against plaintiff Dana Moon and her counsel Jeffrey E. Dorsett, finding that plaintiff did not act with substantial justification in making meritless objections and weak arguments to avoid deposition.

The court granted defendant Chong Park's motion for a protective order, limiting his deposition to three more hours of testimony.

The court denied defendant Chong Park's motion to prohibit plaintiff from asking questions at the deposition, finding that as an attorney representing herself with co-counsel, plaintiff may ask questions at the deposition.

The court granted defendant Chong Park's motion for sanctions against plaintiff Dana Moon and her counsel Jeffrey E. Dorsett, imposing $4,061.65 in sanctions against them.
