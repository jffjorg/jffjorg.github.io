```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for issue and evidence sanctions against Chong Park, as the plaintiff failed to show good cause for the sanctions. The judge also denies the plaintiff's motion to terminate the sanctions against Chong Park, as the plaintiff's arguments are merely conclusory and do not demonstrate that Chong Park has misused the discovery process.

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Dana Moon, as the plaintiff did not serve a valid objection to the deposition notice. The judge also orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant $4,461.65 in sanctions, as the plaintiff made meritless objections and weak arguments in trying to avoid the deposition.

The judge grants the defendant's motion for a protective order, limiting Chong Park's deposition to three more hours, as Chong Park has already testified for over four hours and the additional time is not necessary to fairly examine the deponent.

The judge denies the defendant's motion for an order prohibiting the plaintiff from asking questions at the deposition, as the plaintiff is allowed to ask questions as an attorney representing herself with co-counsel.

Finally, the judge denies the defendant's motion for $4,061.65 in sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel, as the plaintiff's opposition was largely successful and the plaintiff acted with substantial justification.
