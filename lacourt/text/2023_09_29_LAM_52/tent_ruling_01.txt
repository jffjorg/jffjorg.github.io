  Case Number:  21STCV02330    Hearing Date:   September 29, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Jimmy Guzman’s Motion to Quash
Subpoena
Plaintiff Jimmy Guzman filed and
served a notice of motion to quash the deposition subpoena for personal
appearance and production of business records to Dr. Ben Tantayanubutr, M.D.  
Plaintiff’s motion is procedurally
defective.  He filed only the notice of
motion.  He did not file the motion
itself nor a memorandum in support of the motion as required.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1112(a)(2),
(3).)  “A party filing a motion … must
serve and file a supporting memorandum.  The
court may construe the absence of a memorandum as an admission that the motion
or special demurrer is not meritorious and cause for its denial.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(a).)
Plaintiff also did not file a copy of
the deposition subpoena or otherwise state what the subpoena demands.  A party filing a motion “to quash the
production of documents or tangible things at a deposition” generally must file
a separate statement (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(5)) “that provides
all the information necessary to understand each discovery request” (rule
3.1345(c)).  The court cannot rule on the
merits of this motion without knowing what the subpoena demands.      
Plaintiff Jimmy Guzman’s motion to
quash subpoena is denied.
