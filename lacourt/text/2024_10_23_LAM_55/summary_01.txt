  - "The doctrine of res judicata is subject to an exception when the initial action is for purely declaratory relief."
  - "Declaratory relief enables a party to get a prompt adjudication without a dispute over the damages suffered."
  - "The court determines that a defendant is in breach of a contract, it is likely that the defendant will comply with the contract rather than risk a subsequent suit for damages or specific performance, since the prior declaratory judgment will serve as a conclusive determination of defendant's breach."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata, which holds that a final judgment on the merits of a case precludes further litigation on the same claim. However, the judge found that the prior judgment was for declaratory relief only and did not preclude the plaintiff from bringing the present action. The judge also rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff had misrepresented when he learned of the alleged breach of contract. Finally, the judge declined to address the defendant's new argument that the plaintiff's suit was meritless because he failed to provide necessary notification within 5 business days of the agreement's expiration. The court will set a trial setting conference at the hearing.
