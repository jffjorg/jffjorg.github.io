Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the entry of default. The defendant, Catarina Counts, failed to file a responsive pleading to the plaintiff's complaint, resulting in the entry of default on September 25, 2023. The defendant then filed an answer on November 17, 2023, and later filed a motion to vacate the default on March 22, 2024. However, the court found that the motion was not filed within a reasonable time, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The court also found that the defendant's assumption that the defendant Metro would respond on their behalf was not an honest and reasonable mistake.
