Thomas Boule v. Luxury Meetings, Inc., et al.MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
(Civ.
Code § 1717; Code Civ. Proc., § 1032)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Thomas Boule’s Motion
for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $21,421.04. PLAINTIFF
IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
On
March 25, 2021, Plaintiff Thomas Boule (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against
Defendant Luxury Meetings, Inc., (“Defendant LMI”) for breach of written
guaranty agreement, breach of written agreement, and unjust enrichment. On
January 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint, adding Defendant
Jacob Ahrens (“Defendant Ahrens”) as Defendant Doe 1. 
 
A
non-jury trial was scheduled for September 22, 2022. On September 22, 2022, the
Court noted that no appearances were entered for Plaintiff or Defendants and
dismissed the Complaint without prejudice. (Minute Order, 09/22/22.)
 
On
March 13, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s first Motion to Set Aside
Dismissal and Enter Stipulation for Civil Judgment. (Minute Order, 03/13/23.)
On May 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed another Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter
Stipulation for Civil Judgment (“Motion”). The Court granted Plaintiff’s
request to vacate the dismissal entered on September 22, 2022. (Minute Order,
05/25/23.) However, the Court denied Plaintiff’s request to enter the
stipulation for civil judgment because the stipulation and settlement agreement
were not signed by Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s representative. (Ibid.) 
 
On
June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Enter Stipulation for Civil Judgment
(“Motion”).
On August 22, 2023, the Court issued a minute order continuing
the hearing to October 4, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request because
Defendants recently paid the principal amount due to Plaintiff in this action
and the parties were negotiating additional fees due. (Minute Order, 08/22/23.)
At the hearing on October 4, 2023, the case was transferred to Department 26 of
the Spring Street Courthouse and the hearing on the Motion to Enter Stipulation
was continued to December 13, 2023. (Minute Order, 10/04/23.) On December 13,
2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Enter Stipulation for Civil
Judgment in the amount of $0.00 and ruled that attorney’s fees could be sought
pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1702. (Minute Order, 12/13/24.)
 
Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs on April 17, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Timing of
Motion
 
Plaintiff brings the instant Motion pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 and 1717. A prevailing party is
entitled to recover costs, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by
contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4); § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10).) A motion for attorney’s fees must be filed and served with the
time for filing a notice of appeal under Cal. Rules of Court Rule 8.822. (Cal.
Rules of Court Rule 3.1702(a).) Cal. Rules of Court Rule 8.822 states that an
attorneys’ fees motion must be filed within either (1) 30 days after the trial
court clerk served the party filing the motion with notice of entry of
judgment; or (2) 90 days after entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court
8.822(1).) Here, the Motion is timely because judgment has yet to be entered. 
 
Prevailing Party
 
Plaintiff contends it is the prevailing party
in this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision
(a)(4) because it recovered all monetary relief requested against
Defendants and obtained a judgment in its favor. Code of Civil Procedure
section 1032, subdivision (a)(4) defines a prevailing party as “the party with
a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a
defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a
defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against
that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief and in
situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) Plaintiff did not
obtain a judgment with a net monetary recovery but did ultimately recover all
damages sought in the Complaint via the parties’ settlement agreement. (Motion,
Emanuel Decl., ¶¶2-5.) Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff is the
prevailing party in this action under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 and
Civil Code 1717, and is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees. 
 
Amount of Attorney’s Fees
 
Plaintiff moves for an award of $26,371.04
in attorney’s fees billed at $450.00
per hour. (Motion, Emanuel Decl., ¶9.) The moving party bears the burden of
proof with respect to attorney’s fees. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(5)(A).) Specifically, a party seeking fees has the burden of showing
the fees incurred are “allowable,” are “reasonably necessary to the conduct of
the litigation,” and are “reasonable in amount.”  (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.)
 
The Court’s objective is to award attorney’s fees at the fair market value based
on the particular action. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.) 
The lodestar method is based on the
factors, as relevant to the particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Id. at 1132.) “The ‘‘experienced
trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in
his court, and while his judgment is of course
subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Id.) A negative modifier was appropriate
when duplicative work had been performed.
(Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)
 
$450.00 per hour is a reasonable hourly rate
for an attorney with 22 years of experience in a limited breach of contract
action. (Ibid.) The number of hours billed, however, was not reasonable.
In particular, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s first Motion to Set
Aside Dismissal and Enter Stipulation for Civil Judgment was denied. (Minute
Order, 03/13/23.) The time spent on that motion—8.5 hours from August 2022 to
March 2023—was unreasonable. (Motion, Emanuel Decl., Exh. 4 at pp. 15-19.) In
May 2023, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment was also
denied with respect to the request to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’
stipulation. Half the time spent on that motion—2.5 hours in April and May
2023—was unreasonable. (Id. at Exh. 4, pp. 20-21.) Accordingly, the requested
fees are reduced in the amount of $4,950.00 and Plaintiff is awarded attorney’s
fees of $21,421.04.

Thomas Boule’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF
