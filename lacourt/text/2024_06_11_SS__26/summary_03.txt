And here is the English-text summary:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to address the defendant's cross-complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add allegations that the cross-claims are barred by a settlement and release agreement. The court finds that the plaintiff's motion is supported by a declaration explaining what new evidence was discovered and why the amendment was not made earlier. The court also notes that the plaintiff's original motion did not comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, but the supplemental declaration filed later corrected this omission. The court concludes that the policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters in the same dispute is strong, and there is no indication of excusable delay or prejudice to the defendant.
