And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Shakiba Yegan, has filed a motion for relief from potential waiver of trial by jury in a lawsuit against Uber Technologies, Inc., and others. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants' negligence caused her vehicle to be struck from behind and collide with another car, resulting in serious injuries and property damage. The defendants did not file an opposition to the motion.

The court notes that the plaintiff posted jury fees late, but this is not a sufficient reason to deny relief from waiver. The court also finds that granting relief from waiver will not pose undue hardship on the defendants, as all parties have been preparing for a jury trial and the trial is months away.

Based on the court's liberal policy of granting relief from waiver of trial by jury, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for relief. The court orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
