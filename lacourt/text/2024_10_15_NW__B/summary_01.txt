And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's independent medical examination. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had placed his physical injuries in controversy through his complaint and that the examination was necessary to determine the extent of those injuries. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that the examination was unnecessary and that the defendant had not shown good cause for the travel involved in conducting the examination.

The judge found that the defendant had not satisfied the procedural requirements for the motion, including the failure to file a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(a). The judge also found that the defendant had not shown good cause for the travel involved in conducting the examination, despite the plaintiff's argument that the examination should be conducted by a physician within a reasonable distance of the plaintiff's current residence.

The judge noted that there is little case law on what constitutes good cause for travel under California Code of Civil Procedure § 2032.320(e) and that the instant action differs significantly from a previous case, Hansen v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., in which the court found that it was an abuse of discretion to order a worker with a claimed industrial heart condition to attend an IME more than 185 miles away from his residence.

The judge ordered the parties to further meet and confer immediately to make every good faith effort to resolve the issues of the plaintiff's IME without the need for further court intervention.
