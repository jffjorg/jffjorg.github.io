[1] The court notes the captions of
the motions indicate Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Defendants and their
counsel of record.  However, because the
notice of motion states only that Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Defendants,
the court considers the request as to Defendants only.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.)
