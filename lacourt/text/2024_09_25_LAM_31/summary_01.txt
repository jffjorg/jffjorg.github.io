And here is the text summary:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Liberty Mutual Group, Inc. v. Sanjiv K. Jain, et al. regarding six discovery motions filed by Plaintiff Liberty Mutual Group, Inc. The motions seek to compel Defendants Sanjiv K. Jain and Shubha M. Jain to provide verified, objection-free responses to Plaintiff's first set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents.

The Judge finds that Plaintiff served Defendants with discovery requests on January 4, 2022, and responses were due on February 4, 2022. Since Defendants failed to serve responses, all objections to the discovery requests are waived. The Judge grants Plaintiff's motions to compel and orders Defendants to provide discovery responses.

In addition, the Judge imposes sanctions on Defendants Sanjiv K. Jain and Shubha M. Jain in the amount of $844.95, consisting of three hours at plaintiff's counsel's hourly rate and $184.95 in filing fees, for their failure to respond to discovery requests and their lack of cooperation in discovery. The Judge orders that discovery responses and sanctions be provided within 30 days of the date of this order.
