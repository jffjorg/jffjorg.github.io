BACKGROUND
                
On April 21, 2022, Plaintiff sued
Defendants for cancellation of instruments. Plaintiff is Defendant Aljojo’s
mother. Plaintiff alleges Defendant recorded a fraudulent deed transferring
Plaintiff’s real property to Defendant.
 
ANALYSIS
 
When a motion to expunge a lis
pendens is filed, the burden is on the opposing party to show that the
complaint contains allegations of a real-property claim, and to show the
probable validity of the claim based upon a preponderance of evidence.  (CCP §§ 405.32, 405.31, 405.30; Howard S.
Wright Construction Co. v. Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 314,
319.)  “[T]he court shall order that the
notice be expunged if the court finds that the claimant has not established by
a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property
claim. The court shall not order an undertaking to be given as a condition of
expunging the notice if the court finds the claimant has not established the
probable validity of the real property claim.” 
(CCP § 405.32.)
 
Defendant Adnan Aljojo moves to expunge
the lis pendens recorded by Plaintiff against the property subject to this
action on the grounds that the lis pendens was not properly served or filed,
and that Plaintiff cannot establish the probable validity of the real property
claim. 
 
CCP § 405.22 requires that a lis
pendens be served on any adverse parties by certified mail before recordation.
CCP § 405.23 states that a lis pendens is void if it fails to comply with the notice
requirements of CCP § 405.22. Defendant represents that Plaintiff did not serve
the lis pendens before recordation. In opposition, Plaintiff concedes this. As
the lis pendens is void for lack of service, the Court need not address the
arguments relating to the validity of Plaintiff’s claims. 
 
Defendant’s motion to expunge lis
pendens is GRANTED. 
 
CCP § 405.38 provides for an award of attorney’s
fees to the prevailing party in a motion to expunge lis pendens. Defendant
requests $10,500.00 in attorney’s fees for 20 hours of work at $525.00 per hour.
The Court finds this reasonable. The request for attorney’s fees is GRANTED in
the amount of $10,500.00.
