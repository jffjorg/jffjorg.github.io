```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court considers the moving papers, opposition, and reply. Defendant Total Resources International, Inc. moves to quash service of the summons and complaint on the grounds that they were not properly served. The Court finds that the proof of service shows that Total's agent for service, George del Carmen Rivera, was served by substitute service on Lito Capinia, a shipping manager for Total. The Court denies the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has established the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. The Defendant's assertion that Capinia is not in charge of the office where Rivera works is not sufficient to quash service of summons. The Court orders that the parties may submit on the tentative by emailing the courtroom with notice to opposing counsel before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing."
