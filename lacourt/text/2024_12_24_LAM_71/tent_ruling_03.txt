 Case No.: 
  24STCV02330
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 24, 2024



 
Defendants Andrew Clapkin’s, Dina Marshall’s,
Marci Clapkin Weiser’s, and Karen Callan’s, individually and as trustees of The
Irwin Babbit Clapkin and Sheila Clapkin Grantor Trust, motion to compel
arbitration of Plaintiffs Shana Levin’s and Tamara Levin’s claims in their
complaint and the 5th cause of action in Defendants’ cross-complaint in this
action is denied.
 
Defendants Andrew Clapkin (“Andrew”), Dina Marshall (“Marshall”),
Marci Clapkin Weiser (“Weiser”), and Karen Callan (“Callan”), individually and
as trustees of The Irwin Babbit Clapkin and Sheila Clapkin Grantor Trust (“Trust”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) move for an order compelling arbitration of
Plaintiffs Shana Levin’s (“Shana”) and Tamara Levin’s (“Tamara”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) complaint (“Complaint”) and Defendants’ 5th cause of action in
their Cross-Complaint (“CC”) because they involve claims that cannot be decided
without resolution of the parties’ disputes relating to the 1994 Buy-Sell
Agreement (“BSA”) and to stay the action pending arbitration.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §§1281 et
seq.)  
 
Background
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their operative Complaint
against Defendants alleging one cause of action for breach of contract,
requesting specific performance and injunctive relief.
On March 14, 2024, Defendants filed their CC against Plaintiffs
and Joslevin Realty Corp. of LA (“Joslevin”) (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”)
alleging five causes of action: (1) violation of Corporations Code §§700(a), 708(a);
(2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) declaratory relief; (4) Corporations Code §709;
and (5) breach of contract.  
Defendants filed the instant motion on October 8, 2024.  Plaintiffs filed their opposition on December
11, 2024.  Defendants filed their reply
on December 17, 2024.

Motion to Compel Arbitration
C.C.P.
§916 provides that “the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial
court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced
therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order,
but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action
and not affected by the judgment or order.”  (C.C.P. §916(a), emphasis added.)
Plaintiffs’
argument that this Court is divested of jurisdiction to rule on the instant
motion is unavailing.  Plaintiffs’ appeal
of this Court’s ruling on the Anti-SLAPP Motion they filed against Defendants’
CC only affected the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th causes of action in the CC, not
the 5th cause of action at issue in this motion.  Further, Plaintiffs’ appeal does not embrace
any issues related to their Complaint.
Plaintiffs’
argument that this matter is stayed is based on an incorrect understanding of Varian
Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180. In Varian,
the California Supreme Court held that the “perfecting of an appeal from the
denial of a special motion to strike automatically stays all further trial
court proceedings on the merits upon the causes of action affected by the
motion.” (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th
180, 186, emphasis added.)  The Varian
Court went on to clarify that “[s]uch an appeal does not, however, stay
proceedings relating to causes of action not affected by the motion.”  (Id. at pg. 195 n.8, emphasis added.)
In
Varian, the anti-SLAPP motion that was the subject of the appeal covered
all of that plaintiff’s claims, so there was no claim on which the trial
court might have permissibly acted.  (Id.
at pg. 200.)  The facts in Varian
are not like the situation presented here. 
Therefore, this Court is not divested of its jurisdiction to rule on the
instant motion.
 
A.  Arbitration Agreement
California
law favors arbitration for dispute resolution. The California Arbitration Act
(“CAA”), codified at C.C.P. §1281 et seq., provides, “A written
agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy
thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such
grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.”  (C.C.P. §1281; see also Grafton Partners
L.P. v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 955 [“[U]nlike predispute
jury waivers, predispute arbitration agreements are specifically authorized by
statute.”].)  
“California
law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.”  (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97, 99.)  The public policy in favor of arbitration is
so strong that California courts have held that an employee is “bound by the
provisions of the [arbitration] agreement regardless of whether [he] read it or
[was] aware of the arbitration clause when [he] signed the document.”  (Brookwood v. Bank of America (1996)
45 Cal.App.4th 1667, citing Macaulay v. Norlander (1992) 12 Cal.App.4th
1.)  The only prerequisite for a court to
order arbitration is a determination that the parties have entered into an
agreement to arbitrate the dispute.  (United
Transportation Union v. Southern California Rapid Transit District (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 804, 808.)  Thus, arbitration
must be ordered “unless the agreement clearly does not apply to the dispute in
question.”  (Vianna v. Doctors’
Management Co. (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1189.)
Defendants
proved the existence of an arbitration agreement with Plaintiffs.  Defendants submitted evidence that on or
around April 1, 1994, the then-three owners of JLR, Sheila; along with Plaintiffs’
father, Michael Levin (“Michael”); and the parties’ uncle, Ronald Levin
(“Ronald”), executed the BSA for the purpose of establishing “consistent and
harmonious policies” to be invoked following the death of a JLR shareholder or
the occurrence “of certain other events” to “assure continuity of management by
persons who have a proprietary interest” in the Company.  (Decl. of Andrew ¶8, Exh. A.)  Plaintiffs and Defendants are successors-in-interest
to Ronald and own their shares of JLR pursuant to a transfer from Ronald
to Martin Levin (“Martin”), the parties’ grandfather, and then to Martin’s
grandchildren (i.e. the parties).  (Decl.
of Andrew ¶¶4-7; see also Decl. of Haas, Exh. L at ¶¶10-11.)
Plaintiffs
do not dispute that the BSA contains an arbitration provision.  However, Plaintiffs argue Defendants waived
their right to arbitration.  The Court
agrees with Plaintiffs.  
“To
establish waiver, there is no requirement that the party opposing enforcement
of the contractual right demonstrate prejudice or otherwise show harm resulting
from the waiving party’s conduct.”  (Campbell
v. Sunshine Behavioral Health, LLC (2024) 105 Cal.App.5th 419, 427.)  Rather, the waiver inquiry is exclusively
focused on the waiving party’s words or conduct.  (Quach v. California Commerce Club, Inc.
(2024) 16 Cal.5th 562, 585.)
In
Quach, the California Supreme Court abrogated the law that imposed a
heavier burden to show waiver for arbitration contracts than all other
contracts, including the requirement that the party opposing arbitration show
prejudice in order to find waiver by the party moving to compel arbitration.  (Quach, 16 Cal.5th at pg. 582 [“Because
the state law arbitration-specific prejudice requirement finds no support in
statutory language or legislative history, we now abrogate it.”].)
Under
the applicable waiver standard, courts hold a party waives arbitration where it
acts inconsistently with the intent to arbitrate or has unreasonably delayed in
enforcing the right to arbitrate.  (Campbell,
105 Cal.App.5th 419 [holding the defendant waived its right to arbitrate by “engaging
in negotiations over the joint stipulation [to mediate] and representing to the
court that it intended to mediate” during the five months it delayed before
moving to compel arbitration); Semprini v. Wedbush Securities Inc.
(2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 518, 527 [“It is well established that a four-to
six-month delay in enforcing the right to arbitrate may result in a finding of
waiver if the party acted inconsistently with the intent to arbitrate during
that window.”].)
Here,
Defendants have known about the arbitration provision in the BSA for at least
two years. Plaintiffs attached a copy of that agreement as an exhibit to their
shareholder derivative action they filed in 2022.  (P-RJN, Exh. A.)  Also, on July 2, 2023, Defendants themselves
demanded that Plaintiffs agree to arbitrate.  On that date, Defendants’ counsel, Jason Haas,
wrote to Plaintiffs’ counsel:
Please let us know if your
clients will agree to the arbitration or if a motion to compel will be
necessary. We intend to raise the issue in our portion of the Joint Report if
your clients do not agree to arbitrate, since any discovery as to the issues
relating to the BSA should be decided by the arbitrators, not by Judge Beaudet.
We would anticipate moving quickly to compel arbitration and would ask Judge
Beaudet at the July 11 hearing to set a hearing date for that motion in August.
 
(Motion,
D-COE, Decl. of Haas ¶12, Exh. M.)
Since
then, Defendants have delayed seeking arbitration for more than 17 months.  Defendants have acted inconsistently with
their intent to arbitrate by
actively
litigating nine pending actions, including this particular action.
Accordingly,
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration is denied.
 
C.   
Conclusion
Defendants’
motion to compel arbitration is denied.  
Moving Party to
give notice.
