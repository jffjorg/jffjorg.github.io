1.    
Motion to Compel Deposition
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Defendant’s PMK to Attend and Produce Documents at Deposition, the Court
rules as follows.
On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff noticed the Deposition of Defendant’s
PMK and Custodian(s) of Records, with the deposition to take place on March 15,
2024.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶3, Exh. 1.)  On June 14, 2024, Plaintiff requested
Defendant’s PMK availability for deposition. 
(Decl. of Majerus ¶4, Exh. 2.)  
On July 9, 2024, Plaintiff served an amended notice for LAUSD’s
PMK deposition to take place on July 19, 2024, and requested alternative dates
by the end of the week should July 19th not work for Defendant.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶5, Exh. 3.)  On July 12, 2024, Defendant objected to the
deposition for being unilaterally set and objected to the topics the witness
was to be examined.  (Decl. of Majerus
¶6, Exh. 4.)  Defendant agreed to meet and
confer and then produce the witness at a mutually agreeable date and time.
(Decl. of Majerus ¶6.)  
On July 15, 2024, Plaintiff requested Defendant provide additional
dates by the end of the week and offered to set up a call to meet and confer
regarding the PMK topics; however, Defendant failed to respond.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶7, Exh. 5.)  On July 22, 2024, Plaintiff followed up with
Defendant regarding dates for the PMK deposition.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶8.)  On July 23, 2024, Defendant indicated
Plaintiff’s two PMK topics were irrelevant. 
(Decl. of Majerus ¶8.)  Plaintiff
responded, asking Defendant to explain which category (Defendant’s retention
policies or the perpetrator’s employment) is not reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence; Defendant failed to respond.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶8, Exh. 6.)
On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff served an amended PMK deposition
notice for August 9, 2024.  (Decl. of
Majerus ¶9, Exh. 7.)  On July 30, 2024,
Defendant agreed to produce a PMK on the alleged perpetrator’s employment with
LAUSD up to 1983.  (Decl. of Majerus
¶10.)  On August 1, 2024, Defendant again
objected to the PMK topics and the unilaterally set date.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶11, Exh. 8.)  Defendant agreed to meet and confer and
produce the witness on a mutually agreeable date.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶11, Exh. 8.)
On August 5, 2024, Plaintiff and Defendant telephonically met and
conferred and were unable to reach an agreement regarding a PMK being produced
to testify to the entirety of the alleged perpetrator’s employment with LAUSD.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶12.)
On September 16, 2024, the parties attended an Informal Discovery Conference
(“IDC”).  (Decl. of Majerus ¶13.)  After the IDC, on September 17, 2024,
Plaintiff again requested dates for the PMK deposition.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶13, Exh. 9.)
On October 24, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with an amended
PMK deposition notice to take place on November 4, 2024.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶14, Exh. 10.)
On October 30, 2024, Defendant again objected on the grounds the
deposition was unilaterally set.  (Decl.
of Majerus ¶15, Exh. 11.) Defendant also indicated it would not “entertain” a
PMK notice that used the term “PERPETRATOR.” 
(Decl. of Majerus ¶15, Exh. 11.)
On November 4, 2024, Defendant’s PMK failed to appear at the
noticed deposition, so Plaintiff’s counsel recorded the nonappearance.  (See Decl. of Majerus ¶16, Exh. 12.)
On December 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.  Defendant
filed its opposition on December 20, 2024. 
No reply has been filed.
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion
pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Defendant’s PMK to appear for
deposition and produce the requested documents within 20 days.  Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to
order Defendant to produce a PMK witness and the requested documents.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions
totaling $2,900 against Defendant and its counsel.
          The
Court awards sanctions against Defendant and its counsel, jointly and
severally, pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450(g)(1) in the reduced total amount of $2,648.00, in light of the fact no reply was
filed, calculated as follows:
($350/hour x 5.5 hours) = $1,925.00 for
attorney’s fees
$663.75 for certificate of
non-appearance at deposition
$1,925.00 + $663.75 + $60.00 filing fee =
$2,648.00 in fees and costs
Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling. 
 
2.    
Motion
to Compel Production of Yearbooks
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel LAUSD
to produce unredacted yearbooks, the Court rules as follows.
          On
May 28, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with a set of requests for production
of documents, wherein one such request asked Defendant to produce all yearbooks
from Carver during the relevant time period of 1980 to 1983.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶4.)  On August 1, 2024, Defendant responded to
Plaintiff’s request, claiming it was in the process of conducting a diligent
search for yearbooks at Carver during the relevant time period.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶5.)  On September 16, 2024, the parties attended an
IDC where the Court strongly advised Defendant to produce unredacted yearbooks,
as they are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶7.)  On October 28, 2024, Defendant served amended
responses to Plaintiff’s requests for production of documents, as well as
redacted yearbooks for the years 1977-1979, and 1982.  (Decl. of Majerus ¶8.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel production of
unredacted yearbooks for the years 1977-1979, and 1982.  
          Defendant’s
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to compel production of unredacted yearbooks indicates
that it has produced the unredacted yearbooks. 

Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions totaling
$2,000.00 against Defendant and its counsel of record. 
          The Court awards sanctions against Defendant and its
counsel, jointly and severally, pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.300(c) in the reduced
total amount of $1,460.00, in light of the fact no reply was
filed, calculated as follows:
($350/hour x 4 hours) = $1,400.00 for attorney’s
fees
$1,400.00 + $60.00 filing fee = $1,460.00 in fees
and costs
Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
