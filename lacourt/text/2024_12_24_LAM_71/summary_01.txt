And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable (PMK) and orders the PMK to appear for deposition and produce the requested documents within 20 days. The judge also awards sanctions against the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $2,648.00.

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the production of unredacted yearbooks, as the issue is now moot since the defendant has already produced the redacted yearbooks.

The judge grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $1,460.00, as the defendant's objections under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) were without merit.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' inability to agree on a deposition date and the defendant's failure to produce a PMK witness at deposition, as well as the defendant's failure to produce unredacted yearbooks. The judge's decision is intended to ensure that the parties comply with the discovery process and that the plaintiff has access to relevant information to support its claims.
