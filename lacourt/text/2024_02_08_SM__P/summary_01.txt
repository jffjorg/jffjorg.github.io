Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant, The Regents of the University of California, failed to provide adequate equipment, personnel, or facilities at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, resulting in the sexual assault of the Plaintiff by another patient.

The Judge has overruled the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's claims for failure to provide adequate equipment, personnel, or facilities. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's allegations, although not specifically alleging statutory or regulatory standards, do provide sufficient grounds for liability under California Government Code §855. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's allegations of breaches of various standards and injuries resulting from those breaches are sufficient to overcome the Defendant's demurrer.

However, the Judge has sustained the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's ADA claim, finding that the claim is faulty because it seeks damages and does not request injunctive relief. The Judge also found that the ADA falls outside the purview of California Government Code §855, and therefore the Defendant is shielded by governmental immunity.

The Judge has scheduled a hearing for February 8, 2024, to consider the parties' arguments and make a final ruling on the demurrer.
