And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the foreclosure sale of his property. The plaintiff alleges that Private Money Solutions (PMS) induced him into a non-consumer loan and that PMS improperly charged a default interest rate. The judge found that the plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on the merits of his claim and that the harm to the plaintiff resulting from a refusal to grant the preliminary injunction is outweighed by the harm to the defendant from imposing the injunction. The judge also found that the plaintiff has not shown causation and damages sufficient to support his claim under California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and that the plaintiff's complaint is barred by the statute of limitations.
