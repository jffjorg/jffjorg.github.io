And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of the defendants, Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, Greek Orthodox metropolis of San Francisco, and Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, to admit three attorneys (Karina Sanchez-Peralta, Justin Kenney, and John Zavitsanos) to practice pro hac vice in this case. The motion was denied due to procedural defects in the applications, including identical Exhibit A attachments and a missing date of admission to the Texas Bar. Additionally, the proposed orders for two of the applications were rejected by the Clerk due to incorrect titling, and the applicants failed to resubmit the corrected orders. The Judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of the denial.
