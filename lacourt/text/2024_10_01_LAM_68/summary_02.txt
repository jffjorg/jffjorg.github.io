As for the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to compel compliance with the medical records subpoena served on the medical provider, Exodus Recovery, by the Alhambra Police Department. The Alhambra Police Department had requested HIPPA releases from the plaintiff, Kafshi Bennet, but she refused to execute them. The court finds that the plaintiff's emotional medical state was placed in issue through the filing of the subject action and damages claim, thereby providing the Alhambra Police Department with the right to examine the plaintiff's medical history prior to, during, and after the time of the incident(s). The court also finds that the plaintiff presents no opposition otherwise seeking to limit production or other privileges. As a result, the court grants the motion to compel compliance with the subpoena, limiting the production of records to those relating directly to the subject action, and ordering the Alhambra Police Department to arrange for service, compliance, and production of the records.
