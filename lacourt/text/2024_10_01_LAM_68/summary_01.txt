And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition to confirm the arbitration award in favor of Plaintiff Richard Holz. The petition was filed by Holz, who originally filed a complaint for various claims, including foreclosure of a mechanic's lien, breach of contract, and declaratory relief. The court granted a motion to compel arbitration, and the arbitrator issued an Interim Award and Final Award in favor of Holz for $2,146,995.90. The petition to confirm the award was served via electronic service on August 6, 2024, and no objection was filed by Respondent PBM Property, LLC. The court finds that the petition is unopposed and that all required items are present. The judge notes that all arbitration awards, including those that have already been satisfied or performed, are subject to confirmation and are not moot. Therefore, the petition is granted, and the judge orders that the proposed judgment be submitted.
