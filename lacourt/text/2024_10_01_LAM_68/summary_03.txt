As for the summary of the judge's tentative ruling, here is the text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by Defendant Linda Dobbs, individually and as Trustee of the Donald Charles Beattie Living Trust, with leave to amend. The Plaintiff, Mihael Beattie, alleges fraud in the settlement agreement entered into in 2020, which includes misrepresented payments of property taxes in the amount of $39,746.11. The Defendant argues that the settlement agreement requires enforcement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, and that the court lacks jurisdiction to consider the new action. The judge finds that the stipulated dismissal of the complaint on September 24, 2020, conditioned on the entry of the settlement agreement, renders the subject action an improper second challenge to the enforceable settlement agreement available within Department 50. The judge also orders the parties to file a notice of related cases with Department 50 within 10 days of this order.
