REQUESTED:

Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
July 29, 2021, Plaintiff Richard Holz filed a complaint for (1) Foreclose
Mechanic’s Lien; (2) Breach Of Contract; (3) Quantum Meruit; (4) Open Book
Account; (5) Account Stated; and (6) Declaratory Relief. On September 14, 2021,
the court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel arbitration. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff/Petitioner
Richard Holz moves to confirm the arbitration award. The court electronic
filing system shows the motion/petition remains unopposed, and
Plaintiff/Petitioner filed a “Notice of Non-Response.” The court system also
shows no reply at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
On
April 30, 2024, and July 26, 2024, the arbitrator ordered an Interim Award and
Final Award. The arbitrator found in favor of Holz for $2,146,995.90. [Petition, Ex. 8c: Award.]
 
The
court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award,
or dismisses the proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc.
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Service of the petition to confirm the award
was completed via electronic service on August 6, 2024. Respondent provided no
objection to the service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subd. (a).) Service is
therefore presumed valid. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subd. (b).) The petition
contains all required items. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) Respondent submits no
challenge to the petition within the 10-day challenge period for a party
participant following the July 26, 2024, issued final award. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1285, 1285.2,
1288.2, 1290.6; Valencia
v. Mendoza
(2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 427, 444; Correia v. NB Baker Electric, Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 602, 612.)
 
All arbitration awards, including those
that already have been satisfied or performed, are subject to confirmation, and
not moot. (Pacific Law Group: USA v.
Gibson (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 577, 580.)
 
The
unopposed petition is therefore granted.
 
Petitioner
submitted a proposed judgment.
 
Petitioner
to provide notice.
