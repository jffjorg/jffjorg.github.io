SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Michael Beatty and Defendant Linda Dobbs,
Individually and as Trustee of the Donald Charles Beattie Living Trust entered
into a settlement agreement in 2020. Plaintiff alleges fraud in the settlement
agreement due to misrepresented payments of property taxes in the amount of
$39,746.11. On June 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of
Contract, Fraud Intentional Misrepresentation, and Fraud Negligent
Misrepresentation.
 
RULING: Sustained with
Leave to Amend.
Requests
for Judicial Notice: Granted.
 
Defendant
Linda Dobbs, Individually and as Trustee of the Donald Charles Beattie Living
Trust submits a demurrer to the complaint on grounds the settlement agreement
requires any enforcement of the action occur under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6. Plaintiff in opposition maintains the stipulation lacks any term
for entry of judgment, thereby providing the court jurisdiction to consider
this new action. Defendant in reply reiterates the lack of jurisdiction and
basis for abatement of the action. 
 
On
July 17, 2020, the court (Department 50) entered the stipulation of the
parties, whereby the court retained jurisdiction to enforce any terms.
Plaintiff dismissed the complaint on September 24, 2020. 
 
“Section
664.6 was enacted to provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a
settlement contract without the need for a new lawsuit.” (Weddington Prods., Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.) A
court may sustain a demurrer on grounds of abatement, where “There is another
action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., 430.10, subd. (c).) 
 
The
stipulated dismissal conditioned on the entry of the settlement agreement
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 renders the subject action an
improper second challenge to the enforceable settlement agreement available
within Department 50. Nothing in the opposition establishes any right to bring
a new cause of action given the dismissal of the complaint pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6 as opposed to a dismissal without retention of
jurisdiction. (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33
Cal.App.5th 913, 918; Howeth v. Coffelt (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 126, 134-135; Hagan Engineering, Inc. v. Mills (2003) 115
Cal.App.4th 1004, 1008-1011.) The court finds no basis for leave to bring a new
suit beyond the scope of the stipulation. (Howeth v. Coffelt, supra,
18 Cal.App.5th at pp. 134-135.)
 
The court declines to consider the substantive challenges
presented given the lack of facts establishing jurisdiction. 
 
The demurrer is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. 
 
The court also orders the parties to file a notice of
related cases with Department 50 within 10 days of this order.
 
Defendant to give notice.
