And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff, Si Jung Oh, alleged that defamatory statements were made about her on the defendant MissyUSA's website and brought claims for defamation, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff failed to appear at a case management conference and did not file a case management conference statement, leading to the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff has now moved to set aside the dismissal, citing her panic disorder as the reason for her absence. The judge has determined that the policy favoring relief from dismissals where there is no prejudice to the opposing party applies in this case and has granted the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to file a case management conference statement within 10 days and to give notice of the new case management conference date.
