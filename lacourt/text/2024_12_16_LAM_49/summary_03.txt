And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that she advised the defendant on how to start her business, Fenty, and that the defendant breached their oral contract. However, the judge finds that the complaint is uncertain, unintelligible, and lacks facts necessary to discern the basis of the lawsuit. Additionally, the plaintiff's claims are time-barred.

The judge also finds that the plaintiff's allegations are frivolous and fantasy, including claims that she is the great-grandaughter of Queen Victoria and inherited £539 million, and that she was married to Eminem. The judge concludes that the case must be dismissed with prejudice to spare the defendant the costs of defending the suit and to focus scarce judicial resources on actual disputes.

The judge sets an Order to Show Cause re: dismissal with prejudice, which is granted. The case is ordered dismissed with prejudice, and the defendant is ordered to give notice.
