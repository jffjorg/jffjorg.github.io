And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Western Surety Company, seeks to file an amended complaint to assert additional allegations and claims based on additional backcharges and amounts allegedly owed. The defendant, Long Beach Unified School District, opposes the motion, arguing that the proposed amendment would be futile, prejudicial, and barred by the statute of limitations. The judge has determined that the motion is granted, and the plaintiff must file and serve the First Amended Complaint within 10 days. The judge notes that the proposed amendment does not introduce new legal theories or facts that would prejudice the defendant, and that the policy favors liberally granting leave to amend to resolve disputes between the parties.
