The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to compel the in-person deposition of the plaintiff is granted, but with certain conditions. The deposition must be conducted in a large conference room where attendees can distance themselves from the plaintiff as much as possible. Only a limited number of people can attend the deposition, including the court reporter, two lawyers for the defendant, and the plaintiff. All attendees must test negative for COVID-19 within four hours prior to the deposition and wear a KN-95, N-95, or comparable mask throughout the deposition. The deposition will take place within 10 days of the date of this order, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties or ordered by the court. The defendant's request for monetary sanctions is denied.
