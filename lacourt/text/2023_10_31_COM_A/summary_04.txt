And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel the Defendant to produce its person most qualified to testify on the topics identified in the Plaintiff's Notice of Deposition. The Plaintiff had requested the deposition due to the Defendant's failure to repair widespread defects in a vehicle purchased by the Plaintiff. The Judge found that the Plaintiff had attempted to meet and confer with the Defendant without success, and that the Defendant's objections to the deposition requests were without merit. The Judge also ordered the Defendant to pay sanctions of $2,310.00 to the Plaintiff's counsel for the Defendant's failure to show substantial justification for refusing to produce a witness. The deposition is to be taken within 10 days without limitation.
