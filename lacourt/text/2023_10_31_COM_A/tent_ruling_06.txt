ORDER CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
Petitioner, Javier
 Zenteno, filed this Petition on August 23, 2023, for an Order for
Change of Name to Ivan Aguilar Huesco to keep his
 documents in order and to have the same last name as his children.  Petitioner is over the age of 18. The court
has considered the Criminal History Assessment filed on October
 13, 2023, which could not be completed because Petitioner did not
provide a driver’s license number or identification or social security number. 
The Probation Department is unable
to complete its assessment without some form of identification or
fingerprinting. Petitioner may comply with this requirement by any of the
following methods: 
(1)  
Provide a valid California driver’s
license number or California ID Number (Petitioner may apply for and obtain a
new California driver’s license and provide that information to the Probation Department);
(2)  
Provide a driver’s license number
issued from another state and identify the state that issued the
identification; or
(3)  
Contact the Probation Department
at (213) 974-5821 and request the Name Change Probation Officer, who can
provide instructions on how Petitioner may have fingerprints taken for a
LIVESCAN and to have results sent to the Probation Department.
(4)  
Additionally, the court’s file
does not reflect that Petitioner has complied with the requirements for
publication of the Order to Show Cause. Code Civ. Proc., § 1277. 
       Accordingly,
the court continues the hearing to December 5, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the
Compton Courthouse.
