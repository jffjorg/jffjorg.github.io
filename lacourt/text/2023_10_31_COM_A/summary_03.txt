This tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's application for an interlocutory order to partition a residential property by sale and appoint a referee. The property is owned by the plaintiff and defendant as tenants in common, but the defendant is unable to pay the mortgage and refuses to sell the property voluntarily. The court previously granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer for noncompliance with a discovery order, and the defendant was entered in default. A status conference regarding the sale of the property is set for January 4, 2024, and the referee is ordered to file a report 10 court days before the hearing.
