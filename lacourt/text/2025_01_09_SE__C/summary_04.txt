And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel a vehicle inspection, requiring the plaintiff to produce the vehicle for inspection within 90 days. The judge also grants the defendant's motion to compel a deposition of the plaintiff, but takes it off-calendar. Additionally, the judge imposes sanctions of $720.00 on the plaintiff and their counsel, payable within 60 days, for failing to respond to authorized methods of discovery and disobeying court orders. The sanctions are a result of the plaintiff's delay in providing dates for the inspection and deposition.
