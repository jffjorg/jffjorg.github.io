Defendant CAMACHO TAPIA, INC.’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal
is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Court Clerk to give notice. 
 
 
No Opposition(s) filed as of January 6, 2025. 
 
This personal injury action was filed by Plaintiff FRANK
CONTRERAS (“Plaintiff”) against Defendants IRENE ORTEGA; VICTOR ORTEGA; and
MARTHA VASQUEZ (collectively “Defendants”) on May 4, 2023. 
 
On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s Complaint was dismissed
without prejudice because as of that date, Defendants had not been served with
process of the Complaint. (See 11/15/23 M.O.) 
 
Plaintiff now moves to set aside the dismissal under CCP
§473(b). 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief
shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be
filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted….” (emphasis
added.) (CCP §473(b).) 
 
Here, there is no copy of any proposed pleading/First
Amended Complaint attached to or lodged in conjunction with the subject Motion.

 
The Motion is DENIED without prejudice due to Plaintiff’s
failure to attach a copy of a pleading proposed to be filed therein as required
by CCP §473(b). The terms of the code are mandatory; compliance is not
optional.
