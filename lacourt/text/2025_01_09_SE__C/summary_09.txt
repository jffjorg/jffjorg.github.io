The court found that the parties failed to reach an agreement on the selection of an Accounting Referee, despite being ordered to meet and confer on the matter. As a result, the court has appointed Jason Engel, who will determine the judgment amount, resolve disputes over attorney's fees, and tax or strike post-judgment attorney's fees. The costs of the Accounting Referee's appointment will be shared equally by the parties.
