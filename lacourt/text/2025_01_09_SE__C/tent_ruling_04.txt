This is a lemon law action. Plaintiff Jonathan Zavala
Quintero (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant American Honda Motor
Co., Inc. (“Defendant”) alleging causes of action for: (1) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Express Warranty and (2) Fraudulent
Inducement—Concealment. 
Before the Court are Defendant’s motion to compel vehicle
inspection and motion to compel deposition. 
Vehicle
Inspection
Any
party may obtain discovery by inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling
documents, tangible things, land or other property, and electronically stored
information in the possession, custody, of control of any other party to the
action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010, subd. (a).)  A party may
demand that any other party produce and permit the party making the demand, or
someone acting on the demanding party’s behalf, to inspect and to photograph,
test, or sample any tangible things that are in the possession, custody, or
control of the party on whom the demand is made.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.010, subd. (c).)  A party may demand that any other party allow the
party making the demand, or someone acting on the demanding party’s behalf, to
enter onto any land or other property that is in the possession, custody, or
control of the party on whom the demand is made, and to inspect and to measure,
survey, photograph, test, or sample the land or other property, or any
designated object or operation on it.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010, subd.
(d).) 
On December 12, 2023, Defendant served a Notice of Vehicle
Inspection for February 14, 2024. (Sadanaga Decl. ¶ 3; Ex. A.) 
On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff served an objection to the
inspection. (Id., ¶4, Ex. B.) 
On February 6, 2024, Defendant
requested dates for the inspection, but as of the filing date of the motion (February
16, 2024) Plaintiff had not responded with dates. (Id., ¶5.) 

On November 5, 2024, Plaintiff offered January 17, 2025 as
a date for inspection. (Johnson Decl., ¶4.)
On December 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed a limited opposition which
indicated that Plaintiff offered March 27, 2025 and the parties are meeting and
conferring to determine a time when the inspection can begin. (Nandivada Decl.,
¶4.) 
Based on the above, the motion to compel vehicle inspection
is GRANTED.  Plaintiff shall produce the
subject vehicle for inspection within 90 days, absent an agreement by the
parties to an extension.  
Deposition of Plaintiff
On December 26, 2024, Defendant requested that its Motion
to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff and Request for Production of Documents be
taken off-calendar.  
Sanctions
To the extent authorized by this chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose [sanctions] against anyone engaging in conduct that is
a misuse of the discovery process …” (CCP §2023.030.) Failing to respond to an
authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide
discovery are both misuses of the discovery process. (CCP §§2023.010 (d) and
(g).)
Defendant seeks sanctions in the amount of $560.00 for each
motion (1.0 hour preparing each motion, an anticipated 1.5 hours reviewing the
opposition, preparing a reply, and attending the hearing, at a rate of $200.00
per hour, plus a $60.00 filing fee). 
Sanctions are warranted here because Plaintiff waited until
November 2024 to provide dates in response to the October 2023 Notice of
Deposition and the December 2023 Notice of Vehicle Inspection.  Because no Reply was filed, the Court imposes
sanctions in the reasonable sum of $720.00 upon
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, payable within 60
days.
