And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Bellflower's demurrer is overruled. The City had argued that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the Government Claims Act before filing the lawsuit. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs have adequately pleaded compliance with the California Tort Claims Act. The court also rules that the plaintiffs have properly commenced the lawsuit, as it is a survival action that existed while the decedent was alive and survives their death.

The court notes that the City's argument that the plaintiffs were required to file separate wrongful death claims within six months of the decedent's death is misplaced, as the plaintiffs are not seeking damages for wrongful death. Instead, they are seeking damages for personal injury.

The court also finds that the declarations filed by Arnold and Julie Braza are sufficient to establish Julia Braza's status as the successor-in-interest to Lori Braza's estate. The City's objections to the declarations are overruled.

Finally, the court orders the City to answer the complaint within 20 days.
