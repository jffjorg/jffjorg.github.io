The Court appoints Jason Engel to act as the Accounting
Referee. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
 
On December 11, 2024, this Court issued the following Order:
“Under the circumstances here, the Court finds that the appointment of an
accounting referee is necessary to resolve the issue of what judgment amount, if
any, is unsatisfied or has been overpaid by Judgment Debtors.  [¶] Counsel are ORDERED
to meet and confer regarding the selection of an accounting referee who has
agreed to serve in that capacity. Counsel shall prepare a stipulation
containing the name, business address, and telephone number of the referee; and
the maximum hourly rate the referee may charge, not later than January 3,
2025. [¶] If Counsel cannot reach an agreement on the identity of the referee,
each side shall submit a proposed list of three potential referees, together
with their names, business addresses, and telephone numbers, and each referee’s
hourly rate, not later than January 3, 2025.” (12/11/24 M.O.) 
 
On January 2, 2025, AAA filed a document entitled Response and
Objections to Court’s “Order to Show Cause” Hearing Re: Appointment of
Accounting Referee. The January 2, 2025 filing does not contain a proposed list
of any potential referees. 
 
On January 3, 2025, WNG filed a Proposed List of Potential Accounting
Referees, listing the following candidates: David B. Connelly; Howard B.
Grobstein; and Jason Engel. 
 
On January 6, 2025, AAA filed “Defendants’ Objections to Plaintiff WNG
Construction JV, Inc.’s Proposed List of Potential Accounting Referees” wherein
AAA argues that Counsel for WNG made no attempt to meet and confer prior to
filing it’s January 3, 2025 List. 
 
As of January 7, 2025, the parties have not been able to reach an agreement
regarding the appointment of an Accounting Referee and WNG has not submitted a
list of potential referees as required by this Court’s December 11, 2024, order
which clearly states: “if Counsel cannot reach an agreement… each side shall
submit a proposed list of three potential referees….”.
 
Based on the above, the Court now appoints Jason Engel, CPA, CFE, CIRA,
CVA, MAFF, ABV—Engel & Engel LLP located at 350 S. Grand Avenue, Suite 3160
Los Angeles CA 90071, (310) 277-2220. Mr. Engel’s hourly rate ranges from $250
per hour to $600 per hour, and $700 per hour for testimony. 
 
The costs of his appointment are to be born equally by both
parties—Defendants AAA NETWORK SOLUTIONS, INC.; PHILADEPLHIA INDEMNITY
INSURANCE COPMANY; and SURETY NATIONAL CASUALTY CORP. on the one hand, and
Plaintiff WNG CONSTRUCTION JC, INC. on the other hand, unless the referee
orders otherwise. 
 
The following matters are to be determined by the Accounting Referee:
Defendants’ Motion to Enter Order for Return of Judgment Debtor’s Overpayment
of Judgment; Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees; and Defendants’ Motion to
Tax or Strike Plaintiffs’ post-Judgment Attorney’s Fees.
