And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $81,166.50. The plaintiff, Mariana Olivares, sought to recover attorney's fees for the lemon law action against Kia America, Inc. The court found that the plaintiff's counsel, The Knight Law Group, incurred reasonable fees and costs in prosecuting the action. The court did not apply a multiplier to the award because the case did not involve novel or complex issues. The court noted that the case lasted for approximately two years and involved extensive discovery and trial preparation. The defendant, Kia America, Inc., objected to the plaintiff's request, arguing that the counsel's hourly rates and billing entries were excessive. However, the court found the fees and costs to be reasonable.
