And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Honorable Judge Maurice A. Leiter issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment in the case of Plaintiff Andrew Edward Ezor vs. Defendant Ellie Page, LLC, et al. The defendant moved for summary judgment on the first through fourth and seventh through ninth causes of action, alleging that plaintiff failed to address certain issues in opposition. The court found that defendant met its burden to establish that no triable issues of fact exist, and plaintiff failed to present triable issues of fact. The court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on all causes of action except the fifth cause of action for UCL violations, which was deemed insufficient to create a triable issue of fact.
