BACKGROUND
 
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff Jeanette
Polk sued Defendants, asserting causes of action for (1) quiet title and (2)
financial elder abuse. Plaintiff alleges Defendants engaged in a scheme
targeting elderly people to transfer title to their homes to Defendants.
Plaintiff alleges Defendants wrongfully induced her to transfer title to her
home to Defendant The Kristine Taylor Philanthropies on or about June 5, 2018.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action stated in it. 
(CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer
challenges only the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its
factual allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be construed liberally to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendants Appel and Manzana Property management demur to the complaint
on the ground that Plaintiff has failed to allege facts against them. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant Appel is married to Defendant Taylor and that Appel is
an attorney who specializes in foreclosure and credit assistance. Plaintiff
alleges moving Defendants participated in the scheme to induce Plaintiff to
transfer her home, collected rents, and misrepresented that the property taxes
were being paid. Plaintiff also alleges that Appel and Taylor are the alter egos
of Manzana. This is sufficient to state claims against moving Defendants. 
 
The demurrer is OVERRULED.

BACKGROUND
 
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff Jeanette
Polk sued Defendants, asserting causes of action for (1) quiet title and (2)
financial elder abuse. Plaintiff alleges Defendants engaged in a scheme
targeting elderly people to transfer title to their homes to Defendants.
Plaintiff alleges Defendants wrongfully induced her to transfer title to her

ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action stated in it. 
(CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer
challenges only the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its
factual allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be construed liberally to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
A. First Cause
of Action for Quiet Title
 
Defendant Howard demurs to the first cause of action on the ground that
Plaintiff has failed to allege that Howard claims a title in the subject
property. Plaintiff alleges she was
fraudulently induced into signing over title to her house, and that she “is
informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that Defendants claim an
interest adverse to Plaintiff’s title in the House.” (Compl. ¶¶ 17-24, 31.)
This is sufficient to allege a cause of action for quiet title. 
 
The demurrer to the first
cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
B. Second Cause of Action for Financial Elder
Abuse
 
Financial elder
abuse occurs when a person takes the property of an elder for a wrongful use or
with intent to defraud or by undue influence. (See Welf. & Inst. Code §
15610.30(a).) A person is deemed to have taken the property when he or she has
deprived an elder of any property right. (See id. § 15610.30(c).) “A
person . . . shall be deemed to have taken . . . property for a wrongful use if
. . . the person  . . . takes  . . . the property and the person . . . knew
or should have known that this conduct is likely to be harmful to the elder . .
. .” (Id. § 15610.30(b).)
Defendant
Howard demurs to the second cause of action on the grounds that Plaintiff has
not alleged that Defendant took or retained or assisted anyone to take or
retain Plaintiff’s property, and that the claim is barred by the four-year
statute of limitations. Plaintiff alleges Defendant introduced Plaintiff to
Defendant The Kristine Taylor Philanthropies and participated in the scheme to
retain Plaintiff’s property. This is sufficient to state a claim for financial
elder abuse. The complaint also states that Plaintiff did not learn of
Defendants’ wrongdoing until late 2023 when she discovered that Defendants were
not paying the property taxes as they had previously represented. 
The demurrer to
the second cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
C. Motion to
Strike
 
Any party, within the time allowed to
response to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part" of that pleading. (CCP § 435(b)(1).) “The Court may,
upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion,
and upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false or
improper matter asserted in any pleading; (b) Strike out all or any part
of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the Court." (CCP § 436.)
 
Defendant moves to strike the prayer
for punitive damages on the ground that Plaintiff has failed to allege malice,
oppression, or fraud. As Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a claim for
financial elder abuse, Plaintiff has stated facts showing entitlement to
punitive damages.
 
The motion to strike is DENIED.
