BACKGROUND
                
This is a lemon law action arising out
of Plaintiff’s purchase of 2018 Kia Stinger manufactured and distributed by
Defendant Kia America, Inc.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Song-Beverly Act provides, “[i]f
the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed
by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code
§ 1794(d).) 
 
Plaintiff asserts that the Knight Law
Group incurred $81,166.50 in fees and $$18,383.75 in costs to prosecute this action. Plaintiffs request that the Court
apply a 1.5 multiplier, for an additional $40,583.25 in fees. 
 
1. Multiplier
 
Plaintiff requests the Court apply a
1.5 multiplier to counsel’s fees due to the novelty, difficulty, and skill
displayed in the case and the contingent nature of the case. The Court is
permitted, but not required, to apply a multiplier to an award for attorneys
if, inter alia, there was contingent risk or exceptional skill displayed
by the attorneys. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138.) In applying a multiplier for
contingent risk, “the trial court
should consider whether, and to what extent, the attorney and client have been
able to mitigate the risk of nonpayment…” (Id.) 
 
There is no evidence that this case
involved anything novel, nor did it require exceptional skill. This is a
standard lemon law action. There is no basis for a multiplier.
 
2. Lodestar
 
Plaintiff seeks $81,166.50 in fees to
prosecute this case. Plaintiff’s counsel charges between $175.00 and $645.00
per hour and spent 179 hours on this case over approximately two years.
Defendant argues that counsel’s hours are unreasonable, and counsel’s hourly
rates are excessive. The Court does not take issue with counsel’s hourly rates.
The Court also does not find that counsel’s billing entries are excessive. None
of the entries cited by Defendant warrant being reduced. This action lasted two
years and included extensive discovery and trial preparation. The Court finds that
counsel’s fees are reasonable.
 
3. Costs
 
Defendant has filed a separate motion
to tax costs. The Court will address costs on the motion to tax costs.
 
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees
is GRANTED in the amount of $81,166.50.
