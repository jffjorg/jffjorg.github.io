And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the Los Angeles Unified School District's motion for leave to amend its answer to add an affirmative defense. The defense is based on Education Code section 44808, which provides that schools are not liable for conduct off school property, with limited exceptions. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the defendant recently learned about off-campus abuse during the plaintiff's deposition, which provides factual grounds for the amendment. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion. The proposed First Amended Answer may be served and filed as a separate document within 10 days.
