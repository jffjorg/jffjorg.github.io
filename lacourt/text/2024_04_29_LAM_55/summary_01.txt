And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication brought by the plaintiff, Tony Lewis. The plaintiff sought to establish that Upchurch has no defense to the plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief and that all of Upchurch's claims in the cross-complaint lack merit. However, the court found that triable issues of fact exist regarding the 2014 Membership Purchase Agreement and the plaintiff's status with respect to Jefferson LA Brea D&J Properties, LLC. The court also found that the statute of limitations has not expired for the elder and dependent adult financial abuse claim. As a result, the court denied the motion entirely, leaving the issues for the fact-finder to resolve.
