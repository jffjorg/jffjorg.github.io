Background
 
On November 15,
2023, Kyung Tai Lee (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants BCG Lodi
Homes; Joel Mensch; Aaron Mensch; Barrington Capital Group, LLC; and Alpha
Build & Design; and Does 1 to 100. 
 
The Complaint
alleges six causes of action: (1) Trespass, (2) Nuisance, (3) Encroachment, (4)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (5) Assault, and (6) Elder Abuse.

 
Defendant Alpha
Build & Design, Inc. (“Alpha”) now demurs to the Complaint. Plaintiff
opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Summary of
Allegations in Complaint
 
Plaintiff
owns the property located at 1240 Lodi Pl., Los Angeles, CA (“Property 1”).
(Compl., ¶ 8.) Defendants Barrington Capital Group, LLC or BCG Lodi Homes own the
neighboring property, 1249 Lodi Pl., Los Angeles, CA (“Property 2). (Compl., ¶
9.) Defendant Alpha is alleged to have been the contractor to develop Property
2. (Compl., ¶ 9.) 
 
Property 2 is in the process of redevelopment and reconstruction,
which has resulted in damage to Property 1. (Compl., ¶ 9.) This includes damage
caused by moving walls on Property 1, building walls on Property 1 that cross
the property line, and damaging improvements on Property 1. (Compl., ¶ 10.)
Plaintiff asserts that on at least one occasion, 3 to 4 construction workers of
Defendants, have threatened to harm Plaintiff who is over 70 years old.
(Compl., ¶ 32.) 
 
Defendant Alpha now demurs to the entire Complaint based on
uncertainty and the failure to comply with CCP § 425.10. A complaint  must  contain a “statement of the facts constituting the cause of
action, in ordinary and concise language.” (CCP § 425.10.) Defendant Alpha also
specifically demurs to the fourth, sixth and seventh cause of action. 
 
B.        Demurrer to Entire Complaint Based on
Uncertainty
The Complaint will be upheld “‘so long as
[it] gives notice of the issues sufficient to enable preparation of a defense.’”
(Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 549–550.) Although
the Complaint does not contain a statement of facts, the Complaint as a whole contains
facts asserting the nature of the dispute and lays out the causes of action
alleged against all Defendants. Accordingly, the court finds that the demurrer
is not so uncertain that Defendant Alpha is unable to respond. The demurrer on
this basis is overruled.
C.        Fourth Cause of
Action - Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
“A cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress requires: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by appellants
with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of
causing, emotional distress; (2) severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3)
actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the appellants’
outrageous conduct. [Citation.]  Conduct
is considered outrageous when it is ‘so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that
usually tolerated in a civilized community.’ [Citation.]” (Belen v. Ryan
Seacrest Productions, LLC (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 1145, 1164.) Whether
Defendant’s conduct was outrageous, oppressive, or malicious is a question of
fact for the jury. (Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc. (1970) 2 Cal.3d
493, 499.)
 
Defendant Alpha demurs to the fourth cause of
action on the basis that Plaintiff fails to allege facts to show that Alpha’s
conduct was intentional and extreme and outrageous. The Complaint alleges in a
conclusory manner that “Defendants’ conduct in willfully damaging Plaintiff's
property and business and right to peaceful and quiet enjoyment of their
property (Property 1) is outrageous and goes beyond reasonable decency.”
(Compl., ¶ 26.)  Moreover, emotional distress damages are generally not authorized in cases
other than that of physical injury. (See Branch v. Homefed Bank (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 793, 800; Cooper v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1008, 1012 [“No California case has allowed recovery for emotional distress
arising solely out of property damage, absent a threshold showing of some
preexisting relationship or intentional tort”]; Wong v. Jing (2010) 189
Cal.App.4th 1354, 1378 [Holding that “serious emotional distress” required for
negligent infliction of emotional distress is functionally the same as “severe
emotional distress” required for intentional infliction of emotional
distress.”].)


Plaintiff’s opposition states that the Complaint alleges extreme
and outrageous conduct in that construction workers threatened Plaintiff with a
hammer.  (Compl., ¶ 32.) Paragraph 32 is
not, however, incorporated into the fourth cause of action.  Moreover, the facts cited in the fourth cause
of action do not indicate that extreme and outrageous conduct stems from
Plaintiff being threatened by a hammer by construction workers. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the fourth cause of action is
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
D.        Sixth Cause of
Action – Assault
 
“‘The elements of a
cause of action for assault are: (1) the defendant acted with intent to cause
harmful or offensive contact, or threatened to touch the plaintiff in a harmful
or offensive manner; (2) the plaintiff reasonably believed he was about to be
touched in a harmful or offensive manner or it reasonably appeared to the
plaintiff that the defendant was about to carry out the threat; (3) the
plaintiff did not consent to the defendant's conduct; (4) the plaintiff was
harmed; and (5) the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the
plaintiff's harm.’” (Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 879, 890.) 
 
Defendant Alpha
demurs to the sixth cause of action on the ground that a single allegation -- that
on one occasion Plaintiff was threatened with a hammer by three to four
construction workers -- is insufficient to satisfy all the elements of a claim
for assault. (Compl., ¶ 32.) There are no allegations that the construction
workers acted intentionally, that the construction workers acted on orders of
Defendants, and that Plaintiff reasonably apprehended the harm and was harmed.
Lastly, the Plaintiff’s opposition makes additional allegations, not stated in
the Complaint. “[F]acts not alleged are
presumed not to exist.” (Schick v. Lerner (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1321, 1327.)
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the sixth cause of action is
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
E.        Seventh Cause of
Action – Elder Abuse
 
Elder financial abuse under California Welfare and Institution
Code §§ 15710.07 and 15610.30 must be pled separately.
 
Section
15610.07 provides in relevant part: 
 
Abuse of an elder or a
dependent adult” means either of the following: 
 
(a) Physical abuse, neglect,¿financial abuse, abandonment, isolation,
abduction,¿or other treatment with resulting physical harm or pain or mental
suffering.  
(b) The deprivation by a
care custodian of goods or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm
or mental suffering. 
 
(Welf.
& Inst. Code, § 15610.07.)  
 
Under
section 15610.07, “for the conduct to qualify as elder abuse, it must cause
elder to suffer physical harm, pain or suffering.” (Carter v. Prime
Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 409.) “A separate provision, Section 15610.30(a), contains a
different definition of ‘financial abuse’ that does not require physical harm,
pain, or mental suffering.” (Davis v. RiverSource Life Insurance
Company (N.D. Cal. 2017) 240 F.Supp.3d 1011, 1019.)  
 
Section
15610.30 provides:  
 
Financial
abuse” of an elder or dependent adult occurs when a person or entity does any
of the following: 
 
(1) Takes,
secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal property of an
elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or
both. 
(2)
Assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining real or
personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with
intent to defraud, or both. 
(3) Takes,
secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains, or assists in taking, secreting,
appropriating, obtaining, or retaining, real or personal property of an elder
or dependent adult by undue influence [.]
 
(Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30.) 
 
Defendant
Alpha demurs to the seventh cause of action on the basis that it is improperly
pled and is uncertain. The court agrees. Plaintiff’s sole two allegations are
that “All allegations above are repeated herein” and “[a]t the time of the
above referenced conduct, Plaintiff was elderly and therefore the actions
constitute elder abuse.” (Compl., ¶¶ 33, 34.) The court finds that Plaintiff’s
seventh cause of action is entirely conclusory as it is devoid of facts and is
uncertain because Plaintiff fails to state under what specific Welf. & Inst. Code he is alleging elder abuse. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the seventh cause of action is
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
III.      Motion to
Strike
 
Defendant Alpha moves
to strike the following from Plaintiff’s Complaint: 
 

Paragraph 13, Page 3:2-3 “…plus punitive
     damages due to the malicious, oppressive and fraudulent nature of
     Defendants’ conduct.”
Paragraph
     28, Page 4:14-15 “…plus punitive damages due to the malicious, oppressive
     and fraudulent nature of Defendants’ conduct.”
Prayer,
     Paragraph 2, Page 5:14 “On all causes of action, for punitive damages.”

 
 
To state a claim for
punitive damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a plaintiff must allege specific facts
showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud. (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for
punitive damages must be pled with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid
of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Ibid.)¿¿“Malice” is defined
in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with
a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”
“Oppression” is defined as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and
unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code, §
3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions
that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative
Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud
means “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material
fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of
thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing
injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294(c)(3).) 
 
The
court agrees that Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages is not pled with the
requisite specificity as Plaintiff fails to state facts as to what conduct
amounted to fraud, malice, or oppression. Nor does Plaintiff make allegations
on information and belief that would support the finding that punitive damages
are warranted. When
the defendant is a¿corporation, “the oppression, fraud, or malice must be
perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by an officer, director, or
managing agent of the¿corporation.” (Wilson v. Southern California Edison
Company (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164; see Civ. Code, § 3294(b).) Here,
Plaintiff fails to allege that a managing agent of Defendant Alpha perpetrated
or ratified the conduct giving rise to Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages. 
 
Accordingly, the motion
to strike is granted with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Alpha’s demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
Defendant Alpha’s motion to strike is granted with leave to amend. Plaintiff
is granted 30 days leave to amend. The court sets a Non-Appearance OSC RE:
Amended Complaint for July 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant to give notice.
