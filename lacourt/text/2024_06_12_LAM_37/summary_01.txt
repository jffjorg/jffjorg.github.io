And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' pleadings and has reached the following conclusions. Defendant Alpha Build & Design, Inc.'s demurrer to the Complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The court finds that the demurrer is not so uncertain that Defendant Alpha is unable to respond. The court also finds that the Plaintiff's seventh cause of action for elder abuse is entirely conclusory and therefore uncertain. Additionally, the court finds that the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages is not pled with the requisite specificity. The court grants Defendant Alpha's motion to strike certain paragraphs from the Complaint. The court grants the Plaintiff 30 days leave to amend and sets a Non-Appearance OSC RE: Amended Complaint for July 23, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. The Defendant is ordered to give notice.
