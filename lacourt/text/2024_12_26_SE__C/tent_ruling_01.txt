  Case Number:  21NWCV00633    Hearing Date:   December 26, 2024    Dept:  C Olaes v. David Kim, et al. 21NWCV00633This breach of contract action was filed on September 27, 2021. After a bench trial, the Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants in the total amount of $4,645,311.67. On December 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Entry of Statement of Decision and began judgment enforcement efforts. Defendants now move ex parte for a Temporary Stay of Enforcement of Judgment, or alternatively, Expedited Briefing and Hearing on a Noticed Motion to Stay. Defendants argue they need additional time to obtain an undertaking based on the size of the bond and surety requirements. Additionally, they argue a stay is required because Plaintiff’s enforcement efforts risk Defendants’ collateralization options. Defendants’ ex parte application for a Temporary Stay of Enforcement of Judgment is GRANTED pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 918. Defendants have demonstrated good cause for a temporary stay of enforcement.   “If the enforcement of the judgment or order would be stayed on appeal only by the giving of an undertaking, a trial court shall not have power, without the consent of the adverse party, to stay the enforcement thereof pursuant to this section for a period which extends for more than 10 days beyond the last date on which a notice of appeal could be filed.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 918 subd. (b).) Accordingly, Defendants’ request for a temporary stay until 10 days after the date the Notice of Appeal becomes due, February 24, 2025, is reasonable. Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ alternative request for Expedited Briefing and Hearing is DENIED. Moving party to give notice.
