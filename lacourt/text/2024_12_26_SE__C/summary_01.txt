And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's ex parte application for a temporary stay of enforcement of the judgment, pending the result of a potential appeal. The defendant has demonstrated good cause for a temporary stay, as they need additional time to obtain an undertaking based on the size of the bond and surety requirements. The judge has also denied the defendant's alternative request for expedited briefing and hearing. The stay will be in effect until 10 days after the date the notice of appeal becomes due, February 24, 2025. The plaintiff must be given notice of the stay.
