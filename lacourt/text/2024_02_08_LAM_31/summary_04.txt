Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration filed by Medix Staffing Solutions, Inc. and Medix Staffing Solutions, LLC (Medix Defendants). The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Ingrid Rodriguez's Complaint alleging claims of discrimination and wrongful termination against the Medix Defendants and their client, PATH.

The judge found that a valid arbitration agreement exists between Plaintiff and Medix Staffing Solutions, LLC, and that the agreement applies to disputes between Plaintiff and Medix Staffing Solutions, LLC's clients and customers. The judge also found that PATH is a third-party beneficiary of the arbitration agreement and is therefore bound to arbitrate its claims.

The judge further found that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the arbitration agreement, and that the parties have agreed to be bound by the FAA. The judge also found that the nonsignatory Plaintiff can be compelled to arbitrate its claims against the nonsignatory PATH.

As a result, the judge has ordered the action to be stayed pending the conclusion of the arbitration, and has set a post-arbitration status conference for November 8, 2024.
