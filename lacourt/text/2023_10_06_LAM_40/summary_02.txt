Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has considered Defendant Fidelity National Title Co.'s demurrer to Plaintiff Anne H. Decunha's First Amended Complaint. The Court finds that the complaint is uncertain and does not provide sufficient information to determine what claims are being asserted against Fidelity or the basis for any such claim. The Court sustains the demurrer, but grants Plaintiff leave to amend her claims. The Court orders Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 30 days, which must include attachments that state allegations supporting Plaintiff's putative claims and exhibits supporting Plaintiff's claims.
