 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Fidelity
  National Title Co.’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint.



 
Background
Plaintiff Anne H. Decunha sues Defendants Fidelity National Title Co., East
West Bank, and Does 1 to 100 pursuant to a March 22, 2023 First Amended
Complaint (FAC) alleging putative claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Common
Counts, (3) Total Disregard for People Non-White, (4) Collusion, (5) Identity
Theft, (6) Forged Documents, (7) Slander of Title, (8) Negligent of Duties and
Care [sic], (9) Embezzlement, and (10) Malicious Attitude to the Welfare of
Citizens. (The caption names two or three other Defendants, who are not named
in section 1 of the FAC.)
The FAC was filed by Plaintiff in pro per and physically consists of a
two-page pleading, with no attachments, let alone attachments alleging the
factual ground(s) for each stated cause of action.
On July 5, 2023, Defendant Fidelity National Title Co. (Fidelity)
demurred to the FAC’s ten putative causes of action on sufficiency and
uncertainty in pleading grounds.
On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff Decunha—still acting in pro per—opposed
the demurrer.
On September 28, 2023, Fidelity replied to the opposition.
Fidelity’s demurrer is now before
the Court.
 
Demurrer
Demurrer
Sufficiency Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the
complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in White
v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Uncertainty
Legal Standard 
A
demurrer to a pleading lies where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10, subd. (f).) “A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616, disapproved on other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business
practices need not be pled specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].)
As a result, a special demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach
failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at
uncertainty existing in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro
(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v.
J.E. French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations
question].) Where complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to
apprise defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a
special demurrer for uncertainty. (See ibid.; see also Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for
uncertainty] should be overruled where the allegations of the complaint are
sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to
meet”].)
Complaint,
all causes of action: SUSTAINED, With Leave to Amend.
In
its demurrer to the Complaint’s ten putative “causes of action,” Defendant Fidelity
argues that the claims are unintelligible as currently posed because “Fidelity
is unable to determine what claims are being asserted against it or the basis
for any such claim.” (Demurrer, p. 8.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that the FAC advances allegations entitling
Plaintiff to relief and that leave to amend should be granted if the Court
finds that the FAC is insufficiently pleaded. (Opp’n, pp. 4-7.)
In
reply, Fidelity reiterates its grounds for demurrer, advances two new points
for the first time, and argues that no leave should be granted to Plaintiff to
amend her pleading. (Reply, pp. 2-4.)
The
Court finds that it is proper to sustain the demurrer but does so with leave to
amend.
The
Court briefly recognizes that Fidelity raises two important arguments in reply.
The first is that Plaintiff’s claims are time barred because the original
January 26, 2023 Complaint clarifies that the alleged wrongs in this action
occurred between 2007 and 2009. The second is that Plaintiff lacks standing to
bring her claims against Fidelity because she filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and
2014, making any rights claimed by Plaintiff in relation to this lawsuit the
property of the bankruptcy estate. (Reply, pp. 3-4.)
Neither
of these arguments, however, were raised in the demurrer, and the Court refuses
to accept them for the first time in reply. (Nordstrom Com. Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 583 [Courts
generally need not accept arguments raised for the first time on reply without
good cause explanation as to why points were not raised earlier].)
The
Court next determines that the FAC’s claims are uncertain.
The
FAC lists out its claims at sections 8 and 9 of the FAC. (See FAC, p. 2.)
However, the FAC fails to attach “[a] statement of the facts constituting the
cause[s] of action [pleaded in the FAC], in ordinary and concise language” as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 425.10. (See FAC.) Without such
information, the Court is “unable to determine what claims are being asserted
against [Fidelity] or the basis for any such claim.” (Demurrer, p. 8.)
Fidelity’s
demurrer is thus SUSTAINED based on uncertainty in pleading.
However,
the Court gives Plaintiff LEAVE TO AMEND her claims. The Court recognizes that
the opposition makes thin arguments for why leave should be granted (Opp’n, pp.
6-7; cf. Reply, pp. 3-4.) Yet, at this point in the proceedings, and given that
the statute of limitations and bankruptcy arguments are not before the Court,
the Court determines that the most appropriate course is to grant leave to
amend to give Plaintiff the opportunity to redraft her complaint to clarify how
many claims she is bringing and what each claim is, and to attach to such
pleading (1) attachments that state allegations supporting Plaintiff’s putative
claims and (2) exhibits supporting Plaintiff’s claims (like those attached to
the original January 26, 2023 Complaint). 

Conclusion
Defendant Fidelity National Title Co.’s Demurrer to First Amended
Complaint is SUSTAINED, With Leave to Amend.
Plaintiff Anne H. Decunha is given 30 DAYS’ LEAVE to amend her pleadings.
Plaintiff is referred to the Los Angeles Law Library, which assists pro
per litigants in civil proceedings.
