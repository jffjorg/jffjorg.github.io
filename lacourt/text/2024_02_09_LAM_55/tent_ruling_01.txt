  Case Number:  21STCV40818    Hearing Date:   February 9, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Hyam Law, APC to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil.
 
Plaintiff Scott Goldstone filed this case seeking
damages related to a dispute with Defendant Michael Schneider over an Internet business
selling sneakers. After the case proceeded to arbitration, this Court confirmed
the arbitration award and entered judgment on 12/13/2023. 
Counsel for Defendant Michael Schneider has now filed a
motion to be relieved as counsel. “The determination whether to grant or deny
an attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” 
Lempert v. Sup. Ct. (2003) 112 Cal. App. 4th 1161, 1173.  See
also Jones v. Green (1946) 74 Cal.
App. 2d 223, 230.
The form notice, declaration, and proof of service comply
with the requirements for a motion to be relieved as counsel. See CRC Rule 3.1362. Moving counsel’s
declaration provides cognizable grounds for withdrawal:

Client
     breaches an agreement or obligation to the member as to expenses or
     fees.  Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.16(b)(5); Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
     (2003) 112 Cal.
     App. 4th 1161, 1173.
Breakdown
     in the attorney-client relationship (or personality clash).  Estate of Falco v. Decker (1987)
     188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.

No opposing papers have been filed showing any
prejudice to Defendant. See Rules
Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.16(d).  
Therefore, the motion is granted, and the Court will
sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
