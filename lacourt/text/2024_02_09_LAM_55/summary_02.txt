Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the 12/5/23 order granting Defendant's motion to compel Jeet Jogani's deposition. The ruling states that Plaintiff's failure to produce Jeet Jogani for his deposition was unjustified and that Plaintiff's contention that Jeet Jogani is not a party or party-affiliated is not supported by the evidence. The Judge concludes that Plaintiff's failure to produce Jeet Jogani had no merit and warrants an order compelling his deposition. The Judge also finds that Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration does not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008 and therefore is denied.
