And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Daniel Figueroa, was terminated by his employer, Mohini, LLC, in October 2020. Figueroa alleged that he was living with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and had a non-work-related hand injury, and that he requested accommodations due to his disabilities. However, the judge found that Figueroa did not provide sufficient evidence to support his claims of disability discrimination and wrongful termination. The judge ruled that Figueroa did not have a disability under the Fair Employment & Housing Act, and that there was no evidence that he was terminated because of his disability. As a result, the motion for summary judgment was granted, and the case is likely to be dismissed.
