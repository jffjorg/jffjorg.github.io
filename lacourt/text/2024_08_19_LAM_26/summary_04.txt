```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to discovery requests is moot because the defendant's counsel has already provided the requested responses. The judge also denies the parties' requests for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's motion was unnecessary and that the defendant's counsel's failure to provide timely responses was due to a mistake or excusable neglect. The judge notes that the parties had previously granted extensions to the defendant's counsel, and that the defendant's counsel had left the firm and the matter had fallen through the cracks. The judge concludes that the motion to compel is moot and that the parties' requests for sanctions are denied.
