```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to present additional evidence and request relief. The plaintiff had argued that they had newly discovered evidence, an email from Red Velvet Entertainment, that showed discriminatory remarks and bias against them. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had failed to establish any basis for relief, including mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The judge noted that the email was not newly discovered evidence and had been presented at trial. The plaintiff did not file a reply to the defendant's opposition and failed to respond to any of the defendant's arguments. The judge also cited California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 473, which provides for relief from a judgment or dismissal based on mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the judge found that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for relief and therefore denied their motion.
