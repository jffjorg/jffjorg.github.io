```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to present additional evidence and request for relief. The plaintiff sought to introduce an email dated April 9, 2020, from Defendant Red Velvet Entertainment, which the plaintiff claims shows discriminatory remarks and bias towards the plaintiff. The defendant argued that the motion was untimely and that the email was not new evidence, as it was already presented at trial. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to establish any basis for relief and did not show any mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect that would allow them to present new evidence. The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not file a reply to the defendant's opposition and failed to respond to any of the defendant's arguments. Therefore, the motion was denied.
