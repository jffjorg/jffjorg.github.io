BACKGROUND
 
On October 19, 2022, Plaintiff Janet
Yonjung Jha filed a first amended complaint against Defendants Sman Tonyala and
Buakai Tonyala asserting causes of action for specific performance and breach
of written agreement. Plaintiff alleges on August 30, 2022, Plaintiff, as
buyer, and Defendants, as sellers, entered into a California Residential
Purchase Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions (the "Agreement"),
pursuant to which Plaintiff agreed to purchase and Defendants agreed to sell
for a total purchase price of $900,000.00 certain residential real property.
However, on September 6, 2022, Plaintiff alleges Defendants, through their
broker and agent, expressly repudiated the Agreement by unequivocally notifying
Plaintiff that Defendants would refuse to perform their obligations under the
Agreement and to sell the Subject Property to Plaintiff.
 
Defendants filed a cross-complaint
against Plaintiff, Federico Cabral, Mission Real Estate, Inc. and Gerardo
“Jerry” Ascencio on November 28, 2022, asserting causes of action for
indemnification, apportionment of fault, declaratory relief, intentional infliction
of emotional distress, fraud in the inducement and misrepresentation,
conspiracy, elder abuse, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty. Defendants filed a
cross-complaint on June 26, 2023. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Motions by
Plaintiff Janet Yonjung Jha for Order Compelling Responses of Defendants Sman
Tonyala and Buakai Tonyala to Plaintiff's First Set of Requests for Production of
Documents and First Set of Form Interrogatories are GRANTED. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Janet Yonjung
Jha moves the court for an order compelling Defendants Sman and Buakai Tonyala
to provide responses to Jha’s first set of request for production of documents
and first set of form interrogatories. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On May 4, 2023, Jha served the first set of request for production of
documents and form interrogatories on Defendants Sman and Buakai Tonyala.
(Hadek Decl. ¶2.) Responses to the discovery requests were due on or before
June 9, 2023. (Hadek Decl. ¶3.) On June 15, 2023, after not having received any
responses to the RFAs or communication from the Tonyalas, counsel for
Cross-Defendant sent a letter to the Tonyalas. (Hadek Decl. ¶3.) In counsel’s
letter, they informed the Tonyalas that all objections to the discovery
requests were waived and requested that verified responses (without objection)
to the request for production of documents and form interrogatories be
delivered by June 30, 2023. (Hadek Decl. ¶3.) On June 29, 2023, the Tonyala’s
daughter sent an e-mail to counsel requesting the Tonyala’s be given an
additional 30 days to provide responses to the discovery requests. (Hadek Decl.
¶4.) Counsel agreed to the request and stated that the responses to the discovery
requests were due by July 30, 2023. (Hadek Decl. ¶4.) However, as of the date
of the motion, the Tonyalas have failed to serve any response. (Hadek Decl.
¶5.) 
 
The court finds Defendants failed to timely respond to Jha’s properly
served discovery request. The court therefore grants Cross-Defendant’s motions
to compel discovery responses to Jha’s first set of request for production of
documents and form interrogatories. Defendants are ordered to provide a
response within 20 DAYS. 
 
Sanctions
 
The
court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories or response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (CCP §§2030.090(c), 2031.300(c).) 
 
Cross-Defendant Jha request monetary
sanctions in the amount of $987.50 per motion for 1 hour preparing each motion,
.5 hours preparing a reply to each opposition, and 1 hour appearing for each
motion. Counsel’s hourly rate is $395.00 (Hadek Decl.¶6.) Counsel also seeks
the $60 filing fee per motion. 
 
The court grants Jha’s request for
monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,305.00, total. The court finds
one hour for attending the hearings on each motion sufficient. No opposition
was filed.
