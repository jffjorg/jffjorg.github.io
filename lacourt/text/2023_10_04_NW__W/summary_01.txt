Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Janet Yonjung Jha's motion to compel discovery responses from Defendants Sman and Buakai Tonyala. The motion was filed due to the Defendants' failure to timely respond to the Plaintiff's first set of request for production of documents and form interrogatories. The judge finds that the Defendants failed to serve a timely response to the discovery request, which waives any objection to the request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion and orders the Defendants to provide a response within 20 days. The judge also awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,305.00 to the Plaintiff.
