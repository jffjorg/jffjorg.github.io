And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The court grants Defendant Kenbald International, Inc.'s motion to set aside the default. In this case, Kenbald International, Inc. was served with a summons and complaint at an address in Temple City, but the court finds that the service was improper. The court concludes that the service was improper because it was not served at Kenbald International, Inc.'s registered mailing address in Walnut. The court grants Kenbald International, Inc.'s motion to set aside the default and declares that Kenbald International, Inc.'s answer, which was previously received by the court on April 9, 2024, is deemed filed and operative as of this date.
