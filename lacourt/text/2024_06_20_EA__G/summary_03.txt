Roles:
  - Judge: [Name]
Significant Statements:
  - "A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action."
  - "A sham pleading doctrine precludes the amendment of complaints that omit harmful allegations, without explanation, from previous complaints to avoid attacks raised in demurrers or motions for summary judgment."
  - "If a party files an amended complaint and attempts to avoid the defects of the original complaint by omitting facts which made the previous complaint defective or by adding facts inconsistent with those of previous pleadings, the court may take judicial notice of prior pleadings and may disregard any inconsistent allegations."
```

And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling overrules Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (LACMTA) demurrer to Plaintiff Annette Brooks's First Amended Complaint. LACMTA demurred, claiming the facts alleged in the complaint are inconsistent with those stated in Brooks's tort claim. The court finds that LACMTA's arguments are not supported by the pleadings and that the court may not take judicial notice of evidence outside the pleadings. The court also finds that the complaint adequately alleges LACMTA's liability for creating a dangerous condition of public property. The court overrules LACMTA's demurrer and orders LACMTA to file its answer to the complaint in ten days."
