And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The petition to confirm an arbitration award filed by Mark Gomez and Gomez Law, APC against George Panoussis is denied. The award was entered on May 31, 2023, in the amount of $34,257.06, and the petitioners seek to enter judgment against the respondent. However, the petition does not comply with the statutory requirements, as it does not include the substance of or an attached agreement to arbitrate. The petition does contain the arbitration award and identifies the parties and arbitrators, and alleges that the parties agreed in writing to be bound by arbitration. Despite this, no such agreement is included with the petition. The petition is therefore denied, and the respondent is ordered to provide notice.
