And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Nike's motion for a new trial, which was based on alleged irregularities in the proceedings, insufficiency of the evidence, and errors of law. The court's statement of decision found that the property was substantially complete as of July 28, 2018, and that Nike's objections to the statement of decision were considered. Nike argued that the court failed to consider its objections, but the court found that it had in fact considered them. Nike also argued that the court's findings as to the causes of the delay were contradictory, but the court found that they were not. Finally, Nike argued that the court's findings as to the condition of the roof were not supported by substantial evidence, but the court found that they were. The judge's decision is based on the court's review of the evidence and its application of the law.
