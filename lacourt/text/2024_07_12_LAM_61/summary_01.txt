And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the third motion of Brandon C. Murphy, counsel for defendant and cross-complainant David Bogner, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was defective because it was served by mail without assurance that the service was upon Bogner's current or last known business or residence address. The court had previously denied two previous motions by Murphy due to similar issues. In any future motion to be relieved, Murphy must declare that the address is Bogner's current or last known business or residence address if service is made by mail, or serve Bogner by personal service or email with proof of service.
