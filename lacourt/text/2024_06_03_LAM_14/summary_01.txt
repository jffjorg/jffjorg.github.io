And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the motion to set aside the default judgment entered against Leticia Villa. The motion was filed nearly eight years after the entry of default judgment, which is untimely. The acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment filed on February 13, 2024, does not suggest that a judgment can be re-entered. The Judge is unaware of any authority that suggests a judgment can be re-entered following the filing of an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment.
