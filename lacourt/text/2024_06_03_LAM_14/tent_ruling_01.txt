  Case Number:  LAMK15K11661    Hearing Date:   June 3, 2024    Dept:  14 LMarquez vs VillaCase Background
 
            On
September 22, 2015, Plaintiff Luis Marquez initiated this action against
Defendants Meliton Villa and Leticia Villa for violation of Civil Code § 51
concerning the property located at 4504 Avalon Blvd., Los Angeles, California
90011.
 
            On February
8, 2016, defaults were entered against both defendants. Thereafter, on April
28, 2016, default judgment was entered against the defendants. On June 7, 2016,
the abstract of judgment was issued.
 
On April 6, 2023, the writ of
execution was issued on April 6, 2023. 
 
            On February
13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment,
indicating that the judgment had been fully satisfied. 
 
            On April
10, 2024 and April 15, 2024, Defendant Leticia Villa (“Defendant”) filed two
identical motions to set aside default judgment. For the purposes of this
hearing, this court shall treat the motions as one. 
 
Instant Motion 
 
Defendant now moves this court, per Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5,
to set aside the default judgment entered against her. 
 
Decision
 
            The motion is DENIED.
 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
bases her motion on the premise that default judgment was entered on February
13, 2024. (Motion at pg. 5, Chan Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. A; Reply at pg. 2.) However,
this argument is not persuasive because February 13, 2024 represents the date
that Plaintiff acknowledged that the judgment, which was entered on April 18,
2016, had been satisfied. Defendant has failed to present any authority to
suggest that a judgment can be re-entered following the filing of an
Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment. This court is unaware of any such
authority. 
 
In order to timely move for relief
under Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5, the motion shall be filled “within a
reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after
entry of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service
on him or her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has been
entered.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 473.5(a).) In this instance, the motion was filed
nearly eight years after the entry of default judgment. As a result, the motion
is untimely.  
 
Conclusion
 
Because Defendant waited nearly eight years to seek relief under Code of
Civil Procedure § 473.5, the instant motion cannot be considered timely. While
Defendant claims that judgment had been entered on February 13, 2024, this
event within the case merely relates to the satisfaction of judgment. 
 
The motion is DENIED.
