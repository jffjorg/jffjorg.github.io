And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Lawrence Torres. The plaintiff, Golden Bull LLC dba My Noble Gold Investments, alleges that Torres breached an Exclusive Endorsement Agreement and that he failed to promote the plaintiff's products as agreed. The defendant demurred to the first amended complaint, arguing that the causes of action for restitution, promissory estoppel, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud-deceit fail to state a cause of action. The court agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer for the second, third, and fourth causes of action. The plaintiff is ordered to file a second amended complaint within 20 days.
