I.        INTRODUCTION
This case
arises out of the alleged construction defects of a residence located at 17100
Rancho Street, Encino, California (“Property”). (See First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”), ¶ 1.)
Plaintiff Evan Jehle, Trustee of the 17100 Rancho Trust, alleges he purchased the
Property from Defendant developer Rancho Villa, LLC (“Rancho Villa”), on October
25, 2019, but that the Property was “replete with latent defects.” (See FAC,
¶¶ 2, 24.) Plaintiff filed his FAC
against Rancho Villa and those involved in the construction of the Property:
Defendant David Zemach (“Zemach”)(managing member and owner of Rancho Villa), Defendant
CW General Construction, Inc. (“CW”)(general contractor responsible for allegedly
defective decking), Defendant Yoram David Najum dba JR Pool and Spa Services (“JR
Pool”)(pool and spa contractor responsible for defective pool construction), Defendants
Hudson Insurance Company (“Hudson Insurance”) and Hartford Insurance Group
(“Hartford Insurance”)(CW and JR Pool’s insurers, later dismissed), and Defendant
J.T. Eden dba The Eden Group (“J.T. Eden”)(architectural/engineering firm involved
in the construction of the Property)(collectively, “Defendants”). (See
generally FAC.)
A number of
cross-complaints have been filed in this action. Rancho Villa and Zemach filed
a Cross-Complaint against CW, Cross-Defendant Gordon S. Gibson, Inc. (“Gibson”),
Cross-Defendant Jabs Pools and Spas, LLC (“Jabs Pools”) and Riehl Construction Consulting,
LLC (“Riehl”). 
For good
measure, Riehl filed a Cross-Complaint of its own against Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant NJJ Entertainment, LLC (“NJJ”). 
Plaintiff now
seeks leave to file a second amended complaint.

III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of Civil
Procedure § 473(a) provides: “The court may likewise, in its discretion, after
notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment
to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms
allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this code.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 473(a)(1); see also Code Civ. Proc. § 576.)¿¿¿¿ ¿¿ 
The court has
broad discretion to permit amendments to pleadings, and “the court’s discretion
will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings.” (Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.)¿“The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.”¿(Id.)¿“If the
motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not
prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend.”¿(Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in trial, loss of critical
evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New
York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.)¿¿ 
A motion for
leave to amend a pleading must comply with the procedural requirements of Rules
of Court, rule 3.1324, under which the motion must include (1) a copy of the
proposed and numbered amendment, (2) specifications by reference to pages and
lines the allegations that would be deleted and added, and (3) a declaration
specifying the effect, necessity and propriety of the amendments, date of
discovery and reasons for delay. (See Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a),
(b).)¿  
IV.     ANALYSIS  
A.            
Plaintiff’s Motion to File a Second Amended
Complaint is Granted
As a
preliminary matter, Plaintiff’s Motion does not strictly comply with Rules of Court,
rule 3.1324. Plaintiff’s Motion includes a declaration attesting to the
necessity of the proposed amendment and a proposed second amended complaint. However,
Plaintiff’s Motion does not identify by page, paragraph, and line number the
addition to the second amended complaint, nor does the declaration explain the
reasons for the delay in filing. (See Declaration of Fred Fenster filed September
24, 2024 (“Fenster Decl.”), ¶ 3, Ex. 2.) Given the mostly technical nature of these
issues, the Court will nonetheless consider Plaintiff’s Motion but reminds
Plaintiff to fully comply with all Rules of Court, state and local, in future
filings. 
Plaintiff
requests leave of this Court to add a fourth cause of action for fraudulent
concealment as against Rancho Villa and Zemach. (See generally Motion.)
Plaintiff’s requested addition is based on the July 26, 2024, deposition of
Mario Rodriquez (“Rodriguez”), who installed the allegedly faulty waterproofing
system throughout the decking area. (See Fenster Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3, Ex. 1.)
At his deposition, Rodriguez testified to issues with the installation of the waterproofing
system, which he allegedly conveyed to Zemach. (See id.) Plaintiff’s
counsel further declares “[w]hen David Zemach asked Mario Rodriguez what the
actual cost of the waterproofing product would be, Mario Rodriguez replied that
the amount was $10,000 – which prompted David Zemach to reply that it was ‘too
expensive.’ As a consequence, David Zemach declined to have the work done.” (Fenster
Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff argues Zemach’s response amounts to fraudulent
concealment and supports the addition of a fraud cause of action. (See Motion,
pg. 3.)  
In
opposition, Zemach argues Plaintiff was unreasonably delayed in filing the
Motion as he knew there were issues with the waterproofing system as early as
2020 but did not depose the installer of said system (Rodriguez) until July of
2024. (See Opposition, pp. 1-3.) Zemach also argues Plaintiff’s proposed
amendment would be futile as Rodriguez’s deposition testimony is not credible
or accurate. (See Opposition, pp. 4-5.) Zemach does not argue that he
would be prejudiced by Plaintiff’s proposed amendment. 
The Court
will not give Zemach’s substantive arguments any weight because they are irrelevant
in a motion for leave to amend a complaint. Without any claims of prejudice and
given the Court’s liberal discretion to permit such an amendment, the Court
finds granting Plaintiff has met his burden. (See Morgan, 172 Cal.App.2d
at 530.)
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion.
V.    
CONCLUSION
Based on
the foregoing analysis, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to File a Second Amended Complaint. 
Plaintiff is
directed to file and serve his proposed second amended complaint forthwith.
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED: October 21, 2024
