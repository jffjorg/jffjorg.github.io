And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Evan Jehle, Trustee of the 17100 Rancho Trust, is seeking leave to file a second amended complaint to add a fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment against the defendant, Rancho Villa, LLC, and its managing member, David Zemach. The plaintiff alleges that Zemach concealed the cost of the waterproofing system installed in the residence, which was constructed with latent defects. The plaintiff's motion is granted, and he is directed to file and serve his proposed second amended complaint forthwith. The Court finds that the plaintiff has met his burden to show that the amendment is necessary and proper, and that the defendant will not be prejudiced by the amendment.
