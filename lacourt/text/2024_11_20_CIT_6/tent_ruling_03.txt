 Case Number:  24PSCV02015    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:  Daniel Romero Jr. v. Vilma G. Romero, et al. Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests Admitted, and For Sanctions. TENTATIVE RULING The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to deem requests admitted and for sanctions.              Defendant Vilma is ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order. BACKGROUND This is an action for partition of real property. On June 24, 2024, plaintiff Daniel G. Romero Jr. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Vilma G. Romero, individually, and as trustee of the Vilma Gladiz Romero Trust dated May 11, 2020 (Vilma), Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), and Does 1 through 10, alleging the sole cause of action for partition. On October 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to deem the Request for Admissions admitted. On November 18, 2024, Defendant Vilma filed a motion for leave to file a late opposition to the motion and an ex parte application for an order shortening time to hear the motion. LEGAL STANDARD When a party fails to serve a timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the request for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) DISCUSSION Plaintiff seeks to deem the matters specified in Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted as to Defendant Vilma. Plaintiff indicates having served these discovery requests on Vilma on July 25, 2024, but that Vilma has not responded. (Armijo Decl., ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. 5.) The Court finds Plaintiff’s motion not well taken. Plaintiff may not serve discovery requests until at least 10 days after service of the complaint or the defendant’s first appearance in the action, whichever is first. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.020, subd. (b), 2031.020, subd. (b), 2033.020, subd. (b).) Plaintiff served the complaint on Vilma on July 16, 2024. (Proof of Service (7/18/24); Proof of Service (7/19/24).) Ten days after July 16, 2024, is July 26, 2024. Plaintiff served these Requests for Admission on Vilma on July 25, 2024. (Armijo Decl., Ex. 2.) Vilma also did not appear in this action until August 20, 2024. (Answer (8/20/24).) Thus, Plaintiff’s discovery requests were served prematurely and are therefore improper. Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion and corresponding request for monetary sanctions. CONCLUSION The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to deem requests admitted and for sanctions.              Defendant Vilma is ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.Plaintiff’s  Demurrer to Amended Answer TENTATIVE  RULING The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the First Amended Answer with  20 days’ leave to amend.              Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order. BACKGROUND This is an action for partition of real property. On June 24, 2024,  plaintiff Daniel G. Romero Jr. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants  Vilma G. Romero, individually, and as trustee of the Vilma Gladiz Romero Trust  dated May 11, 2020 (Vilma), Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.  (MERS), and Does 1 through 10, alleging the sole cause of action for partition.  On August 20, 2024, Vilma answered the complaint. On September 25, 2024, Vilma  filed a First Amended Answer (the “Amended Answer”). On October 18, 2024, Plaintiff demurred to the Amended Answer. On November  6, 2024, Vilma opposed the demurrer. On November 12, 2024, Plaintiff replied. LEGAL  STANDARD A  demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It  raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing  party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., §  422.10; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,  994 (Donabedian).) It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge  the truthfulness of the complaint or answer; and for purposes of ruling on the  demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint or answer are assumed to be  true. (See id. at pp. 993-994.) A  demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially  noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,  supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be  considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,  881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting  demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].) A  demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire pleading, cause of  action, or affirmative defense. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd.  (a); Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong  v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency  (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046-1047.) PRELIMINARY  ISSUES             The  Court notes that Plaintiff filed and served the demurrer on October 18, 2024, i.e.,  more than 10 days after Vilma filed and served the Amended Answer, and is  therefore untimely. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40, subd. (b).) The Court also  notes, however, that, Vilma did not raise this issue in the opposition. (See  generally, Opp.) Thus, the Court exercises its discretion to still consider the  demurrer, but admonishes Plaintiff to comply with the requirements of the Code  of Civil Procedure going forward. (Jackson v.  Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 742, 750; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300,  subd. (d).) DISCUSSION             Meet and  Confer             The Court finds  Plaintiff’s efforts to meet and confer before filing this demurrer sufficient.  (Armijo Decl., ¶ 8; Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)             Summary of  Arguments             Plaintiff demurs  to all twelve of Defendant Vilma’s affirmative defenses on the grounds that  they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense under Code of Civil  Procedure section 430.20, subdivision (a). Plaintiff contends the law requires  Vilma to state any interest she claims in the subject property but failed to do  so. Plaintiff contends the law requires defendant to specially plead any  equitable defenses, so the First through Fifth and Seventh through Ninth  Affirmative Defenses are defective. Plaintiff then contends “failure to state a  cause of action” is not a proper defense and that Vilma fails to plead any  facts to establish a “failure to mitigate” defense. Finally, Plaintiff further  contends the only defense available in a partition suit is for waiver.             In opposition,  Vilma contends she has adequately pleaded her equitable defenses, but indicates  that she can allege additional facts to support them if necessary, such as:  ·          Vilma relying on Plaintiff’s representations  regarding adding him to the title without explaining the legal implications of  a joint tenancy;·          Plaintiff failing to allow Vilma  to occupy the subject property herself until she dies;·          specific statements Plaintiff made  to Vilma to induce her into adding Plaintiff as a joint tenant; and·          statements regarding the length of  time from which Plaintiff has not lived in the subject property and the  prejudice to Vilma caused by that delay. Vilma  concedes the Sixth Cause of Action for misrepresentation is defective and needs  to be amended. Vilma also concedes the Sixth Affirmative Defense for failure to  state a cause of action is defective and can be stricken. Vilma further  contends affirmative defenses are permitted, and that affirmative defenses of  waiver can be express or implied. Analysis The Court  finds many of Plaintiff’s arguments regarding defects in the Amended Answer  persuasive. First, Code of Civil Procedure section 872.410, subdivision (a),  requires the answer to a partition claim to set forth the defendant’s interest  in the subject property. (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.410, subd. (a).) The Amended  Answer does not clearly set forth Vilma’s interest in the subject property, but  instead only disputes the percentage of Plaintiff’s interest in the subject  property. (Amended Answer (9/25/24), p. 2, ¶ 14.) This does not clearly  demonstrate what Vilma’s interest in the subject property is, even if compared  against the allegations of the complaint. (Compl., ¶ 14.) Second, the Court  finds Vilma’s affirmative defenses fail to state sufficient facts to support  them, such as the First Affirmative Defense for estoppel, the Fourth  Affirmative Defense for undue influence, the Fifth Affirmative Defense for  misrepresentation (which Vilma concedes is defective), the Seventh Affirmative  Defense for laches, the Eighth Affirmative Defense for waiver, the Ninth  Affirmative Defense for consent, the Tenth Affirmative Defense for failure to  mitigate damages, the Eleventh Affirmative Defense for assumption of risk, and  the Twelfth Affirmative Defense for failure to satisfy a condition precedent.  These affirmative defenses contain largely conclusory language and fail to  allege any specific facts to support them. (See generally, Amended Answer  (9/25/24).) The Court also notes that Vilma’s opposition does not address  Plaintiff’s arguments regarding the Tenth through Twelfth Affirmative Defenses.  Additionally, even where there are some factual allegations, they are minimal,  such as the Second Affirmative Defense for breach of contract, and the Third  Affirmative Defense for unclean hands. The Court  disagrees with the parties regarding the Sixth Affirmative Defense for failure  to state a cause of action. Code of Civil Procedure section 430.80, subdivision  (a), provides that a party’s failure to object by demurrer or answer for  failure to state a cause of action is not waived. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.80,  subd. (a).) Whether failure to state a cause of action as asserted in an answer  is a denial or an affirmative defense is an argument of form over substance;  the point is that the defendant’s answer may object to a complaint by claiming  failure to state a cause of action. Nevertheless, the Court does find the  Amended Answer fails to set forth facts explaining why the complaint fails to  state a cause of action. (Amended Answer (9/25/24), p. 5, ¶ 34.) With respect to the argument that the only available  defense in a partition action is waiver, the Court is not persuaded. While the  language of Code of Civil Procedure section 872.710, subdivision (b), states  that the right to partition is absolute unless barred by a valid waiver, Code  of Civil Procedure section 872.140 also provides that a partition action is a  proceeding in equity. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 872.140, 872.710, subd. (b).) Case  law provides that the equitable principles of fairness support affirmative  defenses of waiver, estoppel, and other equitable affirmative defenses against  partition claims. “The objecting coowner [sic]  is thus forced to part with his interest in the property, contrary to his  expectations which brought into being defenses such as waiver of the right of  partition, estoppel or other conditions which make applicable the equitable  principle of fairness.” (Am. Med. Int'l, Inc. v. Feller  (1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 1008, 1016; see also § 11:20. Right of partition—Defenses  to partition; waiver or estoppel, 4 Cal. Real Est. § 11:20 (4th ed.) [“because  the action is a proceeding in equity, it is doubtful that the Legislature  intended to restrict the court's powers of equity, especially when it did not  expressly refer to a limitation on such powers to preclude the right of  partition”].) Nevertheless, for the reasons set forth above, the  Court agrees that the Amended Answer is deficient and should be amended with  supplemental allegations addressing the defects set forth herein. The Court  therefore SUSTAINS the demurrer to the First Amended Answer with 20 days’ leave  to amend. CONCLUSION The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the First Amended Answer with  20 days’ leave to amend. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
