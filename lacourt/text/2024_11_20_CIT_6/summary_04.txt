Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment as to the money judgment, but denies it as to possession of collateral. The plaintiff is seeking a default judgment against the defendants in the amount of $58,984.13, including $56,326.60 in damages, $2,016.53 in attorney fees, and $641 in costs. The judge finds that the plaintiff has submitted sufficient evidence to support the amount requested, but notes that the plaintiff failed to provide the original finance agreement or a declaration explaining why it could not be produced. The judge also takes issue with the proposed judgment providing for both a money judgment and possession of collateral, as this could potentially lead to a double recovery. Instead, the judge suggests awarding a money judgment and allowing the plaintiff to proceed based on that. If the plaintiff submits to the tentative ruling, the plaintiff can submit a corrected proposed judgment for only the money judgment prior to the November 20, 2024 case management conference, and the court will sign it.
