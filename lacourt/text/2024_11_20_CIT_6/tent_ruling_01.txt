California Casualty Indemnity Exchange’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Michael Harrison 
TENTATIVE RULING 
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of

Default Judgment reflecting the reduced amount.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is an insurance subrogation action arising out of an auto accident. On
September 13, 2023, plaintiff California Casualty Indemnity Exchange
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Michael Harrison (Defendant)
and Does 1 through 100, alleging two causes of action for subrogation claim and
indebtedness. On February 9, 2024, default was entered against Defendant. On
April 4, 2024, the Court rejected Plaintiff’s prior request for entry of
default judgment. On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a default judgment
package.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed
to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment
on the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $42,385.45,
including $41,835.00 in damages and $550.45 in costs. However, the
documentation provided still does not add up to $41,835.00 in damages, but
instead adds up to only $41,561.12. (Webb Decl., Ex. 3.) 
CONCLUSION           
                Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$41,561.12, plus costs of $550.45. Plaintiff is ordered to submit a new proposed
Default Judgment reflecting the reduced amount.
