If Plaintiff submits to the tentative ruling,  Plaintiff can submit a corrected Proposed Judgment for only the money judgment  prior to the November 20, 2024 case management conference and the Court will  sign it.            BACKGROUND                        This  is a breach of contract case. On July 3, 2024, plaintiff EBF Holdings, LLC dba  Everest Business Funding (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants  Castro Aljurdi, Inc., a California Corporation dba Teddy’s Taco (Teddy’s Taco),  Theodoro Hinojosa Castro (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 10,  alleging causes of action for breach of revenue based financing agreement,  fraud, negligent misrepresentation, violation of UCL, claim and delivery, and  breach of guaranty. On August 27, 2023, default was entered against Defendants.  On August 30, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a default judgment package.            LEGAL STANDARD  Code of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of  a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must  file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2)  declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested;  (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and  disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of  judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or  an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,  supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;  and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement  of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS  Plaintiff seeks default judgment against Defendants  in the total amount of $58,984.13, including $56,326.60 in damages, $2,016.53  in attorney fees, and $641 in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff has submitted sufficient  evidence to support the amount requested, but notes a couple issues. First,  Plaintiff failed to provide either the original finance agreement or a declaration  explaining why the original could not be produced. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1806; Kahn  v. Lasorda’s Dugout, Inc. (2003)  109 Cal.App.4th 1118, 1123.)  Second, the Court takes issue with the proposed  judgment providing for both a money judgment and possession of the collateral under  the subject finance agreement. The Court finds this potentially problematic since  the collateral under the subject finance agreement is simply Defendant Teddy’s  Taco’s future earnings, (Johnson Decl., Ex. 1, p. 9 of pdf), while the judgment  itself can be used to obtain a writ of execution to levy funds from Defendants’  bank accounts, (see Adir Internat., LLC v. Superior Court (2013) 216  Cal.App.4th 996, 998). An award of both a money judgment and possession of the  collateral could potentially lead to a double recovery. The better approach is  to award a money judgment and then for Plaintiff to proceed based on that.  CONCLUSION                        Based on the  foregoing,  Plaintiff’s request for entry  of default judgment is GRANTED as to the money judgment but DENIED as to  possession of collateral. If Plaintiff submits to the tentative ruling,  Plaintiff can submit a corrected Proposed Judgment for only the money judgment prior  to the November 20, 2024 case management conference and the Court will sign it.
