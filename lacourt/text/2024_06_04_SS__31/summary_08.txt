Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend, as the plaintiff has failed to timely present a tort claim, which is a condition precedent to maintaining a cause of action against a public entity. The plaintiff's petition to file a late claim was previously denied, and the plaintiff has not dismissed the defendant from the action. The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant, and therefore grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court also grants the request for judicial notice of various documents and orders the moving party to give notice.
