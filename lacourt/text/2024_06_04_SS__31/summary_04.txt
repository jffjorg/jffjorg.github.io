The Plaintiff, Lizza Schlumbrecht, seeks to quash the subpoena, which seeks police reports related to a domestic violence incident involving the Defendant, Karen Solomon. The Court finds that the subpoena is overbroad and not relevant to the case. The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas issued to the Orange County Sheriff's Department (OCSD) and the San Clemente Police Department (SCPD). The Court notes that the Defendant did not demonstrate that there are less intrusive means of obtaining the information and that the subpoena seeks reports unrelated to the February 2020 incident.
