And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge grants FSP's motion for leave to file a permissive cross-complaint against Universal Protection Service, LP. The proposed cross-complaint seeks equitable indemnity, contribution, and apportionment of fault, comparative fault, express contractual indemnity, breach of contract, and declaratory relief. The judge finds that the proposed cross-complaint is related to the underlying action and that FSP did not act in bad faith. The judge also finds that Universal's claims of prejudice due to additional discovery are not substantial. The judge orders FSP to file a separate copy of the proposed cross-complaint within five days of the date of this order.
