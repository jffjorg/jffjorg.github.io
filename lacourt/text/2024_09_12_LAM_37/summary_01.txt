Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The plaintiff, Eisner, LLP, is seeking summary judgment or summary adjudication on their claims for breach of contract and common count against the defendant, Patricia Rionda Del Castro.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, but granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication as to the first cause of action for breach of contract. The judge found that the plaintiff has met its burden of showing the existence of a valid written Agreement between the parties, wherein the defendant agreed to pay the amount due in the invoices sent by the plaintiff. The judge also found that the defendant breached the Agreement by failing to pay the fees owed.

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication as to the second cause of action for common count, finding that a valid contract exists between the parties and that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the alternative cause of action.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
