Background
 
On June 26, 2023,
Eisner, LLP (“Plaintiff”), filed a Complaint against Patricia Rionda Del Castro
(“Defendant”) alleging two causes of action for breach of contract and common
counts. The Complaint asserts that Plaintiff agreed to provide attorney services
to Defendant and Defendant failed to pay the sum of $51,922.39. 
 
Default was entered
against Defendant, but the Parties stipulated to vacate the entry of Default
and for Defendant to file an answer. Plaintiff filed an answer on January 11,
2024. The Answer denies generally and specifically the allegations of the Complaint.
Despite moving to vacate the default and filing an Answer, however, Defendant
failed to respond to discovery. 
 
On April 16, 2024, the
court granted Plaintiff’s motion to deem its request for admission admitted
against Defendant. Defendant now moves for summary judgment, or summary
adjudication in the alternative. The motion is unopposed. The matter is now
before the court. 
motion for
summary judgment, or summary ADJUDICATION in the ALTERNATIVE
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”¿ (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843 (Aguilar).) “Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) Summary adjudication may be granted as to one
or more causes of action within an action, or one or more claims for damages.
(CCP, § 437c(f).)¿¿¿¿¿¿
 
A plaintiff moving for summary adjudication bears the
burden of showing there is no defense to a cause of action. (CCP, § 437c(a).)
The burden can be met if the plaintiff “has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.” (CCP,
§ 437c, (p)(1); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 853.) If
the plaintiff meets this burden, it is up to the defendant “to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (CCP., § 437c(p)(1); see also S.B.C.C., Inc. v. St.
Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 383, 388.)
 
Defeating summary judgment requires only a single disputed
material fact. (See CCP, § 437c(c) [a motion for summary judgment “shall be
granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a
matter of law”] [italics added].) Thus, any disputed material fact means the
court must deny the motion – the court has no discretion to grant summary
judgment. (Zavala v. Arce (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 915, 925, fn. 8; Saldana
v. Globe-Weis Systems Co. (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 1511-1512.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may take judicial notice
of records of any court of record of the United States. (Evid. Code, §
452(d)(2).) However, the court may only judicially notice the existence of the
record, not that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.)

Plaintiff’s request for judicial
notice is granted. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
This action arises out
of a fee dispute. On February 7, 2017, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a
written Engagement Agreement (“Agreement”) wherein Defendant agreed to pay
Plaintiff for certain legal services.[1] (Eisner Decl. ¶3, Ex. A.)
The Agreement provided that Defendant would be periodically billed for services
and payment was expected upon receipt of a statement. (Ex. A, ¶ 4.) The
Agreement further provided that Plaintiff would provide services to Defendant
at rates ranging from $410 and $795 per hour for attorneys, between $235 and
$350 per hour for paralegals, and between $50 and $100 per hour for Case
Assistants. (Id.) The Agreement also provided that if fees and costs are
not timely paid, Plaintiff may withdraw as counsel at any time. (Id.)
 
Lastly, the Agreement
contained an attorney’s fees provision: 
 
            13.       Attorney’s Fees.  In the event that a dispute arises hereunder,
the prevailing party in any litigation or arbitration shall be entitled to
payment by the non-prevailing party of all of its attorneys’ fees, arbitrator
fees, expert fees, and all costs and expenses of any sort incurred. 
 
(Ex. A, ¶ 13.) 
 
Plaintiff provided legal services and performed
all obligations under the Agreement as evidenced by Plaintiff’s invoices sent
to Defendant. (Eisner Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. F [RFA].) Commencing on or about March 7,
2017, through on or about March 25, 2020, Plaintiff periodically provided
Defendant with invoices outlining the services performed, the attorney,
paralegal, or Case Assistant performing the service, the hourly rate, the time
spent performing the task, and the amount owed. (Ex. F [RFA of Plaintiff’s
Invoices].) Defendant paid the invoices from March 7, 2017, to on or about May
31, 2022.  (Eistern Decl., ¶ 7.) As of
May 31, 2022, the total fees and costs were $299,441.31, with $247,441.31 in
fees paid by Defendant. (Id.) After crediting all payments, the amount
due and unpaid is $51,992.39, with 10% interest, as stipulated in the
Agreement. (Id.; see also Ex. A, ¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s Exhibit B is a Chart
of Fees, Costs, and Payments from March 7, 2017, to May 31, 2022, including a
tabulation of accrued interest. (Eisner Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. B.) 
 
Plaintiff asserts it was harmed when Defendant
breached the Agreement by not paying the remainder of the costs and fees owed
and Plaintiff expended considerable time and resources seeking to enforce the
Agreement. (Eistern Decl., ¶ 11.) Although the Agreement provided for
arbitration, Plaintiff served Defendant with a notice of the right to arbitrate
the fee dispute but the deadline to seek arbitration passed. (Id., ¶ 10;
Ex. A, ¶ 12.)  Plaintiff asserts that
exclusive of interest and attorney’s fees, Defendant owes the principal sum of
$51,922.39. (Ex. B, F.) 
 
            A.        First Cause of Action - Breach of Contract
 
The elements of a
claim for breach of contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach,
and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v.
Goldman (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must
demonstrate damages proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v.
American Dynasty (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.)
 
Plaintiff has met
his burden of showing the existence of a valid written Agreement between
Plaintiff and Defendant, wherein Defendant agreed to pay the amount due in the
invoices sent by Plaintiff. (Ex. A, F.) Defendant breached the Agreement when
she stopped paying the invoices on or about May 31, 2022. (Ex. B.)
Consequently, Plaintiff was damaged and is owed $51,999.39 plus interest, for
legal services rendered. (Eisner Decl., ¶¶ 7-9, Ex. B.) 
 
The burden shifts
to Defendant to show triable issues of fact exist that preclude summary
judgment. However, Defendant has failed to oppose the Motion despite being
served with notice, despite being aware of this action, and seeking to vacate
the entry of default. Therefore, summary adjudication is granted as to the
first cause of action. 
 
            B.        Second
Cause of Action - Common Count
 
Plaintiff asserts
that the second cause of action for common count is pled in the alternative to
the breach of contract claim for services rendered (quantum meruit).
(Motion, at p. 7:17-19.) “It is well-established that a plaintiff may, where he
is seeking but one recovery, plead either upon an express contract or in quantum
meruit.” (Haggerty v. Warner (1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 468, 475.)
 
“Quantum meruit
refers to the well-established principle that ‘the law implies a promise to pay
for services performed under circumstances disclosing that they were not
gratuitously rendered.’ [Citation.] To recover in quantum meruit, a party need
not prove the existence of a contract [citation], but it must show the
circumstances were such that ‘the services were rendered under some
understanding or expectation of both parties that compensation therefor was to
be made’ [citations].”  (Huskinson
& Brown v. Wolf (2004) 32 Cal.4th 453, 458.)  
 
“The requisite
elements of quantum meruit are (1) the plaintiff acted pursuant to ‘an explicit
or implicit request for the services’ by the defendant, and (2) the services
conferred a benefit on the defendant.” (Port Medical Wellness, Inc. v.
Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 153, 180.)
“[W]here services have been rendered under a contract which is unenforceable
because not in writing, an action generally will lie upon a common count for
quantum meruit.” (Iverson, Yoakum, Papiano & Hatch v. Berwald (1999)
76 Cal.App.4th 990, 996.) 
 
Summary
adjudication is denied as to the second cause of action because Plaintiff has
prevailed on the first cause of action by showing that a valid enforceable
contract exists between the Parties. “[A]s a matter of law, a quasi-contract
action for unjust enrichment does not lie where, as here, express binding
agreements exist and define the parties' rights.” (California Medical Ass'n,
Inc. v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare of California, Inc. (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
151, 172.) “However, it is well settled that there is no equitable basis for an
implied-in-law promise to pay reasonable value when the parties have an actual
agreement covering compensation.” (Hedging Concepts, Inc. v. First Alliance
Mortgage Co. (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1410, 1419.)
 
Because a valid
contract exists, Plaintiff cannot prevail on the alternative cause of action.
Thus, summary adjudication is denied. 
 
The motion for
summary judgment is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for summary judgment
is denied. The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for 
summary adjudication as to the first
cause of action for breach of contract and DENIES 
Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication
as to the second cause of action for common count. 
Plaintiff to give notice.
