And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Providence Health System-Southern California dba Providence Holy Cross Medical Center. The plaintiff, Abel Luna, has alleged that the defendant was negligent in its care of him after a car accident and that this negligence caused him to develop pressure injuries. The defendant argues that its care was adequate and that the injuries were caused by the natural course of Luna's condition.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the entire complaint, but has granted the motion for summary adjudication on the cause of action for dependent adult abuse-neglect. The judge has determined that there is a triable issue of fact regarding the care Luna received, and that the defendant's motion for summary judgment on this issue is denied.

The case is set for trial on October 14, 2024.
