Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the application to confirm the sale of the receivership property to Jessica Palasik and hold the net proceeds. The sale was conducted by the Receiver, Mark Adams and California Receivership Group, who were appointed to take possession of the property and develop an abatement plan to remedy public health and safety violations. The Receiver confirmed the sale of the property to Diabio LLC and Gustavo Cardenas in October 2021, but Diabio failed to complete the repairs as agreed upon. The Receiver retook the property and completed the repairs, and then sold the property to Jessica Palasik for $690,000. The judge finds that the Receiver has wide discretion in selling receivership property and that Diabio's opposition to the sale is based on faulty grounds. The judge grants the Receiver's application, and the moving party is required to give notice.
