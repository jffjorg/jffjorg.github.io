And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Defendant Judith Wolfe to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Elliott Wolfe. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the pleading and argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any causes of action against the Defendant. The Court finds that the complaint lacks specific facts and consists only of conclusory statements. Additionally, the Court notes that the complaint may be an extension of the family law case involving the same parties, which would be a jurisdictional defect. The Court sustains the demurrer, but gives Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to add specific facts.
