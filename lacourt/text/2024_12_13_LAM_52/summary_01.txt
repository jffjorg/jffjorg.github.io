And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion for attorney fees on appeal. The Defendant, Megna T Shirt Manufacturing Company, Inc., seeks $57,675 in attorney fees incurred on appeal. The Judge finds that the Defendant prevailed on the appeal and that the parties' lease agreement provides for attorney fees to the prevailing party.

The Judge calculates the lodestar amount by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate. The Judge finds that the hours worked by the Defendant's counsel, Ben Gharagozli and Kevin Hermansen, were generally reasonable and necessary, but notes that Hermansen billed excessive time communicating with the court reporter and staff.

The Judge awards Hermansen a rate of $200 per hour for 2.7 hours of work that could have been done by someone with less experience and skill. The Judge finds that all 49 hours billed by Gharagozli were reasonable and necessary.

The Judge awards the Defendant a total of $45,168 in attorney fees, which includes a 1.2 enhancement to the lodestar amount. The Judge finds that the contingent nature of the fee award and the counsel's work on the appeal justify the enhancement.

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion for attorney fees on appeal and orders the Plaintiff, T-A Fashion (USA), LLC, to pay the Defendant $45,168 in appellate attorney fees.
