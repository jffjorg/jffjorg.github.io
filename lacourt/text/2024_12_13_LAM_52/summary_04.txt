And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively denied the defendants' application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prohibit interference with their access to the MET-2 building. The defendants, Northland THEA LLC and others, sought the TRO to repair their building's seismic joints and address water intrusion, claiming that they will suffer irreparable harm if the work is not done immediately. However, the Judge found that the defendants failed to demonstrate sufficient grounds for a TRO granted on an ex parte basis, as they did not show that great or irreparable injury would result if the matter were not heard on notice. The Judge also noted that the defendants have an adequate remedy at law for any alleged financial loss and that a regularly scheduled motion for a preliminary injunction will provide a full and fair opportunity for the parties to present their evidence and arguments. As a result, the application for a TRO was denied.
