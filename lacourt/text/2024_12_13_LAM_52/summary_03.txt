The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of PlumbingAndFire, Inc. dba Allied Plumbing & Fire Supply versus Nehorai Construction Inc. and Ilan Kenig. The Plaintiff is seeking a default judgment against the Defendants, and has requested 18% interest on late payments. The Judge has held that the late payment provision in the contract is not subject to usury law, and has granted the Plaintiff's request for 18% interest on late payments.

However, the Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for $53,024.25 in attorney fees. The Judge has determined that the requested fees are unreasonable, and has instead awarded the Plaintiff $1,332.82 in attorney fees, which is the amount calculated according to Local Rule 3.214. The Judge has also modified the proposed judgment to reflect this award.

Overall, the Judge has granted the Plaintiff's request for default judgment in part, but has denied the request for excessive attorney fees.
