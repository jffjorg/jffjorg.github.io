And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the order sustaining the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiffs' cause of action for trespass. The plaintiffs, Sima Ashrafi and Mohammad Ali Nateghi, claimed that they had an exclusive easement over a portion of the defendant's property, but the judge found that this easement did not constitute a possessory interest in the property. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs did not have a right to exclusive possession of the property, and therefore, their cause of action for trespass was dismissed. The court's decision relied on the California Supreme Court's recent opinion in Romero v. Shih, which reversed a previous court decision and clarified the law regarding exclusive easements.
