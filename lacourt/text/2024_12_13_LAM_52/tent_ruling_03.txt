 Case Number:  23STCV19072    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment 
Plaintiff PlumbingAndFire, Inc. dba Allied Plumbing &
Fire Supply requests court judgment by default against defendants Nehorai Construction Inc.
and Ilan Kenig.  
Plaintiff
justifies seeking 18% interest on late payments.  The California Supreme Court has held that a
late payment provision in a contract to sell products on credit “is not subject
to the usury law because it does not constitute payment for the ‘loan or
forbearance of any money.’ ”  (Southwest
Concrete Products v. Gosh Construction Corp. (1990) 51 Cal.3d 701, 709.)
Plaintiff
does not, however, justify its request for $53,024.25 in attorney fees.  Attorney fees for a default
judgment are generally limited to a specified schedule based on the amount of
damages.  (Local Rules 3.207(a),
3.214(a).)  A plaintiff may recover “a fee greater than listed in the [default]
schedule because of extraordinary services.” 
(3.214(d).)  Plaintiff fails to show
extraordinary services justifying a fee greater than the schedule.  As an alternative to its lodestar, plaintiff
calculated the amount of attorneys pursuant to Local Rule 3.214 at $1,332.82.  (Oh Decl., ¶ 25.)  The court will therefore modify the proposed
judgment on Judicial Council form JUD-100 to award $1,332.82 in attorney fees.
Plaintiff’s
request for court judgment by default is granted in part.  The court will modify the proposed judgment plaintiff
submitted and enter judgment.
