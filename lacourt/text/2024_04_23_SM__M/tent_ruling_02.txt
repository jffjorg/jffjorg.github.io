Legal
Standard
 
“Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16, subdivision (c), any SLAPP defendant who brings a successful
motion to strike is entitled to mandatory attorney fees. The fee-shifting
provision was apparently intended to discourage such strategic lawsuits against
public participation by imposing the litigation costs on the party seeking to
chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and
petition for the redress of grievances. The fee-shifting provision also
encourages private representation in SLAPP cases, including situations when a
SLAPP defendant is unable to afford fees or the lack of potential monetary
damages precludes a standard contingency fee arrangement.” (Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.)
 
“It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily
“begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson
Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A] computation of time
spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a
determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v. Reg’l
Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing
factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) Such an approach anchors
the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the
attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id.
at 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining the modification of the
lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) 
 
In challenging attorney fees as excessive
because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging
party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and
citations to the evidence.¿(Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿General
arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice. (Ibid.) 
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
 
Defendants/Cross-Complainant’ objections to the
Franklin-Murdock declaration are OVERRULED. In a supplemental declaration,
counsel verifies the time entries worksheet (Ex. A) on counsel’s personal
knowledge of the work each member of DLG did for the motion and the initial
timesheets. (See Supp. Franklin-Murdock ¶¶ 3, 5.)
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant’s objections are OVERRULED.
 
On October 12, 2022, the Court cautioned Defendant Le
Lycee-Francais de Los Angeles that their papers must comply with the Rules of
Court, and that future violations would result in the Court striking the entire
filing.  That violation involved the filing
of an over-sized brief.  Here, Defendant’s
opposition exceeds ten pages and, as such, was required to include a table of
contents and authorities.  (Cal. R. Court,
rule 3.1113(f).)  Despite this violation,
the Court will consider the opposition, but once again cautions Defendant to
comply with the Rules of Court.
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Karen
Siegemund moves for a mandatory award of attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.16 in the noticed amount of $45,404.16 against Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Le Lycee Francais de Los Angeles. This follows a partially-successful
anti-SLAPP motion against the cross-complaint filed on July 21, 2023, and heard
on September 21, 2023.
 
The parties argue over Siegemund’s entitlement
to fees. Cross-Defendant is entitled to fees as the prevailing party on the
anti-SLAPP motion. The Court fully considered whether Cross-Defendant would
have been successful on the anti-SLAPP motion. If the motion was not mooted by
the dismissal of the trade libel claim, Cross-Defendants would have met their initial
burden under prong one of the anti-SLAPP analysis for that claim. Cross-Complainant,
in turn, did not present any argument or prima facie evidence as to that claim.
Furthermore, Cross-Complainant fails to present any prima facie evidence suggesting
they would have been successful on the merits. Therefore, based on the record, Cross-Defendant
would have prevailed on the anti-SLAPP motion as to the trade libel claim and
are entitled to fees. 
 
Siegemund requests $26,501.66 in
fees associated with the work related to the Special Motion to Strike;
$4,235.18 in costs thereto; $7,602.50 for the fees related to the instant
motion; $64.81 in costs thereto; and $4,932.50 fees associated with the reply
brief and hearing for the instant motion. (Franklin-Murdock Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5, Ex.
1; Supp. Franklin-Murdock Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.) Counsel states that this represents
66.66% of the fees and costs actually incurred. Siegemund explains that the reduction
reflects the mixed success of the motion.
 
Counsel presents verified time
records of counsels’ work on this action, which they contend relates to the
anti-SLAPP motion. (Ex. A.) Counsel declares each attorney, law clerk and
paralegal’s experience, training and education. (Franklin-Murdock Decl., ¶¶
7-13.) Through the verified time records, counsel claims the following rates
and hours related to the anti-SLAPP motion:
 
Harmeet Dhillon – 0.5 hour at $1300/hr.;
John-Paul S. Deol – 9 hours, plus 1
hour in reply, at $1000/hr.; 
Krista L. Baughman – 1.6 hours at $900/hr.;
Jesse Franklin-Murdock – 28.2 hours,
plus 7.7 hours in reply, at $450/hr.; and
Michael Fleming – 8.9 hours at $400/hr.
 
The Court excluded any hours not
associated with the anti-SLAPP motion. Counsel also requests fees for law
clerks and paralegals, which are not attorneys’ fees. These fees will be
discounted from the award. Using the lodestar method, the total fee request is $31,805.00
before any adjustments. The time record also shows $176.79 in costs related to
the anti-SLAPP related motions, which are for e-filing fees and Westlaw legal
research costs.
 
The Court agrees with both parties that
a percentage reduction of work performed would be appropriate to reflect the
mixed success of the motion. The Court adjusts the fees to reflect fully the
success of the motion and its degree of impact on the action as a whole, which
is less than the 66.6% proposed by Seigemund. Accordingly, the Court finds that
a reasonable fee in this instance would be $21,902.50. This amount fairly
compensates Siegemund’s counsel for their efforts in responding to the dismissed
trade libel cause of action in the cross-complaint. Therefore, the motion for fees
is GRANTED in the reduced total amount of $21,902.50. Costs are awarded in the
total amount of $176.79.  Fees are
payable within 30 days.
