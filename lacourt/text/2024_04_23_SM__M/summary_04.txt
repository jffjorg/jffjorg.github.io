And here is a summary in English:

The tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendants (Miller and National Mortgage Resources, NMR) to the complaint filed by the plaintiffs (Haim and Lucinda Revah). The ruling states that the complaint alleges that the defendants, who acted as mortgage brokers and real estate brokers for the plaintiffs, breached their fiduciary duty and engaged in fraudulent conduct. The ruling concludes that the complaint pleads facts demonstrating the existence of a fiduciary duty and that the defendants failed to disclose certain material facts to the plaintiffs. The ruling denies the demurrer and orders the defendants to file an answer within 20 days.
