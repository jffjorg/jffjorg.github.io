And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The court found that there are disputed issues of material fact regarding the status of the Certificates of Occupancy, including whether they were revoked and whether the defendants concealed and misrepresented certain facts. The court also found that the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the alleged breaches, including the invalidity of the Certificates of Occupancy and the defendants' failure to disclose the Construction Lawsuit. The court concluded that the motion was denied because the defendants did not meet their burden of showing that there were no triable issues of material fact.
