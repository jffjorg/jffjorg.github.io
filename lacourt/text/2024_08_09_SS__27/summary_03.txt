And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel compliance with a subpoena served on Penate Customer Service, the alleged employer of the plaintiff, Blanca Penate. The subpoena requested employment records of the plaintiff, including earnings, profits, and health records. The nonparty did not file an objection or response to the subpoena, and the defendant moves to compel compliance. The court denied the motion due to procedural defects, including the absence of a meet and confer declaration and issues relating to service. The court also declines to issue sanctions against the defendant as the motion is timely, but will not issue sanctions against the plaintiff as the court did not grant the present motion. The parties are advised to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
