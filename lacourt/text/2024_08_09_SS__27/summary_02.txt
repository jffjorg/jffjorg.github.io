And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and denied the request for evidentiary sanctions. The plaintiff initially failed to appear at his deposition due to claimed health issues, but the defendant waited several months before re-noticing the deposition. The plaintiff did not respond to the amended deposition notice and did not appear at the second noticed deposition. The Judge finds that the defendant has met its obligation to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel and that the plaintiff failed to provide a timely, formal, and written objection to the notice of deposition. The Judge orders the plaintiff to appear for his deposition within 30 days from today.
