And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the motion to vacate the order of dismissal filed by Plaintiff Alejandro Castro in his case against Defendant Jose Morales. The Plaintiff had failed to comply with court orders and failed to file necessary documents, including a request for default and a declaration showing why the case should not be dismissed. The court granted continuances to file the default/default judgment, but the Plaintiff did not attend the hearing on April 18, 2024, and the case was dismissed. The Plaintiff is now seeking to vacate the order of dismissal, but the court finds that it was not the Plaintiff's mistake, inadvertence, or excuse that led to the dismissal. The court concludes that the Plaintiff's motion is denied, and the case will proceed as dismissed with prejudice.
