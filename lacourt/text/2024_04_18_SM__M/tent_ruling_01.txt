MOTION:                  Motion
for Summary Judgment/Adjudication
HEARING DATE:   4/18/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
            A party may move for summary
judgment in any action or proceeding if it is contended the action has no merit
or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding. (CCP, § 437c(a).) “The
purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to
cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
 
“A party may move for summary adjudication as
to one or more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative
defenses, one or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty, if the
party contends that the cause of action has no merit, that there is no
affirmative defense to the cause of action, that there is no merit to an
affirmative defense as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to a
claim for damages, as specified in Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that
one or more defendants either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or
plaintiffs.” (CCP, § 437c(f)(1).) If a party seeks summary
adjudication as an alternative to a request for summary judgment, the request
must be clearly made in the notice of the motion. (Gonzales v. Superior
Court (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1542, 1544.)  “[A] party may move for
summary adjudication of a legal issue or a claim for damages other than
punitive damages that does not completely dispose of a cause of action,
affirmative defense, or issue of duty pursuant to” subdivision (t).
(CCP, § 437c(t).) 
 
            To
prevail, the evidence submitted must show there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law. (CCP, § 437c(c).) The motion cannot succeed unless the
evidence leaves no room for conflicting inferences as to material facts; the
court has no power to weigh one inference against another or against other
evidence. (Murillo v. Rite Stuff Food Inc. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th
833, 841.) In determining whether the facts give rise to a triable issue of
material fact, “[a]ll doubts as to whether any material, triable, issues of
fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment…”
(Gold v. Weissman (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1195, 1198-99.) “In other
words, the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment
and the reasonable inferences there from must be accepted as true.” (Jackson
v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 179.) However, if
adjudication is otherwise proper the motion “may not be denied on grounds of
credibility,” except when a material fact is the witness’s state of
mind and “that fact is sought to be established solely by the [witness’s]
affirmation thereof.” (CCP, § 437c(e).) 
 
            Once
the moving party has met their burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party
“to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that
cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(1).) “[T]here is no obligation on the opposing party... to establish
anything by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated
facts establishing every element... necessary to sustain a judgment in his
favor.” (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 454, 468.) 
 
“The pleadings play a key role in a summary
judgment motion. The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment
is to delimit the scope of the issues and to frame the outer measure
of materiality in a summary judgment proceeding.” (Hutton v. Fidelity
National Title Co. (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493, quotations
and citations omitted.) “Accordingly, the burden of a defendant moving for
summary judgment only requires that he or she negate plaintiff's theories of
liability as alleged in the complaint; that is, a moving party need
not refute liability on some theoretical possibility not included in the
pleadings.” (Ibid.) 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff SM 10000 Property LLC
moves for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim against Defendant
Seyed Farid Hajmirsadeghi.
 
To establish a cause of action for
breach of contract, a plaintiff must show: 1) the existence of a valid and
binding contract between the parties; 2) the plaintiff’s performance of the
contract or excuse for non- performance; 3) the defendant’s failure to perform
under the contract; and 4) damages resulting from the breach. (Hamilton v.
Greenwich Inv’rs XXVI, LLC, (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1602, 1614.)
 
Plaintiff presents the following
evidence in support of his motion. On April 28, 2022, Defendant entered into a residential
lease agreement (“Lease”) with Plaintiff for Unit #3502 (the “Unit”) at 10000
Santa Monica Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90067. (UMF 2.) The Lease period began
on May 4, 2022, and would have ended May 3, 2023. (UMF 3.) The rent was $14,500
per month to be paid on the first of every month via check, online payment
portal or money order. (UMF 4.) Defendant also agreed to pay a $29,000 security
deposit, a $2,000 club amenity deposit, and $300 annual club amenity dues. (UMF
5.) The Lease provides that each of the terms and conditions of the Lease
constitutes an independent condition of Defendant’s right to possession of the
Premises. (UMF 10.)
 
Defendant also entered into certain
addendums, including the “Utility Lease Addendum” wherein he agreed to pay a
flat fee of $150 per month for cable and/or Internet, and related technology.
(UMF 6, 7.)  Also, he agreed to the “Private
Club Lease Addendum” agreeing to be bound by the terms therein, the terms,
covenants, and conditions of the Club Charter, and the rules and regulations of
the club. (UMF 11, 12.)
 
Defendant made his last regular
monthly rent payment on July 4, 2022. (UMF 13.) Defendant provided Plaintiff with
a check for $15,003.91 on August 2, 2022, however that check was returned by
its bank on August 8, 2022, due to insufficient funds. (Id.) Defendant has
made no further payments. (Id.) After July 4, 2022, Defendant continued living
in Unit 3502 at Ten Thousand without making any payments until he vacated the
Unit on January 5, 2023. (UMF 3, 14.) 
 
Through this evidence, Plaintiff demonstrates
that Defendant entered into the Lease and breached the terms of the Lease by
failing to pay rent from August 2022 onwards. The record also shows that
Plaintiff fully performed its obligations under the Lease by granting
possession of the Unit to Defendant during the lease term until Defendant’s
breach. Plaintiff establishes that Defendant failed to pay the rental rate of
$14,500 per month, other monthly charges per the Lease and addendums, and
repair damages through the “Resident Ledger” for Defendant. (UMF 4; see Brown
Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. 2.) Based on this verified ledger, Defendant’s outstanding
balance is $55,625.15.
 
Plaintiff also seeks prejudgment
interest, as all the damages were certain or capable of being made certain by
calculation. (Civ. Code § 3289(b).) Plaintiff provides the “Resident Ledger”
regarding Defendant, which shows fixed sums certain. (Brown Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. 2.)
Further, Plaintiff shows calculations of interest on these sums. (Id., Ex. 4.)
Based on these calculations, Defendant incurred $9,187.49 of interest. 
 
Plaintiff also seeks attorneys’
fees as an item of damages for breach of contract. An award of attorney fees may be made as
part of the summary judgment in any case where such fees are recoverable by
law. (Hoover Comm. Hotel Corp. v. Thomson (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1130,
1143.) With respect to attorney fees and costs, unless they are specifically
provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the
parties.¿(CCP § 1021.) The prevailing party on a contract, which specifically
provides for attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is
entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.¿(Civ. Code §
1717(a); CCP §§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) “It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily
“begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson
Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) 
 
Plaintiff demonstrates that the
Lease had an attorneys’ fees provision, which provides “In the event of any
litigation to enforce this Lease, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its reasonable attorney’s fees, not to exceed a total of fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000), and its costs of litigation.” (UMF 18; Lease ¶ 34.)
Plaintiff claims at least $30,606.50 in reasonable attorney’s fees through the
litigation of this case, costs of $5,457.93, plus an anticipated $5,500.00 in
fees for reply and attending the hearing on this motion. (UMF 22.) Plaintiff
provides verified invoices reflecting the tasks performed from August 2022
through July 31, 2023. (Olsen Decl., Ex. 3.) Plaintiff also shows counsels’
work from August 2023 and September 2023, through the filing of this motion. (Id.,
¶ 3.) Counsel provides reasonable rates of $275 per hour for partners, $250 per
hour for associates, and $135 an hour for paralegals. (Id., ¶ 2.)
 
Plaintiff only provides speculation
that counsel will expend additional time on this motion. Notably, there was no
opposition, and therefore no reply. Therefore, the Court is not inclined to
grant the full amount of fees requested, as such fees were not necessarily
incurred. The Court will grant 1 hour of reasonable attorneys’ fees for the
instant hearing at $275/hr., but not anticipated fees for replying to an opposition
brief. Otherwise, the attorneys’ fees are fully recoverable per the Lease.
 
Plaintiff has established all
elements of breach of contract. Defendant therefore has the burden to show a
dispute of material fact as to any element or defense. Defendant has not
opposed the motion, and therefore fails to meet this burden. The undisputed
evidence therefore shows Plaintiff’s entitlement to a judgment as follows: 1) $55,625.15
of unpaid rent; 2) $9,187.49 of interest at the legal rate; 3) $30,881.50 of reasonable
attorney’s fees; and 4) costs of $5,457.93.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for
summary judgment is GRANTED.
