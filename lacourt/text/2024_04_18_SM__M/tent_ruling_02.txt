Analysis
 
            Plaintiff
Michael Sanchez moves this Court for an order granting limited direct contact with
Defendant Lauren Sanchez.      Plaintiff cites no legal standard or
authority for the court to make such an order. Plaintiff also provides no
authority for the theory that that such an order would be necessary or proper. The
Court also notes that this motion is essentially an improper request for
reconsideration of prior motions. Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
