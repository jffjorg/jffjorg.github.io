CASE
HISTORY:
·

·        
08/15/23: Cross-Complaint filed. 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and conversion.
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants misappropriated funds intended for the
purchase of a 2008 Sea Ray 44 Sundancer boat. 
 
Defendants and Cross-Complainants
move to quash a third-party subpoena for records propounded to the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants and Cross-Complainants
move to quash a third-party subpoena for records propounded by
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants to the California Department of Tax and Fee
Administration. Code of Civil Procedure § 1985.3, under which this motion is
brought, expressly requires that the witness from whom the records are sought
be served with notice of the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1985.3(g).) Defendants’
original proof of service states only that notice of this motion was given to
Plaintiffs through their counsel of record. The Court therefore ordered
Defendants to give notice to all interested parties, including the entity in
possession of the records sought, and to file proof of service with the Court
showing that service was made on those entities. (December 3, 2024 Minute
Order.) Although Defendants filed a “Proof of Service by Mail” on December 16,
2024, that Proof of Service does not identify the party on whom the materials
were served. The purpose of the Court’s December 3, 2024 order was to require
Defendants to give notice to the entity in control of the records of the
pending motion to quash, and to present proof to the Court that the controlling
party had such notice. A “proof of service” which does not state the party on
whom service was purportedly made does not satisfy that purpose. The Court
cannot issue an order regarding the production of subpoenaed records without the
entity in control of those records having notice that the issue is before the
Court. 
 
            In light of
the joint stipulation filed by the parties on December 27, 2024 to continue the
trial and all related dates, including discovery cutoffs, the Court will
continue this matter to permit Defendants one final opportunity to demonstrate
that proper notice of this motion was given to all interested parties. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to
Quash Subpoena is CONTINUED to Wednesday, January 29, 2025, at 9:00 AM. Defendants
are ordered to give notice to all interested parties, including the entity in
possession of the records sought, and to file proof of service with the Court
showing that service was made on those entities in compliance with Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005(b). 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
