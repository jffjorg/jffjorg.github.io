And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, is issuing a tentative ruling in the case of Scott Norlund, et al. v. Ken Sampson, et al. (Case Number: 22STCV06066). The case involves a motion to quash a third-party subpoena for records propounded to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration by the Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants. The Defendants/Cross-Complainants, Ken Sampson, Dey Sampson, and The Boardroom MDR, LLC, had moved to quash the subpoena, citing that the notice of the motion was not properly served on the entity in control of the records sought.

The Judge finds that the Defendants' proof of service does not satisfy the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 1985.3(g), which requires that the witness from whom the records are sought be served with notice of the motion. The Judge orders the Defendants to give notice to all interested parties, including the entity in possession of the records sought, and to file proof of service with the Court showing that service was made on those entities in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b).

The Judge continues the motion to quash to January 29, 2025, at 9:00 AM, to permit the Defendants one final opportunity to demonstrate that proper notice was given to all interested parties.
