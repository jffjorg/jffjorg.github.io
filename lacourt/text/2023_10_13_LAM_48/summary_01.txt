And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting in part a motion to strike the Substitution of Attorney filed by Paradigm Industries. The Substitution of Attorney was not filed in conformity with the law because William Jun, who is not listed in the State Bar of California's Attorney Search, attempted to represent Paradigm Industries. The Court cannot force Paradigm Industries to be represented by counsel that it no longer wants. Therefore, Reshma Kamath is relieved as counsel for Paradigm Industries. The Court has also advanced the Final Status Conference and Jury Trial dates and scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for Paradigm Industries. If Paradigm Industries does not retain new counsel by the scheduled date, the Court will dismiss its fourth amended complaint and place it in default.
