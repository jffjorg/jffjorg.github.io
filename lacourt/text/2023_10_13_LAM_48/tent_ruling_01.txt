  CASE NO.: 20STCV10368
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION
  TO STRIKE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 13, 2023



 
On
May 10, 2021, Paradigm Industries filed a fourth amended complaint against A’s Match
Dyeing Co. Inc. and Strada Developments L.P.
On
October 13, 2021, A’s Match and Young Chul Kim filed a cross-complaint against Paradigm
Industries and Willian Jun.  They filed an
answer on November 12, 2021.
On
June 27, 2022, Strada Developments filed a first amended cross-complaint against
Young Chul Kim, Paradigm Industries, and A’s Match.  Paradigm Industries filed an answer on July 28,
2022.
On
August 14, 2023, Paradigm Industries filed a Substitution of Attorney, indicating
that Reshma Kamath was withdrawing.  The form
indicates that “Party is representing self,” with William Jun’s name listed without
a State Bar Number.  The same day, Strada
Developments filed an objection to the Substitution of Attorney.
On
August 29, 2023, Strada Developments filed a motion to strike.  Strada Developments asks the Court to strike Paradigm
Industries’ answer to Strada’s first amended cross-complaint and dismiss Paradigm’s
fourth amended complaint as to Strada.  In
the alternative, Strada asks the Court to strike the Substitution of Attorney.
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California,
a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)
“[A]
corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  William Jun is not listed in the State Bar of
California’s Attorney Search.  Accordingly,
William Jun cannot represent Paradigm Industries, and the Substitution of Attorney
was not filed in conformity with the law.
The
motion to strike is GRANTED IN PART.  The
Substitution of Attorney, filed on August 14, 2023, is ordered stricken.  The Court cannot force Paradigm Industries to
be represented by counsel that it no longer wants.  Therefore, on the Court’s own motion, Reshma Kamath
is relieved as counsel for Paradigm Industries.
The
Final Status Conference is currently scheduled for October 30, 2023.  However, the Court will be dark on that date.
The
Final Status Conference scheduled for October 30, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. is advanced
to this date and continued to November 13, 2023 at 9:00 a.m.  The Jury Trial (7-day estimate) scheduled for
November 13, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. is advanced to this date and continued to November
27, 2023 at 9:00 a.m.
An
Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for Paradigm Industries is
also scheduled for November 13, 2023 at 9:00 a.m.  If Paradigm Industries does not retain new counsel
by that date, the Court will dismiss its fourth amended complaint, strike its answer
to the cross-complaint of A’s Match and Young Chul Kim and place it in default,
and strike its answer to the first amended cross-complaint of Strada Developments
and place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 13th day of October 2023
