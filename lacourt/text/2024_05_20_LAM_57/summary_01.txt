And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant, Pacific Shore Property Management (PSPM), to provide further responses to Form Interrogatory (FROG) No. 15.1. The FROG asks PSPM to identify each denial of a material allegation and each special or affirmative defense in their pleadings. PSPM's initial responses and further responses did not adequately answer the questions, and the judge orders PSPM to provide further responses that clarify the persons who have knowledge of facts and/or documents relevant to each separate and distinct affirmative defense. The responses are due by June 10, 2024. Additionally, the judge imposes monetary sanctions on PSPM and its counsel, Rey Yang and Stephanie Guerra, in the form of reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the plaintiff. The amount of attorney's fees, $1,245, is reasonable, and PSPM and/or its counsel must pay this amount to the plaintiff by June 10, 2024.
