 Hearing Date:  December 13, 2023




QUANTGENE, INC., et al.
 
            vs.
 
SEBASTIAN DONOVAN, et al.










 
 

Plaintiffs’
motions to compel further responses are GRANTED. Defendants are each
sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,050.00 per motion. 
 
On 1/31/2023,
Plaintiffs Sebastian Donovan and Arconex (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed suit
against Quantgene, Inc. and Johannes Bhakdi (collectively, Defendants),
alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) intentional misrepresentation; (5)
negligent misrepresentation; and (6) violation of Business and Professions Code
section 17200.
 
            On
3/3/2022, Cross-Complainants Quantgene, Inc. and Johannes Bhakdi filed a
cross-complaint (XC) against Cross-Defendants Sebastian Donovan and Arconex,
alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing; (3) false promise; (4) intentional misrepresentation; (5)
concealment; (6) negligent misrepresentation; (7) conversion; (8) unjust
enrichment; (9) intentional interference with contractual relations; and (10)
unfair business practices. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiffs move to compel Mr. Bhakdi and Quantgene (collectively, Defendants)
to provide further responses to Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos.
2.2, 2.5, 15.1, and 50.1, and Nos. 9.2, 12.1, 15.1, 17.1, and 50.1. 
 
            Plaintiffs
also move to compel Defendants to provide further responses to Plaintiffs’
Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 3, 7, and 10-13, and Nos. 9-12.
 
            For
ease, the Court has consolidated its analysis into a single ruling. 
 
            The
motions are unopposed. 
 
Discussion   
            Plaintiffs
argue that Defendants’ responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 2.2,
2.5, 15.1, and 50.1, and Nos. 9.2, 12.1, 15.1, 17.1, and 50.1, and Special Interrogatories,
Set One, Nos. 3, 7, and 10-13, and Nos. 9-12 are evasive, incomplete, and
contain objections that are without merit or too general. (CCP §
2030.300(a)(1),(3).)
 
            Defendants
did not oppose these motions and thus are considered to have conceded to the
merits of the motions. 
 
            Moreover,
given their lack of opposition, they have not offered any substantial
justification for their failure to adequately respond to discovery.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motions to compel further responses are granted.
Defendants are each sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,050.00
per motion. ($350/hr x 3 hr.) 
 
 
It is so ordered.
