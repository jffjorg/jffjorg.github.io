The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motions to compel further responses from the defendants. The defendants are each sanctioned $1,050.00 per motion, jointly and severally with counsel, for their failure to adequately respond to discovery. The motion is unopposed, and the defendants did not provide any substantial justification for their failure to respond. The judge has consolidated its analysis into a single ruling, finding that the defendants' responses were evasive, incomplete, and contained objections without merit or too general. The judge has ordered the defendants to provide further responses to the plaintiffs' form interrogatories and special interrogatories.
