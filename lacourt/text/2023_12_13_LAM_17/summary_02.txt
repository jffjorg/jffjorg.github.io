- "A plaintiff must plead the following in his or her toxic tort complaint: 1) That he or she was exposed to each of the toxic materials claimed to have caused a specific illness; 2) Each product that allegedly caused the injury; 3) That as a result of the exposure, the toxins entered his body; 4) That he suffers from a specific illness, and that each toxin that entered his body was a substantial factor in bringing about, prolonging, or aggravating that illness; and 5) That each toxin he absorbed was manufactured or supplied by a named defendant." (Bockrath, p. 80)
- "The law cannot tolerate lawsuits by prospecting plaintiffs who sue multiple defendants on speculation that their products may have caused harm over time through exposure to toxins in them, and who thereafter try to learn through discovery whether their speculation was well-founded." (Bockrath, p. 81)
