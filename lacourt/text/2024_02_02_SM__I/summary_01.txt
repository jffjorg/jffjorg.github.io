Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to compel arbitration is continued to allow further briefing on whether the plaintiff actually entered into the agreement with the arbitration provision. The judge concludes that the defendant has not shown that the plaintiff agreed to the contract with the arbitration agreement in it, and therefore has not established the agreement to arbitrate. The judge notes that the defendant's evidence is limited to a declaration by Xie, which relies on a screenshot of what appears to be the plaintiff's account, but lacks any identifying information linking it to the plaintiff. The judge also expresses concerns about the contract's unconscionability, particularly the venue clause, but concludes that this is a matter for the arbitrator to decide. Finally, the judge finds that there is no waiver of the arbitration provision and that the case should be continued to allow the defendant to prove, if it can, that the plaintiff entered into the specific contract at issue.
