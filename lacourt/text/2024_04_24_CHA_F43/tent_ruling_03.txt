Shaun Joseph
Bauman of Bauman Law APLC, counsel of record for Plaintiff Christina Ward, seeks
to be relieved as counsel for that party.¿Counsel filed a motion with the
required Forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. Counsel’s declaration states that due
to irreconcilable differences between Plaintiff and counsel, it is impossible
for counsel to continue representing Plaintiff.
 
Absent a
showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.¿(People v. Prince¿(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)¿There is no
showing of prejudice, and counsel’s motion complies with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362 and meets its requirements.
 
Motion to be
relieved as counsel is granted.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
