English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer (objection to the lawsuit) for Plaintiff's First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth Causes of Action, which means the lawsuit will likely be dismissed. The reasons for this dismissal are that the statute of limitations has expired for these causes of action. However, the judge overrules the demurrer for Plaintiff's Third Cause of Action for Fraud, which means the lawsuit will proceed for this cause of action.
