And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment granted in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant argued that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the lawsuit, that the plaintiff's counsel engaged in misconduct, and that the foreclosure sale was void. The judge found that these arguments were not new and were already presented at the hearing on the summary judgment motion. The judge also found that the defendant failed to provide any evidence or proper legal analysis to support her claims.

The judge ruled that the defendant's motion was procedurally and substantively flawed and therefore denied the motion. The judge also ordered the defendant and her counsel to pay the plaintiff's counsel $3,045 in sanctions for bringing a frivolous motion.
