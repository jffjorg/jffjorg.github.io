And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling to dismiss the underlying complaint filed by Plaintiff Francisco Gomez-Burgos against Defendants Aaron Long, LA Hybrid Shop, and others. The complaint was filed on December 14, 2021, and alleges causes of action for negligence, negligent hiring/retention, and negligent entrustment. The judge notes that default was entered as to Defendant Aaron Long on November 7, 2023, and as to Defendant LA Hybrid Shop on March 19, 2024. Despite this, the plaintiff has failed to file a default judgment package and has repeatedly failed to dismiss Doe defendants or file a statement of damages with the court. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to timely prosecute the action and has failed to comply with court orders. Therefore, the judge intends to dismiss the action without prejudice. The ruling is subject to modification or reversal after oral argument.
