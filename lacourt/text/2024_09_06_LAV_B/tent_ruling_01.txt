[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO TAX COSTS 
 
Dept. B
8:30 a.m. 
September 6, 2024



 
 
1. Background
            On
November 24, 2021, Plaintiff ARTHUR BAKRJYAN (“Plaintiff”), a minor, by and
through his Guardian Ad Litem Hovanes Bakrjyan, filed a Complaint against
Defendants COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES (“County”); CITY OF LOS ANGELES (“City”);
RICHARD HO (“Ho”); and DOES 1 to 50 (collectively, “Defendants”), inclusive
for: (1) Negligence; (2) Governmental Tort Liability – Gov Code. § 835; (3)
Vicarious Governmental Liability – Contractor – Gov. Code § 815.4; and (4)
Premises Liability. 
Plaintiff, at this
time, moves for an order striking and/or taxing the entire Memorandum of Costs
filed by Defendant Ho on June 26, 2024. Defendant Ho opposes the instant motion,
and Plaintiff filed a reply. 
 
2. Motion to Tax Costs
a. Legal
Standard
“A prevailing
party is entitled ‘as a matter of right’ to recover costs in any action or
proceeding unless a statute expressly provides otherwise.”¿(Segal v. ASICS
America Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 658.)¿ “Section 1033.5 sets forth the
types of expenses that are and are not allowable as costs under section 1032.
Specifically, subdivision (a) of section 1033.5 describes items that are
‘allowable as costs,’ subdivision (b) describes items ‘not allowable as costs,
except when expressly authorized by law,’ and section 1033.5(c)(4) provides
that ‘[i]tems not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon application
may be allowed or denied in the court's discretion.’”¿(Ibid.)¿¿ 
            To recover a cost, it must be reasonably necessary to the
litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) If the items appearing in a
cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to
tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)¿ On
the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.)¿¿ 
b. Discussion
            Pursuant
to the Memorandum of Costs (“MOC”), Defendant Ho seeks a total of $7,628.00
consisting of $1,055.00 in filing and motion fees; $2,073.60 in deposition
costs; and $4,500.00 in witness fees. 
Plaintiff argues
the MOC submitted by Defendant Ho must be stricken or taxed on grounds that (1)
Defendant Ho’s Code of Civil Procedure Section 998 Offer was statutorily
defective as drafted whereby it failed to have a mandatory provision that
allows the accepting party to indicate acceptance of the offer by signing a
statement that the offer is accepted under Section 998, subdivision (b); (2)
the Section 998 Offer was not reasonable or in good faith; (3) the amount
requested is unsupported and unreasonable; and (4) most of the costs are not
recoverable under Section 1033.5.
“Not less than 10
days prior to commencement of trial or arbitration (as provided in Section 1281
or 1295) of a dispute to be resolved by arbitration, any party may serve an
offer in writing upon any other party to the action to allow judgment to be
taken or an award to be entered in accordance with the terms and conditions
stated at that time. The written offer shall include a statement of the offer,
containing the terms and conditions of the judgment or award, and a provision
that allows the accepting party to indicate acceptance of the offer by signing
a statement that the offer is accepted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 998(b).) 
First, the Section
998 Offer made by Defendant Ho on August 1, 2023, was not statutorily
defective. In fact, the Section 998 Offer states that in exchange for a
dismissal with prejudice of the Complaint against Defendant Ho, costs Defendant
Ho would be presently and at the conclusion of trial entitled to would be
waived. (Hsu Decl., ¶3, Ex. B.) Under California law, “[a]lthough section 998
refers to entry of a judgment or award, an offer that provides for the
plaintiff's dismissal of the action with prejudice is a valid form of offer
within section 998.” (Hartline v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 458, 470.) Furthermore, the Section 998 Offer included “This Offer
to Compromise is accepted” line with placement for Plaintiffs’ counsel to sign.
(Hsu Decl., ¶3, Ex. B.) As such, the issue is whether the Section 998 Offer was
reasonable and made in good faith. 
A pretrial
settlement offer under Section 998 must be valid, reasonable, and made in good
faith. When a Section 998 offer is found to be valid, the burden shifts to the
offeree to demonstrate the offer was unreasonable or was not made in good
faith. (Smalley v. Subaru of America, Inc. (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 450,
458 (Smalley).) “If the actual judgment is more favorable to the offeror
than was the offer, it is prima facie evidence of the offer's reasonableness.”
(Id.) “Whether an offer is made in good faith is based on whether, at
the time it was made, it carried a reasonable prospect of acceptance by the
offeree.” (Id. at 459.) 
In determining
whether a Section 998 offer had a reasonable prospect of acceptance, the Court
must consider: (1) if the Section 998 offer was within the “range of possible
results” at trial, considering all of the information the offeror knew or
reasonably should have known and (2) if the offeror knew that the offeree had
sufficient information, based on what the offeree knew or reasonably should
have known, to assess whether the offer was reasonable such that the offeree
had a fair opportunity to intelligently evaluate the Section 998 offer. (See Licudine
v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 918, 924–925 (Licudine).) “A
plaintiff who does not accept a valid pretrial offer to compromise and who
fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award may be required to pay
defendant's expert witness costs, so long as the section 998 offer was
reasonable and made in good faith.” (Hartline, supra, 132 Cal.App.4th
470–471.)
 Like in Smalley,
the actual judgment in this case was more favorable to Defendant Ho because he
was ultimately granting summary judgment without having to waive his
entitlement to costs. This constitutes prima facie evidence that
Defendant Ho’s Section 998 Offer was reasonable. Thus, the burden shifts to
Plaintiff to show that the Section 998 Offer was unreasonable. To meet this
burden,, Plaintiff must establish that he did not have sufficient information
and time to evaluate the Section 998 Offer when it was made. In Licudine,
the court held that “In assessing whether the 998 offeror knew that the offeree
had sufficient information to evaluate the offer (the second consideration),
the offeree needs information bearing on the issue of liability as well as on
the amount of damages because these are the issues upon which a verdict would
rest and because the 998 offer, if accepted, would be in lieu of that verdict.”
(Licudine, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at 925.) 
In this instance,
Plaintiff merely contends that Defendant hid evidence to support its stance on
liability, hired experts in October 2022, and did not provide evidence until
December 2023. However, Plaintiff does not indicate he served discovery
requests on Defendant Ho to obtain the information regarding liability prior to
the Section 998 Offer and/or deposition of Defendant Ho. Likewise, there is no
evidence presented by Plaintiff that from the commencement of the suit to the
time the Section 998 Offer was served that Defendant Ho failed to comply with
discovery requests or court orders pertaining to discovery requests to
substantiate the contention that evidence was intentionally withheld.
Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to show that the Section 998 Offer was
unreasonable and not in good faith. 
On the other hand,
“courts have interpreted the discretionary authority in section 998 to allow
the consideration of a party's ability to pay when determining the appropriate
recovery under that statute.” (LAOSD Asbestos Cases (2018) 25
Cal.App.5th 1116, 1127.) Plaintiff asserts that he is unable to pay the claimed
costs because of his age. However, Defendant Ho argues that Plaintiff fails to
present any evidence of his financial resources and fails to cite any legal
authority supporting that  a party’s age
alone means they cannot pay costs. Indeed, Plaintiff does not submit any
evidence supporting his claim of indigency apart from his age for the Court to
assess his ability or inability to pay the claimed expert witness fees under
Section 998. 
As such, the
$4,500.00 in expert witness fees requested by Defendant Ho will not be taxed or
stricken. 
Next, both filing
and motion fees, and deposition costs are allowable costs under Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(1) and (a)(3)(A), respectively.
Moreover, Defendant Ho’s verified MOC is sufficient to support a finding that
these claimed costs were reasonably incurred. (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule
3.1700(a)(1).) Additionally, Plaintiff does not provide any argument
specifically challenging the reasonableness of these claimed costs. 
Therefore,
Plaintiff Arthur Bakrjyan’s Motion to Tax Costs is DENIED. 
 
Moving Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice.
