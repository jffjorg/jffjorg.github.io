21STCV45524 FRANCISCO GOMEZ-BURGOS v AARON LONG, et al.




 


 




 


 



 
TENTATIVE
 
On
December 14, 2021, Plaintiff Francisco Gomez-Burgos filed the underlying action
against Defendants Aaron Long, Defendant LA Hybrid Shop, and Does 1 through 25
concerning personal injuries sustained due to an automobile collision which
occurred on December 15, 2019. Plaintiff alleges causes of action for (1)
negligence; (2) negligent hiring/retention; and (3) negligent entrustment. 
 
On
November 7, 2023, the Court entered default but only as to Defendant Aaron
Long. 
 
On
February 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Amendment to the Complaint as to a
fictious name and amended Doe 1 to a Defendant Leo Marin. Plaintiff served both
Defendant Long and Defendant LA Hybrid as to give notice of the filing.
 
On
March 19, 2024, the Court entered default as to Defendant LA Hybrid Shop. 
 
On
March 21, 2024, the Honorable Michelle Kim issued a minute order (3.21.24 Min.
Order) discharging the OSC Re: Failure to File Entry of Default as to LA Hybrid
due to finding default had been entered as to both Defendants. Judge Kim
provided that the OSC Re: Default Judgment was scheduled for July 5, 2024. 
 
On
June 6, 2024, the parties were notified that the case had been reassigned to
the Honorable Karen Moskowtiz in Department B, Van Nuys.
 
On
July 5, 2024, the Court called the matter for OSC Re: Dismissal for Failure to
File Default Judgment for hearing. The Court then continued the Hearing to
September 6, 2024.
 
To
date, Plaintiff has failed to file any default judgment package. 
   
Legal
Standard:
 
In
addition to the specific statutory grounds that authorize dismissal, a judge
has inherent authority to dismiss an action for failure to timely bring the
action to judgment and for delays in prosecution. Code of Civil Procedure §
581(m) states that the statutory grounds for dismissal specified in CCP § 581
are not an exclusive enumeration of a judge's power to dismiss an action or to
dismiss a complaint as to a particular defendant. Code of Civil Procedure §
583.150 states that the statutes providing for dismissal for delay in
prosecution (CCP §§ 583.110–583.430) do not limit or affect a judge's “inherent
authority” to dismiss an action or to impose other sanctions under local court
rules. (V.
[§ 15.88] Judge's Inherent Authority to Dismiss:, Cal. Judges Benchbook Civ.
Proc. Before Trial § 15.88.)
 
In Lyons
v Wickhorst (1986) 42 C3d 911, 915, 231 CR 738, the California Supreme
Court declared that a judge has the limited, inherent discretionary power to
dismiss an action with prejudice when the plaintiff has failed to prosecute it
diligently (V.
[§ 15.88] Judge's Inherent Authority to Dismiss:, Cal. Judges Benchbook Civ.
Proc. Before Trial § 15.88.)
 
In Del
Junco v Hufnagel (2007) 150 CA4th 789, 799–800, 60 CR3d 22, the appellate
court upheld the imposition of a terminating sanction against the defendant,
striking the defendant's answer and entering the defendant's default after it
became obvious that the defendant had no intention of answering discovery,
filing proper and timely papers, or complying with the judge's orders.


Rule 3.110: Time for
service of complaint, cross-complaint, and response
 
California Rules of Court
provides in Rule 3.110 (h) the following with respect to Default Judgments: “When
a default is entered, the party who requested the entry of default must obtain
a default judgment against the defaulting party within 45 days after the
default was entered, unless the court has granted an extension of time. The
court may issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if
that party fails to obtain entry of judgment against a defaulting party or to
request an extension of time to apply for a default judgment within that time.”
(CRC 3.110(h).)
 
Discussion:
 
In this case, the Court notes
that Plaintiff’s Default as to Defendant Long was entered on November 17, 2023,
and the Default as to Defendant LA Hybrid Shop was entered on March 19, 2024. Well
over forty-five (45) days have passed since default has been entered as to both
Defendants. Yet, Plaintiff has failed to file any papers since the previously
granted extension as required in for entry of default judgments. Thus, the
Court may now impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 3.1110(h), including terminating
sanctions. The Court employs its inherent authority and discretion in this case
to dismiss Plaintiff’s action for a failure to timely prosecute. Additionally,
the Court notes Plaintiff has failed to enter default as to Defendant Leo Marin,
served 6/6/24, and has repeatedly failed to dismiss Doe defendants or file a
Statement of Damages with the Court, among other deficiencies.
 
Accordingly,
the Court orders the underlying Complaint filed by Plaintiff Francisco-Gomez
Burgos dismissed without prejudice.
