Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to tax costs filed by Plaintiff Arthur Bakrjyan against Defendant Richard Ho and others. The case involves a minor, Arthur Bakrjyan, who was injured and filed a complaint against the County of Los Angeles, City of Los Angeles, Richard Ho, and others for negligence, governmental tort liability, vicarious governmental liability, and premises liability.

The defendant, Richard Ho, made a Section 998 Offer to compromise the action, which was not accepted by the plaintiff. Ho then claimed costs of $7,628.00, including expert witness fees of $4,500.00. The plaintiff contends that the Section 998 Offer was statutorily defective, unreasonable, and not made in good faith, and that Ho's financial resources were not considered in determining the recoverability of costs.

The judge concluded that the Section 998 Offer was reasonable and made in good faith, and that the expert witness fees were reasonably incurred and recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1033.5. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to show that the Section 998 Offer was unreasonable or that Ho's financial resources were not considered in determining the recoverability of costs.

Therefore, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion to tax costs, and ordered the plaintiff to give notice.
