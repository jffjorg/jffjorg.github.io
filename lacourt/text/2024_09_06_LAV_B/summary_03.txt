And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to discovery requests. The defendant, Richard Howard Bruckner, had previously served the plaintiff, Rachel Shur, with form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, but the plaintiff had not provided any responses. The defendant had also offered extensions to the plaintiff's counsel, but the plaintiff had not provided any responses. The judge found that the defendant had demonstrated that it had propounded discovery requests on the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had not provided any responses. The judge ordered the plaintiff to submit verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 10 days of notice of the order. The judge also noted that the defendant had not requested an award of monetary sanctions against the plaintiff.
