PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Moving

Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
          Denied. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (a), notice of a motion for
summary judgment and supporting papers “shall be served on all other parties to
the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing. If the
notice is served by mail, the required 75-day period of notice shall be
increased by 5 days if the place of address is within the State of California,
10 days if the place of address is outside the State of California but within
the United States, and 20 days if the place of address is outside the United
States. If the notice is served by facsimile transmission, express mail, or
another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery, the required
75-day period of notice shall be increased by two court days.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2).)  “The motion shall be heard no later than 30
days before the date of trial, unless the court for good cause orders
otherwise.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (a)(3).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3) “requires that two court
days be added to the notice period” when the moving party electronically serves
a summary judgment motion.  (L. Edmon
& C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter
2024) ¶ 10:77, p. 10-34 (Cal. Practice Guide); see Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B) [“Any
period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any response
within any period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which
time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be
extended after service by electronic means by two court days” with exceptions
that do not apply here].) 
DISCUSSION 
Moving
Defendants’ motion was set for hearing on September 24, 2024.  75 days before September 24, 2024 is July 11,
2024. Adding two Court days to the notice period for electronic service made
the last day for service July 9, 2024.  According
to Moving Defendants’ proof of service, Moving Defendants electronically served
the motion on July 11, 2024, two days after the deadline. 
“Where
the moving party notices the hearing in less than the required time, notice
must begin anew.  The court cannot cure
this defect by continuing the hearing for the missing number of days.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 10:80.6,
p. 10-35, emphasis omitted.) 
Moving
Defendants did not provide the statutorily required notice of their motion.
The Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES
the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants Lowers Welding &
Fabrication, Inc. and Lowers Properties,
LLC. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
