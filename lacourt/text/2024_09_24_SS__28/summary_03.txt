As for the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling, here it is:

"The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) to continue the trial, final status conference, and motion/discovery cut-off dates. The court finds good cause to do so because Metro's counsel only recently learned that the plaintiff was uninsured at the time of the accident, which is relevant to the case. The court continues the trial to April 23, 2025, and sets a new final status conference date for April 9, 2025. Discovery deadlines and related dates will be based on the new trial date. The court also grants Metro's motion to continue the trial, final status conference, and motion/discovery cut-off date."
