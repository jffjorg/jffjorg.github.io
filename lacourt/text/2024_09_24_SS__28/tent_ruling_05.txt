 Case Number:  23STCV29856    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as  follows.  BACKGROUND  On December  7, 2023, Plaintiff Horacio Vela (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against  Defendants Alan Ruck (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25 for negligence and negligence  per se.  On  December 27, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.  On May  28, 2024, Plaintiff filed (1) a motion to compel Defendant’s further responses  to request for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions (2) a motion  to compel Defendant’s further responses to special interrogatories, set one,  and for sanctions, (3) a motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to form  interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions.  The motions were  set for hearing on September 3 and 4, 2024.   On August 21, 2024, Defendant filed oppositions and requests for  sanctions.  Plaintiffs filed replies on September  27, 2024.  The Court continued the  hearings to September 24, 2024.  Trial  is currently scheduled for June 5, 2025.  PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS  A.      Informal Discovery Conference  The  Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts  Effective October 10, 2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub  Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery  until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and  complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses  to Discovery.”  The  parties participated in an IDC on July 24, 2024.  B.       Timeliness  A  notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of  the service of the verified responses, or any supplemental verified responses,  or on or before any later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c) [demand for inspection]; Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (c) [interrogatories].)   Failure to file a motion by this deadline constitutes a waiver of any  right to compel further responses.  The  motions are timely.  C.   Meet and confer  A  motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or interrogatories  must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2016.040.  (See Code  Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd (b)(2) [demand for inspection]; Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (b)(1) [interrogatories].)   “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts  showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each  issue presented by the motion.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)   Plaintiff  has submitted meet and confer declarations.  D.      Separate statement  With  exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,  requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate  statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of  factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is  warranted.   Plaintiff  has filed separate statements.  APPLICABLE LAW  A.   Demand for inspection  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 provides in part:  “(a) On receipt of a response to a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an  order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems  that any of the following apply:  “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is  incomplete.  “(2) A representation of inability to comply is  inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  “(3) An objection in the response is without merit or  too general.  “(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with  each of the following:  “(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing  good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  “(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and  confer declaration under Section 2016.040.  “(3) In lieu of a separate statement required under  the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a  concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.  “(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45  days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified  response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party  and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any  right to compel a further response to the demand.  * * *   “(h) Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1031.310,  subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).)  B.   Interrogatories  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides in  part:  “(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the  propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the  propounding party deems that any of the following apply:  “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is  evasive or incomplete.  “(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents  under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those  documents is inadequate.  “(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit  or too general.  “(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.  “(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under  the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a  concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.  “(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45  days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified  response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding  party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party  waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.  “(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further  response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,  subds. (a), (b), (c), (d).)   DISCUSSION  A.    Plaintiff’s  motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to request for production of  documents, set one  Served:                                      December 27, 2023                   Responses:                                 April 10, 2024 Motion filed:                             May  28, 2024  Defendant has not carried his burden of establishing  the preliminary facts required to support his claims of attorney-client  privilege, work product protection, and “insurer-insured privilege.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd.  (c)(1) [“If an objection is based on a claim of privilege or a claim that the  information sought is protected work product, the response shall provide  sufficient factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that  claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log”]; L. Edmon  & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter  2024) ¶ 8:192, p. 8C-61 (Cal. Practice Guide).)  In addition, Defendant has not carried his burden of  establishing the extent and seriousness of the prospective invasion of the  privacy rights he asserts.  (See Cal.  Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:294, p. 8C-98.)  On requests for  production of documents numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 15, and 19, the  Court orders Defendant either (1) to provide a privilege log listing any responsive  documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested  which Defendant has withheld under a claim of privilege or privacy protection  by October 22, 2024, or (2) to produce previously-withheld responsive documents,  electronically stored information, and/or other things requested and serve code-compliant verified further responses by October 22, 2024.  On request for production of documents number 18, Defendant  asserts that he “has not conducted surveillance of Plaintiff, and such videos  or recordings requested do not exist. Plaintiff was advised of the same at the  informal discovery conference related to these motions, and Responding Party  has offered to provide further responses stating the same.”  The Court orders  Defendant to provide verified code-compliant further responses to request  for production of documents number 18 by October 22, 2024.  On request for production of documents number 20, Defendant  asserts that he “provided a copy of his policy declaration page for the  insurance policy in effect at the time of the incident as requested following  the informal discovery conference related to Plaintiff’s motions. This point is  moot, as Defendant has cured the deficiency in providing the requested  documentation.  Defendant has offered to provide a further response stating the  same.”  The Court  orders Defendant to provide a verified code-compliant further response to request  for production of documents number 20 by October 22, 2024.  The Court denies both parties’ requests for sanctions.  B.   Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further  responses to special interrogatories, set one  Served:                            December 27, 2023                              Responses:                        April 10, 2024                                                 Motion  filed:                   May 28, 2024 The  Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to special  interrogatory numbers 22, 23, 24, and 25. For special  interrogatory numbers 26 and 27, Defendant states that he has offered to  provide a further response stating that no responsive evidence exists.  The Court orders Defendant to provide verified  code-compliant further responses to special interrogatory numbers 26 and 27 by  October 22, 2024.  The  Court denies both parties’ requests for sanctions.  C.   Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further  responses to form interrogatories, set one  Served:                            December  27, 2023           Responses:                       April  10, 2024                                                          Motion filed:                   May 28, 2024  Defendant  has not carried his burden of establishing the preliminary facts required to  support his claims of attorney-client privilege, work product protection, and  “insurer-insured privilege.”  (See Cal.  Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:192, p. 8C-61 [“In response to a motion to  compel answers [citation], the burden is on the party claiming a privilege to  establish whatever preliminary facts are essential to the claim”].)  On form interrogatory numbers 16.9 and 16.10,  Defendant states that he has offered to provide further responses stating he has  no information that is responsive to these requests.  The Court  orders Defendant to provide verified code-compliant further responses to form  interrogatory numbers 16.9 and 16.10 by October 22, 2024.  On  form interrogatory number 17.1 with respect to requests for admission numbers  7, 18, 24, and 25, Defendant states that he has offered to provide further  responses stating he has no information that is responsive to these  requests.  The Court orders Defendant to  provide verified code-compliant further responses to form interrogatory  number 17.1 with respect to requests for admission numbers 7, 18, 24, and 25  by October 22, 2024.  The  Court denies both parties’ requests for sanctions.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiff Horacio Vela’s motion to compel Defendant Alan Ruck’s further  responses to request for production of documents, set one, as follows:  On requests  for production of documents numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 15, and 19, the  Court orders Defendant either (1) to provide a privilege log listing any  responsive documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things  requested which Defendant has withheld under a claim of privilege or privacy  protection by October 22, 2024, or (2) to produce previously-withheld  responsive documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things  requested and serve verified code-compliant further responses by October 22,  2024.  The Court  orders Defendant to provide verified code-compliant further responses to request  for production of documents number 18 by October 22, 2024.  The Court  orders Defendant to provide verified code-compliant further responses to request  for production of documents number 20 by October 22, 2024.  In all other  respects, the Court denies the motion.  The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiff  Horacio Vela’s motion to compel Defendant Alan Ruck’s further responses to special  interrogatories, set one, as follows:  The Court  denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to special  interrogatory numbers 22, 23, 24, and 25.           The Court  orders Defendant to provide verified code-compliant further responses to special  interrogatory numbers 26 and 27 by October 22, 2024.  In all other  respects, the Court denies the motion.
