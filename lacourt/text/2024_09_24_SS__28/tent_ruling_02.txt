to Plaintiff’s complaint. 
On

On August

approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s action to be heard on September 24, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Michael Feresten asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action
of minor Plaintiff Jack Feresten. 
DISCUSSION 
The
petition states the following: 
Gross
settlement amount:                                         $235,000.00           
Total
medical expenses:                                           $11,960.00

Medical expenses paid:                                            $0

Reductions:                                                              $2,708.38
To
be paid/reimbursed from proceeds:                     $9,251.62
Liens:                                                                       [not
listed]              
Attorney’s
fees:                                                        $47,000.00
Costs:                                                                      
 $13,421.15
Net
settlement amount:                                             $165,327.23
A.   Medical expenses
Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $11,960.00.  However, the charged amounts listed in
Section 12b(5)(b) of the petition add up to $15,669.90.  As a result, it does not appear that payment or
reimbursement of $9,251.62 from the settlement proceeds (Section 12a(4)) plus
the reduction amount of $2,708.38 (Section 12a(3)) would account for all of the
medical expenses ($15,669.90).  The Court
cannot approve a petition unless it shows that all medical expenses that have
not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds. 
Section
12a(2) of the petition states that $0 of the medical expenses were paid.  However, Section 12b(1) of the petition
states that Petitioner paid $5,541.72 of the medical expenses and Section 12b(2)
states that an ERISA self-funded plan paid $3,709.90
of the medical expenses.  Similarly,
Section 12b(5)(b) lists amounts paid to medical providers.  Petitioner should include the amounts paid to
medical providers in Section 12a(2). 
Petitioner
should also include the lien amounts in Section 12a(5). 
B.   Non-medical expenses 
 Section
13b of the petition lists $4,534.66 as the amount of expenses requested for “Complaint,
Answers (2) & Attorney Service Fees.” 
The Court has reviewed Attachment 14b and the attached documents but does
not understand the basis for this request. 
Petitioner should explain this request in more detail by breaking out
the different expenses and explaining what services were provided. 
The
Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Jack Feresten’s action filed by Petitioner Michael Feresten on August
15, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
