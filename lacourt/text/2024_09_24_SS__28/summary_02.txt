And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Jack Feresten's action and has denied it without prejudice. The petition states that the gross settlement amount is $235,000.00, with $11,960.00 in total medical expenses, of which $0 was paid and $9,251.62 is to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. However, the Court notes that the petition does not account for all medical expenses, as the charged amounts listed in the petition add up to $15,669.90, and the Court cannot approve a petition unless it shows that all medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.

The Court also notes that the petition does not list the amounts paid to medical providers and does not explain the basis for the non-medical expenses of $4,534.66. The Court orders the Petitioner to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
