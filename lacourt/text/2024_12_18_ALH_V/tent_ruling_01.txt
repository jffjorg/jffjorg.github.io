Plaintiff alleges that on November 25, 2019, she purchased a 2020 Ford Explorer (subject vehicle).

Defendant filed the opposition on December 5, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on December 11, 2024. Defendant

LEGAL STANDARD
A plaintiff may serve a request for production
of documents without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of
the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020(b).)
The party whom the request is propounded upon is
required to respond within 30 days after service, but the parties are allowed
to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.260(a), 2031.270(a) - (b).)
Where there has been no timely response to a
request for the production of documents, the demanding party may seek an order
compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b).) If a party fails to
timely respond to a request for production of documents, the party to whom the
request is directed waives any objection, including one based on privilege or
on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a).)
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.300(a), “[t]he court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver
on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1)
The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 [and] (2)
The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a).)
DISCUSSION
A. Motion to Compel Responses
Plaintiff served Requests for Production (Set
Two) on August 12, 2024. (Sogoyan Decl., ¶ 8.) Responses were due by September
13, 2024. (Sogoyan Decl., ¶ 9.) On October 9, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel
attempted to meet and confer on October 9, 2024, by emailing defense counsel
indicating its responses were overdue. (Sogoyan Decl., ¶ 12; Exh. 2.) On
October 14, 2024, defense counsel requested a 30-day extension which
plaintiff’s counsel denied explaining he had already given defendant a 30-day
extension by waiting to meet and confer, thus defendant’s deadline to respond
was October 18, 2024. (Sogoyan Decl., ¶ 13; Exh. 3.)
Defendant’s counsel contends that it was first
made aware of Request for Production (Set Two) when plaintiff sent the October
9, 2024 letter regarding the outstanding discovery responses because the
discovery was not served to the lead associate, Jeck Dizon’s email and at that
point defendant’s counsel requested the 30 day extension which plaintiff
denied. (Dizon Decl., ¶¶ 3, 10; Exh. A, B.) Defendant’s counsel states that
written responses and document production were served October 28, 2024, as well
as document production according to the Case Management Order Addendum in place
when the case was assigned to Judge Ralph Hofer. (Dizon Decl., ¶¶ 15, 16; Exhs.
C-E.) On October 29, 2024, defendant’s counsel asked plaintiff’s counsel to
withdraw the motion to compel, but plaintiff did not respond. (Dizon Decl., ¶¶
17, 18.) The court finds that as defendant’s counsel has served responses, the
motion is moot.
B. Motion for Relief from Waiver of Discovery
Response Objections
Defendant moves for an order relieving it from a
waiver of the right to assert objections to the second set of Request for
Production of Documents propounded by plaintiff pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300.
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300(a),
“[t]he court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 [and] (2) The
party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a).)
Defendant has shown it served responses in
substantial compliance on October 28, 2024. (Dizon Decl., ¶ 15; Exh. E.) Though
defendant’s response includes objections, a response may include an objection
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210 subdivision (a).
Defendant has also shown that its failure to serve
a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. The handling attorney Joanna Calderon (Ms. Calderon) believed there
were no additional requests for production because plaintiff’s counsel did not
electronically serve the discovery to the lead associate Jeck Dizon (Mr.
Dizon). (Dizon Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. A.) When Ms. Calderon took over the case while
Mr. Dizon was on paternity leave, she did not know defendant’s responses were
overdue until plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter on October 9,
2024. (Dizon Decl., ¶ 12; Exh. B ¶¶ 3-6.) Once Ms. Calderon learned of
counsel’s mistake, she requested a 30-day extension and when that was denied,
defendant served responses as soon as practicable. (Dizon Decl., Exh. B ¶¶7, 8,
13.) The court finds that defendant met the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300 subdivision (a), thus defendant is relieved from the
waiver of objections.
Based on the foregoing, the court DENIES, as moot,
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to Request for Production of Documents,
Set Two and GRANTS defendant’s motion for relief from waiver of objections to
plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set Two.
