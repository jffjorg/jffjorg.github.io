And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

**Motion to Compel Deposition**

The court grants the motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Joshua King. The court finds that the deposition notice was served on Plaintiff King for a deposition date of May 30, 2023. Although the defendant contends that Plaintiff King's counsel agreed to the deposition date, no evidence was provided to substantiate this claim. Additionally, the defendant did not inquire about non-appearance or make any attempt to meet and confer regarding the deposition. The court orders that Plaintiff King appear for deposition and produce certain documents.

**Request for Monetary Sanctions**

The court denies the request for monetary sanctions. The defendant seeks sanctions against Plaintiff King in the amount of $2,210.00. The court finds that the circumstances surrounding whether Plaintiff King served objections to the deposition, lack of meet and confer efforts, and lack of proof that the defendant inquired about nonappearance make the imposition of sanctions unjust at this time.

**Demurrer**

The court overrules the demurrer to the third, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth, thirty-first, and thirty-fourth affirmative defenses. The court finds that the pleadings are not so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.

**Meet and Confer**

The court finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer regarding the instant demurrer. However, the court will still consider the demurrer but admonishes the parties to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going forward.

**Tentative Ruling**

The court's tentative ruling is as follows: the motion to compel deposition of Plaintiff Joshua King is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is DENIED. The demurrer is OVERRULED IN PART as to the third, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth, thirty-first, and thirty-fourth affirmative defenses.
