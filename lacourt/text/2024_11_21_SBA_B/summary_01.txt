And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied with prejudice the plaintiff's motion to amend its name on the complaint. The plaintiff, Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company, seeks to change its name to OBI National Insurance Company a/s/o Ben Larbi and Company LLC, citing CCP § 576. However, the court notes that this is the same motion that was previously denied on November 2, 2023, and that the plaintiff has not cited any applicable authority for substituting a different plaintiff. The court also finds that the delay in presenting the motion is unexcused and that the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence and added costs of preparation. As a result, the motion is denied with prejudice.
