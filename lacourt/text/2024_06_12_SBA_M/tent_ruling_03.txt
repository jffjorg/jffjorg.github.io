Amended Complaint

Greene Family
Partners, LLC’s Motion to Strike Portions of First Amended Complaint   
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

Greene Family Partners, LLC’s Demurrer to First
Amended Complaint is sustained without leave to amend, in part, and sustained
with 20 days leave to amend, in part. 
 
Greene Family Partners, LLC’s Motion to Strike
Portions of First Amended Complaint is moot.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on April 17, 2023.  Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint was filed
on September 26, 2023.  The action was
originally filed in the Butte County Superior Court. The action was transferred
to the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles – Torrance on February 21,
2024.  Plaintiff alleges the following
facts.  This is a partition action
related to two properties owned by Plaintiff and Defendants Benedict Cockburn
and Elizabeth Wood.  Plaintiff also seeks
dissolution and declaratory relief with respect to Greene Family Partners LLC
(“LLC”).  Plaintiff alleges the following
causes of action: 1. Partition (752/4 E. 6th St); 2. Partition (2145
Floral Ave); 3. Dissolution; 4. Declaratory Relief.
            
            Meet and Confer
 
            Defendant set forth meet and confer declarations
in sufficient compliance with CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5.  (Decls., Chance M. Hansen, ¶ 3.)  The Court notes that Plaintiff counsel also
submitted declarations which he was not required to do.
 
            Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant’s request for judicial
notice is granted pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(c).  The Court takes judicial notice of the
existence of this document – the Statement of Information filed by the LLC –
only, and not the truth of any matter asserted therein. The Court notes that
Defendant did not even file the Statement of Information with the request.  However, in Plaintiff’s objection and motion
to strike, Plaintiff does not appear to deny the existence of this document.  Thus, the Court will presume that this
document does, in fact, exist.
 
            Demurrer

A demurrer tests the
sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law.
(Schmidt v. Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are
the essential facts of the case "with reasonable precision and with
particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature,
source, and extent of his cause of action.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) "Whether
the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling
upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a
demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s factual
allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a defendant of
the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams
v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Defendant demurs to
the FAC and each cause of action on the grounds that the causes of action fail
to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.  CCP § 430.10(e).
 
First Cause of
Action for Partition (752/4 E. 6th St)
Second Cause of
Action for Partition (2145 Floral Ave)
 
As to the first and
second causes of action, the allegations of the FAC reveal that these
properties are not alleged to be owned by demurring Defendant.  (FAC, ¶¶ 6-8.)  Thus, the demurrer to the first and second
causes of action is sustained without leave to amend as to the demurring
Defendant only.
 
Third Cause of
Action for Dissolution
Fourth Cause of
Action for Declaratory Relief
 
As to the third and
fourth causes of action, the demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 Plaintiff fails to state facts
sufficient to state a cause of action. 
 
These causes of
action are directed to the property in Redondo Beach owned by the LLC.  Plaintiff has failed to plead facts
demonstrating an ownership interest in the LLC. Plaintiff
alleges the following: “The Plaintiff is informed, believes, and thus alleges
that he is a holder of a membership interest in the Partnership.”  (FAC, ¶ 16.)
 
“[P]laintiff may
allege on information and belief any matters that are not within his personal
knowledge, if he has information leading him to believe that the allegations
are true and thus a pleading made on information and belief is insufficient if
it merely assert[s] the facts so alleged without alleging such information that
lead[s] [the plaintiff] to believe that the allegations are true.”  Gomes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.
(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1158–1159 (internal citations and quotations are
omitted; emphasis in original.)  As to
the allegation made on “information and belief,” Plaintiff has failed to allege
sufficient facts that would support the contention that the belief is true. 
 
Plaintiff argues that
this issue was determined when the demurrer to the original Complaint was
sustained by Judge Stephen E. Benson when this action was previously assigned
to the Superior Court of California, County of Butte.  Plaintiff relies on this stray statement by
Judge Benson in his ruling on the demurrer to the original Complaint: “Although
the Complaint clearly alleges Plaintiff has an interest in the LLC, the
Complaint does not clearly allege whether the LLC was distributed from the
trust.”  (Minute Order, Sept. 6, 2023.)
 
As Plaintiff himself
correctly points out, “a trial court ruling is binding on subsequent judges
only as to those aspects of the ruling necessary to decision on the matter
before the initial judge.”  Anne H. v.
Michael B. (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 488, 500.  First, Judge Benson’s ruling was as to a
demurrer to the original Complaint – a completely different pleading – and his
ruling on the demurrer to the original Complaint would have no binding effect
regarding a demurrer to a subsequent pleading. Second, the statement quoted
above was certainly not necessary to his decision to the demurrer since the
actual decision itself with respect to sustaining the demurrer to the cause of
action is based on completely separate grounds.  Third, the statement is vague as Judge Benson
only remarked regrading an “interest” and made no statement that Plaintiff
pleaded sufficient facts regrading an ownership interest.
 
Plaintiff also argues
that he should be excused from pleading facts because Defendant must have full
knowledge of this information.  However,
the two cases primarily relied upon by Defendant involved the requirement of
specificity in pleading fraud and are therefore not analogous.  Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v.
General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216; Tenet Healthsystem
Desert, Inc v. Blue Cross of California (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 821, 840.  Second, Plaintiff would also appear to have
knowledge of this information, or, at a minimum, under the standard listed
above, the ability to set forth the underlying facts by which his “belief” in
this allegation is true.
 
Thus, the demurrer to
the third and fourth causes of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Motion to Strike  
            
            The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading.  CCP § 436(a).  The court may also strike all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court. 
CCP § 436(b).  The grounds for a
motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper
matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  CCP § 436. 
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
            
            Defendant’s
motion to strike is moot upon the sustaining of the demurrer to the FAC.
            
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
