And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants Tesla, Inc.'s motion for a protective order to prevent the deposition of Robert Sumwalt, a former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The defendant argues that Sumwalt cannot testify in his official capacity due to the lack of NTSB investigation into the subject incident. The plaintiffs failed to oppose the motion, and the court finds good cause to grant the protective order. As a result, the deposition of Robert Sumwalt is prevented in this action.
