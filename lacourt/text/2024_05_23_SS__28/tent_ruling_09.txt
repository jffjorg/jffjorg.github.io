LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
and Wang stipulated that the Court would dismiss the action without prejudice.  In return, Wang agreed to make installment
payments to Plaintiff totaling $21,363.99. 
If Wang failed to make payments, Plaintiff could request the entry of
judgment against Wang for the amount still owed. 
Wang
made payments of $5,550.00. Wang’s insurance carrier Alliance United Insurance
Company paid $6,363.99 (the Defendant's policy limits), leaving a
balance due and owing of $9,450.00, with the last payment received
on June 9, 2023.

sent default payment letters to Wang but Wang did not cure the default.  Plaintiff asks the Court to enter judgment in
its favor for $47,843.72, less payments received of $11,913.99, for a total
principal of $35,929.73, plus filing costs of $72.00, for a total judgment of $36,001.73.
