And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on several motions filed by the defendants in a lawsuit brought by the plaintiff, Cody Quang. The defendants, Dylan Alexander Silver and Steven P. Silver, have moved to compel the plaintiff's responses to supplemental demands for production of documents and supplemental interrogatories. They have also moved to compel the plaintiff's second medical examination (orthopedic and neuropsychological issues) or, in the alternative, for an order for second IME for a mental examination.

The court has granted the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's second medical examination (orthopedic and neuropsychological issues) or, in the alternative, for an order for second IME for a mental examination. The court has ordered the plaintiff to attend a mental examination with Dr. George Henry, a clinical neuropsychologist, at 11601 Wilshire Blvd., 5th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90025, or with another suitable neuropsychologist on a mutually agreeable date within 60 days of the court's ruling.

The court has also denied the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to supplemental demands for production of documents and supplemental interrogatories as moot. The court has denied the defendants' request for sanctions because the defendants had not obtained leave of court to conduct a mental examination on March 12, 2024, and the plaintiff had not stipulated to attend the examination.

The court has ordered the plaintiff to provide a list of all medical professionals who have examined the plaintiff and to provide the court with a copy of the plaintiff's medical records. The court has also ordered the defendants to provide the court with a list of all medical professionals who have examined the plaintiff and to provide the court with a copy of the defendant's medical records.

The court has scheduled a hearing on the motion to compel the plaintiff's second medical examination (orthopedic and neuropsychological issues) or, in the alternative, for an order for second IME for a mental examination for May 23, 2024.
