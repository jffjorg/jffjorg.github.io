  Case Number:  21STCV20037    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed Defendant Cole Rundnai’s unopposed Motions to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production, the Court
rules as follows. 
On
November 3, 2023, Defendant Cole Rundnai served Form Interrogatories, Set No.
One, Special Interrogatories, Set No. One, and Requests for Production, Set No.
One on Plaintiff Alamtaj Khazaee. 
Responses
were due December 5, 2023. Plaintiff Alamtaj Khazaee has failed to provide
timely responses. Defendant Cole Rundnai now moves to compel code-compliant
responses and the requested production. 
The
Court grants the motions to compel responses to the form and special
interrogatories under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b),
and orders Plaintiff Alamtaj Khazaee to provide verified responses to the
interrogatories compliant with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210,
subdivision (a), and 2030.220 without objections by June 2, 2024. 
The
Court grants the motion to compel responses to the request for production of
documents under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 and orders Plaintiff
Alamtaj Khazaee to provide verified responses compliant with Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.210 and to produce the documents, electronically stored
information, and/or other things requested without objections by June 2, 2024. 
Defendant
Cole Rundnai requests monetary sanctions totaling $2,580.00. Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and
2031.300, sanctions are available against parties, persons, and attorneys who
unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to compel a response to interrogatories
or requests for production. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].)  Plaintiff did not
make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or requests for
production. Therefore, sanctions are not available under these statutes.         
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.) Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and
monetary sanctions may not be imposed based solely on [the statute]. Monetary
sanctions may be imposed only if authorized by some other provision of the
Discovery Act.” (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030
[court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the
extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or
other provision of this title”]; City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers,
LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504, review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order
permitting citation of opinion for its persuasive value and to establish the
existence of a conflict in authority that would “allow trial courts to exercise
discretion . . . to choose between sides of any such conflict.”)
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  “ ‘Rules of court have the force of law and
are as binding as procedural statutes as long as they are not inconsistent with
statutory or constitutional law.’ ” (Fidelity National Home Warranty Company
Cases (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 812, 842, fn. 41, quoting In re I.V. (2017) 11
Cal.App.5th 249, 256.)  Interpreting rule
3.1348(a) to authorize an award of sanctions on the motions to compel would be
inconsistent with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300.) 
The
Court denies the request for sanctions. 
Moving
party is to give notice of this ruling.
