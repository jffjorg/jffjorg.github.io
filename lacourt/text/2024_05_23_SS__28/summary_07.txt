Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice Plaintiff Maidia Leola Stillitano's application for default judgment against Defendants Juventina Acosta Funez and Jorge Hernandez. The judge finds that the Plaintiff failed to properly complete the CIV-100 form, which is required for a default judgment. Specifically, the form lacks the name and signature of a declarant stating under penalty of perjury that certain information is correct. The judge also notes that the form does not include a declaration of military status for each defendant. The judge requires Plaintiff to address the question of whether the Court should require Plaintiff to file a bond as a condition before entry of judgment. The judge orders Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
