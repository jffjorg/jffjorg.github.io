And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the motion to relieve LA Century Law and their attorneys of record as counsel for the plaintiffs, Luis Gutierrez and Claudia Lemus. The motion was filed on April 23, 2024, and the judge finds that the counsel failed to provide a proof of service showing service of the moving papers on all parties who have appeared in the case. The judge also notes that the counsel's declaration states that there has been a breakdown in communication with the plaintiffs and that the counsel personally served the moving papers on the plaintiffs, but the counsel has not filed a proof of service. The judge orders the counsel to provide a proof of service and to file it with the court within five days.
