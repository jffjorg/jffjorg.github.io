NAME:  Souzan
Gendy v. County of Los Angeles, et al.County
of Los Angeles’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint 
TENTATIVE
RULING 
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the First Cause of Action with
20 days leave to amend. The Court deems the demurrer to the Second Cause of
Action moot. 
             Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order. 
BACKGROUND 
This is a personal injury action. On January 30, 2024, plaintiff Souzan
Gendy (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants County of Los Angeles
(County), FALCK Mobile Care Corp., FALCK USA, Inc. (collectively, Defendants),
and Does 1 through 10, alleging causes of action for general negligence and
strict liability. 
On March 19, 2024, County demurred to the complaint. On April 17,
2024, Plaintiff opposed the demurrer. On the same date, Plaintiff dismissed the
Second Cause of Action for strict liability. On April 23, 2024, County replied. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
            A
demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other
pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or
content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function
of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for
purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Id.) 
A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,
supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].) 
A
demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete
or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of
the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are
incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as
surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]) 
A demurrer
can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108
Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) 
DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer 
Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a),
County was required to meet and confer with Plaintiff in person or by telephone
before bringing the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court
finds County’s meet-and-confer efforts sufficient. (Hall Decl., ¶ 2.) 
Analysis 
To state a cause of action for negligence, the
plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating, “(1) the defendant owed the
plaintiff a legal duty, (2) the defendant breached the duty, and (3) the breach
proximately or legally caused (4) the plaintiff's damages or injuries.
[Citation.]” (Thomas v. Stenberg (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 654,
662.)  To state a cause of action for
medical negligence, the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating, “‘(1) the
duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other
members of his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that
duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the
resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the
professional's negligence.’ [Citation.]” (Belfiore-Braman v. Rotenberg
(2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 234, 238 fn. 3.) 
County demurs to the First Cause of Action for general negligence
on the grounds that it fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. County
contends it fails because Plaintiff is actually alleging a medical malpractice
claim rather than a general negligence claim. County contends paramedics and
emergency medical technicians (EMTs) are health care providers whose services
fall under professional negligence and the provisions of the Medical Injury
Compensation Reform Act (MICRA). County contends it is unclear what standard
applies here based on the allegations, i.e., reasonable standard of care for
general negligence or professional standard of care for ambulance operators.
County contends that it is unable to produce a proper response or defend
against this cause of action. 
In opposition, Plaintiff contends the complaint adequately pleads
the First Cause of Action. Plaintiff contends there is no authority requiring a
plaintiff to relabel a cause of action, and that the law in fact holds that the
label of a cause of action is irrelevant. Plaintiff also contends the label on
the First Cause of Action will not affect discovery. 
County’s argument regarding the First
Cause of Action being labeled one for general negligence does not affect
whether Plaintiff adequately alleged a cognizable claim. “What is necessary to
state a cause of action are the facts warranting legal relief, and not whether
a plaintiff has provided apt, inapt, or no labels or titles for causes of
action. [Citation.]” (Alfaro v. Cmty. Hous. Improvement Sys. &
Plan. Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1371; see also Flowers v. Torrance Mem'l Hosp.
Med. Ctr. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 992, 998 [“[I]t is clear that
denominating a cause of action as one for ‘professional negligence’ does not
transmute its underlying character.”]) 
The Complaint alleges that County was involved in the
provision of medical transportation services to Plaintiff and that Plaintiff
was injured as a result of County’s and the other Defendants’ failure to adhere
to Plaintiff’s notice of her prior surgery. (Compl., GN-1.) These allegations
demonstrate that County was a medical transportation service provider, which demonstrates
that County owed Plaintiff a duty of due care. (See T.L. v. City Ambulance
of Eureka, Inc. (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 864, 881.) These allegations also
demonstrate that County owed Plaintiff a professional standard of care. (Id.
[conduct of ambulance company, paramedics, and EMT assessed under
professional standard of care, even though they owed a general duty of due care];
see also Flowers, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 998 [“As to any given
defendant, only one standard of care obtains under a particular set of facts,
even if the plaintiff attempts to articulate multiple or alternate theories of
liability.”]) The applicable professional standard of care is a question of
fact resolved by expert testimony, (T.L., supra, 83 Cal.App.5th at p.
881), and therefore not the proper subject of a demurrer, (Panterra GP, Inc.
v. Superior Court of Kern County (2022) 74 Cal. App. 5th 697, 709 [demurrer
not appropriate for determining truth of disputed facts].) The Complaint
further alleges that defendants breached the duty of care resulting in harm and
injury to Plaintiff. (Compl., GN-1). 
However, the Complaint lumps all of the defendants
together so it is not entirely clear what the County is alleged to have done. Is
Plaintiff alleging that County owned and operated the ambulance? Or that it
employed the paramedics? Further, the First Cause of Action also alleges that
Defendants failed to property train and manage the paramedics. This is a
different claim than professional negligence and should be alleged as a
separate cause of action. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court SUSTAINS the
demurrer to the First Cause of Action for general negligence with 20 days leave
to amend. 
Due to Plaintiff’s dismissal of the Second Cause of
Action for strict liability, the demurrer is moot as to that cause of action.
(Request for Dismissal (4/17/24).) 
CONCLUSION 
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the First Cause of Action with
20 days leave to amend. The Court deems the demurrer to the Second Cause of
Action moot. 
             Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
