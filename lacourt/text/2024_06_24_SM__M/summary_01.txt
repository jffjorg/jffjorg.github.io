Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant, Venice Business Partners, Inc., to compel further responses to requests for production made by the plaintiff, Tom Yang. The motion was filed in connection with a deposition taken from Yang.

The judge has ruled that requests 1-3 and 5 are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and therefore will not be granted. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's objections to requests 6-14 and 16-26 are without merit and therefore will not be sustained.

The judge has granted the motion as to requests 6-14 and 16-26, ordering Yang to attend a resumed deposition within 10 days, produce any responsive documents at that deposition, and answer questions related to the documents without objection except for objections based on privilege.

The judge has also ordered Yang to serve on the defendant verified written responses to each request that Yang lacks the ability to comply with the requests at least 5 days prior to the resumed deposition.

In addition, the judge has granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $3,860.00 against Yang and his counsel, Steven M. Garber and Steven M. Garber & Associates, jointly and severally, for their failure to produce certain documents requested by the defendant. The judge has also ordered the parties to meet and confer on a mutually agreeable time and date for the resumed deposition.
