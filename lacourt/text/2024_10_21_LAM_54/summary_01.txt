And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Agustin Arias. The defendant, Estela Villasenor, moves to compel the deposition because the plaintiff has refused to appear for the deposition. The plaintiff's counsel is not opposed to the deposition but is not available until December 2024. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to take the deposition of the plaintiff and orders the plaintiff to appear for deposition within 45 days of notice of the ruling. The judge declines to award sanctions, as the dispute is merely a scheduling issue.
