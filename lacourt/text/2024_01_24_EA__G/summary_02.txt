And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Aurora Charter Oak – Los Angeles, LLC's demurrer to Plaintiff Roberto Lopez's complaint and motion to strike are continued to a date to be determined at the hearing in Department G (Pomona). The Judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer before filing the demurrer and motion to strike. The Judge orders Defendant's counsel to meet and confer with Plaintiff regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing on the demurrer. The Judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, which requires the parties to meet and confer before filing a demurrer, and the case of Dumas v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors (2020), which holds that courts may continue a hearing if the parties do not adequately meet and confer.
