The attorney may withdraw from representation as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client's interest—i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.)Attorney Steven E. Formaker, on behalf of Freedman, Taitelman and Cooley, LLP, seeks to be relieved as counsel for Cross-Defendant Jonghyeok Choi.  Mr. Formaker asserts that he is seeking to withdraw because “there is an amount owing, unpaid, and past due for the representation of Mr. Choi. Mr. Choi has not responded to repeated requests that he pay the past due amount and provide a deposit to secure payment of future fees.”  The motion is unopposed. Mr. Formaker has complied with all procedural requirements, including giving notice of this hearing to his client.There are no future court hearings scheduled.  Mr. Choi’s court trial occurred in February 2024.  Therefore, this is not a critical point in the litigation. THE MOTION IS GRANTED. COUNSEL IS TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER ON MR. CHOI WITHIN 5 DAYS OF NOTICE OF RULING. COUNSEL WILL BE RELIEVED UPON FILING OF PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER. The clerk to give notice.Dated July 22, 2024 JARED D. MOSES JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT
