 Case Number:  24AHCV00164    Hearing Date:   July 22, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING ANNA
GREENSTIN AND THE FIRM OF HART, KIENLE & PENTECOST LLP’S MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS ATTORNEYS OF RECORD FOR PLAINTIFF ELECTRACORP, INC. 


The Court may issue an
order allowing an attorney to withdraw from representation after notice to the
client. (CCP § 284.) The attorney may
withdraw from representation as
long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client's
interest—i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
Attorney Anna Greenstin and the firm of Hart,
Kienle and Pentecost seek to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Electracorp,
Inc. Ms. Greenstin asserts that she is
seeking to withdraw because “(1) there has been a breakdown in attorney client
communications, which has rendered it unreasonably difficult for counsel to carry
out representation effectively (See Rule 1.16(b)(4)); and (2) a material breach
of client's obligations to attorney (see Rule 1.16(b)(5)). Client has declined to
secure new counsel rendering this Motion necessary as a Substitution cannot be filed.”
The motion is unopposed. Ms. Greenstin has
complied with all procedural requirements, including giving notice of this
hearing to her client.
The next court hearing in this matter is a
status conference re mediation completion set for June 20, 2025.  Therefore, this is not a critical point in
the litigation.             THE MOTION IS GRANTED. COUNSEL IS TO FILE
PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER ON ELECTRACORP, INC. WITHIN 5 DAYS OF NOTICE OF
RULING. COUNSEL WILL BE RELIEVED UPON FILING OF PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER.The clerk to give notice.Dated: July 22, 2024 JARED D. MOSES      JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT
