And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Jared D. Moses, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion filed by Freedman, Taitelman and Cooley, LLP, to be relieved as attorney of record for Cross-Defendant Jonghyeok Choi. The attorney, Steven E. Formaker, seeks to withdraw due to an unpaid amount for representation, which has not been paid despite repeated requests. Since the court trial occurred in February 2024 and there are no future hearings scheduled, this is not a critical point in the litigation. The motion is unopposed, and the attorney has complied with all procedural requirements. The Judge grants the motion and orders the attorney to file proof of service of the order on Mr. Choi within 5 days of notice of the ruling.
