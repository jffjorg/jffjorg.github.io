  - Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 604-606 (D.C. Cir. 2017)
Statutes:

  - Conservator: Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)

Significant Statements:
  - "The rationale of those decisions applies with equal force to Section 4617(f)’s indistinguishable operative language. The plain statutory text draws a sharp line in the sand against litigative interference—through judicial injunctions, declaratory judgments, or other equitable relief—with FHFA's statutorily permitted actions as conservator or receiver." (Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 606)
  - "The prohibition created by the cited statutes makes such inquiry improper. Congress has chosen to insulate FHFA from interference by the Court."
