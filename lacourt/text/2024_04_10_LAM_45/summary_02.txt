And here is the English-text summary:

The court has considered the motion to quash the service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction, brought by Defendants Chris Loomis and Chris Loomis Consultations, LLC. The defendants argue that the summons and complaint were not properly served and that the court lacks jurisdiction over them. However, the Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion. The court notes that the defendants have filed a notice of non-opposition with an attached proof of service, but have not filed a proof of service showing that the Plaintiff was served the moving papers. Therefore, the court denies the motion without prejudice.
