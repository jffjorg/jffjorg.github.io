Motion to Quash for Defective Service of Process and
Lack of Personal Jurisdiction
 
The court has
considered the moving papers.
The court DENIES  without prejudice Defendant’s motion to quash
for defective service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction, since no
proof of service of the moving papers has been filed.
Discussion
Defendants Chris
Loomis and Chris Loomis Consultations, LLC move for an order to quash the service
of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. Defendant’s motion is based on
the grounds that (1) the Summons and Complaint were not properly served, and
(2) the court lacks jurisdiction over the Defendants. 
Plaintiff has
the initial burden of proving the facts required for an effective service and
establishing the existence of jurisdiction. (Summers,
supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at 413.) Here, Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition. On April 5, 2024, Defendants filed the notice of
non-opposition with an attached proof of service showing that the notice of
non-opposition was mailed to Plaintiff. 
However, Defendants did not file a proof of service showing that
Plaintiff was served the moving papers.
The court
therefore DENIES  the motion without
prejudice. 
It is so
ordered.
