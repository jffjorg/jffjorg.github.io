And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling ahead of the Court hearing on the Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication. The Judge will focus on the Defendant's response to Question 11 in the application for insurance, which asks about the percentage of gross billings derived from "mediation/arbitration" in 2016 and 2017. The Defendant left the answer blank, which appears to be a material misrepresentation given their involvement in an OLE arbitration in 2016 and early 2017. The Judge intends to question the Defendant's counsel about their apparent dodge of this issue in their opposition brief. The Judge concludes that aside from the answer to Question 11, there are disputed issues of material fact regarding other questions in the application form, and therefore the Plaintiff is not entitled to summary adjudication.
