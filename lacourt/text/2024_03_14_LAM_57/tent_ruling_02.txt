 Case Number:  21STCV42748    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendant Helen
Kim Law Firm, APC (“HKL”) moves for orders compelling Plaintiffs Horton Law
Firm, APC and Laura Horton (collectively, “Horton”) to further respond to certain
Requests for Admissions (Set Two) (“RFAs”), Form Interrogatories – General (Set
Three) (“FROGs”), and Special Interrogatories (Set Four) (“SROGs”) on the
grounds that Horton either did not respond, or if it did, the responses are
incomplete and evasive.  The specific
numbers (“nos”) of the SROGS, RFAs, and FROGs in question are as follows: SROGs
nos. 8 and 9; RFAs nos. Nos. 3-8 and 11-30, and FROG no. 17.1(b).  The Court is
granting HKL’s motion as to SROG no. 8  The motion is denied as moot as to SROG no. 9.
The Court is
granting HKL’s motion as to RFA number 3, but denying the motion as to
remainder of the RFRs at issue.
The Court is
granting HKL’s motion as to FROG no. 17.1(b) as it relates to RFAs nos. 3, 4,
17-21, 23-37, and 39.  The Court is denying
the motion as to FROG no. 17.1(b) as it relates to RFAs nos.  5-8, 11-16, 22 38, and 40.
While HKL
requested monetary sanctions against Horton in the amount of $5,061.65 in its
Memorandum of Points and Authorities, HKL’s Notice of Motion is silent as to
any such request. (See Notice, p. 2.)   Therefore, due to lack of notice, the Court
is declining to impose monetary sanctions against Horton.  Even if the notice was proper, the Court would
decline to impose monetary sanctions against Horton because, in the Court’s
view, Horton’s position with respect to the discovery in question was
substantially justified. In opposing HKL’s motion, Horton requested monetary
sanctions against HKL and its counsel in the amount of $4,725.  That request is denied because HKL’s motion
was substantially justified.
 SROGs
 On December
14, 2023, HKL electronically served the SROGs on Horton (Helen Kim Decl., ¶ 2,
Ex. A.)  They consisted of SROG nos. 7, 8
and 9. (Ibid.) On January 17, 2024, Horton timely served verified responses
electronically. (Id., ¶ 4, Ex. C.) HKL moved
for further responses to SROGs nos. 8 and 9. 
HKL acknowledges  that its request
for further responses as to SROG no. 9 is now moot. (See Reply, p. 3.)  That leaves SROG no. 8 at issue.   SROG no. 8 seeks “the names, last known
street addresses, mailing addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers [collectively,
“Contact Information”] for all attorneys with whom YOU co-counseled on a case
(“YOU” refers to Horton Law Firm, APC) from January 1, 2010 to the present.” Initially
Horton objected on the grounds, inter alia, that the interrogatory is
“overly broad” and stated that it “will not respond to this interrogatory.” (HKL
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. C.)  On February 26,
2024, Horton supplemented its response by providing the names and contact information
of its former co-counsels in “the last ten years only.” (Dery Decl., ¶ 14, Ex.
A.) HKL contends that Horton should be ordered to serve a verified further answer
to interrogatory no. 8 without limiting it to the last ten years. (Reply, p.
4.) The Court agrees that Horton’s supplemental answer does not render
interrogatory 8 no. moot. Horton’s supplemental answer neither justifies its
earlier objection that the interrogatory is “overly broad” nor explains the
ten-year limitation it imposed.  The
Court is granting HKL’s Motion as to interrogatory no. 8 and directs Horton to
serve a verified further answer as to all former co-counsels with whom it split
costs.
RFAs
On December
17, 2023, HKL electronically served RFAs nos. 2-40 on Horton. (Kim Decl., ¶ 3,
Ex. B.)  On January 18, 2024, Horton timely
served verified responses to the RFAs electronically. (Id., ¶ 5, Ex. D; Dery
Decl., ¶ 6.) Horton responded with objections to all of the RFAs, along with
responses. (Kim Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. D.)
HKL contends
that Horton’ objections to RFA nos. 5-8, 11-16, 19-40 are improper.  HKL is incorrect.  As to those responses, Horton contends that
no further response is required because all that is required is “a response in
the form of 1) admit; 2) deny; or 3) unable to admit or deny,” citing Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.220.  The
Court agrees with Horton.
HKL contends
that Horton’ responses to the remaining RFAs at issue, nos. 3-4 and 17-18, are
evasive.  The Court finds that Horton’s claimed
inability to admit or deny RFA No. 3 is improper because it also does not state
that Horton made a reasonable inquiry. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220(c).) By
contrast, Horton does state that it made a reasonable inquiry as to RFA no. 4, and
therefore its response that it is unable to admit or deny RFA no. 4 is
proper. 
RFA no. 17
asks Horton to “[a]dmit that YOU never sent Helen Kim Law APC a cost report
listing all costs YOU advanced in the GONZALEZ CASE until after summary
judgment was granted.” RFA no. 18 asks for the same admission as to Helen Kim .
To both RFAs, Horton responded, inter alia, “[a]dmit that a report from Horton’
practice management software was sent to Defendants on November 14, 2019, but
otherwise deny.” HKL argues that Horton’s responses “otherwise denying” nos. 17
and 18 are evasive and that they “fail to address whether November 14, 2019 is
the first time [Horton] sent Defendants a report from Horton’ practice
management software listing all costs.” (Separate Statement, pp. 31-32.)  Horton need not volunteer statements that the
RFAs did not call for.  RFAs nos. 17-18
did not ask Horton when was the first time that costs reports were sent to Helen
Kim Law, APC and Helen Kim.  Accordingly,
Horton’ s responses to RFAs nos. 17 and 18 are not evasive.
In sum, the
Court is granting HKL’s motion as to RFA no. 3, but denying the motion as to remainder
of the RFAs that were the subject of the motion.
  FROG 17.1(b)

On December
17, 2023, HKL electronically served the FROGs on Horton. (HKL Decl., ¶ 3, Ex.
B.) HKL checked box 17.1, which requires disclosure of facts supporting denial
of any RFA served with the interrogatories. (Ibid.)  On January 18, 2024, Horton served its verified
response to form interrogatory 17.1. (Id., ¶ 5, Ex. B; Dery Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
FROG 17.1
asks the following questions: 
 
Is your response to each request for admission served with these
interrogatories an unqualified admission? If not, for each response that is not
an unqualified admission: 
 
(a) state the number of the request; 
(b) state all facts upon which you base your response; 
(c) state the names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who
have knowledge of those facts; and 
(d) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support your
response and state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who
has each DOCUMENT or thing. 
 
(Kim Decl.,
¶ 3, Ex. B.) 
 
HKL  takes issue with Horton’s response to subpart
(b) to the extent it corresponds to RFA Nos. 3-8, 11-40.  In its Separate Statement, HKL left blank “reason
for further response” to form interrogatory 17.1, though in its Motion HKL refers
to “the Chart on pages 28 through 36 of the Separate Statement.” (Separate
Statement, p. 28; Motion, pp. 4-5.)  On
February 26, 2024, Horton supplemented its response. (Dery Decl. ¶ 15, Ex. B.)   The
issue is whether those supplemental responses moot the motion as to FROG no.
17.1(b) as it relates to specific RFAs.
 
Hortons’s supplemental
response to FROG no. 17.1(b) as to RFA nos. 3 and 4 
 
Horton
claimed that it was unable to admit or deny RFAs nos. 3 and 4, which seek
admission that HKL and Kim did not promise to split the work with Horton in the
Gonzalez Case.  In its supplemental
response, Horton states that it bases its inability to admit or deny on the
facts that “Horton are not suing Defendants for attorneys’ fees in the Gonzalez
[C]ase” and that “promise” is undefined. (Dery Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. B.) In the
Court’s view, this supplemental response is deficient and does not render the
Motion moot as to form interrogatory no. 17.1 as it corresponds to RFAs nos. 3
and 4. 
 
 
 
Horton’s supplemental response to FROG no. 17.1(b) as
to RFA nos. 5-8
 
Horton
denied RFAs nos. 5-8.  RFA nos. 5-6 seek
admission that before November 12, 2019, Horton did not discuss with anyone
that Helen Kim Law or Helen Kim promised to split costs 50/50 with Horton
in the Gonzalez Case. RFA nos. 7-8 seek admission that before November 12,
2019, Horton did not discuss with anyone that Helen Kim Law or Helen Kim promised
to split the work 50/50 with Horton in the Gonzalez Case. Horton’s supplemental
response stated that Horton “may have discussed with [Dery and Fernandez]” the
cost-splitting agreement between Horton and Defendants in the Gonzalez Case before
November 12, 2019 and that “[t]here were discussions regarding an equitable
split of work.” (Dery Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. B.) The Court finds this supplemental
response as it corresponds to RFAs nos. 5-8 is sufficient and renders the
motion moot as to those RFAs.
 
Horton’s supplemental
response to FROG no. 17.1(b) as to RFAs nos. 11-14
 
RFAs nos.
11-14 seek admission that there is no document or writing that reflects,
evidences or indicates that Helen Kim Law or Helen Kim promised to split costs
or work with Horton 50/50 in the Gonzalez Case. Horton denied RFA nos. 11-14.  In its supplemental response, Horton exercised
the option to allow an inspection of Exhibits C-X filed in support of Horton’
Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication, referring
to section 2030.230. This supplemental response as it corresponds to RFAs nos.
11-14 is proper and renders the motion moot as to those RFAs. 
 
HORTON’s
supplemental response to FROG no. 17.1(b) as to RFAs nos. 15 and 16
 
RFAs nos. 15
and 16 seek admission that Horton never asked Helen Kim Law or Helen Kim in
2019 to send Horton a list of all costs HKL advanced in the Gonzalez Case. Horton
denied. Horton’s supplemental response states in relevant part, “On July 15,
2019, Flor Dery asked Defendants to send their timekeeping records and
information, which usually includes hours worked and costs incurred, for the
Gonzalez case in preparation for drafting the mediation brief.” (Dery Decl., ¶
5, Ex. B.) This supplemental response as it corresponds to RFA nos. 15 and 16
is sufficient and renders the motion moot as to those RFAs. 
 
Horton’s supplemental
response to FROG no. 17.1(b) as to RFA nos. 17 and 18 
 
As mentioned
above, RFAs nos. 17 and 18 seek admission that Horton never sent Helen Kim Law
and Helen Kim a cost report listing all costs Horton advanced in the Gonzalez
Case until after summary judgment was granted, or November 1, 2019.  Horton admitted that a report from Horton’
practice management software was sent to Defendants on November 14, 2019, but
otherwise denied the RFAs. Horton’s supplemental response reiterates this
qualified admission and states that “Defendants were aware of each cost Horton
advanced in the Gonzalez Case prior to the granting of summary judgment.” That
Defendants allegedly were aware of the costs is not a fact upon which to base
whether Horton sent Defendants a cost report. 
Accordingly, the motion is granted as to RFAs nos. 17 and 18. 
 
Horton’s supplemental
response to FROG no. 17.1(b) as to RFAs nos. 19-27
 
RFAs nos.
19-27 seek admission that Horton never asked Helen Kim Law and Helen Kim  to reimburse Horton for costs until after the
summary judgment was granted in the Gonzalez Case (nos. 19-20); that Horton
never asked HKL to pay certain experts directly for costs in the Gonzalez Case
(nos. 21, 23, 25 and 27); that prior to November 12, 2019 Horton never
disclosed to HKL that those certain experts including Dr. Gupta had billed
certain amounts in costs in the Gonzalez Case (nos. 22, 24 and 26).  Horton denied RFAs nos. 19-27. Horton’s supplemental
response as to these RFAs is deficient except as to no. 22.  As to no. 22, Horton states “Horton and
Defendants discussed [Dr. Gupta’s bills] in July 2019.”  That response is sufficient.  As to RFAs nos. 19-21 and 23-27, Horton’s
response that “Defendants were aware of all costs Horton advanced in the
Gonzalez case prior to the granting of summary judgment” is not a fact upon
which to base Horton’ denial of RFA nos. 19-21 and 23-27. The Motion is moot as
to FROG 17.1 as it corresponds to RFAs no. 22 but granted as to FROG 17.1(b) as
it corresponds to RFAs nos. 19-21 and 23-27.
 
HORTON’s
supplemental response to form interrogatory  no. 17.1(b) as to RFA nos. 28 and 29
 
Horton’s supplemental
response as to RFAs nos. 28 and 29 does not provide facts supporting Horton’
denial that it did not ask Helen Kim Law or Helen Kim for a $1,650
reimbursement in costs Horton paid to Steven Olswang in the Gonzalez Case.  The motion is granted as to FROG no. 17.1(b)
as it relates to RFAs nos. 28 and 29.
 
Horton’s supplemental
response to FROG no. 17.1(b) as to RFAs nos. 30-37
 
Horton’s supplemental
response as to RFs  nos. 30-37 does not
provide facts supporting Horton’ denial that it never disclosed to HKL how much
Dr. Steiner, Dr. Miller, Larimer Consulting and Renuka Jain had each billed in
costs and that Horton never asked HKL to pay each of these experts/consultants
directly for those costs in the Gonzalez Case. Defendants being on notice of
costs is irrelevant.   The motion is
granted as to FROG no. 17.1(b) as it relates to RFAs nos. 30-37.
 
 
Horton’s
supplemental response to form interrogatory 17.1(b) as to RFAs no. 38
 
Horton’s supplemental
response as to RFAs no. 38 states that “Laura Horton specifically asked Helen Kim
to pay for [Dr. Chiang]’s bill, but Helen Kim refused to pay more than $5,000 .
. .” This response is sufficient.  The
motion is denied as to FROG 17.1(b) as it relates to RFA no. 38.
 
Horton’s s
supplemental response to FROG 17.1(b) as to RFA no. 39
 
Horton’s supplemental
response as to RFA no. 39 states: “Horton did not need to ask Defendants to pay
for the deposition transcripts and videotaped depositions in the Gonzalez case
because Defendants had agreed to and were supposed to have already paid it.”
This fact does support Horton’ denial that Horton never asked HKL to pay
Veritext directly for the deposition transcripts and videotaped depositions in
the Gonzalez Case. The motion as to FROG 17.1 as it relates to RFA no. 39 is granted.
 
Horton’s  supplemental response to FROG 17.1(b) as to
RFA no. 40
 
Horton’s supplemental
response as to RFA no. 40 states, “Horton notified Defendants of the total
costs in the mediation brief prior to the mediation in the Gonzalez case,:
which took place on July 23, 2019.  This
supports Horton’ denial that it never disclosed to HKL the total costs it incurred
in the Gonzalez Case prior to November 12, 2019.  The motion as to FROG 17.1 as it relates to
RFA no. 40 is denied.
