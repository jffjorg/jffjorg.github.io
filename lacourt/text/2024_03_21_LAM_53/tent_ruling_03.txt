The court notes that Plaintiff filed an untimely opposition on March 15, 2024,
which may indicate that Defendants did serve Plaintiff with this motion.  The court further notes that the proof of
service attached to Defendants’ request for judicial notice is signed, but that
proof of service establishes only service of the request for judicial notice on
Plaintiff, and not the motion.  (Request
for Judicial Notice, p. 23.)
