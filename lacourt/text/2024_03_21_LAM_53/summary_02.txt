And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, without prejudice. The defendants failed to serve the plaintiff with the motion and provide sufficient notice of the hearing. The proof of service attached to the motion is defective and electronic service on February 28, 2024 did not provide sufficient notice. The court finds that the defendants must cure these procedural defects and refile their motion. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
