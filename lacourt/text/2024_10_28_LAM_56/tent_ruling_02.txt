BACKGROUND
             This action arises from an alleged agreement
between Plaintiffs and Defendants Turning Point Network LLC (“TPN”), Lisa
Perona Reyes (“Reyes”), Tresor Tulanda (“Tulanda”) and Kevin Lewis (“Lewis”)
(collectively, “Defendants”).  On February

following causes of action: (1) declaratory relief; (2) damages for breach of
partnership contract; and (3) fraud.
 
On July 29, 2024 and August 5, 2024,

Specified in Request for Admissions set no. 1 Admitted and Conclusively Established

Set no. 1 (“Tulanda SIs Motion”) (collectively,
“Discovery Motions”).
 
            No

DISCUSSION
A
party to whom interrogatories, demands for production, or requests for
admission have been propounded shall respond in writing under oath separately
to each interrogatory or demand by providing an answer or a statement of
compliance, or by providing an objection.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.210, 2031.210, &
2033.210.)  Responses should be served
within 30 days of service.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.260, 2031.260, & 2033.250.)  A motion to compel responses may be brought
where a responding party fails to timely respond to written discovery, and the
party who failed to serve timely responses waives any objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300, &
2033.280.)¿¿ If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the requesting party can move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
request be deemed admitted.  (CCP §
2033.280(b).) 
¿ 
Unsuccessfully
making or opposing a motion to compel responses, interrogatories, requests for
production of documents, or requests for admission can subject a party to
sanctions unless that party acted with substantial justification¿or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanctions¿unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,¿subd. (c), 2031.300,¿subd.
(c).)¿¿¿ It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney,
or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated a motion for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents and
the truth of any matters specified in the request as deemed admitted.  (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a) provides that “[t]he court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.”
 
Here, on
June 24, 2024, Plaintiffs served TPN with Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One (“RFPs”), Requests for Admission, Set One (“RFAs”), Form
Interrogatories, Set One (“FIs”) and Special Interrogatories, Set One (“SIs”),
and also served Lewis, Reyes and Tulanda with SIs.  (Declarations of Freddie Fletcher in support
of the RFPs Motion, RFAs Motion, FIs Motion, TPN SIs Motion, Lewis SIs Motion,
Reyes SIs Motion and Tulanda SIs Motion.) 
Responses to these discovery requests were due 32 days later, on or before
Friday, July 26, 2024, but Defendants failed to serve any response by the deadline.  (Id.)
 
Plaintiffs now move for an order compelling
responses to the discovery requests, without objections, and deeming the truth of the matters and the
genuineness of documents specified in the RFAs deemed admitted.  TPN is further ordered that in its responses
to the RFPs, the documents responsive to each request are to be identified by
Bates numbers.  
 
Plaintiffs
also request monetary sanctions, with Plaintiffs’
counsel stating that his hourly billing rate in this matter is $350 per hour
and that he had spent two hours preparing each of the Discovery Motions. (Id.)  The Court exercises its discretion and limits
sanctions to the amount of $2,450 representing one hour spent for each of the
seven Discovery Motions at $350/per hour, plus $420 filing fee for all of the seven
Discovery Motions, for a total amount of $2,870. 
 
RULING
Accordingly, the Motions are GRANTED.  
 
TPN is ORDERED
to serve complete, Code-compliant and verified responses to the SIs, FIs and
RFPs served upon it, without objections, and to produce all responsive
documents to the RFPs, within 20 days of this Order.  The truth of the matters and the genuineness
of documents specified in the RFAs are deemed admitted.  
 
Lewis,
Reyes, and Tulanda are ORDERED to serve complete, Code-compliant and verified
responses to the respective SIs served upon them, without objections, within 20
days of this Order.
 
Defendants are further ORDERED to pay Plaintiffs $2,870
in monetary sanctions, jointly and severally, within 20 days of this Order.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 28th day of October 2024
