Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the Plaintiff's Motion to Disqualify the Honorable James L. Crandall (Ret.) as judicial referee in this case. The Plaintiff alleges that Judge Crandall has shown a bias towards the Defendants and their counsel, and that his conduct has created a reasonable doubt of impartiality. The Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to provide evidence to support a valid objection to Judge Crandall as judicial referee based on the grounds identified in Code of Civil Procedure section 641. Additionally, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's belief that Judge Crandall is biased is unsupported. Therefore, the Motion is DENIED. The Plaintiff is ordered to pay the appropriate fees to Judge Crandall as agreed to by the parties.
