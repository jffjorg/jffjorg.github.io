**Significant Statements:** "Unsuccessfully making or opposing a motion to compel responses, interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for admission can subject a party to sanctions unless that party acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanctions unjust." "It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated a motion for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the request as deemed admitted."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motions to compel responses to discovery requests and to deem the truth of matters and genuineness of documents specified in request for admissions admitted. Turning Point Network LLC, Lisa Perona Reyes, Tresor Tulanda, and Kevin Lewis are ordered to serve complete and verified responses to the discovery requests without objections and to produce all responsive documents. The judge also ordered the defendants to pay $2,870 in monetary sanctions to the plaintiffs. The judge's ruling is based on the defendants' failure to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, which necessitated the filing of motions to compel responses.
