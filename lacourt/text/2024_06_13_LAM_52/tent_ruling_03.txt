 Case Number:  24STCV04836    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendants SurrogateFirst, Lina Li,
and Jeff Hu’s Demurrer and Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint 
            Defendants SurrogateFirst, Lina Li,
and Jeff Hu demur to all four causes of action alleged in the complaint by plaintiff
Mingxi Zhu.  Defendants further move to
strike several portions of the complaint regarding punitive damages and
attorney fees.  
Plaintiff did not oppose the demurrer or motion to strike.  Instead, plaintiff attempted to file a first
amended complaint on June 3.  “A party
may amend its pleading once without leave of the court … after a demurrer or
motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard
if the amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing
an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike.”  (CCP § 472(a).)  Plaintiff had the right to file a first
amended complaint by May 31, nine court days before this hearing on June
13.  (CCP § 1005(b).)  
By submitting an amended pleading, plaintiff “manifested
implied consent to” sustaining the demurrer and granting the motion to strike
with leave to amend.  (Sharifpour v.
Le (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 730, 734.) 
Permitting plaintiff to file the
first amended complaint serves the interests of justice and judicial
economy.  Plaintiff missed the deadline
to file it by one court day.  
Disposition
            Defendants
SurrogateFirst, Lina Li, and Jeff Hu’s demurrer to plaintiff Mingxi Zhu’s
complaint is sustained with 15 days’ leave to
amend.  Defendants’ motion to strike
portions of the complaint is granted with 15 days’ leave to
amend.
