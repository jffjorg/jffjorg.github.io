Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained defendants SurrogateFirst, Lina Li, and Jeff Hu's demurrer to plaintiff Mingxi Zhu's complaint with 15 days' leave to amend. The judge has also granted the defendants' motion to strike portions of the complaint with 15 days' leave to amend. The plaintiff did not oppose the demurrer or motion to strike, and instead attempted to file a first amended complaint, which was filed one day late. The judge has allowed the plaintiff to file the amended complaint, considering it a manifestation of implied consent to sustain the demurrer and grant the motion to strike.
