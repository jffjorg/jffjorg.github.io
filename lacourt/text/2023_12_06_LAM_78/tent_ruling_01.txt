FACTUAL BACKGROUNDThis is an action for negligence, negligent hiring, negligent failure to warn, sexual battery, and sexual harassment. Plaintiff Brandon David alleges he suffered physical and sexual abuse committed by Doe 5, Brandon David’s father, between approximately 1987 and 1991 at their home in Anaheim, California, and later North Hills, California. (David Compl., ¶¶56-57.) Plaintiff was raised as a member of the Fellowship (“TLWF”), a church founded by John Robert Stevens in 1951. (Compl., ¶21.) Plaintiff’s family attended an affiliated church in Anaheim California until church leadership instructed the family to move to Doe 3 Local Church. (Compl., ¶53.) Doe 5’s marriage with Plaintiff’s mother was arranged by Stevens. (Compl., ¶52.) Plaintiff’s parents fought often and Doe 5 would regularly perpetrate domestic violence upon Plaintiff’s mother. (Compl., ¶54.) Doe 5 also sexually abused Plaintiff from when he was 3 years old until he was about 6 or 7. (Compl., ¶57.) Plaintiff is informed that pastors at both the Anaheim congregation and Doe 3 Local Church knew or had reason to know that Doe 5 was sexually abusing Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶59.) Doe 5 repeatedly informed pastors at Doe 3 Local Church that he had thoughts and impulses concerning sexually abusing Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶60.) The pastors then informed other affiliated churches and members of Doe Supervisory Organization. (Compl., ¶61.) When Plaintiff was five, Doe 5 confessed that he had been sexually abusing Plaintiff to pastors at Doe 3 Local Church who reported him to Doe 1 Supervisory Organization. (Compl., ¶¶62-63.) The pastors told Plaintiff and his mother to stay quiet and not to inform police. (Compl., ¶64.) Defendants failed to investigate Doe 5’s confession and instead promoted Doe 5 and allowed him to maintain a position of leadership at Doe 3 and another affiliated church. (Compl., ¶65.) Doe 5 was also made the head of the youth program. (Compl., ¶65.) Plaintiff’s mother informed other congregants of Doe 5’s conduct and Plaintiff’s school ultimately reported the abuse to law enforcement. (Compl., ¶66.) Plaintiff’s mother was kicked out of the church and divorced Doe 5. (Compl., ¶66.) Plaintiff was afraid to press charges against Doe 5 and continued to visit him after his parents’ divorce. (Compl., ¶68.) After Doe 5’s confession, he stopped sexually abusing Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶69.) Members of Doe 1 Supervisory Organization made inappropriate sexual comments about Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶70.) Plaintiff was also sexually abused by another member of Doe 3 Local Church on one occasion when the member fondled Plaintiff’s genitals and encouraged Plaintiff to engage in sexual conduct with other minors. (Compl., ¶71.) II. PROCEDURAL HISTORYOn July 10, 2019, Plaintiff Brandon David filed his Complaint against Defendants Doe 1 Supervisory Company, Doe 2 Family Ministry Corporation, Doe 3 Local Church, Doe 4 Religious Leader, and Doe 5.On June 22, 2023, Defendant Doe 3 Local Church filed a motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication.  On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to seal documents submitted in support of his opposition to Doe 3 Local Church’s motion for summary judgment.III. LEGAL STANDARDPursuant to California Rules of Court Rule 2.550 the court may seal a record “only if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d).) In Hinshaw v. Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 233, 242, the court stated that private, non-governmental parties have a privacy interest in maintaining confidentiality of settlement agreements that contain personal financial information. The sealing of court documents is not permitted solely based on the agreement of the parties "without a specific showing of serious injury." (Huffy Corp. v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 97, 106.) Regarding the serious injury, "[b]road allegations of harm, bereft of specific examples or articulated reasoning, are insufficient." (Huffy, supra, 112 Cal.App.4th at p. 106) (quoting In re Cendant Corp. (3d Cir. 2001) 260 F.3d 183, 194.) IV. DISCUSSIONPlaintiff moves to seal the following:A. Exhibit 6a – Deposition excerpts of Shannon Shaw B. Exhibit 11 – Deposition excerpts of Brandon David C. Exhibit 68a – Deposition excerpts of Shalom Abrahamson-Caples D. Exhibit 61 – Deposition of Lauren Beckman E. Exhibit 17 – Holbrook Incident Report F. Exhibit 18 – Centers of Learning Student Report G. Exhibit 22 – CLW Member List H. Exhibit 26 – Centers of Learning School Log Summary I. Exhibit 27 – B-4 2000 J. Exhibit 29 – Centers of Learning Shepherds Log K. Exhibit 36 – Centers of Learning Student List 1989/1990 L. Exhibit 37 – 1990 Children Activities Report M. Exhibit 38 – Centers of Learning Student List 1991/1992 N. Exhibit 39 – 1992 Special Meeting Minutes O. Exhibit 40 – Security Keys by Recipient P. Exhibit 41 – Security Keys Q. Exhibit 42 – D. David Workflow - HVACPlaintiff’s counsel testifies that these exhibits contain information concerning the sexual assault of minor sexual abuse victims and were marked confidential by the defense during discovery. (Radwick Decl., ¶3.) There are no less restrictive means of achieving the victims’ overriding privacy interest than lodging the documents under seal. (Id., ¶5.)Because the records contain the names of individuals who were victims of childhood sexual abuse, the Court finds that Plaintiff sufficiently establishes that the victims’ interest in privacy overrides the public’s interest in accessing the records. The proposed relief is narrowly tailored because the parties marked specific exhibits as confidential, rather than seeking to seal the whole record. Plaintiff’s motion is granted.DATED: December 6, 2023_________________________                                                                      Hon.
