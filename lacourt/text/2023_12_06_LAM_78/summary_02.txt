Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion for reconsideration of the October 29, 2021 order compelling arbitration. The Court finds that the motion is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a). However, the Court reconsiders the motion to compel arbitration under its own authority, in light of the change in law in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 89 Cal. App. 5th 1324. The Court elects to follow the Ochoa Court's limited interpretation of the arbitration agreement and denies the motion to compel arbitration. The matter is remanded to the superior court for all further proceedings.
