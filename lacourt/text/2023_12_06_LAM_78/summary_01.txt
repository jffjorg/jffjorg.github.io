Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to seal certain exhibits that contain information about sexual abuse victims. The plaintiff argues that the victims' privacy interest in maintaining confidentiality of their abuse outweighs the public's interest in accessing the records. The judge finds that the victims' interest in privacy overrides the public's interest and that the proposed relief is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The judge also notes that there are no less restrictive means of achieving the victims' privacy interest than lodging the documents under seal.
