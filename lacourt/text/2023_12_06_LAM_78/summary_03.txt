Summary:

The tentative ruling addresses Defendant General Motors, LLC's demurrer to the first amended complaint and motion to strike punitive damages. The Court finds that the fifth cause of action for fraudulent inducement - concealment is plead with the required specificity and overrules the demurrer. However, the Court grants the motion to strike the demand for punitive damages because the FAC fails to meet the requirements of alleging punitive damages against a corporation. The Court also finds that the FAC fails to state facts sufficient to support a demand for punitive damages.
