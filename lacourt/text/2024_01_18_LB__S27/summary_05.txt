And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which has been pending since September 7, 2022. The plaintiffs, Araceli Gutierrez and Jesus Galindo, filed a lawsuit against the defendants, Pacific Care Nursing Center, Inc., Janet Mandelbaum, and Brenda Mandelbaum, alleging dependent adult abuse and related claims. The defendants filed demurrers to the plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, and a hearing was scheduled for December 5, 2023.

At the hearing, the plaintiffs failed to appear, and the court adopted its tentative ruling as its final ruling. The court sustained both demurrers without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs cannot refile their claims. The court also set a future hearing date for January 18, 2024, to dismiss the case for failure to prosecute.

The court's tentative ruling notes that the plaintiffs have not dismissed their claims or filed opposition to the demurrers, and it appears that they have abandoned their case against the demurring defendants. The court orders the demurring defendants to give notice of the dismissal, and it sets a deadline for parties who intend to submit on the tentative to email the court.
