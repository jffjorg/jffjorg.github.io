And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Navy Federal Credit Union v. Maria Stoch. The plaintiff, Navy Federal Credit Union, filed a complaint against the defendant, Maria Stoch, on May 12, 2023, alleging that she owes the credit union $76,135.90. The defendant filed an answer to the complaint on July 5, 2023, and included counterclaims for negligence and fraud. The court advised the defendant to file a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, which she did on October 12, 2023. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that it is not timely and that the proposed cross-complaint is fatally defective as a matter of law. The court has granted the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, finding that the defendant's proposed cross-complaint meets the requirements of CCP §426.30 and that the court must grant the motion unless it finds the moving party is acting in bad faith. The defendant is ordered to file a separate copy of her cross-complaint within five days, and the plaintiff is ordered to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter.
