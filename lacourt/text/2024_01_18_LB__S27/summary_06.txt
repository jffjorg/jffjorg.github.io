And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Pat Amaka Levison, against the defendants, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook-Meta. The plaintiff's amended complaint was found to be uncertain and failed to state a cause of action. The court had previously given the plaintiff leave to amend, but the recent attempt was deemed unsuccessful due to the plaintiff's failure to articulate a cause of action against the defendants. The court has denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend and has ordered the defendants to give notice. The parties are advised to submit on the tentative or make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on January 18, 2024.
