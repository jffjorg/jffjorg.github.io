Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions for summary judgment filed by Dr. Levine, Dr. Javahery, and Dr. Attinasi. The moving defendants have met their initial burden to show entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. The plaintiff, however, has failed to file proper opposition to any motion, and the Court will not consider the opposition papers that were submitted. The Court also finds that the Declaration of Jill Glenn, submitted in opposition to the motion, is insufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact. Therefore, the motions are granted, and the moving defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
