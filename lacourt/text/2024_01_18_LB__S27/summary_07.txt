Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The judge is inclined to grant the motion, which seeks to streamline the proceedings by clarifying that the plaintiff is only proceeding against the Scotts. The judge is concerned about service on the Scotts, as there is no proof of service of the moving papers or notice of the continued hearing date on the Scotts. The judge will grant the motion and order the plaintiff to file a separate copy of the Second Amended Complaint within ten days, and will order the Scotts to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter. The judge also wishes to hear from the Scotts concerning any reason they believe leave to amend should be denied. If all parties submit on the tentative ruling, the effect will be an order granting the motion and ordering the parties to take specified actions.
