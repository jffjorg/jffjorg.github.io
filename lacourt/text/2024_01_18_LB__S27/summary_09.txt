English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses in a lemon law case involving General Motors. The court has seen a significant increase in similar motions in recent months and is frustrated by the failure of attorneys to meet and confer in good faith to resolve these issues. The judge has ruled on discovery motions in similar cases and believes that the attorneys can easily resolve the issues on these motions. The court is ordering the parties to meet and confer with the court's prior rulings in mind and to file a joint statement of disputed discovery items. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer and making any arguments against the imposition of sanctions. The hearing on this motion has been continued to March 19, 2024.
