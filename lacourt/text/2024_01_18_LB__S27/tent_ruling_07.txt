 Case Number:  22LBCV00839    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  S27  
1.     Detailed
History of Case
On 11/22/22, Plaintiff, Shwe Shyan
Hwee, in pro per, filed a complaint against Defendant, Judith Vela for breach
of contract.  On 2/21/23, after retaining
an attorney, Plaintiff filed her operative First Amended Complaint, which
includes various landlord-tenant claims against Defendants, Judith Vela, Juan
Villagomez, Maria Villagomez, Eleazar Vela, Guadalupe Vela, Jose Rivera, William
H. Scott, and Dorita Scott.  
 
On 5/17/23, Plaintiff filed proof
of service of the summons, FAC, and related papers on Dorita Scott, William
Scott, and Judith Vela.  On 6/02/23, Judith
Vela, in pro per, filed an answer to the FAC. 
On 7/06/23, Vela filed a substitution of attorney, pursuant to which
Leonard Kirschen commenced representing Vela. 

On 6/15/23, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s former attorney’s motion to be relieved as counsel.  On 7/17/23, Plaintiff, in pro per, filed a request
for dismissal of her complaint against Judith Vela, Jose Rivera, Eleazar Vela,
Guadalupe Vela, Juan Villagomez, and Maria Villagomez.  
 
On 10/30/23, Plaintiff filed a substitution
of attorney, pursuant to which J. Owen Murrin commenced representing
Plaintiff.  On 10/31/23, Plaintiff,
through Murrin, filed a motion for leave to file a Second Amended
Complaint.  Plaintiff scheduled the motion
for hearing on 2/13/24.  Plaintiff filed
proof of service of the moving papers on Judith Vela only.  This is true despite the fact that Plaintiff
had previously dismissed Judith Vela as a defendant in the case on
7/17/23.  
 
On 11/02/23, Plaintiff filed
another request for dismissal.  The
request was filed through Murrin, and seeks dismissal of the same defendants
who were already dismissed on 7/17/23. 
The Court did not enter the dismissal, as it was redundant of the one
previously filed.
 
On 11/03/23, the Court advanced the
2/13/24 hearing and continued it to 1/18/24. 
The Court ordered Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.  To date, Plaintiff has not given notice of the
ruling.  That said, as of 11/03/23, no
active defendant in the action had filed any responsive pleading, and therefore
it does not appear notice was required. 
CCP §1014.  
 
On 11/21/23, Plaintiff filed
declarations of diligence re: attempts to serve William and Dorita Scott.  The declarations indicate the Scotts cannot
be served despite diligent attempts to serve them.  The filings are curious, both because proof
of service on the Scotts was filed on 5/17/23 and also because the Scotts, on
12/14/23, filed a Case Management Statement. 

 
2.     Case
Management Statement
As noted above, the Scotts filed a
Case Management Statement on 12/14/23, which relates to a Case Management
Conference they indicate is scheduled for 1/18/24.  Defendants filed the document through their
attorneys, Kenneth O. Taylor and Ryan Sharifi of the law firm Resnick &
Louis.  
 
The Court does not have a CMC
scheduled for 1/18/24.  The Court has
only a motion for leave to file Second Amended Complaint on calendar on 1/18/24,
a Final Status Conference on calendar on 6/28/24, and a jury trial on calendar
on 7/01/24.  
 
It appears, however, that
Defendants somehow understand there are proceedings on calendar on
1/18/24.  The Court asks Counsel to
appear on 1/18/24 (unless submitting on the tentative, as detailed below) so it
can inquire with Counsel about the motion for leave to amend, which will be
discussed below.  
 
3.     Motion
for Leave to Amend
Plaintiff seeks leave to file a
Second Amended Complaint.  The motion seeks
to streamline the proceedings by clarifying that Plaintiff is only proceeding
against the Scotts, by eliminating any facts and claims relating to the dismissed
defendants, and by clarifying the allegations against the Scotts.  
 
The motion appears to be well-taken
and the Court is inclined to grant it.  The
Court’s only concern is service on the Scotts, as there is no proof of service
of the moving papers or the notice of continued hearing date on the Scotts.  However, as noted above, the Scotts had not yet
appeared in the action when Plaintiff filed the motion or when the Court
continued the hearing on the motion, and therefore they were not entitled to
notice of the hearing.
 
The Court, at the hearing, wishes
to hear from the Scotts concerning any reason they believe leave to amend should
be denied, and any concerns they may have about service of the moving
papers.  Assuming the Court is satisfied,
the Court will grant the motion and will order Plaintiff to file a separate copy
of the SAC within ten days.  The Scotts
will be ordered to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time
thereafter.  
 
4.     Effect
of Submitting on the Tentative
If all parties submit on the tentative
ruling, the effect will be an order granting the motion, ordering Plaintiff to
file a separate copy of the SAC within ten days, and ordering the Scotts to
file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter.  Plaintiff will be ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as
directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.  If a party submits on the tentative, the
party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party
submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the tentative, the
party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on this
matter.
