And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one to appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL) and another to compel further responses to requests for admissions (RFAs). The defendant, David and Jessica Quackenbush, filed the motions, while the plaintiff, Duk Ha Kim, opposed the motions. The judge granted the motion to appoint a GAL, finding that the plaintiff is an incompetent person and needs a representative to act on his behalf.

Regarding the motion to compel further responses to RFAs, the judge found that the plaintiff's responses were incomplete and lacked sufficient information. The judge ruled that the plaintiff must serve code-compliant responses without objections within 10 days. Additionally, the judge granted the defendant's request for sanctions, ordering the plaintiff and his attorney to pay $2769 within 20 days. The judge also ordered the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
