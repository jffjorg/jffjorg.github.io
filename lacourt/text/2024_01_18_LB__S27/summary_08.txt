Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Todd LeBerge, an expert fire marshal, in connection with the City's summary judgment motion. The Plaintiff had argued that LeBerge's expert opinion lacked proper foundation and that a deposition was necessary to impeach his testimony. The City, on the other hand, argued that the motion was premature and that the Plaintiff's objections could be raised through evidentiary objections and the submission of contrary factual evidence. The Judge held that the Plaintiff failed to show a need for an expert deposition prior to the hearing on the summary judgment motion and that the disputes raised by the Plaintiff were factual and did not go to the foundation of LeBerge's expert opinion.
