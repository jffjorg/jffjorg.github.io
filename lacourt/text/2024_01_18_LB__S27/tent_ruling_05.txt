 Case Number:  22LBCV00467    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiffs, Araceli Gutierrez, by
and through her successor-in-interest, Jesus Galindo, as well as Jesus Galindo
and Ezequiel Galindo in their individual capacities, filed this action against
Defendants, Pacific Care Nursing Center, Inc., et al. for dependent adult abuse
and related claims.  Plaintiffs’
operative complaint is their First Amended Complaint, which they filed on
1/27/23.  
 
2.     12/05/23
Hearing on Demurrer
On 5/17/23, Defendant, Janet
Mandelbaum filed a demurrer to the FAC, setting it for hearing on 12/05/23.  On 9/13/23, Defendant, Brenda Mandelbaum
filed a demurrer to the FAC, setting it for hearing on 2/06/24.  Any opposition to the 12/05/23 demurrer was
due on or before 11/20/23.  
Prior to the 12/05/23 hearing, the Court
issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on the 12/05/23 demurrer to
1/18/24, to be heard concurrently with Brenda Mandelbaum’s demurrer.  The Court’s tentative ruling stated, in
pertinent part:
This case has been pending since
9/07/22.  There is no trial date or Case
Management Conference date on calendar.  The
Court wishes to move along the proceedings in a timely manner.  
 
The hearing on the 12/05/23
demurrer is continued to Thursday, 1/18/24 at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27.  The hearing on the 2/06/24 demurrer is
advanced to today’s date and continued to 1/18/24 at 8:30 a.m.  The Court also sets a Case Management
Conference and Trial Setting Conference for 1/18/24 at the same time.  
 
If Plaintiff does not wish to
substantively oppose the demurrers, she must dismiss her claims against the
demurring defendants at least nine court days prior to the continued hearing
date.  If she does wish to pursue her
claims, she must file timely substantive opposition to the demurrers.  
 
Plaintiff failed to appear at the 12/05/23
hearing.  The Court ultimately adopted
its tentative ruling as its final ruling.
 
3.     Current
Hearing on Demurrers
To date, Plaintiff has not
dismissed her claims and has not filed opposition to either demurrer.  It appears Plaintiff has abandoned her case
against the demurring defendants.  The Court
therefore sustains both demurrers without leave to amend.  
 
4.     Future
Hearing Date
The court will dismiss the case for
failure to prosecute and it is without prejudice.
Demurring Defendants are ordered to
give notice.
