Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge, Upinder S. Kalra, has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's prior ruling granting the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff, Ana Gonzalez, is seeking to reconsider the court's prior ruling based on two summary writ denials by the Court of Appeal in separate cases. The Judge has held that the denial of a writ petition does not establish law of the case unless the denial is accompanied by a written opinion, and that the two summary writ denials are not binding on this case. The Judge has also noted that the court is unaware of any authority implicating denial of a writ petition in a separate case as binding on another case. As such, the Judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
