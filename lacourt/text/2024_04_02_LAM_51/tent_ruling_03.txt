STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On August 12,
2021, Plaintiffs James D. Healy and Catherine Shultz (Plaintiffs) filed a
Complaint against Defendant Certified Pool Construction, Inc. (Defendant) with
four causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Breach of Implied Warranty, and
(4) Negligence.
 
According to the
Complaint, the parties contracted for Defendant to construct a swimming pool,
had substantially completed the project, but had construction issues and
undisclosed additional costs. Plaintiffs allege that as time went on,
additional critical construction flaws manifested. 
 
On October 12,
2022, Defendant filed an Answer.
 
On November 14,
2023, the parties stipulated to continue trial.
 
On January 2,
2024, Counsel for Defendant filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel.
As of March 27, 2024, there is no opposition filed.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other.   (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284, subd.
(b).)  An attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts between the
attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the representation. 
(See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).)  “The determination whether
to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion)
(Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite
forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in
the case.  (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(d).)  The court may delay
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.  (Cal.
Rules of Court 3.1362(e).) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Counsel Joseph S. Park (Counsel) moves with withdraw as
counsel of record for Defendant Certified Pool Construction, Inc.
 
In the Declaration of Support of Attorney’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel, Counsel indicates Client breached its contract for
services with Counsel and has been unable or unwilling to cure the breach which
has irreparably damaged the attorney-client relationship. Additionally, on the
Declaration, it indicates that Counsel has confirmed Defendant’s last known
address within the last 30 days by email communication with Client and looking
up Client on the California Contractor’s Board website. 
 
Counsel has provided all the required documents under
California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362. The Proof of Service attached to the
motion indicates that Plaintiffs and Defendant have been served, via mail and
email. However, the Proof of Service is addressed to the Client as a
corporation, not addressed to an individual authorized to accept service, such
as an agent of process, corporate officer, or authorized represtentative.
 
Conclusion: 
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1. 
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is CONTINUED to May 3, 2024, at 9:00
a.m.
2. 
Counsel to provide proof of service indicating service on an individual
authorized to accept service on behalf of Client.
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
