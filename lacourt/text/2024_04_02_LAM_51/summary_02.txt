And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case. The plaintiff has asked the court to reconsider an earlier order granting the defendant's motion to quash, citing "new law" and a "change in the law". However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has provided no authority or analysis to support these claims. The judge also declines to consider other arguments made by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has requested judicial notice of the Supreme Court's denial of the defendant's writ petition, but failed to comply with court rules. The judge will not consider unreported authority and will not apply the law of the adjacent case doctrine. The judge will make a final ruling after considering further arguments from the parties.
