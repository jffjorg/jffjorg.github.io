Plaintiff cites authority for how the court should treat new law but provides
no authority, or analysis, that the denied writs are “’new law’ entitling
Plaintiff to seek reconsideration of the court’s order granting Cosentino’s
motion to quash.” (Mot. 5:13-15.) The same applies to Plaintiff’s conclusion
that the writ denials constitute “a change in the law.” (Mot. 6:9-14.)

The court declines to develop those other arguments at this time.
 


[3]
The Kowis Court also discussed the
law of the case doctrine. (Kowis, supra,
at p. 893.) Here, however, Plaintiff asks this court to apply a law of the adjacent case doctrine.

What is more, the court disregards unreported authority. (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 8.1115.) To the extent Plaintiff requests judicial notice of the Supreme
Court’s denial of Cosentino’s writ petition, Plaintiff failed to comply with
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(l).
Additionally, Plaintiff concedes that it would not be precedential. (Supp.
Memorandum 4:13-15.)
