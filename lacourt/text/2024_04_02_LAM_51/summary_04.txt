And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Lemonade Holdings, LLC (Lemonade) to serve the Summons and Cross-Complaint upon Hey Jackpot, LLC via the California Secretary of State. The motion was filed by Lemonade as a cross-complainant in a lawsuit against Jackie Subeck, Hey Jackpot, LLC, and others. The lawsuit stems from a dispute over a purchase agreement and consulting agreement. The judge found that Lemonade had not demonstrated reasonable diligence in attempting to personally serve the registered agent of Hey Jackpot, LLC, Jackie Subeck, and therefore the motion was denied without prejudice. The judge noted that Lemonade had attempted to personally serve Subeck at the address provided on Jackpot's Statement of Information, but had not attempted to serve by mail with a notice and acknowledgment of receipt as required by law.
