**Analysis**

* Motion to Strike: The Court will deny the motion to strike as moot since the demurrer is sustained.

**Leave to Amend**

* Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden to show how the complaint could be amended to state a cause of action.
* The additional allegations attached to the original complaint do not assist the Court in determining what causes of action Plaintiff is attempting to allege against Defendant.

**Conclusion and Order**

* The Court sustains Defendant's Demurrer to Plaintiff's Complaint without leave to amend.
* The Court denies Defendant's motion to strike as moot.
* Defendant shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.

**Significant Statements**

* "It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint." (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)
* "Determining whether the complaint is sufficient as against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if one consideration of all the facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged." (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
* "A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the pleading is so bad that the responding party cannot reasonably respond - i.e., he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what claims are directed against him or her." (Khoury v. Maly's of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
