Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to dismiss and a motion to strike in a lawsuit involving a tenant (Plaintiff Maureen Minehart) and her landlord (Defendants Kord Enterprises II, Lee Summers, and Ronak Kordestani). The lawsuit alleges that the landlord failed to maintain the property, leading to water intrusion and cockroach infestations. The court has overruled the defendants' demurrers to the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action (negligence, nuisance, and breach of statute), but sustained their demurrers to the seventh and eighth causes of action (intentional misrepresentation and constructive eviction). The court also denied the defendants' motion to strike references to and requests for punitive damages.
