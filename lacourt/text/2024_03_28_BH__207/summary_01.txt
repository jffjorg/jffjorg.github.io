And here is the summary in English text:

The judge grants Blue Shield's unopposed motion to seal portions of Exhibits 3, 4, and 35 containing confidential and proprietary payment methodology and fee schedule information. Blue Shield seeks to protect its confidential and proprietary information, which is not required to be disclosed by law. The judge finds that Blue Shield's interest in protecting its information overrides the public's right of access to that information and supports sealing the record. The motion is granted, and Blue Shield is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling and provide proof of service of the same.
