I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On November 5, 2023,
Plaintiff, DSG International, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendant, General Motors, LLC, and DOES 1 through 50. The Complaint alleges
causes of action for: (1) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2 (d); (2)
Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code section
1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of Express Warranty – Civil Code section 1791.2(a),
1794; and (5) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability – Civil Code
section 1791.1, section 1794. 
 
This action has since settled
in favor of Plaintiff who obtained a $159,115.34 settlement including: (1) GM
buying back the vehicle for the full amount provided by law ($70,048.55); (2)
GM paying Plaintiff civil penalty damages ($56,951.45); and (3) GM having to
pay Plaintiff prejudgment interest ($32,115.34). 
 
Now, Plaintiff states the
only issue left for this court to decide is whether the $53,989.50 in
attorney’s fees are reasonable under the circumstances. Thus, Plaintiff has
filed this Motion for Attorney’s Fees. Defendant GM has also filed a Motion to
Tax Costs.

III. ANALYSIS¿ 
¿ 
A.   
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees 
 
Here, Plaintiff asks for
attorney’s fees of $53,989.50 and submits the declaration of its counsel, Joshua
D. Fennell (“Fennell Decl.”) in support of its motion. Per Fennell’s declaration,
the firm took Plaintiff’s case on a contingency bases, and thus, the fees
incurred in litigation were advanced by the firm and recovery of the fees
incurred was contingent upon a successful resolution of the case, emphasizing
that if Plaintiff’s case would have lost, the firm would not have recovered
attorneys’ fees. (Fennell Decl., ¶ 213.) Exhibit 16 of Fennell’s declaration
includes the schedule of fees on this case totaling in $48,989.50 in attorneys’
fees and costs. (Fennell Decl., ¶ 210, 212, Exhibit 16.) Fennell has also
accounted for an anticipated additional fee of $5,000 for review of opposition,
motion reply, and attendance at the hearing. (Fennell Decl., ¶ 211-212.)
 
                                  
i.         
Legal Standard 
 
Under the Song-Beverly Act, Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d), “If the buyer prevails in an action under this section,
the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a
sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's
fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been
reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.” Since the California Supreme Court has held that
the lodestar adjustment method is the prevailing rule for statutory attorney
fee awards to be applied in the absence of clear legislative intent to the
contrary (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1135–1136), the
lodestar method of calculating fees is appropriate in motions for attorney’s
fees under Civil Code section 1794. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of
California, Inc (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 818.) 
 
“[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….” (Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 140, 154.) In making a
lodestar calculation of proper hourly rates to apply, “the court may rely on
its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees (Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009),
the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied
(Syers Properties [III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 700)
. . . and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the
community and rate determinations in other cases. (Heritage, at p.
1009.)” (569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.
(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437.) The moving party plaintiff bears the burden of
showing that the fees incurred were “allowable,” were “reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation,” and were “reasonable in amount.” (Morris v.
Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 34; Levy v. Toyota Motor
Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.)The trial court
in Levy found that some submitted charges were duplicative, others were
for unnecessary or unsuccessful motions, or for travel time. There was no abuse
of discretion in the pruning of the requested hours for such items. (Id.)

 
“The verified time statements of the attorneys, as
officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal. App. 4th 359, 396.) If the
motion is supported by evidence, the opposing party must respond with specific
evidence showing that the fees are unreasonable. (Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal. App. 4th 550, 560–63.) The
Court has discretion to reduce fees that result from inefficient or duplicative
use of time. (Horsford, supra, at 395.) “[T]he contingent and
deferred nature of the fee award in a civil rights or other case with statutory
attorney fees requires that the fee be adjusted in some manner to reflect the
fact that the fair market value of legal services provided on that basis is
greater than the equivalent noncontingent hourly rate. (Ketchum v. Moses,
supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp. 1132–1133.) “ ‘A lawyer who both bears the risk of
not being paid and provides legal services is not receiving the fair market
value of his work if he is paid only for the second of these functions. If he
is paid no more, competent counsel will be reluctant to accept fee award
cases.’ ” (Id. at p. 1133, quoting with approval from Leubsdorf, The
Contingency Factor in Attorney Fee Awards (1981) 90 Yale L.J. 473, 480.) The
contingency adjustment may be made at the lodestar phase of the court's
calculation or by applying a multiplier to the noncontingency lodestar
calculation (but not both). (Ketchum v. Moses, supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp.
1133–1134.)” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 394-395.) Plaintiff was designated by the parties
in the settlement as the prevailing party. Therefore, attorney fees may and
will be awarded.
 
                                 
ii.         
Reasonableness
of Hourly Rates 
 
1.    
Joshua
D. Fennell 
 
 Fennell states that he is a supervising
attorney at Consumer Law Experts, P.C., and that he was admitted to practice
law in California in January 2018. (Fennell Decl., ¶ 195.) Fennell asserts that
he has been employed at consumer Law Experts, P.C. since June 3, 2019, and in
that time, has litigated and resolved numerous Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Cases. (Fennell Decl., ¶ 195.) Prior to joining Consumer Law Group, P.C.,
Fennell notes that he worked at the Law Offices of Michael H. Rosenstein, a
lemon law firm based in Century City, where he also litigated and resolved
numerous Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Cases. (Fennell Decl., ¶ 195.)
Fennell’s hourly rate on this case is $500. (Fennell Decl., ¶ 195.) Prior to
his work in lemon law, Fennell worked as a family law attorney and a personal
injury attorney, as well as clerking for the New York Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission’s Office of Administrative Judges and for Baltimore’s
Office of the Public Defender. (Fennell Decl., ¶ 195.)
The moving papers argue
that Fennell’s hourly rate is appropriate given his relative experience and
qualifications. The court disagrees. Assuming that Fennell started working in
consumer law when he passed the California Bar Exam in January of 2018 and
worked for the Law Offices of Michael H. Rosenstein, has worked as a consumer
law attorney for just shy of seven (7) years total. Plaintiff submits, in its
RFJN, court orders awarding attorneys fees and hourly rates of thirteen (13)
cases. None of those cases awarded an hourly rate of above $495/hour, even for
an attorney with ten (10) years of practice experience. Based on Fennell’s
experience, and specifically, his years of experience in consumer law with
respect to lemon law cases, the court will not be finding his hourly
rate of $500 to be reasonable. Further, as noted in GM’s opposition brief, none
of the cases submitted for evidence in Plaintiff’s RFJN approved of Fennell’s
hourly rate at $475, $490, or even $500. 
In Plaintiff’s reply
brief, it cites to Reynolds v. Ford Motor Co. (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th
1105, in asserting that there, “the trial court conducted a lodestar analysis
and awarded Reynolds attorney fees . . . at reasonable hourly rates ranging
from $225/hour to $500/hour, plus a lodestar multiplier of 1.2, ‘reasonable and
appropriate to accomplish the salutary objectives of the Song-Beverly Act.’” (Reynolds,
supra, 47 Cal.App.5th at 1110.) Although this is true at the trial court
level, Plaintiff appears to be misrepresenting what the Court of Appeal
actually decided, which was whether the trial court abused its discretion in
awarding fees without considering the contingency fee agreement. (Id. at
1113.) 
The Reynolds Court
did not determine whether $500 was a reasonable hourly rate. Instead, the Court
of Appeal acknowledged that “[t]he trial court acted well within its discretion
in using ‘the prevailing market value in the community for similar legal
services’ (see PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095), relying on its personal knowledge [based on the trial court’s over forty
years of experience in the legal field in Mendocino and Sonoma Counties] and
familiarity with the area legal services, as the “ ‘touchstone’ for
determination” of the reasonable hourly rates.” (Reynolds, supra, 47
Cal.App.5th at 1114 citing Serrano v. Unruh  (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 643.) As the Attorneys
for the Parties in this case may be aware, this Court has very extensive
experience of over 33 years as a lawyer (with an additional nearly 10 years as
a judge in Lemon Law litigation and is very aware from other fee motions in
other cases what the prevailing hourly rates are for Plaintiff and defense
firms in this area. Even in the absence of Mr. Fennell’s recitation of fee
awards by other trial counsel in Los Angeles County and the published fee rates
in numerous cases over the years, this Court has kept abreast of hourly rates
not only in Song-Beverly litigation but also in other less and more complicated
areas of practice. The Court finds that the reasonable hourly rates for Mr. Fennell
is $400. 
2.     Joseph
Kowalski 
Additionally, associate
attorney, Joseph Kowalski, who also worked on this case, was admitted to the
California Bar in 2020, and his hourly rate for this case was $350. (Fennell
Decl., ¶ 196.) Fennell states that prior to working at Consumer Law Experts,
P.C., Mr. Kowalski represented tribunal governments in Indian Law matters. (Fennell
Decl., ¶ 196.) The Court reduces his reasonable hourly rat to $300, based on the
factors outlined above.   
3.     Elaine
Paiz-Astorga
Fennell’s declaration
also asserts that Elaine Paiz-Astorga, a paralegal at Consumer Law Experts,
P.C., has a reasonable hourly rate – without stating what that rate is. Per the
court’s review of Exhibit 16, it appears that her hourly rate ranged from $175/hour
- $200/hour. (Fennell Decl., ¶ 214, Exhibit 16.) Elaine has eight years of
experience in the legal industry which includes: trial preparation, trial
documents/binders, discovery preparation, preparing pleadings and judicial
council forms, preparing memorandum of costs, calendaring state and federal
deadlines, submitting documents for filings, creating table of contents and table
of authorities, and drafting subpoenas (among many others). (Fennell Decl., ¶
214.) The court acknowledges that a $200 hourly rate is within the range of
reasonableness for an experienced paralegal. 
In opposition, GM argues
that this court should award no more than $24,497 in attorneys’ fees and costs
and urges this court to exercise its discretion to reduce Fennell’s request to
include only fees actually and reasonably incurred, asserting the claimed fees
are unreasonable and excessive. 
                               
iii.         
Reasonableness of Fees 
In its opposition, GM
argues that the following categories of hours should be reduced on the basis of
being templates, unnecessary, padded, and/or unsupported entries. The Court
rules on each as follows: 
·       Clerical
& Administrative Tasks Billed at Attorney Rates—June 1 and 5, 2022, July 12
and 19, 2022: Mr. Fennell billed 4.0 hours ($1840.00)
for clerical or administrative tasks such as “[c]onfer w/ associate” and
“[e]mail responses to handling attorney.” (Fennell Decl. Ex. 16, pp. 2 &
4.) These entries are separate from entries detailing actual work performed.
Purely clerical tasks, such as those performed by Mr. Fennell, are not
recoverable as attorney fees. (See Missouri v. Jenkins by Agyei (1989)
491 U.S. 274) These entries relate to internal communications between Mr.
Fennell and “associate” or “co-counsel.” GM should not be required to reimburse
Counsel for time spent discussing general case status with individuals not
actively involved in litigating Plaintiff’s case. The Court makes some reduction
in the claimed hours consistent with GM’s Opposition.
·       Review
of Repair Orders—November 12, 2021, July 11, 2022, December 8, 2023, January
16, 2024: Counsel “billed” 3.8 hours ($1604.00) to review
twenty pages of repair orders and draft a chronology. (Fennell Decl. Ex. 16, p.
1,3, 28 and 32) Presumably, Counsel had already read these documents before
filing suit. Reviewing them again and preparing a chronology, when Counsel
should be aware of their contents, serves only to pad the bill. Finally, these
repair orders only consist of seventeen pages. GM requests that this time be
stricken in its entirety for a reduction of 3.8 hours ($1604.00).  The Court reduces the hours to 3 hours, not
3.8 hours. 
 
·       Discovery
Responses— September 26, 2023, and October 10, 2023:
Mr. Fennell “billed” 3.7 hours ($1304.00) to prepare written discovery
responses and a 51-page document production. (Fennell Decl. Ex. 16, pp. 21
& 26.) GM’s requests do not substantially differ from case to case. It
should not have taken Mr. Fennell more than 30 minutes to draft Plaintiff’s
responses, which were almost exclusively templated objections Counsel deploys
in all cases against GM. (Keshishian Decl. ¶ 10, compare Ex. G with Ex. H.) GM
requests that Counsel’s fees for this “work” be reduced by 3.2 hours
($1,472.00).  The court finds this amount
of time reasonable to respond to discovery. 
 
·       Discovery
Requests, Deposition Notices & ESI Letter—May 26, 2022, June 16, 2022,
August 10, 2022, August 16, 2022, January 15, 2024:
Mr. Fennell “billed” 5.6 hours ($1,692.50) to prepare templated form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production, requests for
admission, PMQ deposition notices, and an ESI meet and confer letter. (Fennell
Decl. Ex. 16, pp. 2, 6, 7, and 31) This time is excessive given counsel’s
claimed extensive experience in this area of the law,  so the Court halves the hours claimed to 2.8
hours.   
 
·       Review
of GM’s Discovery Responses— June 16, 2022, July 11-12, 2022, August 3 and 10,
2022, November 2, 2023: Counsel should not be permitted to
recover all 3 hours ($1276.50 he “billed” to review and analyze GM’s objections
to Plaintiff’s PMQ deposition notices and GM’s discovery responses. (Fennell
Decl. Ex. 16, pp 3, 7, and 22) Like every other aspect of written discovery in
this case, neither Plaintiff’s requests nor GM’s responses to those requests
were novel nor varied significantly from other lemon law cases. (Keshishian
Decl. ¶7.) GM asks that these time entries be reduced to no more than 0.5 hours
for a 2.5-hour ($1,150.00) reduction. The Court disagrees and finds the time is
reasonable. 
 
·       Templated
Meet-and-Confer Correspondence—July 12, 19 and 27, 2022, August 3, 2022, April
23, 2024: Mr. Fennell should not be able to recover the 2.9
hours ($1,201.00) “billed” to draft various “recycled” meet-and-confer letters
regarding GM’s discovery responses and review GM’s responses. (Fennell Decl.
Ex. 16, pp. 4-7, and 56.) Counsel’s discovery requests and GM’s responses to
those requests never differ, so it is unsurprising that their meet-and-confer
letters to GM are highly similar from case to case.  (Keshishian Decl. ¶ 8, compare Ex. E with Ex.
F).  The Court reduces the time claimed
to 1.5 hours total. 
 
·       Review
of GM’s Production Documents—July 11, 2022, August 17, 2023, November 2, 2023,
January 16, 2024: The amount of time is lowered to 3 hours
total.  
 
·       Motion
for Sanctions re RFP Responses–May 30, 2023, June 8, 2023, July 26-27, 2023:
It was unreasonable and unnecessary for Mr. Fennell, to bill 7.9 hours
($3,139.00) to draft Plaintiff’s templated motion and, reviewing GM’s
opposition, and preparing for the hearing. (Fennell Decl. Ex. 17, pp. 35, 42,
& 46-47.)   GM asserts this was a “stock”
motion and reply that Counsel routinely files in cases against GM. (Keshishian
Decl. ¶ 9.) GM requests a reduction of 3.5 hours ($1,610.00).  The Court agrees in part with GM and reduces
these hours as well.   
 
·       Motion
for Sanctions re PMQ Deposition—March 1 and 4, 2024 and April 4-5, 2024:
GM asserts it was unreasonable and unnecessary for Mr. Fennell to bill 2.5
hours ($1,128.00) to draft Plaintiff’s “templated” motion and withdrawing the
motion to compel regarding the deposition of GM’s PMK reviewing GM’s opposition
and preparing for the hearing. (Fennell Decl. Ex. 16, pp. 48 & 53.) GM asserts
it had already produced its PMK for deposition on March 25, 2024. (Keshishian
Decl. ¶ 11.) The sanctions hearing never occurred.  As noted in the reply brief, the Court
requires clarification as there does not appear to be a motion for sanctions
billed for those dates. 
 
·       Non-Party
Dealership Subpoena & Depositions— November 10, 2023; February 5, 7 and 15,
2024, March 1, 2024: Mr. Fennell “billed” a total of 7.8
hours ($3,355.50) to “prepare” non-party deposition subpoenas for the PMK and
service technicians for nonparty dealerships Martin Chevrolet, and arranging,
preparing for, and taking the depositions. (Fennell Decl. Ex. 16, pp. 22, 36,
38-39 and 45.) GM argues it is unreasonable for Mr. Fennell to have spent more
than a full day preparing for and deposing multiple dealership witnesses on the
same topics. Indeed, there were only a total of seventeen pages of repair
orders produced by Plaintiff. The Court finds that a reduction of the hours is appropriate.

 
·       Templated
Motions in Limine— February 9, 2024: Counsel should not be
able to recover for the 2.9 hours ($1112.50) “billed” to prepare the same seven
“templated” motions in limine that are adapted from prior cases with only minor
variations for case-specific details. (Fennell Decl. Ex. 16, p. 37; Keshishian
Decl. ¶ 13, compare Ex. I with Ex. J.) GM states that the work here could be
done in 1.0 hour and asks for a reduction of 1.9 hours ($874.00). The Court
agrees in pat and will reduce the claimed hours.   
 
·       Templated
Trial Documents—February 29, 2024, March 1 and 4, 2024:
Counsel “billed” 7.4 hours ($4,360.00) to draft the witness list, verdict form,
statement of the case, jury instructions, exhibit list, and to finalize trial
documents. (Fennell Decl. Ex. 16, pp. 44- 47.)  Per GM, all of these documents are virtually
identical in every case filed by Counsel. (Keshishian Decl. ¶ 14.) Counsel is
padding the time here. GM request that the time be reduced to 1-hour, for a
reduction of 6.4 hours ($3,040.00). The Court finds the 7.4 hours to be excessive,
so it reduces the hours claimed. 
 
·       Templated
Attorney Fees Motion; Reply & Attend Hearing—August 5-6, 2024; & TBD:
Finally, Counsel should not get full credit for the 5.5 hours ($2,750.00) that
Counsel claims it spent on the fee motion, or the additional $5,000 in
“anticipated” fees to review GM’s opposition, prepare a reply brief, and attend
the hearing. (Fennell Decl. Ex. 16, pp. 62-63.) GM claims that Counsel’s fee
motion in this case is substantially similar to fee motions that Counsel filed
in other Song-Beverly cases against GM. (See Keshishian Decl. ¶ 16 and Ex. K.)   The Court agrees in part with GM and reduces
the claimed hours.
 
                               
iv.         
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’
Fees Conclusion 
Based on the above
analysis, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, but in a
lowered amount of $44,500 based on reasonable hourly fees as well as reasonable
amount of time spent. 
B.   
Defendant GM’s Motion to
Tax Costs
 
                                  
i.         
Legal Standard 
The non-prevailing
party may file a motion to strike or tax costs. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b).) Procedurally, “[a]ny notice of motion to strike or to tax
costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum.” (Ibid.)
“Unless the objection is made to the entire cost memorandum, the motion to
strike or tax costs must refer to each item objected to by the same number and
appear in the same order as the corresponding cost item claimed on the
memorandum of costs and must state why the item is objectionable.” (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(2).) “Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to
its preparation.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).) 
 
            During
the hearing, “the verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of their
propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show they
were not reasonable or necessary.” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 131.) “This procedure provides an orderly and efficient way of
placing disputed costs at issue on a line item basis.” (612 South LLC v. Laconic
Ltd. Partnership (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1285.) 
 
            “Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 sets forth various categories of recoverable
costs.  Some of the costs include filing, motion, and jury fees (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(1)) and service of process by a
public officer, registered process server, or other means (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (a)(4)). Section 1033.5 also explains
that if an item is not mentioned in this section, these items may be allowed or
denied in the court’s discretion. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4).) “Where costs are not expressly
allowed by the statute, the burden is on the party claiming the costs to show
that the charges were reasonable and necessary. Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial
court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.” (Foothill-De
Anza Community College Dist. v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29-30.)

Discussion 
GM asserts that
Plaintiff’s Counsel’s firm has demanded $4,069.13 in costs for a Song-Beverly
matter that did not go to trial or raise any complex or novel issues. Further,
the total Counsel has proffered in its memorandum of costs includes $1,433.91
that GM argues is without merit. GM has requested an order from this Court
taxing costs for several items it asserts are unreasonable, unnecessary, and
for which Plaintiff is unentitled to under California law. With respect to the
mentioned $1,433.91, GM states Plaintiff has failed to carry its burden in
demonstrating the following expenses were actually or reasonably incurred: 
·       $166.79
for “Jury fees” (See Memorandum of Costs, Worksheet, p. 1, line 2.) This case
never went to trial and GM should therefore not be billed for jury fees. The
Court should therefore strike these costs entirely. 
o  
DENIED. Despite this case not going to
trial prior to settling, Plaintiff nonetheless had to pay a jury fee deposit in
order to reserve Plaintiff’s right to a jury trial in this jurisdiction. 
·       $12.34
in “Notice of Change of Address” costs. (Worksheet, p. 2, line 1e.) Such costs
are considered business overhead costs and are in no way related to. 
o  
GRANTED. Irrespective of the California
Rules of Court mandatory requirement, Plaintiff can cite to no portion of
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 that would warrant this being
an allowable cost. 
·       $744.80
for the “Reply Courtesy Copy”, “MIL Courtesy Copies”, “Opposition Courtesy
Copies”, “Courtesy Copies for Jury Instructions” and “Courtesy Copies for Trial
Filings”(Worksheet, p. 4, Attachment 1g.) Such copies are by definition
unnecessary. Because these copies were not required, GM should be forced to pay
Counsel’s decision to incur the unnecessary expense. 
o  
GRANTED. Unless Plaintiff can show that GM
specifically requested courtesy copies, the Court does not allow for Plaintiff
to collect this cost. 
·       $509.98
in service of process costs related to serving the dealership deposition and
trial subpoenas. (Id.; Worksheet, p. 5, Attachment 5(d).) Again, these
dealerships are non-parties with their own counsel and are not controlled by
GM. Moreover, none of this work by Counsel advanced Plaintiffs’ case as the
dealership employees were never deposed and the case settled before trial. As
such, Counsel should not recover any of these costs.
o  
DENIED. Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5(a)(4), costs related to service are allowable. 
As such, the Court GRANTS
GM’s Motion to Tax Cost in part and DENIES it in part, resulting in a reduction
of $757.14, for a net of $3,212 in costs awarded.
