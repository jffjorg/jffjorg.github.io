  Case Number:  23PSCV02341    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  H Lomingkit
v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., et al., Case No. 23PSCV02341


ORDER
ON PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL 
Plaintiff Rajah Raphael Lomingkit’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents is DENIED.


Background 
Plaintiff Rajah Raphael Lomingkit (“Plaintiff”) alleges that he entered into a warranty
contract with American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Honda”) in connection with the
purchase of a 2019 Honda Odyssey (the “subject vehicle”). According to
Plaintiff, the subject vehicle suffers from various defects and has not been
repaired after a reasonable number of attempts. 
 
On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint, asserting causes of action against Honda and Does 1-10 for:

1.       Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil
Code Section 1793.2;
2.       Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil
Code Section 1793.2;
3.       Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil
Code Section 1793.2; and
4.       Breach of the Implied Warranty of
Merchantability.
 
The Final Status Conference is set for
February 4, 2025. Trial is set for February 18, 2025. Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion To Compel Further Responses to
Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, where Plaintiff seeks
documents relating to alleged electrical defects and engine defects.Prior to filing the motion, the
parties met and conferred in an effort to informally resolve the disputes, as
required under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2016.040 and 2031.310(b)(2). (Brown Decl., ¶¶ 38-39, Exhs. 14-15).
The parties subsequently attended Informal Discovery Conferences (“IDCs”), but still
were unable to resolve their disputes. (Id., ¶¶ 42-49). At the last IDC,
the Court permitted Plaintiff to file the instant motion. (Id., ¶ 49).
For the reasons stated herein, the Court denies the motion.

 
Legal Standard 
“[T]he
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that. . . (1) A statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete[,] (2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive [and/or] (3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)A
motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of
documents must “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
If the moving party has shown good cause for the production of documents, the
burden is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) Discussion Plaintiff
moves the court for an order striking Honda’s
objections and compelling its further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One (i.e., Nos. 16, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30,
41, 42, 45, 46, 51, 52, 53, 54, 72, 80, 81, 109, 114, 119, 120, 129, and 130).Plaintiff
has categorized the requests in issue as follows: (1) Internal Knowledge &
Investigation Discovery (i.e., Nos. 16, 23, 24, 27-30, 41, 42, 45, 46 and
51-54); (2) Summary Documents and Deposition Testimony Regarding These
Documents (i.e., Nos. 72, 80 and 81); (3) Policies and Procedures Discovery
(i.e., No. 109) and (4) Communications with Governmental Agencies and Suppliers
(i.e., Nos. 114, 119 and 120).No.
16 seeks documents concerning any internal analysis or investigations regarding
the “engine defect(s)”[FN1] in “Honda
Odyssey Vehicles”[FN2] equipped with the same 3.5-liter engine as the subject vehicle.Nos.
23 and 24 seek documents regarding any internal investigation regarding root
cause problems, problem-solving efforts, or efforts to identify any actual or
potential problems, failures, malfunctions, conditions, and/or defects,
regarding the electrical architecture and 3.5-liter engine in the Honda Odyssey
vehicles, respectively.Nos.
27 and 28 seek documents concerning field reports, dealer contacts, warranty
claims, customer complaints, claims, and/or reported failures regarding electrical
defects[FN3] and
engine defects in Honda Odyssey vehicles, respectively.Nos.
29 and 30 seek documents regarding the electrical defects and engine defects in
Honda Odyssey vehicles equipped with the same electrical architecture and 3.5-liter
engine as the subject vehicle.Nos.
41 and 42 seek documents to and from Honda’s agents, representatives,
engineers, employees, or part suppliers, concerning common parts failures for
the electrical architecture and 3.5-liter engine in Honda Odyssey vehicles.Nos.
45 and 46 seek documents from Honda’s engineers or suppliers with information
relating to suggested repair procedures for commonly observed problems
regarding electrical defects and engine defects in Honda Odyssey vehicles.Nos.
51 and 52 seek documents regarding Honda Odyssey vehicles that were repurchased
or replaced by Honda and (1) underwent two or more warranty repair attempts, or
(2) were unable to be repaired within 30 days for concerns regarding electrical
defects or engine defects.Nos.
53 and 54 seek all vehicle warranty history reports for Honda Odyssey vehicles
that Honda repurchased or replaced with two or more warranty repair attempts to
the electrical architecture or 3.5-liter engine.No.
72 seeks documents prepared by any of Honda’s engineers or suppliers concerning
the engine defects in Honda Odyssey vehicles equipped with the same 3.5-liter
engine as the subject vehicle.Nos.
80 and 81 seek documents regarding software release notes for all software
released for the electrical defects in Honda Odyssey vehicles equipped with the
same electrical architecture and 3.5-liter engine as the subject vehicle. No. 109 seeks the user manual for every
database where any of the following information is stored: warranty records,
customer complaints, field reports, technician line contact, field service
reports and dealer contacts. No. 114 seeks documents regarding any investigations and/or communications between Honda
and any government agency or entity regarding engine defects in Honda Odyssey
vehicles.Nos.
119 and 120 seek communications with and documents provided to or received from
the supplier of the electrical architecture and the 3.5-liter engine in Honda Odyssey
vehicles regarding an actual or suspected electrical architecture condition,
issue, problem, or defect.Nos.
129 and 130 seek documents concerning performance standards relating to the
electrical architecture and 3.5-liter engine in Honda Odyssey vehicles.In
the course of meet-and-confer discussions, Plaintiff agreed to narrow the
document request to cover only 2019 Honda Odyssey vehicles sold in the State of
California. (Brown Decl., ¶ 28.) Plaintiff also agreed to narrow the definition
of “engine defect(s)” to mean “repair or replacement of the fuel pump motor,
and repair or replacement of the shutter grill” and to re-define the definition
of “electrical defect(s)” to mean “updates to the Honda display audio unit
software; repairs to the third-row power outlet; updates to the multi-model
gauge control module; updates to the multi module front control box; updates or
repairs to the rear-view camera; non-operation of the open/close button for the
sliding doors; and installation of FAKRA service cables.” (Id.)Honda
maintains its objections to producing the requested documents. It first objects
on the grounds that Plaintiff’s definitions of “engine” (contained in Nos. 16,
28, 30, 46, 52, 72, 81 and 114) and “electrical” (contained in Nos. 27, 29, 45,
51 and 80) defects are “wholly disconnected from the Subject Vehicle’s repair
history” and seek documents “involving issues, components, allegations, and
circumstances not at issue here.” (Opp. 3:10-12; 5:3-4). The Court agrees.“A plaintiff pursuing an action under
the [Song-Beverly] Act has the burden to prove that (1) the vehicle had a
nonconformity covered by the express warranty that substantially impaired the
use, value or safety of the vehicle (the nonconformity element); (2) the
vehicle was presented to an authorized representative of the manufacturer of
the vehicle for repair (the presentation element); and (3) the manufacturer or
his representative did not repair the nonconformity after a reasonable number
of repair attempts (the failure to repair element).” (Oregel v. American
Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)Under the Song-Beverly Act (the “Act”),
a plaintiff cannot exercise his or her rights under the Act if the manufacturer
has not been given at least two opportunities to fix the nonconformity. (Silvio
v. Ford Motor Co. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1208 [“The statute requires
the manufacturer to afford the specified remedies of restitution or replacement
if that manufacturer is unable to repair the vehicle ‘after a reasonable number
of attempts.’ ‘Attempts’ is plural. The statute does not
require the manufacturer to make restitution or replace a vehicle if it has had
only one opportunity to repair that vehicle.”].)As
to Request Nos. 16, 28, 30, 46, 52, 72, 81 and 114, Honda further objects to
Plaintiff’s definition of the term “engine defect(s)” as being too vague and
including the non-specific phrase “any other similar concerns identified in the
repair history” for the subject vehicle. Honda also argues that the information
requested is not relevant because the subject vehicle was never presented to an
authorized Honda repair facility for any symptom included in Plaintiff’s definition
of the term “engine defect,” including “loss of power,” “stalling,” “engine
running rough,” “engine misfire(s),” and “failure or replacement of the engine.”While
Plaintiff asserts that he presented the subject vehicle to Honda’s authorized
dealership on nine separate occasions “with concerns related to Electrical
Defects and Engine Defects” (Brown Decl., ¶ 4), the service history reflects
that the subject vehicle was never presented for a drivability concern until
October 11, 2023 (after the complaint was filed on August 1, 2023) when
it was brought in for the first time for replacement of the shutter grill and
that the fuel pump was replaced in April 2021 in response to a service
bulletin. (Id., ¶¶ 13, 8). Accordingly, none of these unreported or
once-reported “engine defect” symptoms can form the basis of Plaintiff’s
lawsuit. No further responses to Nos. 16, 28, 30, 46, 52, 72, 81 and 114 are
warranted.As
to Nos. 27, 29, 45, 51 and 80, Honda similarly objects “to Plaintiff’s
definition of the term “electrical defects” as being too vague and including the
non-specific phrase “any other similar concerns identified in the repair
history” for the subject vehicle. Honda also observes that the definition
includes symptoms for which the subject vehicle was never presented to an
authorized Honda repair facility, including “loss of power,” “battery draining,”
“lights dimming or flickering,” “failure to start,” “malfunctioning of the
instrument cluster,” “malfunction or failure of the auto start-stop feature,” “malfunction
or failure of the engine stop-start feature,” and “malfunctioning or failure of
the fuses, modules, and/or relays.”The
service history reflects that the only item that could be tied to Plaintiff’s “electrical
defect” definition is his complaint regarding the subject vehicle rear
passenger door not closing with the inner button, which was apparently repaired
on August 6, 2021. (Brown Decl., ¶¶ 9-11). No further responses to Nos. 27, 29,
45, 51 and 80 are warranted.Honda
properly objects to Plaintiff’s “root cause” discovery (i.e., Nos. 23 and 24)
on the basis of relevance. Plaintiff is not required to show what caused a
nonconformity. (See Oregel, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at 1102, fn. 8 [“Isuzu also argues
it was incumbent on Oregel to prove not only that the car leaked oil but also
to show the cause of the leak, and that he failed to meet this burden because
he produced no expert testimony proving the cause of the leak. However, the
statute requires only that Oregel prove the car did not conform to the express
warranty, and proof that there was a persistent leak that Ron Baker could not
locate or repair suffices. We do not interpret the statute as depriving a
consumer of a remedy if he cannot do what the manufacturer, with its presumably
greater expertise, was incapable of doing, i.e. identify the source of the
leak”].). Additionally, Honda’s objection that the term “electrical
architecture” in No. 23 is vague and ambiguous is well-taken. No further
responses are warranted to Nos. 23 and 24.The
Court similarly concludes that Honda properly objects to the remaining requests.
As to Nos. 41 and 42, the terms “common parts failures” (in No. 41 and 42) and
“electrical architecture” (in No. 41) are vague and ambiguous. As to Nos. 53
and 54, the term “electrical architecture” (in No. 53) is vague and ambiguous,
and the requests seek irrelevant information of repurchases and replacements of
other vehicles. No. 109 is vague, ambiguous, overly broad, and irrelevant. Nos.
119 and 120 are overbroad, as well as vague and ambiguous as to the phrases
“actual or suspected electrical architecture condition, issue, problem, or
defect” (in No. 119) and “actual or suspected 3.5-liter engine condition,
issue, problem, or defect” (in No. 120). Nos. 129 and 130 are similarly overbroad,
as well as vague and ambiguous as to the phrases “concerning performance
standards relating to the electrical architecture” (in No. 129) and “concerning
performance standards relating to the 3.5-liter engine” (in No. 130). No
further responses are warranted to Nos. 41, 42, 53, 54, 109, 119, 120, 129, and
130.The
Court denies the motion in full.
