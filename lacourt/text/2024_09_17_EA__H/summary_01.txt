And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from Honda regarding alleged electrical and engine defects in a 2019 Honda Odyssey. The plaintiff, Rajah Raphael Lomingkit, alleges that Honda failed to repair the defects after a reasonable number of attempts and is seeking documents related to the alleged defects. Honda has objected to producing the documents, arguing that they are irrelevant and seek information that is not related to the subject vehicle. The judge agrees that Honda's objections are well-taken and that the remaining requests are vague, ambiguous, or irrelevant. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's claims are limited to the specific defects and issues related to the subject vehicle and that the plaintiff cannot exercise his rights under the Song-Beverly Act if the manufacturer has not been given at least two opportunities to fix the nonconformity.
