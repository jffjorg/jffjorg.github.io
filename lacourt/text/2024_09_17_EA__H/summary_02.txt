The judge is considering a case involving Honda Odyssey vehicles manufactured and/or sold by American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The vehicles are equipped with certain engine and electrical architecture, which have been previously defined as "ENGINE DEFECT(S)" and "ELECTRICAL DEFECT(S)" respectively. The judge is considering the scope of these defects and is basing their ruling on previous definitions of these terms. Specifically, the "ENGINE DEFECT(S)" refer to the repair or replacement of the fuel pump motor and shutter grill, while the "ELECTRICAL DEFECT(S)" refer to updates to the Honda display audio unit software, repairs to the third-row power outlet, and other issues. The judge's tentative ruling is intended to clarify the scope of these defects and will likely be based on the information presented in the case.
