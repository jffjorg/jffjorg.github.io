CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV20467
SALVADOR SERMENO BARRIENTEZ vs LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION
AUTHORITY et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel Shawn
Azizzadeh
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: THE COURT WILL HEAR FROM
THE PARTIES
 
Background 
 
Attorney Shawn Azizzadeh
represents Plaintiff. Shawn Azizzadeh moves to be relieved as counsel, citing
an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and
communication. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion¿ 
¿ 
Azizzadeh has
filed Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). Azizzadeh seeks to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for
withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the
attorney to withdraw).)  
 
The Court notes that within the
past 30 days, Plaintiff's address was confirmed as current by counsel through a
phone call. The FSC is currently set for November 7, 2024, only seven days
away, which provides insufficient time for Plaintiff to retain new counsel.
Nonetheless, the Court will hear from the parties on how they wish to proceed.
