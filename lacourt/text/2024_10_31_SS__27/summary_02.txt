And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to exclude expert testimony at trial. The defendant had noticed the depositions of the plaintiff's non-retained experts, Dr. Bruce Fishman and Dr. Ata Kashani, but they failed to appear. The plaintiff had designated these experts on June 18, 2024, and the defendant had noticed their depositions, but they did not appear for their scheduled depositions. The judge found that the plaintiff had unreasonably failed to make their experts available for deposition, and therefore excluded Dr. Fishman and Dr. Kashani from testifying as experts at trial. The judge also found that the plaintiff's conduct was unreasonable and that the defendant had complied with the statutory requirements for timely expert disclosure. The judge ruled that the motion was granted, and Dr. Fishman and Dr. Kashani are excluded from providing expert testimony at trial, although they may testify as percipient witnesses.
