And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court will hear from the parties on how they wish to proceed after receiving a motion to be relieved as counsel from Plaintiff's counsel, Shawn Azizzadeh. Azizzadeh cites an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and communication as the reason for his request. Although the Court notes that the FSC is currently set for November 7, 2024, only seven days away, it will hear from the parties on how they wish to proceed. The Court finds this to be a proper ground for withdrawal, citing previous case law.
