Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Luis Chacon v. R. Scott Tucker & Associates, et al. The case involves a dispute over alleged violations of the warranty of habitability and other causes of action. The judge has deemed moot the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike portions of the complaint. The judge has also struck the complaint on its own motion and entered a dismissal of the entire instant action with prejudice.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff filed the exact same action against the defendant as Case No. 22TRCV01052, which was previously dismissed with prejudice. The judge has determined that the plaintiff is precluded from filing the same action again and has therefore struck the complaint and dismissed the action with prejudice.

The judge's ruling is supported by various legal authorities, including CCP § 430.10(e), CCP § 436, and CCP § 581(f)(2). The judge has also considered the meet and confer declarations filed by the defendant and has determined that the pleading is not drawn in conformity with the laws of this State.
