23TRCV01423
1.      R. Scott Tucker & Associates, et al.’s Demurrer to
Complaint 
2.      R. Scott Tucker & Associates, et al.’s Motion to
Strike Portions of Complaint  

TENTATIVE RULING

            R.
Scott Tucker & Associates, et al.’s Demurrer to Complaint is deemed moot by
the Court. 
 
            R.
Scott Tucker & Associates, et al.’s Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint
is deemed moot by the Court. 
 
            The
Court strikes the Complaint on its own motion pursuant to CCP § 436 and enters
a dismissal of the entire instant action with prejudice. 
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed his Complaint on May 5, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff was a tenant at 13321 Cordary Avenue
#22, Hawthorne, CA 90250.  The property
is owned by Defendant R. Scott Tucker & Associates dba RST and Assoc.
Defendant Josue Aguilar was the property manager during Plaintiff’s tenancy. Plaintiff
claims damages for alleged violations of the warranty of habitability as well
as numerous other causes of action.  
 
            On October 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed the exact same
action against Defendant as Case No. 22TRCV01052. On May 4, 2023, Defendant’s
ex parte application for dismissal for failure to amend the complaint after the
sustaining of the demurrer was granted. Plaintiff’s action was dismissed with
prejudice.
 
            Meet and Confer
  
            Defendants filed
meet and confer declarations in sufficient compliance with both CCP § 430.41
and CCP § 435.5.  (Decls., Leonard S.
Kirschen). 
 
             Demurrer

            A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
            Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
            Motion
to Strike  
 
            The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
CCP § 436(a).  The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  CCP § 436(b). 
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant,
false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  CCP § 436. 
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
            As noted above, on October 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
exact same action against Defendant as Case No. 22TRCV01052. On May 4, 2023,
Defendant’s ex parte application for dismissal for failure to amend the
complaint after the sustaining of the demurrer was granted. Plaintiff’s action
was dismissed with prejudice.
 
            If a demurrer to the entire complaint has been sustained
with leave to amend, and Plaintiff fails to amend within the time permitted by
the court, Defendant may bring an ex parte application to dismiss the action
and for entry of judgment. CCP § 581(f)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1320(i); Datig v. Dove Books, Inc. (1999) 73 Cal. App. 4th 964, 976. If
the Court grants the motion, the dismissal must be with prejudice. Cano v.
Glover (2006) 143 Cal. App. 4th 326, 329–30. 
 
            Because Case No. 22TRCV01052 was mandated to be dismissed
with prejudice, Plaintiff is precluded as a matter of law from filing the exact
same action again. 
 
            Thus, the Court, on its own motion, strikes the Complaint
in Case No. 23TRCV01523 because the pleading is not drawn in conformity with
the laws of this State and orders the action dismissed with prejudice.
 
            Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
