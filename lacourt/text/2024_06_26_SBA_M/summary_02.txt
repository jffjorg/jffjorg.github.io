The judge has denied Charles Enabulele's motion to relate, consolidate, and stay the action against Arbor Vitae, LLC, et al. Enabulele claims that the property at 200 W Arbor Vitae St has habitability issues and seeks to consolidate the action with an unlawful detainer action against him. The judge finds that consolidation is not necessary to present a defense in the unlawful detainer action and that it would only result in further delay and inefficiency. The judge also notes that Enabulele can raise issues of habitability in the unlawful detainer action that may support his contention that he should retain the right to possess the property. As a result, the judge has denied Enabulele's motion and ordered the instant action to proceed separately.
