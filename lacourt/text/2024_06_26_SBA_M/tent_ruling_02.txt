Enabulele v. Arbor Vitae, LLC, et al.   
23TRCV04247
1.      Charles Enabulele’s Motion to Relate, Consolidate, and
Stay Cases     
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Charles Enabulele’s Motion to
Relate, Consolidate, and Stay Cases is denied.  
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on December
22, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff is the tenant at real
property located at 200 W Arbor Vitae St, Unit 35, Inglewood, CA 90301. The
property suffers from numerous habitability issues. Plaintiff alleges the
following causes of action: 1. Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability; 2.
Negligence; 3. Nuisance; 4. Breach of Quiet Enjoyment; 5. IIED; 6. Unruh Civil
Rights Act, Civ. Code 51.7; 7. Anti-Harassment Statute, Civ. Code 1940.1; 8.
Violation of L.A. County, Cal. Mun. Code 8.52.130 et seq.  
 
            Motion to Consolidate
 
The trial court has discretion to consolidate actions
involving common questions of law or fact. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1048.)  The
purpose of consolidation is “to promote trial convenience and economy by
avoiding duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common
to both actions.”  Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.
 
The court generally considers the following: (1)
timeliness of the motion, i.e., whether granting consolidation would delay the
trial of any of the cases involved; (2) complexity, i.e., whether joining the
actions involved would make the trial too confusing or complex for a jury; and
(3) prejudice, i.e, whether consolidation would adversely affect the rights of
any party.  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d
428, 430–31; Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon
Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-79.
 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.300 states:
“A pending civil case is related to another pending
civil case, or to a civil case that was dismissed with or without prejudice, or
to a civil case that was disposed of by judgment, if the cases:
(1) Involve the same parties and are based on the same
or similar claims;
(2) Arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact;
(3) Involve claims against, title to, possession of,
or damages to the same property; or
(4) Are likely for other reasons to require
substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.”
 
Plaintiff moves
for an order to relate and consolidate the instant action with Case No. 24IWUD00071,
Beach Front Property v. Enabulele, an unlawful detainer action, and to stay
the UD action. Plaintiff argues that the actions involve fundamental
common issues of law and fact, contain common parties, and that consolidation
will promote judicial resources. 
 
“[A]n unlawful detainer action may not generally be
tried together with other causes.” Childs v. Eltinge (1973) 29
Cal.App.3d 843, 852. “[T]he reason for the rule that unlawful detainer actions
are not to be tried in conjunction with other causes or claims is that,
otherwise, the very purpose of this statutory, summary procedure, to afford an
expeditious and adequate remedy for obtaining possession of premises wrongfully
withheld by tenants, would be entirely frustrated.” Id. at 853. 
 
In fact, Plaintiff may assert as an affirmative
defense in the unlawful detainer action the alleged breach of the warranty of
habitability which Plaintiff has asserted as a cause of action in the instant
action. The California Court of Appeals stated as follows: “Green v.
Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616, 111 Cal.Rptr. 704, 517 P.2d 1168, holds that
breach of implied warranty of habitability in residential leases ‘may be raised
as a Defense by a tenant in an unlawful detainer action.’ (Emphasis added; p.
619, 111 Cal.Rptr. p. 706, 517 P.2d p. 1170.) The court also noted that
“absolutely nothing in the statutory provisions governing unlawful detainer
proceedings prohibits assertion of any Defense.” (Emphasis added; p. 632, 111
Cal.Rptr. p. 714, 517 P.2d p. 1178.)  Thus,
under Green, a tenant may assert the habitability warranty as a defense
in an unlawful detainer action.” De La Vara v. Municipal Court (1979) 98
Cal.App.3d 638, 641.
 
Therefore, the
Court finds that convenience and economy will not be fostered by consolidation
of the cases. The Court finds
that the purpose of consolidation - to promote trial convenience and economy by
avoiding duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common
to all actions – is not present in the actions. Plaintiff can raise
issues of habitability in the unlawful detainer action that may support his
contention that he should retain the right to possess the property.  Consolidation is, therefore, not required for
Plaintiff to present a defense in the UD action. Instead, consolidation would
merely result in further delay and inefficiency, and would not foster the
policy of promoting the speedy resolution of UD actions.
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion to Relate, Consolidate,
and Stay Action is denied. 
 
The Court declines to order
the instant action as related to Case No. 24IWUD00071. The motion for
consolidation is denied.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
