And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rafael Lopez, et al. v. David Avalos, et al. (Case Number: 24TRCV01756). The Plaintiffs have applied for a preliminary injunction to prevent a foreclosure sale of the property located at 1434 W 224th St., Torrance, CA 90501. The Court has granted the application.

The Plaintiffs allege that they borrowed money from the Defendants but paid it back, and that they do not recall signing any promissory notes or notarizing any deeds of trust. The Defendants filed no written opposition.

The Court has considered the two factors required to grant a preliminary injunction: the likelihood that the Plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of the case at trial, and the interim harm that the Plaintiffs may suffer if the injunction is denied compared to the harm that the Defendants are likely to suffer if the injunction is granted.

The Court has determined that the Plaintiffs have met their burden to demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the case at trial, and that the interim harm to the Plaintiffs if the injunction is denied is greater than the harm to the Defendants if the injunction is granted.

The Court has ordered that the Plaintiffs post a bond in the amount of $25,000.00 and has granted the preliminary injunction to prevent the foreclosure sale of the property.
