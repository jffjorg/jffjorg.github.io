And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to compel arbitration of the cross-complaint filed by Juan Carlos Reyes against Arc City and others. The cross-complaint is stayed pending arbitration. The judge has also set a non-appearance case review for November 20, 2025, and directed the parties to submit a joint statement five calendar days in advance, apprising the court of the status of the arbitration. The judge found that the dispute resolution clause in the subcontract agreement is enforceable and covers the causes of action asserted in the cross-complaint. The judge also found that the cross-complainant failed to establish that the provision is unconscionable.
