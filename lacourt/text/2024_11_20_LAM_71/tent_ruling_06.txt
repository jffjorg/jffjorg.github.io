[1] The Court notes Cross-Defendant’s motion indicates it
is specially appearing on this matter. However, Cross-Defendant’s motion is one
to compel arbitration and not one to challenge this Court’s personal
jurisdiction over Cross-Defendant.  (Rockefeller
Technology Investments (Asia) VII v. Changzhou SinoType Technology Co., Ltd.
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 125, 144, cert. denied, 141 S.Ct. 374 (2020) [“When
parties agree to California arbitration, they consent to submit to the
personal jurisdiction of California courts to enforce the agreement and any
judgment under section 1293.”], emphasis added; see C.C.P. §418.10(e)(3)
[“Failure to make a motion under this section at the time of filing a demurrer
or motion to strike constitutes a waiver of the issues of lack of personal
jurisdiction, inadequacy of process, inadequacy of service of process,
inconvenient forum, and delay in prosecution.”].) Cross-Defendant does not
specially appear on this motion; filing the instant motion constitutes a
general appearance.
 


[2] The Court notes Cross-Defendant has not paid its $60.00
reservation fee for this motion to be heard. 
Therefore, this Court’s ruling on the instant motion is not effective
until Cross-Defendant pays the $60.00 fee it owes.
