[1] The Court notes Plaintiff’s opposition is labeled on
the docket at “Memorandum of Points and Authorities” and does not provide the
Court notice that the filing is indeed the Plaintiff’s Opposition to Slurry Explosive
Corporation’s Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted. 
Plaintiff’s counsel is advised to remedy this issue in future filings
before this Court, as this Court has already addressed this issue with Metzger
Law Group on at least one prior occasion. 
Continuing the practice of filing documents with ambiguous titles creates
the potential of this Court not reviewing Plaintiff’s improperly labeled
filings.
