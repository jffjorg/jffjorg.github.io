And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to Slurry Explosive Corporation's motion to deem the truth of the matters specified in their Request for Admissions (Set One) and the genuineness of the documents specified therein, served on Plaintiff Craig Steven Roberts. The court has denied the motion as moot since Craig served his written responses to the Request for Admissions on November 7, 2024. Additionally, the court has denied Slurry's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,270.00, as the notice of sanctions fails to specify the statute it moves under, depriving Craig of due process. The court has ordered Slurry to give notice of this ruling.
