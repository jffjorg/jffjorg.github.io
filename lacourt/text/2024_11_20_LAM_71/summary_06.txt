And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge notes that Cross-Defendant has filed a motion to compel arbitration, but has not paid the required $60.00 reservation fee. As a result, the judge's ruling on the motion is not effective until the fee is paid. The judge also observes that Cross-Defendant is making a general appearance, rather than a special appearance, by filing the motion. The judge cites relevant case law to support the conclusion that Cross-Defendant's failure to pay the fee waives its right to challenge the court's personal jurisdiction.
