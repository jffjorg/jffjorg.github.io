DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff
moves the court for an order imposing terminating sanctions or, in the
alternative, issue and monetary sanctions against Defendants and their attorney
of record on the grounds Defendants continually engage in tactics to prevent
legitimate discovery and fails to obey this Court’s prior order that issued
sanctions against Defendants and their attorney of record. Plaintiff contends
Defendants willfully failed to pay the monetary sanctions and willfully failed
to obey this Court’s prior order that required Defendants to serve code-compliant
supplemental responses, without objection, within 20 days.
 
Where
a party fails to obey an order compelling answers to discovery, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c), 2023.010, subd. (c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative
Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.)  The Court may
impose a terminating sanction against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d).)  Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond to an
authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).)  A
terminating sanction may be imposed by an order dismissing part or all of the
action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3).)   
 
Before
any sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there
has been a willful failure of the party to serve the required answers.  (Fairfield
v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113,
118.)  Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where the party understood
its obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to comply.  (Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior
Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)  The
party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing
that the failure was not willful.  (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.) 
 
Plaintiff
notes that Defendants failed to provide further discovery responses within 20
days after the court’s order on July 13, 2023. (Xu Decl. ¶3.) The court also
issued monetary sanctions against Hats Enterprises in the amount of $1,000.00, against
Hayk Shishoyan in the amount of $1,750.00, and against Defense Counsel for
$2,750, through joint and several liability. (Xu Decl. ¶4.) Defendants nor
Defense Counsel have complied with the court order to pay sanctions despite
Plaintiff following up several times. (Xu Decl. ¶¶7-11.)  On August 7, 2023, Defendants did provide
supplemental responses; however, those responses contained objections, contrary
to court order.  (Xu Decl., ¶4 Exh. B.) Under
the totality of the circumstances, the court cannot conclude that less severe
sanctions would be ineffective and that terminating or issue sanctions are
warranted at this time, despite defendants failure to oppose this motion.   If Defendants still have not complied with
the Court’s July 13, 2023 Order by providing responses without objections, and
if Plaintiff believe they are entitled to further responses, Plaintiff may
pursue other relief through the appropriate discovery motions. 
 
Plaintiff
also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $9,520 together with the unpaid
amount of the previous sanctions amount of $2,750 for a total of $12,270
against Defendants and Defense Counsel, jointly and severally. The court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,750 (prior
court order) and $3,850 for the instant motion for the total of $6,600.00. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions, in the alternative, Issue Sanctions and
Monetary Sanctions against Defendants Hats Enterprises LLC for Misuse of the
Discovery Process is GRANTED, in part. Plaintiff’s Motion
for Terminating Sanctions, in the
alternative, Issue Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions against Defendants Hayk
Shishoyan for Misuse of the Discovery Process is GRANTED, in part. 
 
The court notes that defendant Hats Enterprises, LLC
remains unrepresented by counsel, despite the requirement that it can only
appear in court with counsel.  The court
will not entertain argument from anyone other than properly substituted counsel
at the hearing on this motion for sanctions. 
Further, the court intends to set an OSC re striking of defendant Hat’s
answer for failure to obtain counsel at the upcoming hearing.
