[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s
Second Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED; Defendant’s Motion to Strike is GRANTED.

 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
In support of
their demurrer with motion to strike, Defendant requests this court take
judicial notice of several court documents (RJN, Exhs. 1-3.) The court GRANTS
Defendant’s request for judicial notice. (Evid. Code 452(d).) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant
Topa Insurance Company demurs to the three causes of action concerning breach
of contract and unjust enrichment as well as moves to strike Plaintiff’s claims
for punitive damages.[1]
 
Seventh Cause
of Action
 
Defendant
Topa first demurs to the seventh cause of action for breach of contract on the
grounds that although Plaintiff refers to an alleged contract being attached to
the complaint, there is no contract attached to the complaint. Additionally,
there is no policy language alleged in the second amended complaint.
 
To recover
damages for a breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the existence of
the contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for
non-performance; (3) the defendant’s breach; and (4) the resulting damage to
the plaintiff. (Richman v. Hartley
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) The pleadings must specify that the
contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct. (CCP § 430.10(g).) Further,
“[a] written contract may be pleaded by its terms—set out verbatim in the
complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated
therein by reference—or by its legal effect. [Citation.] In order to plead a
contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance of its
relevant terms. This is more difficult, for it requires a careful analysis of
the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal
conclusions.’  [Citation.]” (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006)
142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489 [citing 4 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (4th ed. 1997) Pleading,
§§ 479-480, pp. 572-73].)
 
Plaintiff
alleges she entered into a contractual obligation with Topa. (SAC ¶101.)
Plaintiff then alleges she entered into a valid and enforceable contract with
Hippo and the Hippo Contract is valid and enforceable against Topa. (SAC ¶102.)
Plaintiff does not allege the terms of the contract other than Topa breached
the agreement by failing to properly investigate the claim and therefore,
ultimately denying Plaintiff’s claim. (SAC ¶105.) Plaintiff has failed to
attach the agreement to the complaint or allege the terms of the agreement
either verbatim or by its legal effect. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff states they are aware of the deficiencies and request
that the court allow Plaintiff leave to amend to address the issues. Plaintiff
does not address how the pleading can be amended successfully. (See Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) 
 
The court
SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to the seventh cause of action. At the hearing,
Plaintiff must address how they plan on addressing the issues raised in the
demurrer so leave to amend may be granted. 
 
Eighth Cause
of Action
 
Defendant
also demurs to the eighth cause of action for third party beneficiary claim for
breach of contract on the same grounds as the demurrer to the seventh cause of
action. For reasons stated above, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer. At the
hearing, Plaintiff must address how they plan on addressing the issues raised
in the demurrer so leave to amend may be granted. 
 
Unjust
Enrichment
 
Defendant
demurs to the twelfth cause of action for unjust enrichment on the grounds California
does not recognize such a cause of action.
 
There is a
split amongst California courts regarding whether unjust enrichment is an
independent cause of action. Some courts have explicitly stated that “there is
no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment.” (Melchior v. New
Line Prods., Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793; McKell v. Wash. Mut.,
Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1490; Jogani v. Superior Court
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 901, 911.) These courts conclude that unjust enrichment
is “not a cause of action ... or even a remedy, but rather a principle,
underlying various legal doctrines and remedies. It is synonymous with
restitution.” (McBride v. Boughton (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 387
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). However, other California
courts have recognized an independent cause of action for unjust enrichment.
(See First Nationwide Sav. v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1662–63;
Lectrodryer v. SeoulBank (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 723, 726.) 
 
The court
follows the line of authority that unjust enrichment may be alleged as cause of
action. (See Professional Tax Appeal v. Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc.
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 230.) 
 
Defendant’s
demurrer on the grounds unjust enrichment is not a cause of action is
OVERRULED. 
 
Motion to
Strike
 
Defendant
moves to strike Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages on the ground Plaintiff
has failed to allege any oppression, fraud or malice committed by Topa. The
only mention of punitive damages throughout the entire complaint is in Plaintiff’s
prayer for relief in which she contends that she prays for judgment in her
favor on all causes of action “for general, special, direct, compensatory, and
punitive damages, with the exact amount to be proven at time of trial.”
 
The court agrees
that the allegations supporting a claim for punitive damages is insufficient. Plaintiff
generally alleges denying the claim was done with malice, fraud, and/or
oppression.  These conclusory allegations
are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. 
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to strike is GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
