And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant, Wilma Almaraz, had challenged the validity of the service of summons, claiming that the process server did not have permission to be at the property where the summons was served. However, the judge found that the plaintiff, Audra Iovino, had met her burden of proving that the service was proper, as the process server had made multiple attempts to serve the defendant personally and had ultimately served a co-resident who was authorized to receive the summons. The judge also noted that the defendant's claims that she was out of the country at the time of service were not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the service was proper. As a result, the judge denied the motion to quash service of summons and ordered the defendant to file and serve her answer to the complaint within 10 days.
