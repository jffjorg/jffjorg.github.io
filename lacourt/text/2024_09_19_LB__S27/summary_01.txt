And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the case and is tentatively ruling in favor of CalPERS, allowing them to recover $656,250.75 from the settlement proceeds. The Judge agrees with CalPERS that they have an enforceable lien on the settlement proceeds and that section 20252 of the Government Code applies. The Judge rejects the Plaintiffs' arguments that CalPERS' recovery should be reduced, citing case law and the plain language of the statute. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs have not shown that they are exempt from the application of section 20252. The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the undisputed declaration of CalPERS' Actuary Seniors, Wingcheong Lee, who calculated the value of Kristin's benefit based on the relevant mortality tables and interest rate. The Judge concludes that CalPERS' lien amounts to $656,250.75, which is the lesser of the two calculations specified in section 20252.
