And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Luis M. Falcon vs. Yolanda Fernandez, Albertina C. Fernandez, and Albertina C. Fernandez 2002 Trust. The case involves a dispute over habitability and tenant harassment.

The judge has sustained the demurrer of the defendants, which means that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim. The complaint is uncertain and does not contain sufficient facts to establish Yolanda's relationship to Albertina or the Trust, or to state the plaintiff's causes of action.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend his complaint. This means that the plaintiff has the opportunity to revise and refile his complaint to include more specific facts and allegations.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to strike, as the demurrer has already been sustained.

The case will be heard again on the specified date, and the parties may submit written arguments or evidence in support of their positions.
