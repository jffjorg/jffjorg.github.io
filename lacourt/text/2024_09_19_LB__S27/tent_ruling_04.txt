 Case Number:  23LBCV02364    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.    
Background Facts
Plaintiff, Bernald Rock filed this action against Defendants, Patricia
J. Danis, Successor Trustee of the Jean L. Davis Revocable Living Trush, Sati
AH, Inc., Castlehead, Inc., Jona Howe, and Vashti Clisby for damages arising
out of a real estate purchase agreement. 

 
Plaintiff’s operative complaint is his First Amended Complaint, which
he filed on 2/29/24.  The FAC includes
causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, fraud, quiet title, and negligence.  
 
Cross-Complainant Sati Ah Inc. (“Sati”) filed a Cross-Complaint (“XC”) against
Cross-Defendants Patricia J. Danis and Orange Coast Title Company on April 25,
2024.  The XC includes causes of action
for breach of statutory duties (Civil Code § 1102, et seq.), fraudulent
concealment, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of contract,
implied indemnity, equitable indemnity, express indemnity, contribution, and
declaratory relief. 
 
            The XC alleges that Sati, a real
estate investor, hired Kelsea Mazzocco as a real estate agent in late 2022 to
help purchase a multi-family property known as the 6th Street Property, which
was marketed as an “investor's dream.” 
During negotiations, Mazzocco informed Sati of an issue with a detached
5-car garage on the property, which was being partially used by the neighboring
property owner, Bernald Rock, without Sati’s knowledge.  To address the potential issue, Danis, the
seller, engaged Orange Coast Title to conduct a title and physical inspection,
which found no claims, encumbrances, liens, or clouds on the title. Relying on
this assurance, Sati proceeded with the purchase on December 9, 2022, and later
modified the purchase agreement to ensure the disputed garage would be vacated
by Rock before the close of escrow. 
However, Rock initiated legal action on December 8, 2023, asserting an
alleged easement granting him access to one of the garage spaces.  Sati disputes the validity and existence of
this claimed easement.
 
On May 31, 2024, Cross-Complainant amended Roe 1 as Real Advantage
Title Insurance Company. 
 
On June 3, 2024, Cross-Defendant Orange Coast Title Company (“OCTC”) filed
a demurrer to the Cross-Complaint.  To
date, no opposition has been filed. 
 
On July 9, 2024, Cross-Defendant Real Advantage Title Insurance Company
filed a demurrer to the Cross-Complaint. 
On September 13, 2024, Cross-Defendant Real Advantage Title Insurance
Company filed a notice to withdraw its demurrer, set for hearing on November 12,
2024.
2.    
Demurrer 
a.     Legal
Standard on Demurrer
A demurrer is a pleading used to
test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading.  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purpose of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true,
however improbable they may be.
 
A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. Blank v. Kirwan 39
Cal.3d 311 (1985). No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no
“speaking demurrers”). A demurrer is brought under CCP § 430.10 [grounds], §
430.30 [as to any matter on its face or from which judicial notice may be
taken], and § 430.50(a) [can be taken to the entire complaint or any cause of
action within].  Specifically, a demurrer
may be brought per CCP § 430.10(e) if insufficient facts are stated to support
the cause of action asserted.  Per CCP
§430.10(a) a demurrer may be brought where the court has no jurisdiction of the
subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading.  Furthermore, demurrer for uncertainty will be
sustained only where the complaint is so bad that the defendant cannot
reasonably respond.  CCP §
430.10(f).  
 
However, in construing the
allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual allegations that
may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations. Financial
Corporation of America v. Wilburn, 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769 (1987). And, if the
facts pled in the complaint are inconsistent with facts which are incorporated
by reference from exhibits attached to the complaint, the facts in the
incorporated exhibits control. Further, irrespective of the name or label given
to a cause of action by the plaintiff, a general demurrer must be overruled if
the facts as pled in the body of the complaint state some valid claim for
relief. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts. (CCP
§ 92(c).)
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. Goodman v.
Kennedy, 18 Cal.3d 335, 348 (1976). The burden is on the complainant to show
the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.) 
 
Finally, CCP section 430.41
requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.” (CCP §430.41(a).) The parties are to meet and confer
at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (CCP
§430.41(a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (CCP §430.41(a)(3).)
 
b.    
Meet
and Confer
Counsel for OCTC, Shadi Namiranian, filed a declaration establishing
the attorneys met and conferred prior to the filing of the demurrer, but were
unable to agree on a resolution of the merits of the pleading challenge.  The demurrer is therefore ripe for
resolution.  
 
c.    
Fourth
Cause of Action, Negligence
OCTC argues that Sati’s fourth cause of action for negligence should be
dismissed because Sati has not sufficiently alleged that OCTC owed a duty of
care or breached any such duty.  To
establish a negligence claim, Sati must demonstrate the existence of a legal
duty of care, a breach of that duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury.  OCTC contends that Sati fails to specify any
law or facts that establish such a duty, and that there was no relationship or
transaction between itself and Sati that would create a duty of care, pointing
out that Sati admits OCTC was hired by Danis (the seller) and that Sati only
learned of OCTC’s actions through its real estate agent.  Additionally, OCTC argues that even if it were
involved in the Title Policy, a preliminary title report or title insurance
policy does not guarantee the state of the title, according to California law.
 
Furthermore, OCTC claims that even if a duty of care existed, there was
no breach of such a duty.  Sati alleges
that OCTC failed to disclose or investigate a purported Garage Easement, but
OCTC argues it had no obligation to disclose an unrecorded easement and had no
knowledge of it.  (XC ¶ 41.)  OCTC asserts that Sati’s allegations are
vague, lack supporting facts, and do not clearly establish a breach of duty.  Additionally, OCTC notes that Sati was already
aware of an “issue” with the garage, which further undermines the claim of a
breach. 
 
Sati provides no arguments in opposition.  The Court finds that OCTC sufficiently shows
that the negligence claim fails as a matter of law. 
 
The demurrer to the fourth cause of action is sustained without leave
to amend.
 
d.    
Fifth
Cause of Action, Breach of Contract
 
OCTC argues that Sati’s fifth cause of action for breach of contract
should be dismissed because Sati has not established that OCTC was a party to
the contract or that the contract terms were breached.  To claim a breach of contract, there must be a
contract between the parties, the plaintiff’s performance or a valid excuse for
nonperformance, the defendant’s breach, and resulting damages.  OCTC asserts that Sati’s claim fails on two
primary grounds.  First, OCTC argues that
it was not a party to the title insurance policy that Sati claims was breached.
 The title policy was issued by a title
insurance company, not OCTC, and OCTC is not named or referenced anywhere in
the policy.  Under California law, a
party that is not a signatory to a contract cannot be held liable for its
breach.  Therefore, OCTC states that Sati
has not adequately alleged the first element required for a breach of contract
cause of action.
 
Second, OCTC contends that even if it were a party to the title
insurance policy, the terms of the policy do not support a breach.  The policy does not guarantee the state of the
title, and there is no contractual term requiring OCTC to disclose or
investigate any title items, including the alleged Garage Easement.  The policy explicitly excludes coverage for
easements, liens, or encumbrances not shown by public records, and the Garage
Easement in question was never recorded.  Additionally, the policy excludes coverage for
items not recorded in public records but known to the insured without written
disclosure to the insurer, which applies here since Sati was aware of the
garage issue but did not provide written notice to OCTC.  Given these policy terms, OCTC argues that
Sati's allegations are conclusory and insufficient to establish a breach of
contract.
 
Sati provides no arguments in opposition.  The Court finds that OCTC sufficiently shows
that the breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law. 
 
The demurrer to the fifth cause of action is sustained without leave to
amend.
 
e.    
Sixth
Cause of Action, Implied Indemnity
OCTC argues that Sati’s sixth cause of action for implied indemnity
fails because Sati has not provided sufficient facts to establish OCTC’s
liability.  To claim implied indemnity,
Sati must demonstrate fault on OCTC’s part and resulting damages for which OCTC
is equitably responsible.  However, Sati
merely makes a general assertion that OCTC should provide indemnity based on
its conduct, without specifying how OCTC is at fault.  Additionally, OCTC notes that it was not a
party to the Title Policy, and Sati’s conclusory statements about OCTC's fault
are vague and lack the necessary factual support to establish a valid claim for
implied indemnity.
 
Sati provides no arguments in opposition.  The Court finds that OCTC sufficiently shows
that the implied indemnity claim fails as a matter of law. 
 
The demurrer to the sixth cause of action is sustained without leave to
amend.
 
f.     
Seventh
Cause of Action, Equitable Indemnity
OCTC argues that Sati’s seventh cause of action for equitable indemnity
fails because it lacks sufficient factual support.  Equitable indemnity requires showing fault on
the part of the indemnitor (OCTC) and resulting damages for which the
indemnitor is equitably responsible.  Sati
claims that OCTC failed to make required disclosures, misrepresented facts, and
was negligent, but these allegations are based on the same insufficient grounds
as Sati’s negligence and breach of contract claims.  OCTC contends that Sati’s claims are
conclusory, lacking any concrete facts to demonstrate OCTC’s fault, and are
therefore vague and uncertain.  Additionally,
OCTC states that Sati does not adequately explain how OCTC’s alleged failure to
discover and disclose the unrecorded Garage Easement constitutes wrongdoing.  
 
Sati provides no arguments in opposition.  The Court finds that OCTC sufficiently shows
that the equitable indemnity claim fails as a matter of law. 
 
The demurrer to the seventh cause of action is sustained without leave
to amend.
 
g.    
Eighth
Cause of Action, Express Indemnity
OCTC argues that Sati’s eighth cause of action for express indemnity
fails because Sati has not adequately established the required elements for
such a claim.  Express indemnity requires
a contractual relationship between the parties, the indemnitee’s performance of
their contractual obligations, a demonstrated loss within the scope of the
indemnification agreement, and the amount of damages sustained.  First, OCTC contends that there is no
contractual relationship between itself and Sati.  Sati claims that OCTC is obligated to
indemnify under a title insurance policy; however, OCTC states that the Title
Policy attached to Cross-Complaint clearly shows that the policy was not issued
by OCTC, nor is OCTC mentioned in it.  Therefore,
OCTC concludes that Sati has not alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate a
contractual relationship with OCTC.
 
Second, OCTC argues that Sati has not shown any loss under the
indemnification agreement.  Sati claims
that OCTC should have ensured the property’s title was free of any
encumbrances, but the alleged loss arises from an unrecorded Garage Easement,
which the Title Policy explicitly excludes from coverage.  Even if OCTC were a party to the Title Policy,
California law establishes that a title insurance policy does not guarantee the
state of the title.  Thus, OCTC states it
had no duty to ensure that the property was free from all encumbrances.  Consequently, OCTC asserts that Sati cannot
claim a loss based on OCTC’s failure to guarantee a clear title, making the
basis for express indemnity uncertain and unsupported by the facts.
 
Sati provides no arguments in opposition.  The Court finds that OCTC sufficiently shows
that the express indemnity claim fails as a matter of law. 
 
The demurrer to the eighth cause of action is sustained without leave
to amend.
 
h.    
Ninth
Cause of Action, Contribution
OCTC argues that Sati’s ninth cause of action for contribution fails
because it lacks the necessary legal and factual basis.  To establish a claim for contribution, there
must be a money judgment rendered jointly against defendants in a tort action,
the application of equitable principles, a payment by one tortfeasor of more
than their pro rata share, and no intentional injury by the tortfeasor. 
 
Sati claims that OCTC must contribute if Sati is found liable to
Plaintiff.  However, OCTC contends that
Sati has not provided any legal or factual grounds to support this claim.  Additionally, OCTC states that Sati’s
contribution claim cannot be based in tort because Sati has not sufficiently
alleged facts to support a negligence claim or any other tort against OCTC.  Moreover, OCTC asserts that Sati fails to
present any facts showing joint liability, equitable considerations in its
favor, or any payment made by itself or another tortfeasor. 
 
Sati provides no arguments in opposition.  The Court finds that OCTC sufficiently shows
that the contribution claim fails as a matter of law. 
 
The demurrer to the ninth cause of action is sustained without leave to
amend.
 
i.     
Tenth
Cause of Action, Declaratory Relief
OCTC argues that Sati’s tenth cause of action for declaratory relief
fails because it does not meet the required elements.  To qualify for declaratory relief, there must
be a proper subject for such relief and an actual controversy involving
justiciable questions about the rights or obligations of a party.  Sati seeks a determination of OCTC’s indemnity
obligations, but OCTC contends that Sati has not provided sufficient facts to
establish a valid claim for indemnity.  OCTC
argues that the Title Policy excludes indemnity coverage for the unrecorded
Garage Easement, and Sati has not presented any other valid basis for
indemnity. 
 
Sati provides no arguments in opposition.  The Court finds that OCTC sufficiently shows
that the declaratory relief claim fails as a matter of law. 
 
The demurrer to the tenth cause of action is sustained without leave to
amend. 
 
3.    
Motion to Strike 
OCTC moves to strike Sati’s prayer for attorneys’ fees.  OCTC argues that Sati’s request for
attorney’s fees against OCTC is not valid because such fees are not provided
for under any contract or California law. 
Sati’s claim for attorney’s fees is based on a Title Policy attached to
the Cross-Complaint. However, OCTC states that the Title Policy only allows for
attorney’s fees if arbitration is initiated, not for court actions.  Moreover, the Title Policy expressly excludes
coverage for unrecorded easements, such as the disputed Garage Easement, which
was never recorded in the public records.
 
Additionally, OCTC points out that it is not a party to the Title
Policy, which was issued by another company.  According to California law, only parties to a
contract can be held liable for breaches or obligated to pay attorney’s fees
under that contract.  Since OCTC is not a
signatory to the Title Policy, it cannot be liable for attorney’s fees. OCTC,
therefore, requests that any claims for attorney’s fees against it be removed
from the Cross-Complaint.
 
Despite the Court’s sustaining of the demurrer, OCTC has shown that there
is no basis for an award of attorney’s fees. 
Thus, the Court GRANTS OCTC’s motion to strike request for attorney’s
fees. 
 
4.    
Conclusion
The demurrer is sustained as to the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh,
eighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action without leave to amend.  The motion to strike is granted.
 
OCTC is ordered to give
notice.
