And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to tax costs. The defendants seek to recover costs associated with expert witness fees, deposition fees, service of process fees, court reporter fees, jury fees, and filing and motion fees. The plaintiff argues that the costs are not reasonable and should be taxed. The judge finds that the defendants' costs were reasonably incurred and made in good faith. The judge denies the motion to tax the costs for expert witness fees, deposition fees, service of process fees, jury fees, and filing and motion fees, but grants the motion to tax the costs for court reporter fees. The judge orders the moving defendants to give notice and sets a deadline for parties to submit on the tentative ruling.
