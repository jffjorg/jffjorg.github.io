 Case Number:  22LBCP00448    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.    
Background Facts
Plaintiff Roger Kavigan sued defendant Cody Mattingly on December 1,
2022, for (1) civil harassment (Code Civ. Proc., § 527.6), (2) trespass, and
(3) declaratory and injunctive relief. 
As alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint: Defendant contacted him on an online
dating site in November 19, 2022; later that day, Defendant entered Plaintiffs’
property without permission and falsely, and loudly, accused him of having
sexual relations with minors. Defendant was not a minor. Defendant recorded his
interaction with Plaintiff and posted it to the Internet along with Plaintiff’s
personal information. Plaintiff’s employer placed him on administrative leave
on November 21, 2022. Plaintiff sued ten days later.
The parties tried the case before the Court over three days in June and
July 2024. On July 18, 2024, the Court entered judgment for Defendant on the
first cause of action for civil harassment, but for Plaintiff on the second
cause of action for trespass, awarding Plaintiff $10,000.00 to compensate him
for emotional distress.
On July 11, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees.
Plaintiff filed his opposition on August 26, 2024. Defendant filed no reply.
2. Legal Standard
California applies the “American Rule”
to litigation fees and costs: a prevailing party to litigation is entitled to
recover costs from its opponent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032(b).) But a prevailing
party is presumptively not entitled to recover attorneys’ fees. (See id.,
§ 1033.5(a)(10).) 
Notwithstanding the default rule, a
prevailing party may recover fees only if specially authorized by contract,
statute, or law. (Ibid.) If a prevailing party establishes that
contract, statute or law entitles it to fees, the court may award fees
“reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation” and “reasonable in
amount”. (Id., § 1033.5(c)(2)-(3).)
3. Discussion
a. Defendant is not entitled to fees under the anti-SLAPP statute.
As an initial matter, the Court disposes of what it assumes is a
typographical error. Defendant asserts in passing in his moving papers that he
may recover under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, California’s
“anti-SLAPP” statute. (See Mot., 3:12-16.) Section 425.16 was never raised in
this case and is irrelevant to this motion.
b. Defendant may recover fees under section 527.6.
Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6 permits “[a] person who has
suffered [civil] harassment” to “seek a temporary restraining order and an
order after hearing prohibiting harassment”. (Code Civ. Proc., § 527.6(a)(1).)
Subdivision (s) states that “[t]he prevailing party in an action brought
pursuant to [section 527.6] may be awarded court costs and attorney’s fees, if
any.” (Id., subd. (s).)
“[D]etermination of the prevailing party [for purposes of section 527.6]
lies in the trial court’s sound discretion.” (Elster v. Friedman (1989)
211 Cal.App.3d 1439, 1443-1444 [interpreting predecessor section 527(h) by
reference to CCP sections 1021.5 and 1032].) “A plaintiff prevails ... when he
gets most or all of what he wanted by filing the action. ‘A plaintiff will be
considered a prevailing party when the lawsuit “ ‘was a catalyst motivating
defendants to provide the primary relief sought’ ” or succeeded in “
‘activating defendants to modify their behavior.’ ” ’ ” (Ibid.,
internal citations omitted.)
If the primary relief Plaintiff sought was a monetary judgment, then it
was his trespass claim, not his civil harassment claim, that secured it for
him. If the primary relief he sought was discontinuance of Defendant’s
harassment, the relief was unnecessary. The Court found in its judgment in part
that “Defendant has not returned to the Plaintiff’s property”. (07-18-2024
Judgment, ¶ 3.) No injunctive relief was necessary because there was no need to
induce Defendant to modify his behavior going forward.
Plaintiff brought a claim under section 527.6, and Defendant prevailed;
Defendant is entitled to fees according to section 527.6.
c. The Court reduces Defendant’s fees considerably because Defendant’s
claim is excessive.
            Defendant seeks $78,648.50 in
attorney’s fees, plus another $8,400.00 for this motion, plus $5,443.24 in
costs, for a total award of $92,491.74.
“[T]he starting
point of every fee award ... must be a calculation of the attorney's services
in terms of the time he has expended on the case. Anchoring the analysis to
this concept is the only way of approaching the problem that can claim
objectivity, a claim which is obviously vital to the prestige of the bar and
the courts.”  (In re Vitamin Cases (2003) 110 Cal. App. 4th 1041,
1058, citation omitted.) The determination of reasonable amount of attorney
fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.) The Court
“need not simply award the sum requested.” (Id.) 
“[T]he primary method
for establishing the amount of ‘reasonable’ attorney fees is the lodestar
method. The lodestar (or touchstone) is produced by multiplying the number of
hours reasonably expended by counsel by a reasonable hourly rate.” (Thayer
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal. App. 4th 819, 833.) Under this approach, a base amount is calculated from a
compilation of time reasonably spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each
attorney. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48; Serrano v. Unruh
(1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 639.)
Counsel’s $525 hourly rate is reasonable for an attorney of his
experience in the Los Angeles legal market. But the hours Defendant seeks to
recover for are unreasonably inflated.
The parties tried the case to the Court over three days, totaling approximately
twelve (12) hours of court time. There was no extensive motion practice in this
case. But Defendant claims his counsel spent a surprising nearly one hundred
fifty (150) hours on the case, plus sixteen (16) hours to prepare this single
motion for fees.
“[R]easonableness of attorney fees is ... to be
determined from a consideration of such factors as the nature of the
litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and expertise of
counsel and the amount of time involved. The court may also consider whether
the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson
v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) Parties may only recover fees
“ ‘for all hours reasonably spent ... .’ [Citation.]” (Meister v.
Regents of University of California (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 437, 448-449.)
Crucially here, “[a] fee
request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting
the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether. [Footnote.] ‘If ...
the Court were required to award a reasonable fee when an outrageously
unreasonable one has been asked for, claimants would be encouraged to make
unreasonable demands, knowing that the only unfavorable consequence of such
misconduct would be reduction of their fee to what they should have asked for
in the first place. To discourage such greed, a severer reaction is needful...
.’ [Citation.]” (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.)
Defendant is entitled to fees,
but he seeks an extraordinarily inflated amount. The Court in its discretion
cuts his requested award by approximately two-thirds to account for the
unreasonable request, and to ensure an award of only those hours reasonably
spent. The Court makes the same adjustment to Counsel’s legal secretary’s
billing (8 hours at $175.00), cutting the secretary’s time to 2.5 hours.
Based on this adjustment, the Court awards fees
totaling $26,687.50 (50 hours x $525.00 hourly, 2.5 hours x $175.00 hourly). 
d. Costs
“Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is
entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5
enumerates certain costs that are presumptively allowable, other presumptively
not allowable, and leaves those unenumerated to the discretion of the trial
court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)-(b).) Regardless of whether a cost is
expressly allowable, it may only be awarded if it is “reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to
its preparation”, and it must be “reasonable in amount.” (Id., subd.
(c)(2)-(3).)
Defendant seeks three categories of costs: (1)
filing fees, (2) deposition costs, and (3-5) costs of preparing trial binders,
incurred at Office Depot, Staples, and Amazon. 
The former two categories are awardable and
reasonable. (Id., subds. (a)(1) [filing fees], (a)(3)(A) [deposition
costs], (c)(3) [“reasonable in amount”].) The Court grants the request.
As to the third category, trial binder
preparation: Defendant claims a total of $2,344.44 spent on binders, tabs, and
copying. (Sattro Decl., 4:25-5:2.) The Court finds the amount only partly
awardable. Specifically, $1,154.98 of Counsel’s costs are only evidenced by a
debit card transaction record and a receipt that refers to the cost as “JDA
GMILL ORDE” [sic]. (See Sattro Decl., Exh. F.) Particularly given
Counsel’s otherwise inflated request, he has not demonstrated this ambiguous charge
is reasonable or necessary. The Court strikes it in its entirety.
The Court finds the remaining $973.08
unreasonable solely for the preparation of exhibit binders, particularly where
supplemental purchases were made from Staples and Amazon. (Id., Exhs.
G-H.) As with the fee award, the Court cuts the Office Depot charge only by two
thirds, to a total of $324.36.
The Court therefore awards costs as follows: $924.10
in filing fees, $2,174.00 in deposition costs, and $540.74 for preparation of
trial binders and exhibits, for a total of $3,638.34.
 
4. Conclusion
The Court grants Defendant’s motion in part. Defendant is awarded $26,687.50
in fees and $3,638.34 in costs, for a total of $30,326.34.
 
Moving Defendant is ordered to give notice.
