And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion by the individual defendants, Hamid Mahrou and Peyman Mahrou, for summary adjudication of the issues. The motion argued that there was an absence of evidence showing that the defendants were the alter egos of Parmida, LLC. The judge found that the plaintiff had presented admissible evidence to support a "unity of interest" between the defendants and Parmida, including admissions by Hamid, documents filed with the California Secretary of State, and other evidence. The judge also found that the defendants had failed to meet their burden of showing that the plaintiff could not reasonably expect to obtain a prima facie case. Therefore, the motion was denied, and the case will proceed to the scheduled hearing date.
