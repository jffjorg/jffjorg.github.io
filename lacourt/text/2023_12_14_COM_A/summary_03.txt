Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (Metro) motion to file a cross-complaint against the City of Los Angeles. The City had previously filed a cross-complaint against Roes, and Metro seeks to assert claims for indemnity, declaratory relief, contribution, and apportionment of fault. Metro's investigation and claims presentation were delayed due to the need to comply with the Government Tort Claims Act, and it has now obtained additional information to evaluate the incident. The judge finds that Metro acted in good faith in not filing the cross-complaint at the time of its answer and grants the motion. Metro is ordered to file its cross-complaint forthwith.
