The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.BACKGROUNDThis action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiff sustained in a motor vehicle accident on June 26, 2021.On May 25, 2023, Plaintiff Normajean Yamashita (“Plaintiff” or “Yamashita”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Ahmed Helmy (“Defendant” or “Helmy”) and Does 1 to 10, alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle liability. Subsequently, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint on December 6, 2023.On August 15, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”), along with a request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney of record.  On November 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a declaration in response to the Motion No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the Court.ANALYSIS“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)Additionally, “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response ... [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)A. Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set OneDefendant’s counsel, Jason Ahdoot (“Ahdoot”), attests that on December 21, 2023, Plaintiff was served by email with the first set of Special Interrogatories. (Ahdoot Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “A.”) This service established that responses were due on January 24, 2024, incorporating a two-court-day extension for electronic service under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. Ahdoot’s office made multiple follow-up attempts in June and July of 2024, both in writing and via telephone, requesting that Plaintiff provide responses as soon as possible. (Id. ¶ 5.) Despite these efforts, no responses had been received by the time Defendant filed this Motion. (Id. ¶ 6.)In contrast, Plaintiff’s counsel, Marshall C. Sanders (“Sanders”), claims that Plaintiff has now provided responses to Defendant’s written discovery requests, including the Special Interrogatories at issue. (Sanders Decl. ¶ 2.) Based on the records presented, the Court concludes that the part of the motion to compel Plaintiff‘s initial responses is moot, as untimely responses have been served. Nonetheless, the Court must proceed to address the remaining issues, specifically the relief of waiver and monetary sanctions.Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), “[t]he court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”Here, Sanders merely asserts that responses have been provided, without providing any additional factual basis for the Court to assess its compliance. Moreover, Sanders attributes the untimely responses to the Special Interrogatories, Set One, to a series of circumstances. These include the extended absence of his long-term administrative assistant, who was unable to work for over a year due to work-related injuries, and the temporary legal assistant, who tested positive for COVID-19 twice this year. (Id. ¶¶ 6-8.) Additionally, Sanders indicates that he has to meet with his client, Plaintiff, in person to obtain information, as Plaintiff – who is nearly 86 years old – does not have a computer and cannot rely on assistance from her husband, who is experiencing medical issues. (Id. ¶ 9.) Finally, Sanders notes that he has been required to miss work hours due to personal family matters. (Id. ¶ 10.)     Notwithstanding these explanations, the Court observes that the declaration was submitted without accompanying opposition papers. As a result, the Court finds that relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a) is unavailable in this circumstance, as Plaintiff has not made a substantive factual showing sufficient to satisfy the two requisite elements for relief from waiver: (1) that Plaintiff’s untimely responses are in substantial compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240, and (2) that the failure to serve timely responses was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s unopposed Motion. Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, constitutes a waiver of any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) However, the portion of Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s initial responses is DENIED AS MOOT, as Plaintiff served responses prior to the hearing. If Defendant deems it necessary, he may file a separate motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 to compel further responses.B. Monetary SanctionsPursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust....”Additionally, California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(a) further provides, “The Court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)The Court finds that the mandatory sanctions apply in this case. Considering the substantial similarities between this Motion and several other discovery motions filed concurrently by Defendant, and utilizing the lodestar approach, the Court determines the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the Motion to be $290.00, calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $230.00 for one hour reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.CONCLUSIONDefendant Ahmed Helmy’s Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED IN PART, as outlined in the foregoing ruling.Defendant Ahmed Helmy’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. Plaintiff Normajean Yamashita and her attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay $290.00 to Defendant’s attorney of record within 20 days.Moving party to give notice.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED IN PART. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN
PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiff
sustained in a motor vehicle accident on June 26, 2021.
 
On May 25, 2023, Plaintiff Normajean Yamashita (“Plaintiff”
or “Yamashita”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Ahmed Helmy (“Defendant” or “Helmy”) and Does 1 to 10, alleging
one cause of action for motor vehicle liability. Subsequently, Defendant filed
an Answer to the Complaint on December 6, 2023.
 
On August 15, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (the
“Motion”), along with a request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her

ANALYSIS
 
“If a party to
whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails
to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One
 
Defendant’s counsel, Jason
Ahdoot (“Ahdoot”), attests that on December 21, 2023, Plaintiff was served by
email with the first set of Requests for Production of Documents. (Ahdoot Decl.
¶ 4, Ex. “A.”) This service established that responses were due on January 24,
2024, incorporating a two-court-day extension for electronic service under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. Ahdoot’s office made multiple follow-up
attempts in June and July of 2024, both in writing and via telephone,
requesting that Plaintiff provide responses as soon as possible. (Id. ¶
5.) Despite these efforts, no responses had been received by the time Defendant
filed this Motion. (Id. ¶ 6.)
 
In contrast, Plaintiff’s counsel, Marshall C. Sanders
(“Sanders”), claims that Plaintiff has now provided responses to Defendant’s
written discovery requests, including the Requests for Production at issue.
(Sanders Decl. ¶ 2.) 
 
Based on the records
presented, the Court concludes that the part of the motion to compel
Plaintiff‘s initial responses is moot, as untimely responses have been served. Nonetheless,
the Court must proceed to address the remaining issues, specifically the relief
of waiver and monetary sanctions.
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a), “[t]he court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
 
Here,
Sanders merely asserts that responses have been provided, without providing any
additional factual basis for the Court to assess its compliance. Moreover,
Sanders attributes the untimely responses to the Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One, to a series of circumstances. These include the extended
absence of his long-term administrative assistant, who was unable to work for over
a year due to work-related injuries, and the temporary legal assistant, who tested
positive for COVID-19 twice this year. (Id. ¶¶ 6-8.) Additionally,
Sanders indicates that he has to meet with his client, Plaintiff, in person to obtain
information, as Plaintiff – who is nearly 86 years old – does not have a
computer and cannot rely on assistance from her husband, who is experiencing
medical issues. (Id. ¶ 9.) Finally, Sanders notes that he has been
required to miss work hours due to personal family matters. (Id. ¶ 10.)     
 
Notwithstanding these explanations, the Court observes that the
declaration was submitted without accompanying opposition papers. As a result, the
Court finds that relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,
subdivision (a) is unavailable in this circumstance, as Plaintiff has not made
a substantive factual showing sufficient to satisfy the two requisite elements
for relief from waiver: (1) that Plaintiff’s untimely responses are in substantial
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280, and (2) that the failure to serve timely responses was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s unopposed Motion.
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond to Defendant’s Requests for Production of
Documents constitutes a waiver of any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) However, the portion of Defendant’s motion to compel
Plaintiff’s initial responses is DENIED AS MOOT, as Plaintiff served responses
prior to the hearing. If Defendant deems it necessary, he may file a separate
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 to compel further
responses.
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Monetary
sanctions, as outlined under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300
subdivision (c) are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand,
unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Additionally,
California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(a) further provides, “The Court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
The Court finds that the mandatory
sanctions apply in this case. Considering the substantial similarities between
this Motion and several other discovery motions filed concurrently by
Defendant, and utilizing the lodestar approach, the Court determines the total
and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $290.00, calculated based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $230.00 for one hour reasonably spent, plus a $60.00
filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s request for
monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Ahmed
Helmy’s Motion to Compel Responses to Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One, is GRANTED IN PART, as outlined in the foregoing
ruling.
 
Defendant
Ahmed Helmy’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Plaintiff
Normajean Yamashita and her attorney of record are ordered to jointly and
severally pay $290.00 to Defendant’s attorney of record within 20 days.
