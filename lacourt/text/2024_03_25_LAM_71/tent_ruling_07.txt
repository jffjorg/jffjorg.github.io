[1] Plaintiff’s counsel declares that he served
objections on Defendant’s counsel, and the objections are attached as Exhibit 2
to his declaration.  (See Decl. of
Benyamin ¶2.)  However, Exhibit 2 appears
to be a copy of the complaint.  The Court
regards the inclusion of this paragraph in Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration to
have been included in error.
