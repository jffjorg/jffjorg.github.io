 Hearing Date:  March 25, 2024



 
Defendant Stephen Pattillo dba Quality Stamp Show and Orcoexpo’s motion for a protective
order against pro per Plaintiff Wesley Robbins’ Special Interrogatories
(Set Three) is granted.
 
          Defendant
Stephen Pattillo dba Quality Stamp Show and Orcoexpo’s (“S. Pattillo”)
(“Defendant”) moves for a protective order against pro per Plaintiff
Wesley Robbins’ (“Robbins”) (“Plaintiff”) Special Interrogatories (Set Three)
(“SROG”) propounded on him on the basis Plaintiff has exhausted the number of
allowed specially prepared interrogatories, a majority of the interrogatories
fall outside of the scope of discovery, and otherwise constitute an unwarranted
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, and undue burden and expense. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §2030.090.)  
 
          Background
On August 12, 2022,
Plaintiff served SROG Set One propounded to Defendant, which consisted of 410
interrogatories.  (See Decl. of
Mallory ¶3, Exh. A.)  While SROG Set One
included a Declaration for Additional Interrogatories, the set was largely
outside the scope of discoverable information because many of the
interrogatories did not relate to any claims or defenses at issue in this
litigation. (See Decl. of Mallory ¶3, Exh. A.)  Defendant’s counsel conveyed a meet and confer
letter regarding his issues with SROG Set One on September 13, 2022.  (See Decl. of Mallory ¶4, Exh. B.)  After meet and confer efforts, Plaintiff
agreed to not pursue response SROG Set One in exchange for Defendant’s
withdrawal for his own SROG Set One propounded on Plaintiff.  (See Decl. of Mallory ¶5.)
On March 25, 2023,
Plaintiff served SROG Set Two propounded to Defendant, comprised of an additional
65 interrogatories.  (See Decl. of
Mallory ¶6, Exh. C.)  While SROG Set Two
included a Declaration for Additional Interrogatories, many of the
interrogatories continued to be outside the scope of discoverable information
because many of the interrogatories did not relate to any claims or defenses at
issue in this litigation.  (See Decl.
of Mallory ¶6, Exh. C.)  Defendant’s
counsel conveyed a meet and confer letter regarding his issues with SROG Set
Two on April 21, 2023, but the parties were unable to reach a resolution.  (See Decl. of Mallory ¶7, Exh. D.) 
Defendant filed a Motion
for Protective Order in regard to SROG Set Two on April 26, 2023, and was heard
on June 29, 2023.  (6/29/23 Minute Order.)  This Court denied Defendant’s motion and instructed
Defendant to assert his objections and respond to the interrogatories.  (See 6/29/23 Minute Order.)
Defendant served his
response to SROG Set Two on August 21, 2023. (See Decl. of Mallory ¶9,
Exh. E.)  Plaintiff requested an Informal
Discovery Conference (“IDC”) to discuss his issues with Defendant’s responses
to SROG Set Two, during which the Court instructed Defendant to provide further
responses. (See Decl. of Mallory ¶10.) 
On October 9, 2023, Defendant served his amended responses to SROG Set
Two.  (See Decl. of Mallory ¶11,
Exh. F.)
On October 25, 2023,
Plaintiff served SROG Set Three propounded to Defendant.  (See Decl. of Mallory ¶12, Exh. G.)  SROG Set Three is comprised of an additional
70 interrogatories.  (See Decl. of
Mallory ¶12, Exh. G.)  At this juncture,
the total number of interrogatories Plaintiff has propounded to Defendant to
date is 545 interrogatories.  (See
Decl. of Mallory ¶¶3, 6, 12.)  SROG Set
Three included a Declaration for Additional Interrogatories.  (See Decl. of Mallory ¶12, Exh. G).
On November 28, 2023, Defendant
filed the instant motion.  On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed his
opposition.  On March 18, 2024, Defendant filed his reply.  
 
Meet and Confer
          Defendant’s counsel declares that on
November 3, 2023, his office conveyed a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff regarding
the issues discussed in this motion and requested Plaintiff to contact his
office to discuss SROG Set Three by November 20, 2023.  (Decl. of Mallory ¶13, Exh. H.)  Defendant’s counsel declares Plaintiff failed
to contact his office by the stated deadline.  (Decl. of Mallory ¶14.)  Defendant’s counsel declares that on November 22,
2023, his office conveyed a second meet and confer letter to Plaintiff regarding
the issues discussed in this motion and requested Plaintiff to contact his
office to discuss SROG Set Three by November 27, 2023.  (Decl. of Mallory ¶15, Exh. I.)  Defendant’s counsel declares that on November
27, 2023, Plaintiff contacted him via telephone and communicated his intent to
propound additional discovery with no meaningful good faith effort to reach an
informal resolution for the issues discussed herein.  (Decl. of Mallory ¶16.)  The Court finds Defendant’s counsel’s
declaration states facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the matter
outside of court.  (C.C.P. §§2016.040,
2033.080(a).)  Therefore, Defendant’s motion is proper and
will be considered.
 
Legal Standard 
C.C.P. §2030.090(b)
provides, “[T]he court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice
requires to protect any party or other natural person or organization from
unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and
expense. [A] protective order may include, but is not limited to, one or more
of the following directions: . . . (2) That, contrary to the representations
made in a declaration submitted under Section 2030.050, the number of specially
prepared interrogatories is unwarranted.” 
(C.C.P. §2030.090(b)(2).)
C.C.P §2030.030(b) states
that “no party shall, as a matter or right, propound to any other party more
than 35 specially prepared interrogatories.”  (C.C.P §2030.030(b).)  Any additional specially prepared
interrogatories must be accompanied with a declaration for additional discovery
stating the reason why a greater number of interrogatories is warranted,
because of the complexity or quality of the issues in the matter, the financial
burden on a party conducting discovery by oral deposition, or the expedience of
using special interrogatories to provide the responding party an opportunity to
investigate.  (See C.C.P.
§§2030.040, 2030.050.)
The decision upon whether
to enter a protective order lies within the sound discretion of the court.  (Raymond Handling Concepts
Corp. v. Superior Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 584, 588, 591; Meritplan Insurance
Co. v. Superior Court (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 237, 242.)  Moving
parties have the burden to show good cause for the protective order.  (Emerson
Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1101,
1110.)   
A party may demand the
production of documents within the scope of discovery and responding party’s
possession, custody, or control.  (C.C.P §2031.010(a)-(b).)
 The scope of discovery is defined as
“any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in
the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action,
if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010).  Despite the liberal construction of discovery
statutes, discovery seeking information that is not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, is outside of the scope of
discovery and thus not discoverable.  (See
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1968)
263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19).
 
          Discussion
Defendant’s motion for protective order is granted.  Plaintiff failed to meet his burden of
justifying the number of interrogatories he propounded on Defendant.  (C.C.P. §2030.040(b).)  Plaintiff’s Declaration for Additional
Discovery served with SROG Set Three fails to state a viable reason as to why
the number of interrogatories over the limit imposed by C.C.P. §2030.030(b) is warranted. 
(Decl. of Mallory ¶13, Exh. H at pg. 14.)  
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion for a protective order is granted.
Moving Party to give notice.
