of this ruling.
Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff is denied.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Defendant is denied.
 
           Defendant Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.,
Inc. (“TMS”) (“Defendant”) moves to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Omar
Hernandez Santiago (“Santiago”) (“Plaintiff”) to appear for deposition and
produce documents and things within fifteen (15) days of this Court’s ruling.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2;
C.C.P. §§2025.280(a), 2025.450; Gov. Code §68607.)
 
           Meet and Confer
A
motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a declaration stating
facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P.
§§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Defendant’s
counsel declares that along with the deposition notice on January 20, 2024, she
sent a meet and confer letter requesting for alternative dates if the
unilaterally scheduled date did not work for Plaintiff and/or his attorneys.  (Decl. of Yao ¶6, Exh. C.)  Defendant’s counsel declares that Plaintiff’s
counsel has ignored all of Defendant’s meet and confer correspondences.  (Decl. of Yao ¶11.)   Defendant’s counsel’s declaration does not
indicate if she attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel by
telephone.  Defendant’s counsel’s
declaration does not substantially comply with the requirements of C.C.P. §2016.040.  Regardless, the Court in its discretion will
consider Defendant’s motion.
 
Background
On March 17, 2022, Defendant served a notice for the
deposition of Plaintiff set for March 30, 2022, and Plaintiff objected to the
deposition notice the following day. 
(Decl. of Yao ¶2, Exh. A.)  
On July 8, 2022, Defendant filed a Motion to Compel
Arbitration which was granted on January 4, 2023.  (Decl. of Yao ¶3.)  Plaintiff never initiated arbitration and
then filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Court’s January 4, 2023, Order
three months later.  (Decl. of Yao
¶4.)  Plaintiff’s Motion for
Reconsideration was not heard until September 28, 2023, wherein this Court reversed
its prior ruling and the instant case has returned to state court.  (Decl. of Yao ¶4.)
On January 20, 2024, Defendant served an amended
notice of deposition set for February 20, 2024. 
(Decl. of Yao ¶5, Exh. B.)  Having
received no objections to the amended deposition, on February 16, 2024, Defendant
sent the deposition link to Plaintiff’s counsel.  (Decl. of Yao ¶7, Exh. D.)  On the date of the deposition, February 20,
2024, after waiting for five minutes with no one appearing, Defendant’s counsel
e-mailed Plaintiff’s counsel to inquire when Plaintiff and his counsel would
appear.  (Decl. of Yao ¶8.)  After ten minutes past the scheduled start
time, Defendant’s counsel called Plaintiff’s counsel and left a voice message.  (Decl. of Yao ¶9.)  After fifteen minutes, Plaintiff still had
not appeared and the court reporter took a notice of non-appearance.  (Decl. of Yao ¶10, Exh. E.)
Defendant filed the instant motion on February 27,
2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on March
13, 2024.  Defendant filed its reply on
March 18, 2024.
 
           Discussion
C.C.P. §2025.280(a) provides, in part, “[t]he
service of deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to require any
deponent who is a party to the action . . . to attend and to testify, as well
as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”  (C.C.P. §2025.280(a).)
C.C.P. §2025.450 states, in pertinent part, as
follows:
(a) If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action . . . , without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, . . . described in the deposition
notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the
deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any
document, . . .  described in the
deposition notice.
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any
document . . . described in the deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails
to attend the deposition and produce the documents . . . described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450.)
           The
Court grants Defendant’s motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders
Plaintiff to appear for deposition and produce documents and things within
fifteen (15) days of this Court’s ruling.  Plaintiff was properly served with two
deposition notices and failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition.
           Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion is granted.

is denied for lack of proper notice.

Conclusion

days of this ruling.
Defendant’s request for sanctions
against Plaintiff is denied.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
against Defendant is denied.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
