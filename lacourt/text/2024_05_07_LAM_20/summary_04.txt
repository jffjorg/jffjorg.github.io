And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings should be denied. The plaintiff, a law firm, claims that the defendant, a former client, failed to compensate them for services rendered. The defendant argues that the plaintiff abandoned the case and is therefore entitled to no payment. The judge has rejected this argument, citing case law that a client can be liable for attorney fees received as part of a settlement. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment are sufficient to state a cause of action. The defendant's argument that the conversion clause in the retainer agreement is invalid was also rejected, with the judge noting that the State Bar requires careful evaluation of such clauses on a case-by-case basis.
