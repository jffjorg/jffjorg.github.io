And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is in regards to a lemon law matter. The parties have settled the matter and agreed that the plaintiffs, Angel Ismael Juarez and Miguel Juarez, are prevailing parties entitled to fees and costs. The defendants, Nissan North America, Inc. and Wish Automotive, Inc., contend that the fees should not be awarded because they made a reasonable repurchase offer before the suit was filed. However, the court finds that the initial repurchase offer did not encompass all available relief, making it reasonable to pursue litigation. The court also reduces the hourly rates of the counsel and awards the requested amount of fees and costs.
