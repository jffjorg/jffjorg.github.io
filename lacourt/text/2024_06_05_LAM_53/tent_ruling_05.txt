[1] Defendants
have presented different circumstances in support of their motion for
reconsideration, as required by section 1008, because (1) Plaintiff did not raise
the affirmative defense of offset in her oppositions to the subject motions in
limine, and instead raised this argument at the hearing, such that Defendants
did not present argument and authority addressing this issue in support of
their motions in limine, and (2) Defendants have now briefed the issue of whether
Plaintiff may present the subject evidence in support of her affirmative
defense of offset.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1008, subd. (a); Nemececk Decl., ¶ 3.) 
The court also finds that it is appropriate to grant, on its own motion,
reconsideration of its order denying Defendants’ motions in limine numbers 2
and 13.  (Flynn, supra, 4
Cal.App.5th at pp. 100-101.)
