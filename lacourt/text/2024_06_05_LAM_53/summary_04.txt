And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for reconsideration filed by the Plaintiff and Defendants. The Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration was denied because the court finds that the Plaintiff did not support her contention that the Defendants' conduct in connection with the Moore v. Smith action "has always been part of" this action. The court also finds that the evidence regarding the Defendants' conduct in connection with the Moore v. Smith action is not relevant to the Plaintiff's affirmative defense of offset. The court granted the Defendants' motion in limine numbers 2 and 13. The court ordered that the Plaintiff shall not introduce evidence relating to the matter of Moore v. Smith (Case No. LC101816) and that the Plaintiff's standard of care expert, Marc Sallus, shall not present his expert opinion regarding the filing of the Moore v. Smith (Case No. LC101816) action.
