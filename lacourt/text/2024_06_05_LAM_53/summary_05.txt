And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion for reconsideration. The defendants have argued that the plaintiff did not properly raise the affirmative defense of offset in their opposition to the motions in limine, and instead raised it at the hearing. The court finds that the defendants did not have the opportunity to address this issue in their briefs. As a result, the court grants the motion for reconsideration and will reconsider its order denying the defendants' motions in limine.
