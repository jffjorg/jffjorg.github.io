RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Turnover Order for Artwork
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff and judgment creditor 101 Pine Street, LLC (“Judgment
Creditor”) moves the court for a turnover order for assignment and possession
of certain personal property and documentary evidence thereof belonging to
defendants and judgment debtors Jeroen Bik and Miray Bik (“Judgment Debtors”). 
“[A]t the conclusion of a proceeding pursuant to this article, the
court may order the judgment debtor’s interest in the property in the
possession or under the control of the judgment debtor or the third person or a
debt owed by the third person to the judgment debtor to be applied toward the
satisfaction of the money judgment if the property is not exempt from
enforcement of a money judgment.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 708.205, subd. (a).)  The
court may not order property or debt to be applied toward the satisfaction of a
money judgment pursuant to this statute “[i]f a third person examined pursuant
to Section 708.120 claims an interest in the property adverse to the judgment
debtor or denies the debt and the court does not determine the matter as
provided in subdivision (a) of Section 708.180 . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.205, subd. (b).) 
Similarly, “[i]f a writ of execution is issued, the judgment creditor
may apply to the court . . . for an order directing the judgment debtor to
transfer to the levying officer either or both of the following: [¶] (1)
Possession of the property sought to be levied upon if the property is sought
to be levied upon by taking it into custody. 
[¶]  (2) Possession of documentary
evidence of title to property of or a debt owed to the judgment debtor that is
sought to be levied upon.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 699.040, subd. (a).)  The court
may issue an order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 699.040 “upon a
showing of need for the order.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 699.040, subd. (b).) 
On January 12, 2023, the court entered judgment pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1710.25 in favor of Judgment Creditor and against Judgment
Debtors in the total amount of $140,547.08, consisting of (1) $138,473.17 on
the sister state judgment, (2) $1,638.91 in accrued interest on the sister
state judgment, and (3) $435 in filing fees for entry of the sister state
judgment.  (Jan. 12, 2023 Judgment, p.
1.)  Thereafter, on September 18, 2023, a
writ of execution was issued.  
Judgment Creditor has presented evidence establishing (1) that it “has
been unsuccessful in collecting any amounts under its Judgment” from Judgment
Debtors, and (2) that, during the debtor examinations of Judgment Debtors,
Judgment Debtors identified $85,000 in artwork that is located in their
property on Cavalleri Road (in Malibu, California), and not pledged to any
other creditor.  (Allyn Decl., ¶ 5; Allyn
Decl., Ex. 3, Aug. 9, 2023 Judgment Debor Examination Transcript, pp. 61:18-21
[testifying that the art that is the subject of the appraisal belongs to
Judgment Debtors], 62:2-10, 63:16-18 [testifying that Judgment Debtors have not
pledged any pieces of the subject artwork and sculptures to other creditors];
Allyn Decl., Ex. 4 [Appraisal Report for Judgment Debtors’ artwork].)  Judgment Debtors have not filed an opposition
to this motion, contending that Judgment Creditor does not have a need for a
turnover order, that Judgment Debtors are not in possession of the subject
property, or that the property is exempt from enforcement of a money
judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 699.040,
subd. (b) [court may issue turnover order “upon a showing of need for the
order”], 708.205, subd. (a) [court may issue turnover order “if the property is
not exempt from enforcement of a money judgment”].)  
Thus, the court finds that Judgment Creditor has met its burden to
show that the court may issue a turnover order as requested because Judgment
Creditor has shown that (1) a writ of execution has been issued, but that
Judgment Creditor has not recovered the amounts due under the judgment, such
that Judgment Creditor has shown “need for the [turnover] order” pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 699.040, and (2) a judgment debtor examination
as to both Judgment Debtors has taken place, such that Judgment Creditor has
shown that the court may issue a turnover order pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 708.205.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 699.040, subds. (a), (b), 708.205, subd. (a).)  The court therefore grants Judgment Creditor’s
motion.  (Ibid.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff and
judgment creditor 101 Pine Street, LLC’s motion for turnover order for artwork.

            The court will sign and file the
proposed “Turnover Order for Artwork Against Defendants / Judgment Debtors
Jeroen Bik and Miray Bik,” lodged by judgment creditor 101 Pine Street, LLC on
October 5, 2023, as modified by the court. 
            The court orders plaintiff and
judgment creditor 101 Pine Street, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  June 5, 2024
