And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22CHCV00801, which involves a motion to designate plaintiff Margarita Carranza as a vexatious litigant. The defendants, Jennifer Craig-Ford, et al., argue that the plaintiff has engaged in frivolous litigation and has repeatedly filed motions to reopen a dismissed action. The plaintiff, in turn, claims that the defendants have fraudulently withheld settlement proceeds from a previous lawsuit.

The judge has granted the defendants' request to take judicial notice of the existence of the court filings and docket, but has denied their request to take judicial notice of the content of the filings for the truth of the matter asserted.

The judge has also granted the defendants' request to stay the litigation pending the outcome of the motion to designate the plaintiff as a vexatious litigant. The hearing on the motion has been continued to March 4, 2024.

The judge has noted that the parties have been engaged in a dispute over the legitimacy of the settlement proceeds and the deduction of expenses, and has determined that the parties will not be prejudiced by the continuance of the hearing.
