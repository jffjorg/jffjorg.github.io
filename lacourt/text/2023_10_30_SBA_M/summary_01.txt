And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motion to relieve counsel Alex Valenzuela as attorney of record for plaintiff Mia Morgan White. The motion is continued to allow counsel to provide notice of the hearing date and to submit a properly filled out proposed order. The court notes that the original hearing was scheduled for September 7, 2023, but was continued to October 30, 2023, and that there is no proof of service filed as to the continued hearing date. Additionally, the motion only seeks to relieve counsel Valenzuela, but there are two attorneys listed on the caption of the complaint, including Joseph H. Elias. The court also notes that defense counsel filed a notice of change of firm name and eservice email address on July 6, 2023, but moving counsel served defense counsel at the old firm name and email address. The court is exercising its discretion to allow counsel to withdraw, but only if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
