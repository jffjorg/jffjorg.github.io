And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of plaintiffs Steve Algert and Cameron Brown to strike and/or tax costs. The motion was filed in response to the defendant's memorandum of costs, which sought $9242,783.30 in costs. The judge found that the plaintiffs are the prevailing parties in this action because they obtained their objective of restoring their ocean view, which was obstructed by the defendant. The defendant had refused to comply with the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs) that required him to remove the offending vegetation, but eventually did so after being sued. The judge concluded that the plaintiffs' main litigation objective was to remove the offending vegetation, and the defendant's removal of the vegetation accomplished that goal. Therefore, the judge granted the plaintiffs' motion and struck the defendant's memorandum of costs in its entirety.
