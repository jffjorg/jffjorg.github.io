And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to quash service of process. The defendant, Khachatus Serobyan, was allegedly involved in an automobile collision with the plaintiff, Evelyn Avalos, on October 13, 2021. The plaintiff filed a complaint on June 27, 2023, and served the defendant with process on July 7, 2023. However, the defendant argues that the service of process was defective because the plaintiff failed to make good faith efforts to personally serve him, did not mail copies of the complaint and summons to him, and did not serve him at his residence on the date and time listed in the proof of service. The court agrees with the defendant's arguments and finds that the plaintiff failed to comply with the requirements for service of process. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion to quash service of process.
