English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, dismissing the City of Los Angeles's demurrer to the complaint. The plaintiffs, Ovidio M. Gonzalez, Mayra E. Gonzalez, Eli A. Gonzalez, and Anthony S. Camacho, allege that a Los Angeles Police Department officer caused an automobile collision that injured them on November 14, 2021. They claim to have filed a government claim with the City of Los Angeles on May 2, 2022. The City argues that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the claims presentation requirements, but the judge finds that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged compliance with the requirements. The judge therefore overrules the demurrer and orders the City to file and serve its answer to the complaint within 30 days.
