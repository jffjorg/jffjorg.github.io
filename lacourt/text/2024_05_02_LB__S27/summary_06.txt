And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the City of Long Beach in response to the complaint filed by David Cain and Red Ball Fun Zone, Inc. The City contended that the plaintiffs' failure to file a timely government tort claim bars their claim. However, the judge has ruled that the demurrer was not timely filed or served, as the City failed to provide the required statutory notice. Despite this, the judge has chosen not to overrule the demurrer solely on this ground and has instead continued the hearing on the demurrer for one month to allow the parties to respond substantively to the demurrer. The hearing is now scheduled for June 4, 2024.
