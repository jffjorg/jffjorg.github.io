And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a petition to approve a compromise of minor in a wrongful death lawsuit. The court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds it to be fair and reasonable. The court is concerned about the attorneys' fees allocation, which is 39.34% of the minor's settlement, and wishes to hear from counsel and the guardian ad litem (GAL) at the hearing to discuss the appropriate fee. Assuming the court is satisfied with the testimony and/or there is an agreement concerning attorneys' fees, the court will approve the petition. The court also notes that the plaintiff, a minor, will not be required to appear in person at the hearing, due to their age.
