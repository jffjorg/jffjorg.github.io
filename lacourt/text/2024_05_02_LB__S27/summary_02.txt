Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the motion to compel discovery in a Song-Beverly Act case. The court previously ordered the parties to meet and confer to resolve their discovery disputes, but the parties failed to do so. The court has reviewed the plaintiff's statement of discovery dispute and finds that the parties have failed to resolve their disputes relating to Requests for Production and Documents (RPDs) concerning documents and information about the subject vehicle. The court has ruled in the plaintiff's favor in the past on similar issues and finds that documents relating to other customers' complaints about the subject vehicle are relevant and admissible in this case. The court grants the motion to compel and orders the defendant to serve further responses without objections within 10 days.
