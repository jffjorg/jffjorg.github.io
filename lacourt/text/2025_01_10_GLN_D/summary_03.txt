  - The court notes that there does not appear to be any imminent default or equivalent with respect to this party at this time.
  - The motion will be denied for failure to establish by any type of evidence that the moving party has any interest whatsoever in this lawsuit, or that the insurer is facing a potential default situation.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the unopposed motion for leave to intervene filed by Farmers Insurance Exchange. Farmers Insurance Exchange seeks to intervene in the action to prevent a default judgment against the insured, Déjà Vu Restaurant and Banquet, Inc., which is allegedly the owner of the valet service where Kazbek Khatagov was stabbed. The court finds that the moving party has failed to establish by any type of evidence that it has any interest whatsoever in this lawsuit, or that the insurer is facing a potential default situation.

The court notes that the motion lacks sufficient evidence connecting Déjà Vu Restaurant and Banquet, Inc. to a named defendant in this action, and fails to explain how the intervenor's interest or ability to protect its interest in the disposition of this action is being impeded. The court also notes that there does not appear to be any imminent default or equivalent with respect to this party at this time.

The court is denying the motion without prejudice, and the parties are encouraged to make arrangements in advance if they wish to appear via LACourtConnect.
