BACKGROUND
                
On June 6, 2023, Plaintiffs American
Outdoor Advertising LLC and Riddle Legacy LLC filed a commercial unlawful
detainer complaint against Defendant KBS Holdco, LLC.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken
to the whole complaint or to any of the causes of action in it.  (CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only the legal
sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual allegations or the
plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations. 
(Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.
App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court must treat
as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law. 
(Id. at 732-33.)  The
complaint is to be construed liberally to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendant demurs to the complaint on
the ground that Plaintiffs failed to provide legally adequate notice of the
3-day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. Defendant asserts the notice itself and the
method of service of the notice are defective. The Court of Appeal has
discussed adequate service of notice as follows:
 
According to the statutes governing unlawful detainer proceedings, “ ‘a
tenant is entitled to a three-day notice to pay rent or quit which may be
enforced by summary legal proceedings (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161) but this notice
is valid and enforceable only if the lessor strictly complies with the
specifically described notice conditions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1162.)’ ” (Kwok
v. Bergren, supra, 130 Cal.App.3d at p. 600, 181 Cal.Rptr. 795, quoting Lamey
v. Masciotra (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 709, 713, 78 Cal.Rptr. 344.) Stated
another way, “[p]roper service on the lessee of a valid three-day notice to pay
rent or quit is an essential prerequisite to a judgment declaring a lessor's
right to possession under section 1161, subdivision 2. [Citations.]” (Liebovich,
supra, 56 Cal.App.4th at p. 513, 65 Cal.Rptr.2d 457.) “A lessor must allege
and prove proper service of the requisite notice. [Citations.] Absent evidence
the requisite notice was properly served pursuant to section 1162, no judgment
for possession can be obtained. [Citations.]” (Ibid.)
 
(Palm Property
Investments, LLC v. Yadegar (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419,
1425.)
 
CCP § 1162(b) provides,
 
(b) The notices required by Section 1161 may be served upon a commercial
tenant by any of the following methods:
(1) By delivering a copy to the tenant personally.
(2) If he or she is absent from the commercial rental property, by
leaving a copy with some person of suitable age and discretion at the property,
and sending a copy through the mail addressed to the tenant at the address
where the property is situated.
(3) If, at the time of attempted service, a person of suitable age or
discretion is not found at the rental property through the exercise of
reasonable diligence, then by affixing a copy in a conspicuous place on the
property, and also sending a copy through the mail addressed to the tenant at
the address where the property is situated. Service upon a subtenant may be
made in the same manner.
 
                Plaintiffs allege “Plaintiff
served its ‘3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit; 3-Day Notice to Cure or Quit; Real Property
Commonly Known as 1320 South Santa Fe Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90021 (APN
5168-031-024)’ on both KBS and Regency via certified first class mail to the
notice addresses indicated in the Sublease, as well as personal service via
courtesy copies delivered to KBS’ known most-recent current business address
and counsel.” (Compl. 16.) Mail service is not permitted under CCP § 1162(b); also, it is unclear whether
“personal service” on Defendants’ most recent business address was completed
correctly. Plaintiffs have failed to allege proper service of notice. 
 
Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with
leave to amend.
