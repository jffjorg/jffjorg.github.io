And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the complaint filed by defendant KBS Holdco, LLC is sustained with leave to amend. The complaint filed by plaintiffs American Outdoor Advertising LLC and Riddle Legacy LLC alleged that defendant failed to provide legally adequate notice of the 3-day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit, and that the notice itself and the method of service of the notice were defective. The judge found that the complaint failed to allege proper service of the notice, and that the method of service used by the plaintiffs (mail service) was not permitted under CCP § 1162(b). The judge has given the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to cure the defect in service of notice.
