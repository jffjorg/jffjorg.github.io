And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant, Vazgen Khachatryan, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Believe in Big Change, Inc. The plaintiff alleges breach of contract, violation of State Security Deposit Laws, and other related claims. The defendant argues that several of the causes of action are superfluous and lack independent tort liability.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action, alleging violation of State Security Deposit Laws, as it appears to be an alternative theory on which recovery may be made. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, alleging breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it appears to be superfluous and rely on the same underlying facts as the breach of contract claim.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, alleging unfair business practices, as it appears to be an alternative theory on which recovery may be made. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, alleging conversion, as it appears to be based on breach of contract and lacks independent tort liability.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, alleging unjust enrichment, as there appears to be a split of authority on whether unjust enrichment is a cause of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the seventh cause of action, alleging negligence, as it appears to be based solely on breach of contract and lacks independent tort liability.

The judge has given the defendant 30 days to amend its demurrer, if desired.
