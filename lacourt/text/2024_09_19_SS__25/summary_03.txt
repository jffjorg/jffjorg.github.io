And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to declare the mobilehome abandoned without prejudice. The petition was filed by the Fountains La Verne MHP Associates, L.P. against Sylvia Vargas and Armando Vargas. The petition alleged that the mobilehome, located in a mobilehome park in La Verne, California, had not been occupied and that the owners had not paid rent since September 1, 2023. The court found that the petition had demonstrated that the mobilehome was abandoned within the meaning of Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1). However, the court denied the petition because the petitioner failed to serve the notice of belief of abandonment with return receipt requested and failed to submit copies of return receipts. The court ordered the petitioner to give notice of the denial of the petition.
