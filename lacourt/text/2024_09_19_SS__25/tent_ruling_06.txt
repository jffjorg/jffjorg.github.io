BACKGROUND
 
On April 16, 2024,
Plaintiff Believe in Big Change, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant
Vazgen Khachatryan (“Defendant”)
for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Violation of State Security Deposit Laws
(California Civil Code § 1950.7); (3) Breach of Implied Duty of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing; (4) Unfair Business Practices; (5) Conversion; (6) Unjust
Enrichment; and (7) Negligence.
 
On August 14, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer
to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh causes of action. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Defendant
demurs to the second through seventh causes of action on the basis that Plaintiff's
first cause of action is labeled as “breach of contract due to failure to
return Security deposit”, and the remaining 6 causes of action also seek a return
of the security deposit and the exact same remedies merely under different
labels. Thus, they are superfluous. Further, this contractual right action does
not support a negligence claim. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            No
opposition has been filed. 
 
REPLY
 
            No reply
has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
            “The
primary function of a pleading is to give the other party notice so that it may
prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly
notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56
Cal.4th 203, 240.) “A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the factual
allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v.
Bank of America, N.A. (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to
whether “the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action or
discloses a complete defense.” (Ibid.)
The Court does not “read passages from a complaint in isolation; in reviewing a
ruling on a demurrer, we read the complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their
context.’ [Citation.]” (West v. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.) The Court “assume[s] the
truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations, facts that reasonably can be
inferred from those expressly pleaded and matters of which judicial notice has
been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56
Cal.4th p. 240.) “The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions,
deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v.Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)
 
            A
general demurrer may be brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (e) if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action
asserted or under section 430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no
jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All
other grounds listed in Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision
(f), are special demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited
jurisdiction courts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).)
 
            Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on
the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.
(Ibid.) 
 
            Finally,
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a
demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in
person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five
days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
 
II.        Discussion
 
            Defendant has satisfied the meet and confer requirement.
(Anaya Decl., ¶¶2-3.)
 
a.       Violation of State Security Deposit
Laws (Civil Code § 1950.7)
 
            Defendant
argues this claim is superfluous because it is based on the same underlying
failure to return the security deposit, which is the basis of the breach of
contract action. However, a complaint may state multiple legal theories upon
which recovery might be predicated for one claim for relief. (See Newhall
Land & Farming Co. v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 334, 351.)
Further, a party may plead alternative legal theories and make inconsistent
allegations in the pleading. (See Mendoza v. Rast Produce Co., Inc.
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1402; Rader Co. v. Stone (1986) 178
Cal.App.3d 10, 29.)
 
            As this cause of action appears to
be an alternative theory on which recovery may be made, the demurrer to the
second cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
b.       Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing
            
            All
contracts impose upon each party an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing
as part of its performance and its enforcement. (Foley v. Interactive Data
Corporation (1988) 47 Cal.3d 654, 683.) Under the implied covenant, each
contracting party must “refrain from doing anything to injure the right of the
other to receive the agreement’s benefits.” (Jordan v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1072.) In sum, the implied covenant “fills in”
gaps in contracts in order to effectuate the intentions of parties or protect
their reasonable expectations. (Ibid.) Consequently, a breach of the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing is treated as a breach of the
underlying contract. (Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit,
Inc. (1990) 222 Cal. App. 3d 1371, 1393.) Claims for breach of the implied
covenant are demurrable if they only replicate another cause of action for
breach of contract contained within the same pleading, seeking the same damages
and relying on the same underlying facts. (Careau, supra at 1395.)
 
            Here,
Plaintiff appears to be seeking the same damages and relying on the same
underlying facts as the breach of contract claim. Thus, the demurrer to the
third cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
c.      
Unfair Business Practices
 
            Defendant
appears to be arguing that the claim is superfluous, but it is not entirely
clear from the moving papers. To the extent that is the argument, the Court
reiterates that Plaintiff may bring alternative theories of recovery.
Accordingly, the demurrer to the fourth cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
d.     
Conversion
 
            The general
rule is that neither negligence, active or passive, nor a breach of contract,
even though it results in injury, to or loss of, specific property, constitutes
a conversion. (Taylor v. Forte Hotels Int. (1991) 235 Cal. App. 3d 1119,
1124, citing Emmert v. United Bank etc. Co. (1936) 14 Cal.App.2d 1, 4.) As
the claim is based on breach of the contract, the demurrer to the fifth cause
of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. 
 
e.      
Unjust Enrichment
 
            Defendant
argues there is no cause of action for unjust enrichment. However, there
appears to be a split of authority as to whether unjust enrichment is a cause
of action. (See Melchior v. New Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 779, 793, Jogani v. Superior Court (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 901, 911, Lectrodryer v. Seoulbank (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 723, 726, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v.
Dintino (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 333, 346, and Peterson v. Cellco
Partnership (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593.) Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
demurrer to the sixth cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
f.       
Negligence
 
            Defendant
argues that a defendant generally does not have a duty to prevent purely
economic loss to third parties under negligence law. (Quelimane Co. v.
Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 58).
 
            “Conduct
amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates
an independent duty arising from principles of tort law.” (Applied Equipment
Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 515.) “The same act
may be both a tort and a breach of contract. Even where there is a contractual
relationship between the parties, a cause of action in tort may sometimes arise
out of the negligent manner in which the contractual duty is performed, or out
of a failure to perform such duty.” (Eads v. Marks (1952) 39 Cal.2d 807,
810; internal citations omitted.)
 
            “Despite
the fact that a negligent failure to perform contractual obligations
constitutes a tort, the injured party may recover only contractual damages
unless ‘the duty that gives rise to tort liability is either completely
independent of the contract or arises from conduct which is both intentional
and intended to harm.’” (Stop Loss Ins. Brokers, Inc. v. Brown &
Toland Medical Group (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1059, quoting Erlich
v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 552.) “Focusing on intentional conduct gives
substance to the proposition that a breach of contract is tortious only when
some independent duty arising from tort law is violated.” (Erlich at
553-554.)
 
            Here, the
action appears to only arise from breach of contract, and there does not appear
to be independent tort liability for the purely economic loss. Accordingly, the
demurrer to the seventh cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is OVERRULED
in part and SUSTAINED in part with thirty (30) days leave to amend.
            
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
