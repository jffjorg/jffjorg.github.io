And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over whether the plaintiff must produce a retained expert witness, Dr. Tamorah Hunt, for deposition. The defendants, California Back and Pain Specialists and Vikram Singh, M.D., moved to compel the plaintiff to produce Dr. Hunt for deposition, but the Judge has denied the motion. The Judge found that the defendants failed to comply with the applicable statutes and rules, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.450 and 2025.480, and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346. The Judge also noted that the defendants did not serve the motion on Dr. Hunt, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480. As a result, the Judge denied the motion and ordered the defendants to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
