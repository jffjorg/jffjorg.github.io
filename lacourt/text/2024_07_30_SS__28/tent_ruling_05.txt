 Case Number:  22STCV39084    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  28  On December 16, 2022,
Plaintiffs Alejandro Trejo and Daniel Barajas filed this action against
Defendants Henry Nash (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for motor vehicle tort and
general negligence. 
          On January 24, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a proof of service
showing personal service on Defendant of the summons, complaint, and other
documents on January 19, 2023. 
          On May 13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a proof of service showing
substituted service on Defendant of statements of damages on April 10, 2024. 
          On May 28, 2024, Defendant filed an answer. 
          On May 29, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
          On June 3, 2024, Plaintiffs filed applications for default
judgment.  Also on June 3, 2024, the
Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request. 
          The Court vacates the default entered on May 29, 2024.  Defendant filed an answer before the clerk
entered the default.  Therefore, the default
was improper.  For the same reason, the
Court also denies Plaintiffs’ applications for default judgment. 
          The Court will schedule a trial setting conference on a
date to be determined by the Judicial Assistant.
