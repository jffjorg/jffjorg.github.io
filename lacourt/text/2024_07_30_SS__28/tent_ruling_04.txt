LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Motions to compel  
On
January 8, 2024, Defendant served (1) supplemental demands for production of
documents and things, set two, and (2) supplemental interrogatories, set two, on
Plaintiffs. 
On
February 9, 2024, Plaintiffs served unverified responses.  "Where a verification is required [citation], an unverified response is ineffective; it is the equivalent of no response at all."  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 8:1113, pp. 8F-54 to 8F-55.) 
Defendant’s
counsel met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel about Plaintiffs’ verifications.  Despite Plaintiffs' counsel's promises to provide the verifications, Defendant did
not receive the verifications by the time Defendant filed these motions (on May
23, 2024) or by the time Defendant filed the reply (on June 10, 2024).  Plaintiffs argue the Court should deny Defendant’s motions to compel because Plaintiffs’ counsel intended
to provide the verifications prior to the June 17, 2024 hearing.  Plaintiffs have not informed the Court whether they served the verifications.  The
Court grants Defendant's motions.  The Court
orders Plaintiffs to provide verified code-compliant
responses to the supplemental demand for production of documents and things without
objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by August 29, 2024.  The Court orders Plaintiffs to provide
verified code-compliant responses to the supplemental interrogatories without
objections by August 29, 2024. 
B.   Sanctions requests 
Defendant
requests $760.00 in sanctions on each motion to compel based on four hours of
attorney time at $175.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel spent two hours preparing each motion
and two hours to travel and appear at the hearing. 
The
Court awards Defendant $645.00 in sanctions for both motions based on three
hours of attorney time and two filing fees. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Jeffrey Forst’s motion to compel Plaintiff Edgardo
Diaz’s responses to supplemental demand for production of documents and things,
set two, and orders Plaintiff Edgardo Diaz to
provide verified code-compliant responses to the supplemental demand for
production of documents and things without objections and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by August 29, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Jeffrey Forst’s motion to compel Plaintiff Carmina
Tiscareno’s responses to supplemental demand for production of documents and
things, set two, and orders Plaintiff Carmina Tiscareno to provide verified
code-compliant responses to the supplemental demand for production of documents
and things without objections and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by August
29, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Jeffrey Forst’s motion to compel Plaintiff Edgardo
Diaz’s responses to supplemental interrogatories, set two, and orders Plaintiff
Edgardo Diaz to provide verified code-compliant responses to the supplemental interrogatories
without objections by August 29, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Jeffrey Forst’s motion to compel Plaintiff Carmina
Tiscareno’s responses to supplemental interrogatories, set two, and orders
Plaintiff Carmina Tiscareno to provide verified code-compliant responses to the
supplemental interrogatories without objections by August 29, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Jeffrey Forst’s requests for sanctions and orders
Plaintiffs Edgardo Diaz and Carmina Tiscareno
and their counsel to pay Defendant Jeffrey Forst $645.00 by August 29, 2024.
