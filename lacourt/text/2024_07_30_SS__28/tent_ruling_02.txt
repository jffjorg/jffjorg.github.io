in special damages, and 1,287.89 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff
requests $15,753.37 in special damages, consisting of the following: 
          Orthopaedic
Surgery Specialists:         $2,675.78          Prohealth
Advanced Imaging Center:  $926.34          Vargo
Physical Therapy:                     $2,230.35          The
Rawlings Company:                     $9,920.90 
          However,
The Rawlings Company paid for medical expenses that appear to duplicate some or
all of the other medical expenses Plaintiff is asking to include as special
damages.  For example, The Rawlings
Company paid for medical services provided by Stephan Yacoubian, who appears to
be a doctor at Orthopaedic Surgery Specialists. 
(See exhibits 1, 4.)  The Rawlings
Company also paid for medical services provided by Vikram Shaker and Shmuel
Mahgerefteh, who appear to be doctors at Prohealth Advanced Imaging
Center.  (See exhibits 2, 4.)  In addition, the Rawlings Company paid for services provided by Alejandro Aguilar, who appears to work for Vargo
Physical Therapy.  (See exhibits 3, 4.) 
Therefore, it is unclear whether Plaintiff is entitled
to more than $9,920.90 in special damages. 
In addition, although Plaintiff is entitled to an
award of general damages, Plaintiff has not provided evidence supporting his
request for $500,000.00 in general damages. The Court denies the application without prejudice.  
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without
prejudice Plaintiff Hagob
Kevorkian’s application for default judgment against Defendants Pacifico S. Ner, Maria C. Ner, Ner
Family Trust, and Mehial F. Evseff filed on July 9, 2024. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
