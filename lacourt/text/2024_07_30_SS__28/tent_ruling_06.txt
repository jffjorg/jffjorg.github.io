LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Party depositions
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. 
*
* *
 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
B.   Expert depositions 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2034.410 provides: 
“On receipt of an expert witness list from a party,
any other party may take the deposition of any person on the list. The
procedures for taking oral and written depositions set forth in Chapters 9
(commencing with Section 2025.010), 10 (commencing with Section 2026.010), and
11 (commencing with Section 2028.010) apply to a deposition of a listed trial
expert witness except as provided in this article.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2034.410.) 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.460, subdivision (a),
provides: 
“The service of a proper deposition notice accompanied
by the tender of the expert witness fee described in Section 2034.430 is
effective to require the party employing or retaining the expert to produce the
expert for the deposition.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.460,
subd. (a).) 
C.   Deponent’s failure to answer questions or produce documents 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480 provides: 
“(a) If a
deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production. 
“(b) This
motion shall be made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record
of the deposition, and shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040. 
“(c) Notice
of this motion shall be given to all parties and to the deponent either orally
at the examination, or by subsequent service in writing. If the notice of the
motion is given orally, the deposition officer shall direct the deponent to
attend a session of the court at the time specified in the notice. 
* * * 
“(h) Not less
than five days prior to the hearing on this motion, the moving party shall
lodge with the court a certified copy of any parts of the stenographic
transcript of the deposition that are relevant to the motion. If a deposition
is recorded by audio or video technology, the moving party is required to lodge
a certified copy of a transcript of any parts of the deposition that are
relevant to the motion. 
“(i) If the
court determines that the answer or production sought is subject to discovery,
it shall order that the answer be given or the production be made on the
resumption of the deposition. 
“(j) The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subds. (a), (b), (c), (h),
(i), (j).) 

DISCUSSION 
On
November 20, 2022, Plaintiff designated Dr. Hunt as a retained expert.  On February 12, 2024, Defendants noticed Dr.
Hunt’s deposition for March 8, 2024.  Plaintiff
did not respond or object to the deposition notice. 
On
March 6, 2024, Defendants served an amended deposition notice scheduling Dr.
Hunt’s deposition for April 2, 2024.  Plaintiff
again did not object to the notice of Dr. Hunt’s deposition.  Defendants attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff
to see if she would produce Dr. Hunt for a deposition.  Plaintiff did not respond. 
Defendants
ask the Court to compel Dr. Hunt’s deposition under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2025.450 and 2025.480.  “Depositions of expert witnesses
normally are governed by [Code of Civil Procedure section] 2034.010 et seq.,
which provides a detailed procedure for the exchange of expert witness
information shortly before trial and deposing experts so disclosed.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 8:467.10, p. 8E-18.) 
By its terms, Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.450
does not apply to expert witnesses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a) [statute applies to deposition
notices served on “a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230”].)  Dr. Hunt does not fall into any of the statutory categories. 
While Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480 might
apply to expert witness depositions when an expert witness fails to answer
questions or produce documents, Defendants have not complied with the statute’s
terms by serving their motion on Dr. Hunt. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (c) [“Notice of this motion
shall be given to all parties and to the deponent either orally at the
examination, or by subsequent service in writing”]; see Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1346 [“A written notice and all moving papers supporting a motion to
compel an answer to a deposition question or to compel production of a document
or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally served on the
nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service by mail
or electronic service at an address or electronic service address specified on
the deposition record”].)  The proof of
service for Defendants’ motion lists only Plaintiff. 
Defendants are not without a remedy (if they qualify
to use it).  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.300
[with certain exceptions, “on objection of any party who has made a complete
and timely compliance with Section 2034.260, the trial court shall exclude from
evidence the expert opinion of any witness that is offered by any party who has
unreasonably failed to . . . (d) Make that expert available for a deposition .
. .”].) 
The Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the motion to compel Plaintiff to produce retained expert Tamorah
Hunt, Ph.D., for personal appearance at a deposition filed by Defendants
California Back and Pain Specialists and Vikram
Singh, M.D. aka Vikramjeet Singh, M.D. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
