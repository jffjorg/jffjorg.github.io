English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Hagob Kevorkian's application for default judgment against Defendants Pacifico S. Ner, Maria C. Ner, Ner Family Trust, and Mehial F. Evseff, without prejudice. The Plaintiff is seeking $517,041.26 in damages, consisting of $500,000.00 in general damages, $15,753.37 in special damages, and $1,287.89 in costs. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support his request for $500,000.00 in general damages. Additionally, the Court notes that some of the medical expenses claimed by the Plaintiff appear to be duplicated by payments made by The Rawlings Company, which may reduce the amount of special damages the Plaintiff is entitled to. The Court orders the Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
