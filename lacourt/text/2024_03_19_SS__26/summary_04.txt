And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant, Joseph Sguigna's motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against him. The motion was filed on February 27, 2024, and was supported by an affidavit of fault, which explained that the defendant's failure to file a responsive pleading was due to accidental attachment of the response to the proof of service filed on November 2, 2023. The Court finds that the defendant is entitled to relief from the entry of default and default judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The defendant is ordered to file, serve, and reserve a hearing date for the motion to strike within 30 days of the order.
