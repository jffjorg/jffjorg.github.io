Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling dismisses the Petition to Correct Arbitration Award filed by Brett Shannon and Doris Parker against Raul Barrera and Barrera's Landscape. The Petition was filed and served after the statute of limitations expired, and the grounds for the Petition are defective. The Judge finds that the Petition fails to show that the statute of limitations should be tolled and that the arbitrator's determination was not imperfect as a matter of form. The Judge also notes that the Court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrator.
