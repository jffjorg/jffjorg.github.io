ANALYSIS:
 
On May 8, 2023, Plaintiffs Nicholas Porretta and Rachel
Porretta (“Plaintiffs”), in propria persona, filed this action to quiet title against
Defendants Juan Zenito (Defendant) and “All Persons Claiming any Right, Title,
or Interest in the Property Described Herein.” Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint on May 12, 2023 and Defendant, also in propria persona, answered on
June 30, 2023. 
 
Plaintiffs filed
the instant Motion to Reclassify on February 9, 2024. No opposition has been
filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Motion to
Reclassify is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 403.040,
which allows a plaintiff to file a motion for reclassification of an action
within the time allowed for that party to amend the initial pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) If the motion is made after the time for the
plaintiff to amend the pleading, the motion may only be granted if (1) the case
is incorrectly classified; and (2) the plaintiff shows good cause for not
seeking reclassification earlier. (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).) In Walker
v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262, the California Supreme Court
held that a matter may be reclassified from unlimited to limited only if
it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff's damages will necessarily
be less than the jurisdictional limit. (Walker v. Superior Court (1991)
53 Cal.3d 257.) The jurisdictional limit, effective January 1, 2024, is
$35,000.00. (Code Civ. Proc., § 85, subd. (a).) 
 
In Ytuarte v.
Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 278, the Court of Appeals
examined the principles it set forth in Walker and held that “the court should reject the plaintiff's effort to
reclassify the action as unlimited only when the lack of jurisdiction as an
“unlimited” case is certain and clear.” (Id. at 279.) Plaintiffs’ burden is to present evidence to demonstrate
a possibility that the damages will exceed [the jurisdictional limit] and the
trial court must review the record to determine “whether a judgment in excess
of [the jurisdictional limit] is obtainable.” (Ibid.) 
 
As the instant Motion was filed after the time to amend the
complaint, Plaintiffs must show both good cause for the timing of the request
and that the case is incorrectly classified. Plaintiffs demonstrate that the
Complaint was incorrectly classified due to their clerical error in filing out
the Civil Case Cover Sheet. (Motion, Porretta Decl., ¶2.) Upon discovery of
this mistake, Plaintiffs promptly filed the instant Motion. (Ibid.) Additionally,
the case is incorrectly classified insofar as Plaintiffs only seek declaratory
and injunctive relief with respect to real property. (See Compl. and FAC.) This
relief is not available in the limited jurisdiction court. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
85, 86.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs
Nicholas Porretta and Rachel Porretta’s Motion to Reclassify is GRANTED. THIS CASE IS RECLASSIFIED AS AN UNLIMITED
CIVIL CASE AND TRANSFERRED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION/TRANSFER DESK FOR COLLECTION
OF FEES AND REASSIGNMENT TO AN UNLIMITED JURISDICTION COURT. PLAINTIFF IS TO
PAY THE RECLASSIFICATION FEE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
