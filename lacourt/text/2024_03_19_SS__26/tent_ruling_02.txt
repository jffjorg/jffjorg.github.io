Clara Baldwin Stocker  Home for Women, et al.MOTION TO ENTER  JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO STIPULATION(CCP  § 664.6) TENTATIVE RULING:   Plaintiff F&W Distribution,  LLC’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED. JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED  IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,730.95,  PRINCIPAL, $465.17 COSTS, AND  $75.26 INTEREST.     ANALYSIS:   On February 22,  2023, Plaintiff F&W Distribution, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for  breach of contract and common counts against Defendant Clara Baldwin Stocker Home for Women aka Clara Baldwin Stocker (“Defendant”)  and Charles Brugh (“Brugh”). Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement on  March 29, 2023 and concurrently dismissed Brugh. The Motion for Stipulated  Judgment was filed on February 13, 2024.    Legal Standard   The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section  664.6, which states in relevant part:   If parties to pending litigation  stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court  or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the  court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties  to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.  (a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the  litigants themselves, not their attorneys.   (Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current  statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”  and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement  must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,  and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.  Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the settlement agreement complies with  the statutory requirements set forth above as it was signed by both parties. (Motion,  Stern Decl., p. 4.)   The settlement provides that  Defendant would pay Plaintiff $20,771.39 through monthly payments upon  execution of the agreement in March 2023. (Id. at Attachment A, ¶3.) The  settlement agreement also provides that if Defendant defaults, Plaintiff may  seek judgment in the settlement amount, less any monies paid. (Id. at  Attachment A, ¶4.) Payments of $4,320.00 were made towards the settlement,  after which Defendant defaulted. (Id. at Attachments C-D.) Based on the  foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to entry of judgment against Defendant in the  amount of $5,192.85 principal ($20,771.39 - $15,122.37), $456.17 costs, and  interest of $75.26. (Id. at ¶7.) On March 18, 2024, Counsel for Plaintiff informed the Court that Defendant has made additional payment with two checks totalling $3,461.90  which may be deducted from the principal. The Court will adjust the judgment accordingly.   Conclusion  Plaintiff F&W Distribution, LLC’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED. JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,730.95,  PRINCIPAL, $465.17 COSTS, AND $75.26 INTEREST.      Moving party to give notice.
