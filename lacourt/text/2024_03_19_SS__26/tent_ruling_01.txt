Shannon v. Barrera, et al.PETITION
TO VACATE ARBITRATION AWARD(CCP § 1285, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioners Brett Shannon and
Doris Parker’s Petition to Correct Arbitration Award is DISMISSED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On November 14, 2023, Petitioners Brett Shannon and Doris
Parker (“Petitioners”) filed the instant Petition to Correct Arbitration Award
against Respondents Raul Barrera and Barrera’s Landscape (“Respondents”).
Respondents filed an answer on February 28, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
A party may petition to correct an arbitration award under the provisions
of Code of Civil Procedure section 1285, et seq. A petition on these grounds
must be filed and served within 100 days of service of the award. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1288.) The Award was served on the parties on February 28,
2023. (Pet., Attachment 8c, p. 2.) 100 days after February 28, 2023 was June 8,
2023. The instant Petition was untimely filed and served in November and
December of 2023, respectively. Therefore, the Petition was filed and served
after the statute of limitations and there is no showing that the statute of
limitations should be tolled. (See Law Finance Group, LLC v. Key (2023)
14 Cal.5th 932, 959-960.)
 
There are other defects with the Petition, as well. The Petition is
brought on the grounds that the award is imperfect as a matter of form.
(Pet., ¶10(b).) However, the basis of Petitioner’s arguments is that the
arbitrator came to the wrong determination despite the evidence presented
during the arbitration proceeding. (Pet., Attachment 10(b)(2).) This is not a basis to vacate an arbitration
award. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.2, subd. (a).) The Court cannot substitute
its judgment for that of the arbitrator. (Young v. Ross-Loos Medical Group,
Inc. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 669, 673.) Nor is any evidence presented by
Petitioners as to why the arbitrator’s ruling was imperfect as a matter of
form—which does not affect the merits of the controversy—such that the award
can be corrected. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.2, subd. (c).)
 
 Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioners
Brett Shannon and Doris Parker’s Petition to Correct Arbitration Award is DISMISSED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
