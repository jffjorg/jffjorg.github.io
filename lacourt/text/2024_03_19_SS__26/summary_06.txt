And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to vacate the renewal of judgment filed by Jose Aguirre and Maria Aguirre, who claim they were never served with the summons and complaint in the original action. The judge found that the proofs of service, which contain declarations from a registered process server, place the burden of proof on the defendants to show that they were not served. The judge concluded that the defendants' declarations, which are not properly verified, are insufficient to overcome the presumption of service and that the defendants have not carried their burden of proof. As a result, the motion to vacate the renewal of judgment is denied.
