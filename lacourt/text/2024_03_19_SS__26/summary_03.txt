And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiffs' Motion to Reclassify the case as an unlimited civil case and has transferred the case to an unlimited jurisdiction court. The Plaintiffs, Nicholas Porretta and Rachel Porretta, filed the complaint on May 8, 2023, and the Defendant, Juan Zetino, answered on June 30, 2023. The Plaintiffs then filed a first amended complaint on May 12, 2023. The Motion to Reclassify was filed on February 9, 2024, after the time to amend the complaint, and the Plaintiffs must show both good cause for the timing of the request and that the case is incorrectly classified. The Judge found that the case was incorrectly classified due to a clerical error in filing out the Civil Case Cover Sheet and that the Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to real property, which is not available in the limited jurisdiction court. The Plaintiffs are required to pay the reclassification fee within 10 days of the order.
