The Plaintiff, Laurie Ramsey, seeks to compel the Defendant, Clearmark Title Company, to provide further responses to her requests for production. The Defendant responded to some of the requests, but failed to indicate which documents relate to which requests and did not produce all responsive documents. The Judge finds that the Defendant's response is sufficient, but not complete. Therefore, the Defendant is ordered to produce all responsive documents and indicate which documents relate to which requests. The Judge also awards the Plaintiff reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,000. The Plaintiff is to provide further responses and production within 30 days.
