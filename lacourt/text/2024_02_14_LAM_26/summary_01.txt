Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Timothy B. Fitzgerald, an attorney from New York, may appear as counsel pro hac vice for the defendants in this case. Fitzgerald has satisfied the eligibility requirements of California Rule of Court 9.40, which allows non-California attorneys to appear in California courts under certain circumstances. The judge has also ordered the parties to attend an informal discovery conference to resolve their discovery disputes and has set certain deadlines for the filing of IDC statements and moving papers. The judge notes that the parties have reserved multiple hearing dates on the online Court Reservation System (CRS) but have not filed moving papers for some of these dates, which is exacerbating the congestion of the court's motion calendar.
