  Case No.:  22STCV35339
 
  Hearing Date:  February 14, 2024
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER PERMITTING GREGORY A.
  GIDUS AS COUNSEL PRO HAC VICE 
 



 
Gregory A. Gidus (“Gidus”) applies as counsel pro hac vice for Defendant
Twin City Fire Insurance Co.  The
application is unopposed. 
Under California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40,
attorneys licensed and in good standing in other states may, upon the
California court’s approval, appear as counsel pro hac vice in a pending case if an active member of the state bar
is associated as attorney of record. 
(CRC 9.40(a).)  Gidus is an active member, in good standing, of the Florida Bar,
the U.S. District Court Middle District of Florida, the U.S. District Court
Northern District of Florida, the U.S. District Court Southern District of
Florida, and the 11th Circuit, U.S. Court of Appeals. (Gidus Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)  In addition, Gidus states that he is not a
resident of California or regularly engaged in business in California.  Gidus is a resident of Tampa, Florida with an
office in Tampa, Florida  (Gidus Decl. ¶¶ 1-3.)  Gidus states that he has not filed any
applications to appear pro hac vice in California within the last two years.  Thus, Counsel satisfies the eligibility
requirements of CRC 9.40(a).
Gidus’s application successfully addresses all six
content requirements outlined in CRC 9.40(d). 
Specifically, Gidus provides
in his application: (1) his residence and office address (Gidus Decl. ¶¶ 1-2); (2) the courts to which Gidus has been admitted to practice and the dates
of admission (Gidus Decl. ¶ 4); (3) that Gidus is a member in good standing in
those courts (Gidus Decl. ¶ 3); (4) that he is not currently suspended or
disbarred in any court (Gidus Decl. ¶ 5); (5) the title of each court and cause
in which the applicant has filed an application to appear as counsel pro
hac vice in this state in the preceding two years, and whether or not
it was granted if any (Gidus Decl. ¶ 6); and (6) the name, address, and
telephone number of an active member, Stephanie G. Chau of the State Bar of
California who is the current counsel of record for Twin City Fire Insurance Co.  (Gidus Decl.
¶ 7).
Furthermore, Gidus demonstrates that he has met the requirement of CRC 9.40(c)(1). That rule
provides: “a person desiring to appear as counsel pro hac vice in a superior court must file with the court a
verified application together with proof of service . . . of a copy of the
application and of the notice on all parties who have appeared in the cause and
on the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office.”  (See Chau Decl. ¶ 2.)
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
The application of Gregory A. Gidus to appear as counsel pro hac vice for Defendant Twin City Fire Insurance
Co. is GRANTED.
Moving
Party is ordered to
give notice and file a proof of service of such.
