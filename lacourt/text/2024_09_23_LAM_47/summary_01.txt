And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a landlord-tenant dispute between Earl J. Washington and Lola Mitsuk (plaintiffs) and Wellington Yang and Shadi Kashani (defendants). The plaintiffs move to compel further responses to 39 requests for production and four special interrogatories propounded to each defendant. The court finds that the plaintiffs failed to meet and confer with the defendants in good faith before filing the motions and that the motions do not comply with the required procedures. The court orders the parties to meet and confer in person or telephonically by October 4, 2024, and to file a joint statement detailing the results of their meet-and-confer efforts by October 16, 2024. The court also conditions its ruling on the payment of an additional $120 in filing fees within 10 days of the order. The hearing on the motions is continued to October 22, 2024.
