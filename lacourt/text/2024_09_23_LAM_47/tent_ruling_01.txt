STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
This is a landlord-tenant dispute. Plaintiffs allege that
Defendants have engaged in an ongoing campaign of harassment against them.
Plaintiffs assert claims for harassment, invasion of privacy, breach of
contract, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
 
Plaintiffs move to compel
further responses to requests for production and special interrogatories              
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiffs move to compel further
responses to 39 requests for production propounded to Defendants Yang and
Kashani, each, and move to compel further responses to four special
interrogatories propounded to each Defendant. 
 
First, Plaintiffs filed two motions to compel further responses for four
sets of discovery. Multiple motions should not be combined into a single
filing.¿(See¿Govt. Code,¿§ 70617(a)(4) [setting forth the required filing fee
for each motion, application, or any other paper or request requiring a
hearing];¿see¿also¿Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, [8:1140.1]
at 8F-60 (The Rutter Group 2011)¿[“Motions to compel compliance with separate
discovery requests ordinarily should be filed separately.”].) Combining
multiple motions under the guise of one motion with one hearing reservation
manipulates the Court Reservation System and unfairly jumps ahead of other
litigants. Moreover, combining motions to avoid payment of separate filing fees
deprives the Court of filing fees it is otherwise entitled to collect. The
Court therefore conditions its ruling on these motions on the payment of an
additional $120 in filing fees within 10 days of this order.
 
Second, before moving to compel
further responses to interrogatories or requests for production, the party who
seeks further responses is required to meet and confer with the responding
party in a good faith attempt to informally resolve the issues presented in the
motion. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2016.040; see also 2030.300(b)(1); 2031.310(b)(2).)
The motion must then be accompanied by a sworn affidavit which must “state facts
showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at informal resolution.” (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2016.040; see also 2030.300(b)(1); 2031.310(b)(2).) These motions fail
entirely to comply with that requirement, as the accompanying declaration of
Earl Washington only states: “On March 18, 2024, counsel of record met and
conferred regarding Defendants’ verified responses and Plaintiffs’ requests for
further responses. The parties did not resolve active discovery disputes.” (Declaration
of Earl Washington ISO Mot. ¶ 2.) The Court is not inclined to accept the
conclusory assertion proffered by Plaintiff as evidence of a sufficient meet-and-confer
effort. Rather, it appears from the substantial number of discovery requests at
issue and the lengthy Separate Statements in support of each motion (totaling
125 pages for one set of requests for production alone) that no meaningful
effort to informally resolve this dispute has taken place. 
 
The Court therefore orders the
parties to these motions to meet and confer in person or telephonically
to attempt an informal resolution of some or all of the issues raised in these
motions on or before Friday, October 4, 2024. The parties are further ordered
to file a joint statement detailing the results of their meet-and-confer
efforts and identifying what issues remain for the Court to resolve the dispute
on or before Wednesday, October 16, 2024. 
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Production is CONTINUED to Tuesday, October
22, 2024 at 1:30 PM.
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Special Interrogatories is CONTINUED to Tuesday, October
22, 2024, at 1:30 PM. 
 
This ruling is conditioned on the
payment of $120 in filing fees within 10 days of this order. 
 
Moving Parties to give notice.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
