And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a habitability action filed on October 4, 2022, by Ken Houang and others against Rochelle H. Sterling and others. The defendants seek to quash a deposition notice and prevent the deposition of Rochelle Sterling, while the plaintiffs seek to compel her deposition and responses to special interrogatories.

The court finds that the defendants' motion to quash the deposition notice is denied, and the plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition is granted. The court orders Defendant Sterling to appear for deposition by September 30, 2024.

The court also grants the plaintiffs' motion to compel responses to special interrogatories propounded to Defendant Rochelle Sterling. The court orders Defendant Sterling to produce verified, code-compliant responses without objections on or before October 1, 2024.

The court denies the plaintiffs' request for sanctions.

The court notes that the parties are required to give notice of this tentative ruling.
