The Court has reviewed the Cross-Complaint in Interpleader filed by California TD Specialists and has ruled that Cross-Defendant Nancy Goulston's demurrer to the Cross-Complaint is OVERRULED. The Court finds that the Cross-Complaint asserts a valid cause of action and that the competing claims are valid. The Court orders Cross-Defendant Nancy Goulston to file and serve an Answer to the Cross-Complaint within 20 days of this order. The Court also notes that the claims are grounded in an abstract of judgment recorded on the property, which appears to have attached to Cross-Defendant's property generally. The Court concludes that the Cross-Complaint alleges a series of liens derived from recordation of an abstract of judgment on Cross-Defendant's property and identifies at least one claim which appears on its face to have been timely presented.
