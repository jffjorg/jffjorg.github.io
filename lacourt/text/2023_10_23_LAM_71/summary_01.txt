And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Malin Asset Management, Inc. (Defendant) to the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by Billie Jean Whittenberg (Plaintiff) with 20 days leave to amend. The demurrer was based on the uncertainty of the complaint and the failure to specify Malin Asset's relationship to the other defendants. The FAC failed to provide sufficient notice to Malin Asset of the claims and issues against them.

The motion to strike filed by Malin Asset is denied as moot due to the ruling on the demurrer. The Court finds that the FAC is uncertain and ambiguous, and the Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient notice to Malin Asset of the claims and issues against them.

The Court grants Malin Asset 20 days leave to amend the FAC to address the defects and uncertainties identified in the demurrer.
