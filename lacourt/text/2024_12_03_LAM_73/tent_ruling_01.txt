I. BACKGROUND
 
On February 4, 2019, Plaintiff Gwendolyn Gatti filed this action
against Defendants CBS Broadcasting, Inc. and Kevin Hall. 
 
Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action:
1.      Discrimination
in Violation of Statute (California Government Code § 12490, et. seq.);
2.      Retaliation
in Violation of Statute (California Government Code § 12490, et. seq.);
3.      Failure to
Prevent Retaliation in Violation of Statute (California Government Code §
12490, et. seq.);
4.      False
Imprisonment;
5.      Violation
Civil Code §52.1, et. seq.;
6.      Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress;
7.      Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress;
8.      Wrongful
Termination in Violation of Public Policy;
9.      Breach of
Implied Covenant Not to Terminate without Good Cause; and
10.  Violation of
California Business & Professions Code § 17200, et. seq.
The Complaint
alleges that Plaintiff was employed by Defendant CBS as "Head of
Makeup" for television stations CBS2 and KCAL9. Plaintiff’s employment
with Defendant CBS began on or about 1999 and ended on or about September 19, 2018
when she was wrongfully terminated by Defendant CBS. Plaintiff alleges that she
was retaliated against for complaining about sexual harassment and discriminatory
conduct. 
 
On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award. 
 
On November 13, 2024, Defendants filed a Notice of Non-Opposition to
Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award.
II.
DISCUSSION
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may
petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.)  The petition must set forth (1) the substance of or have
attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate, (2) the names of the
arbitrators, and (3) the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, or
attach a copy.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.)  If such a petition is
filed, the court must confirm the award unless it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.) Where the petition is served but no response is
served and filed, the allegations in the petition are deemed admitted. 
(CCP § 1290; Taheri Law Group, A.P.C. v. Sorokurs (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th
956, 962.)    
 
Every presumption is in favor of the arbitration award. (See Firestone
Tire & Rubber Co. v. United Rubber Workers of America (1959) 168
Cal.App.2d 444, 449.) CCP section 1286.2 provides that “the court shall vacate
the award if the court determines any of the following: (1) [t]he award was
procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means.” (CCP § 1286.2(a).) The
defendant moving for vacation of an arbitration award due to corruption, fraud,
or other undue means must demonstrate a nexus between the award and the alleged
undue means used to attain it. (See Pour Le Bebe, Inc. v. Guess? Inc.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 810, 833-34.) An objection to the granting of a motion
to confirm an award is equivalent to a motion to vacate. (See Thriftimart,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 421, 425-26.) 
 
Here, the petition complies with Code of Civil Procedure section
1285.4.  First, the petition sets forth the arbitration provision of the
parties’ agreement to arbitrate, specifically that “Any and all controversies,
claims or disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
interpretation, performance or breach thereof … or any claims arising out of
[Gatti's] future employment with KCBS-TV/KCALTV,shall be resolved in an
arbitration to be conducted at the Los Angeles office of JAMS, or its successor…”
(Petition, p. 2, ¶ 4.) Second, the petition provides
the name of the arbitrator, Honorable Terry Friedman (JAMS). (Petition, p. 2, ¶
6.)
Third, the petition sets forth the terms of the Arbitration Award, stating “Gatti
is awarded $100,000 on her false imprisonment claim; Gatti failed to prove her
other causes of action; CBS is the prevailing party; neither CBS or Gatti is
awarded attorneys' fees or costs.” (Petition, p. 2, ¶
8.)
 
Defendants filed a Notice of Non-Opposition of the Petition. The
Court does not have any reason to correct the award, vacate the award, or
dismiss the proceedings. 
 
The Court GRANTS the Petition and confirms the arbitration award.
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
The petition to confirm arbitration award is GRANTED.  
 
Plaintiff is to lodge a proposed judgment consistent with the
arbitration award within 10 days.
 
Moving party to give notice.
