I. BACKGROUND
 
On November 12, 2020, Plaintiff RJS
Financial, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Dos
Potrillos LLC (“Dos Potrillos”); David A. Romero, trustee of the Laguna Seca
Living Trust; David A. Romero, an individual; and all persons known and unknown claiming any legal or
equitable right, title, estate, lien, or interest in the real property
described in the complaint adverse to the plaintiff’s title, or any cloud on
plaintiff’s title (“Defendants”).
 
The Complaint alleges causes of action
for: (1) Quiet Title and (2) Declaratory Relief.
The Complaint alleges the following. On or about June
2019, Plaintiff made a $2.1 million loan to Defendant Dos Potrillos which was
intended to be secured by certain properties, including a property located at
902 Nicholson Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90744 (“Nicholson Property”). (Complaint, ¶¶ 8-9.) Dos Potrillos executed a Promissory Note
and Deed of Trust noting that the Nicholson Property served as security for the
loan. (Id., ¶¶ 9-11.) The
Deed of Trust was recorded on July 2, 2019 as Document No. 20190639198 in the
Official Records of the Los Angeles County Recorder. (Id., ¶ 11.) In July 2020, Dos Potrillos defaulted
on the loan and a Notice of Default was recorded in July 2020. (Id.,
¶ 12.) Upon recording the Notice
of Default, Plaintiff learned that title to the Nicholson Property had a title
defect and record title still reflected the Nicholson Property being owned by
Defendant David A. Romero as Trustee of the Laguna Seca Trust (“Trust”) instead
of Dos Potrillos. (Id., ¶¶ 14-15.) Plaintiff alleges that due to an error,
the Deed that was signed by Romero on behalf of the Trust transferring the
Nicholson Property from the Trust to Dos Potrillos was never recorded, although
the Nicholson Property was intended by Dos Potrillos to be included as security
for the Deed of Trust. (Id., ¶ 17.)
On February 8, 2024, Defendants filed
a Third Amended Cross-Complaint alleging causes of action for:  
(1) Declaratory Relief; 
(2) Cancellation of Instruments; 
(3) Wrongful Foreclosure; 
(4) Violation of CCP
§§ 17200 et. seq.; and 
(5) Quiet Title.
 
On October 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to
Expunge Notice of Pendency of Action, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff moves this Court for an order expunging 
o  
(a) the Notice of Pendency of Action (the “Motion”)
recorded on August 23, 2021 in the Official Records, Recorder’s Office, Los
Angeles County, as document number 20211285797 (“Lis Pendens”), against the
real properties commonly known as 329 Magnolia Street, Compton, California
90220 (the “Magnolia Property”), and 534-536 E. 19th Street, Long Beach,
California 90806 (the “19th Street Property,” collectively the “Properties”),
and 
o  
(b) any other Notice of Pendency Action that has
been recorded on the Properties. 
·      
There is no “pending action” here. This case has
been fully settled and dismissed since April 22, 2024. At that time, the Lis
Pendens against the Properties should have been withdrawn by Potrillos.
·      
Accordingly, RJS brings this instant motion to
expunge the Lis Pendens. As shown below, RJS will “prevail on the merits”
considering the “pending action” was dismissed with prejudice as part of a
binding settlement supervised by a retired Judge. Moreover, the Lis Pendens
filed suffers from several fatal procedural flaws. It must be expunged. 
·      
RJS
seeks an award of its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs in connection with
the instant Motion in an amount of $8,040.00 against the Lis Pendens claimants
here, Potrillos, David A. Romero, individually and as Trustee of The Laguna
Seca Living Trust, jointly and severally.
Beverly
Hills Real Estate Investment LLC filed
an opposition, arguing:
·      
RJS lacks standing to
prosecute this case. on November 1, 2024, the California Secretary
of State declared: “I further certify that a diligent search has been made in
the corporate files of this office and that there is no record of a California
or foreign corporation, active or inactive, of the name: RJS FINANCIAL INC.”
[Request for Judicial Notice, Exhibit “A”].
·      
Intervenor,
Beverly Hills Real Estate Investment LLC own an interest in property RJS seek
to foreclose on. BHREI, represented by Alden, has standing to oppose RJS’s
motion to expunge its lis pendens.
 
Plaintiff filed a reply, arguing:
·      
Counsel Nick Alden and Beverly Hills Real
Estate Investment LLC’s Lack Standing
o  
As
detailed in the Declaration of Gerrick M. Warrington in Support of the Motion,
Nick A. Alden was disqualified from participating in the case on November 5, 2021
due to committing a serious ethical violation. Despite
being disqualified, Mr. Alden continued and still continues to try to
participate in this case. On August 23, 2022, the Court of Appeal then affirmed
the November 5, 2021 order to disqualify Alden and referred the matter to the
state bar. (Warrington Decl. ¶ 11, Ex. E.) Importantly,
given Mr. Alden’s disqualification, BHR, and therefore Mr. Alden himself,
taking an ownership interest in the Properties from his former client is yet
another unethical conflict.
·      
The
Opposition was Filed Late and Not Served on Counsel. The Opposition should not
be considered by the Court.
·      
The
Opposition Fails to Adequately Oppose the Merits of the Motion
o  
RJS
has standing
§ 
RJS
is a California registered corporation. While the registration does not have
“Inc.” at the end, a corporation may add “inc.” to its name even if it is not
included in the original registration. The term “inc.” is equivalent to “a
corporation” and is considered merely descriptive rather than a part or the
corporate name. (See Indian Refining Co. v. Royal Oil Co. (1929) 102 Cal.App.
710.)
o  
The
Case was Adjudicated on the Merits
II. DISCUSSION 
 
A.     
Legal
Standard 

 
A
notice of pendency of action may be filed when a real property claim is alleged
in an action.  (C.C.P., § 405.1, 405.2.)  A real property claim means
the causes of action, if proven, would affect either: (a) title to or the right
to possession of specific real property, or (b) the use of an easement
identified in the pleading.  (C.C.P., § 405.4.)¿ A party seeking to remove
the notice has two options, either attack the pleading as failing to state a
real property claim¿(C.C.P., § 405.31),¿or attack the real property claim as
lacking evidentiary merit¿(C.C.P., § 405.32).¿¿ 
 
In
determining whether a real property claim has been asserted, the Court engages
in a demurrer-like analysis.  (Park 100 Investment Group II, LLC v.
Ryan¿(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 795, 808.) ¿
 
When
questioning the evidentiary merit of a claim, the claimant who filed the lis
pendens has the burden of proof.  (C.C.P., § 405.30.)  Thus, that
claimant, in opposing the motion to expunge the lis pendens, must demonstrate
the following: (1) the action affects title to or right of possession of the
real property described in the notice; (2) in so far as the said notice is
concerned, the party recording the notice has commenced the action for a proper
purpose and in good faith; and (3) the probable validity of the real property
claim by a preponderance of the evidence.  (Hunting World, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 67, 70; see also C.C.P., §405.30, et
seq.)  Only admissible evidence is permitted on the motion.¿ (Burger v.
Superior Court¿(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 1013, 1019.)

court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any
state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid.
Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).)¿¿ 
 
The Court grants
Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice.
 
C.      Procedural Deficiencies with the
Opposition
 
Plaintiff
argues that the opposition filed by Beverly Hills Real Estate Investment LLC (“BHREI”) should be disregarded
because (1) it was filed late and (2) it was never served on counsel. 
 
Opposition papers are required to be filed and served at
least nine court days prior to the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b). 
 
Here, the hearing in this matter is set for December 3, 2024. The opposition
was due by November 18, 2024. However, BHREI did not file its opposition until November
20, 2024. 
 
Nevertheless,
a court may properly consider papers that are not timely filed pursuant to CCP
section 1005(b) unless “substantial rights” are affected.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1300(d); Code Civ. Proc., § 475.)  The appearance of a party
at the hearing of a motion and his or her opposition to the motion on the
merits is a waiver of any procedural defects or irregularities in a motion.
 (Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697.)
 
The Court elects to exercise its discretion to consider the
untimely opposition. (CRC 3.1300(d).) 
 
Plaintiff also argues the opposition should be disregarded because
BHREI failed to serve it on Plaintiff. (Reply, p. 3.)
 
Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the
statutory requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones
v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) 
 
However, the Court notes that the opposition’s signed proof of
service indicates it was served on Plaintiff’s counsel and Plaintiff does not
provide any evidence in its reply in support of its assertion that the opposition
was not served. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court is not inclined to disregard the
opposition and continues its discussion on the merits of the motion. 
 
D.     Discussion
 
Plaintiff
moves to expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action recorded on August 23, 2021
in the Official Records, Recorder’s Office, Los Angeles County, as document
number 20211285797 (“Lis Pendens”), against the real properties commonly known
as 329 Magnolia Street, Compton, California 90220 (the “Magnolia Property”),
and 534-536 E. 19th Street, Long Beach, California 90806 (the “19th Street
Property,” collectively the “Properties”), and any other Notice of Pendency
Action that has been recorded on the Properties.
 
Plaintiff
asserts that the Lis Pendens must be expunged since there is no “pending action” as the case has been fully settled and
dismissed since April 22, 2024. The Court agrees. 
 
On
February 22, 2024, the Court heard and granted Plaintiff RJS’ Motion for
Summary Adjudication (“MSA”) which established that Potrillos owned the
Nicholson property and it was therefore subject to RJS’ deed of trust recorded
on July 2, 2019. The MSA resolved all factual disputes of RJS’ claims and
resulted in summary judgment. (Warrington Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. F.) On April 15,
2024, the parties attended a mediation with Judge Charles Rubin (Ret.) to
settle the remaining issues related to the Cross-Complaint. The parties settled
the remaining claims pursuant to a written and binding settlement agreement
and, as part of the settlement, Potrillos agreed to dismiss with prejudice the Cross-Complaint
against RJS. (Warrington Decl. ¶ 14.) On April 22, 2024, Potrillos filed a
Request for Dismissal with Prejudice for the entire Cross-Complaint. The Court
entered the dismissal on April 23, 2024. (Warrington Decl. ¶ 15, Ex. G.)
Therefore, since the case has been dismissed the Lis Pendens must be expunged. 
 
In opposition, BHREI contends that it
has standing to oppose Plaintiff’s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens because it owns
an interest in property that Plaintiff seeks to foreclose on. First, the Court
notes that BHREI fails to provide any evidence in support of its assertion that
it has standing as an intervenor. 
 
Next, BHREI argues in its opposition
that the Plaintiff’s Motion should be denied because Plaintiff lacks standing.
BHREI argues that as shown by the certificate of no record from the California
Secretary of State, there is no legal entity named RJS Financial Inc., as a
California Corporation. (Oppos., p. 8, Ex. A.)
 
In reply, Plaintiff argues that not
only has the case already been adjudicated on its merits and dismissed, but
that Plaintiff does have standing. Plaintiff argues that RJS is a California
registered corporation and while the registration does not have “Inc.” at the
end, a corporation may add “inc.” to its name even if it is not included in the
original registration. (Reply, p. 4.)
 
Moreover,
the Court finds that BHREI has failed to meet its burden. Opposing a motion to
expunge the lis pendens must demonstrate the following: (1) the action affects
title to or right of possession of the real property described in the notice;
(2) in so far as the said notice is concerned, the party recording the notice
has commenced the action for a proper purpose and in good faith; and (3) the
probable validity of the real property claim by a preponderance of the
evidence.  (Hunting World, Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 22
Cal.App.4th 67, 70; see also C.C.P., §405.30, et seq.) Here, BHREI does
not provide any argument or evidence in support of these elements. As such, BHREI
has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating the probable validity of the real
property claims. Further, since the case has been dismissed, the Lis Pendens
must be expunged. 
 
Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED.
 
E.      Sanctions
 
The
prevailing party on a motion to expunge is entitled to reasonable attorneys’
fees and costs in making or opposing the motion unless the other party acted
with substantial justification.  (C.C.P., § 405.38.)¿ 
 
Plaintiff
seeks attorney’s fees in the amount of $7,980.00 and costs in the amount of $60. Plaintiff
attached the declaration of its counsel, Kristina Ross, who attests to spending
16 hours on the motion and an anticipated 5 hours on the opposition and reply,
at a rate of $380 an hour. (Ross Decl., ¶
3.) 
 
As
the motion is being granted, Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney’s
fees and costs. However, since the Motion appears to be relatively
straightforward, the Court is inclined to reduce the award of attorney’s fees
and costs to the total amount of $3,860.00 (10 hours of work total and $60
filing cost). 
 
Therefore,
the Court awards attorney’s fees and costs in the total amount of $3,860.00.
 
III. DISPOSITION 
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for an Order Expunging Notice of Pendency of Action is GRANTED. The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against the Defendants
in the reduced amount of $3,860.00. Said
monetary sanctions are to be paid to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days of the
date of this order.
