Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the Cross-Complainant's Motion for Leave to File First Amended Cross-Complaint. The motion was denied due to procedural deficiencies, including failure to comply with California Rule of Court 3.1324. The motion did not specify what allegations in the previous pleading were proposed to be deleted, nor did it state what allegations were proposed to be added to the previous pleading. Additionally, the attached declaration by the Cross-Complainant's counsel did not specify the effect of the amendment and when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered. The judge's ruling is based on the legal standard set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1), which allows the court to allow or deny an amendment to a pleading or proceeding in furtherance of justice.
