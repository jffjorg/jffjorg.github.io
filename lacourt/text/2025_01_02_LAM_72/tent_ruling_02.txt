         v.

 Case No: 24STCV06070
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: January

 Calendar Number: 4



 
            Defendant
Charmain Campbell (Defendant) moves for relief from the Court’s August 1, 2024
entry of default against Defendant.  The
Court GRANTS the motion.
 
Background
 
            On
March 11, 2024, Yana G. Henriks and the law firm McMurray Henriks, LLP
(Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint alleging both (1) civil extortion and (2) libel per
se against Defendant. The Complaint stems from a prior representation
Plaintiffs provided to Defendant and her co-defendants in a prior case
(hereafter, the “former lawsuit”). 
 
            The
former lawsuit regarding the wrongful death of Defendant’s mother was settled
for $300,000.00. (Compl., ¶10.) Plaintiffs allege that upon sending the final
accounting to Defendant, Defendant and her co-defendants in the former lawsuit
responded with written accusations that Plaintiffs mishandled the case,
misrepresented the terms of the retainer agreement, and racially discriminated
against Defendant and her family during the representation. (Id. at
¶13.) Plaintiffs go on to allege Defendant made several threats to extort more
money from Plaintiffs than the standard rate identified in the retainer
agreement, which provides for 33.33% of the gross recovery to Plaintiff upon a
pre-litigation resolution of the matter and 40% upon resolution after the
commencement of litigation. (Id. at ¶¶8 and 13.)
 
            The
motion now before the Court is Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside and Vacate
Default Judgment (the Motion). On August 1, 2024 the Court granted a request
for entry of default and entered default against Defendant. Defendant now moves
to set aside that default entry contending that she was never properly served
with the Summons and Complaint. Plaintiffs oppose the Motion.    
 
 
Discussion
 
            Compliance
with statutory procedures for service of process establishes personal
jurisdiction over a defendant.  A default
judgment entered against a defendant who was not served in the manner
prescribed by statute is void. (Braugh v. Dow (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 76, 88;
Kremerman v. White (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 358, 371.)
 
            Defendant contends she was never
personally served with the Summons and Complaint for the current action.
(Declaration of Charmain Campbell, hereinafter Campbell Decl., ¶2.) Defendant
supports this contention in her declaration by stating the initial attempts at
service were executed at 18631 Burbank Blvd., Apt. 3, Tarzana , CA 91356, an
address where Defendant’s son lives, but not where Defendant herself resides. 
 
            The Court agrees that the summons
and complaint were not properly served on Defendant in accordance with
statutory requirements.  California Code
of Civil Procedure Sections 415.10, 415.20, 415.30, and 415.50 describe four
methods of service within California: (1) personal delivery of copy of summons
and complaint to person to be served; (2) delivery of a copy of summons and
complaint to someone else at defendant’s usual residence or place of business;
(3) service by mail coupled with acknowledgment of receipt of summons; and (4)
service by publication.
 
First, Plaintiffs
attempted to effect personal service on thirteen separate occasions at 18694
Chase St., Northridge, CA 91324. According to the Campbell Decl., Defendant
resides at this address, however never received service. (Campbell Decl., ¶2.)
This is invalid service because Defendant was not served personally. Additionally,
there is no indication by Plaintiffs that a copy of the Summons and Complaint was
left there with someone over the age of 18.  
 
Second, Plaintiffs
made fifteen separate attempts to serve Defendant at 11611 Blucher Ave., #146,
Granada Hills, CA 91344, but to no avail. Defendant claims this was an address
she resided at one and a half years ago, and that she no longer resides there.
(Campbell Decl., ¶3.) Service here is again invalid for the same reasons noted
above, in addition to it not being the Defendant’s usual mailing address or
place of residence.  
 
Then on May 2, 2024,
Plaintiffs conducted a third attempt at service by emailing Defendant with the
Summons and Complaint. However, Code Civ. Proc. §1010.6 only permits electronic
service if Defendant consents to receiving service electronically. The Court is
in possession of no such consent. (See Code Civ. Proc. §1010.6(c)(3)(i)-(ii).) 
 
Finally, Plaintiffs
attempted to serve Defendants by mail to Defendant’s P.O. Box address at an
unknown date. However, Plaintiffs do not claim that they received a notice of
acknowledgement from Defendant, which is required to effectuate such
service.  (Code Civ. Proc. §415.30, subd.
(c).)  Accordingly, this was not
effective either.
 
Defendants do not
argue that any of their attempts at service were successful in complying with
the statutory formalities.  Instead,
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant had actual notice of the lawsuit.  This is true, as evidenced by Defendant’s
appearance at the August 23, 2024 case management conference, after default had
already been entered.  However, actual
notice without the statutory formalities is not sufficient for the Court to
acquire jurisdiction over the Defendant.
 
Accordingly, the Court
grants Defendant’s motion and sets aside the August 1, 2024 entry of default.
