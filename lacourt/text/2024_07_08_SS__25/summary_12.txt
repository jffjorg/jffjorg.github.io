**Significant Statements**
```
* The demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
* The court must treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.
* Negligence per se is an evidentiary doctrine that creates a presumption of negligence if four elements are established.
* The doctrine of negligence per se does not establish tort liability, but rather codifies the rule that a presumption of negligence arises from the violation of a statute.
* The cause of action for negligence per se is not a separate cause of action, but rather a theory of recovery that may be alleged in conjunction with a cause of action for ordinary negligence.
* The cause of action for negligent entrustment is duplicative of the cause of action for negligence based on the same facts.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Hugo Valencia, Jr. The plaintiff, Laura Elena Valencia, had filed a complaint against the defendant alleging negligence, strict liability, negligence per se, and negligent entrustment in connection with a dog attack that occurred on November 7, 2021.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action for negligence per se, finding that the complaint adequately states a cause of action based on the defendant's alleged violation of municipal codes.

However, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for negligent entrustment, finding that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because there are no allegations that anyone entrusted a vehicle or the dog to another person, and because the cause of action is duplicative of the cause of action for negligence.

The defendant's answer to the complaint is to be filed within 20 days.
