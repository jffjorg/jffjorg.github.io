Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's motion for judgment on the pleadings against Defendant Marvin Sosa-Reyes. The motion is denied because Plaintiff failed to meet the meet and confer requirement and because the basis for the motion is improper. The judge notes that Plaintiff is seeking to determine that the Complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that Defendant's Answer fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense, but that this is not a proper basis for a motion for judgment on the pleadings.

Instead, the judge suggests that Plaintiff file a motion for summary judgment, which would allow the court to determine whether there is any triable issue of fact. The judge also notes that the basis for Plaintiff's motion is improper because it relies on deemed requests for admission granted through the court's discovery motion, rather than the pleadings.

The judge orders Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling and to attach a copy of the court's tentative ruling to the notice.
