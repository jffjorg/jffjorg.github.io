Oakhurst
Income Fund II, LP v. Caverhill, Case No. 23SMCV05356
Hearing
date February 2, 2024
Plaintiff
Oakhurst Income Fund II, LP’s Application for Writ of Attachment
Plaintiff
Oakhurst Income Fund alleges defendant Caverhill entered into three continuing
guaranty agreements in connection with three promissory notes. Pursuant to
these notes, Plaintiff loaned $1,705,000 to Rampart Resources, which defaulted.
Plaintiff seeks a writ of attachment against defendant’s interest in property
located at 2500 Briarcrest Road, Beverly Hills, CA 90210. No opposition was
filed. 
“Upon the
filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply
pursuant to this article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment
by filing an application for the order and writ with the court in which the
action is brought.” Code Civ. Proc. §484.010. 
“The application [for a writ of attachment] shall be supported by an
affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented would be entitled
to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is based.” Code Civ. Proc.
§484.030. “The declarations in the moving papers must contain evidentiary
facts, stated ‘with particularity,’
and based on actual personal knowledge with all documentary evidence properly
identified and authenticated.” Hobbs,
supra, 73 Cal.App.4th at p. 79–80 (citing
Code Civ. Proc. §482.040).
The court
shall issue a right to attach order if the claim is one upon which an
attachment may be issued; plaintiff established the claim’s probable validity;
the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than recovery on the claim
upon which the attachment is based; and the amount to be secured is greater
than zero. Code Civ. Proc. §484.090.
The court
shall issue a right to attach order if the claim upon which the attachment is
based is one upon which an attachment may be issued. Code Civ. Proc., §484.090
(a)(1).  “[A]n attachment may be issued
only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a
contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is
a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars
($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney’s fees.” Code Civ. Proc.,
§483.010(a). 
Plaintiff’s
application is based on the three continuing guarantee agreements and alleged
breach thereof. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages of $1,087,459.48, which
amount is readily ascertainable. The claim is a proper basis for attachment.  
Attachment
is not sought for a purpose other than recovery on a claim upon which the
attachment is based. AT-105 ¶ 4. The amount sought to be secured is greater
than zero. Id. ¶ 8. Plaintiff seeks attachment of an interest in
property located at 2500 Briarcrest Rd., Beverly Hills, CA 90210. AT-105 ¶ 9(c);
Fine Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. 4. This described the property sought to be attached. Code
Civ. Proc. § 487.010(c)(1).
Because an
opposition has not been submitted, defendant has not claimed to be entitled to
any exemptions. 
“A claim has
‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.” Code Civ. Proc.
§481.190. The court must consider the relative merits of the parties’ positions.
Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp. (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484. 
The elements
for a breach of contract claim are (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damages. Coles v. Glaser
(2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 384, 391.
Scott Fine,
CEO of Platinum Loan Servicing, the loan servicing agent for plaintiff, states
plaintiff loaned Rampart Resources $1,705,000 based on three promissory notes executed
August 31, 2022. Fine Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. 1(B). Defendant personally guaranteed
these promissory notes pursuant to three separate continuing guaranty
agreements. Id, Exh. 1(A). Because Rampart defaulted, plaintiff recorded
notices of default. Id., Exh. 2. The principal, plus interest, costs,
and expenses are outstanding. Id. at ¶ 4, Exh. 3.  
Plaintiff’s
evidence shows: (1) a contract; (2) plaintiff performed by funding; (3)
defendant failed to make necessary payments; and (4) damage. Considering no
opposition has been filed, the court finds plaintiff has shown it is more than
likely than not that it will obtain a judgment.
Code of Civil
Procedure § 489.210 requires plaintiff to file an undertaking before issuance
of a writ of attachment. Unless an objection has been made, a writ of attachment requires the posting of a $10,000
undertaking. Code Civ. Proc. §489.220. There is no objection to the sum of
$10,000. Once plaintiff submits an undertaking of $10,000, the application will
be GRANTED.
