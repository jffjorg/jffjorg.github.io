On May 5, 2021, Plaintiff, as

agreed to rent the property located at 844 N. Vernon

On July 20, 2023, Defendant’s default was entered.

Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied
without prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff has failed to dismiss Does 1-10.
2.                 
Matthew Sawyer’s (“Sawyer”) declaration contains a
typographical error in Paragraph 5 (i.e., “February 23, 2025”). This error
should be corrected.
3.                 
Sawyer attests that ERS Partners, LP (“ERA”) is
Plaintiff’s predecessor. (Sawyer Decl., ¶ 5). The court notes that Attachment A
to Plaintiff’s complaint states as follows: “On or about February 23, 2015, ERS
Partners, L.P., by written agreement, leased the premises located at 844 N.
Vernon Avenue, Unit #7, Azusa, California, 91702 (‘Unit 7’), to Defendant,
Michael Johnson. Ownership of Unit 7 was subsequently transferred to 4 Jet
Terrado, LLC, was thereafter sold by 4 Jet Terrado, LLC, to 15130 Nelson, LLC,
now known as SGV, LLC Plaintiff in this proceeding. Additionally, the Lease to
Defendant, Michael Johnson, was assigned to CGV, LLC.” This information,
however, is not set forth in Sawyer’s declaration, nor are any documents
evidencing the transfer of the aforesaid lease to Plaintiff attached. 
4.                 
Plaintiff is instructed to highlight the provision in
Exhibit 1 which obligated Defendant to pay real property taxes.
5.                 
Paragraph 1.7(c) of Exhibit 2 reflects that a $2,475.00
security deposit was made. Plaintiff is to advise the court as to the
disposition of the security deposit. 
6.                 
Paragraph 22 of Sawyer’s declaration includes a summary
of invoices with respect to Unit 10. The court requests that Sawyer explain
what “legal fees” were incurred as reflected on the 3/1/2022, 4/1/2022,
5/1/2022 and 7/1/2022 invoices and why Defendant is being charged with same.
7.                 
Attorney’s fees should be recalculated pursuant to
Local Rule 3.214.
