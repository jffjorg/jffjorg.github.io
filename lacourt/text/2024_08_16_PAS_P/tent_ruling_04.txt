 Case Number:  23PDUD01059    Hearing Date:   August 16, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER WITH 30 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND AND DENYING MOTION TO
STRIKE AS MOOTI.        INTRODUCTION
          On April 5, 2023, Plaintiffs Luxor
Properties, Inc., and Hooman Dayani, as Trustee of the Dayani Family United
Trust filed an unlawful detainer action against Defendant Che Bri Inc. Agency
Incorporated dba My Place Cafe.
On September 29, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the first amended
complaint (FAC), which alleges a cause of action for breach of lease. The FAC
alleges that Defendant leased property from Plaintiffs in Pasadena and between
January 1, 2020 and July 31, 2022, Defendant failed to pay a total of $35,421
in rent that was due. Further, the FAC alleges that Defendant did not vacate
the premises after the lease expired and did not pay the base rent and common
area charges. The FAC further alleges that on June 27, 2023, the date set for
trial of this action on the issue of possession, Defendant surrendered
possession of the Premises. Plaintiffs allege that because Defendant held over
without payment after March 31, 2023, Defendant owes $150 per day as the
reasonable rental value of the premises from April 1, 2023 through June 27,
2023 in the amount of $13,200. Plaintiffs allege they are owed $51,742.
On October 30, 2023, Defendant Che Bri Inc. Agency
Incorporated (Cross-Complainant) filed a cross-complaint against Ayodele
Henderson and Deanna Henderson, Successor Trustees of the Jeanette McDonald
Henderson Living Trust Dated August 28, 2008 (Henderson Cross-Defendants), and
Roes 1-10, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (3) declaratory relief. 
The cross-complaint alleges that Cross-Complainant entered
into a lease agreement with the Henderson Cross-Defendants to rent the property
in Pasadena, and in March of 2020, shortly after opening the cafe´, the
Covid-19 pandemic began. Cross-Complainant was forced to close the cafe´ during
the months of April, May, June and July because of the pandemic.
Cross-Complainant alleges that during the above-referenced months,
Cross-Complainant’s rent was waived by the Henderson Cross-Defendants, by
verbal agreement. In the months that followed, Cross-Complainant was informed
by the Henderson Cross-Defendants that a lower monthly rental amount could be
paid and that amount would depend on the sales of the cafe´. Cross-Complainant
claims that in reliance on these statements, Cross-Complainant paid a lower
rental amount each month, which varied depending on the cafe´’s sales. 
Beginning in 2022, Cross-Complainant alleges it resumed
making full rental payments to Cross-Defendant. 
In August of 2022 the property was sold by the Henderson Cross-Defendants
to Luxor Properties, Inc., and Homayoon Dayani, As Trustee of The Dayani Family
United Trust (Luxor Cross-Defendants). Cross-Complainant alleges that the
Henderson Cross-Defendants failed to inform Luxor of the rent which was waived
by the Henderson Cross-Defendants and the Covid relief which was applied for. 
Cross-Complainant alleges that in violation of the promises
and obligations under the Agreement and the subsequent verbal agreements made
by Cross-Complainant and the Henderson Cross-Defendants, Cross-Complainant was
entitled to remain on the Property without fear of an Unlawful Detainer action.

On February 7, 2024, Cross-Complainant dismissed the
Henderson Cross-Defendants from the cross-complaint.
On February 8, 2024, Cross-Complainant filed an amendment to
the cross-complaint, substituting for Roe 1 the Luxor Cross-Defendants.
Before the court is a demurrer with motion to strike the
cross-complaint filed by the Luxor Cross-Defendants. The demurrer is sustained
with 30 days to leave as the cross-complaint combines the allegations of all
the defendants together and it is therefore uncertain; further, the amendment
is improper insofar as one Roe was substituted for two cross-defendants. As the
demurrer is sustained, the motion to strike is moot.
II.  DEMURRER
A.  
Legal Standard 
Code Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on
the basis that a complaint fails to state a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).)
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is
treated as “admitting all material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth
of “contentions, deductions or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-Defendants
Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer
is that the pleadings are “deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.”
(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th
593, 604.)¿ 
Questions of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely
allegations are of no concern. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v.
General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213-214.) 
 
Allegations need not be accepted as true if they are
contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.)¿ 
 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all the properly pleaded
material facts and consider matters which may be judicially noticed, but we do
not treat as admitted contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Align
Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d
343].) Further, ‘ “ ‘we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading
it as a whole and its parts in their context.’ ”’ (Ibid.) Because a
demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true
even the most improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with
the plaintiff's ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.)
‘“Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint also are
accepted as true and are given precedence, to the extent they contradict the
allegations.”’ (Paul v. Patton (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091.)
Although a demurrer does not ordinarily reach affirmative defenses, it ‘“will
lie where the complaint ‘has included allegations that clearly disclose some
defense or bar to recovery.’ ”’ (Casterson v. Superior Court (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 177, 183, Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.) 
 
Code Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(f) provides for a demurrer
where a pleading is uncertain. (CCP § 430.10(f).) Demurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible a
defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
 
B.    Meet and
Confer Requirement 
 
The Declaration of Krause-Leemon is offered in support of
counsel’s compliance with Code Civ. Proc. Section 430.41 and 435.5. Krause-Leemon
declares that he met and conferred with Cross-Complainant’s counsel by
telephone on March 7, 2024. (Krause-Leemon Decl., ¶ 3.)  
 
The meet and confer requirement has been met.  
 
C.   
Demurrer 
The
Luxor Cross-Defendants demur to the cross-complaint arguing that the first
through third causes of action for breach of contract, breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and declaratory relief fail to state
sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain.
 
1.    
Amendments to Cross-Complaint
 
The
Luxor Cross-Defendants argue Cross-Complainant cannot substitute
Cross-Defendants in place of a fictiously named cross-defendant because
Cross-Complainant was aware of Landlords’ identities at the time as they are
the Plaintiffs in this matter. Thus, Cross-Defendant argues the amendment was
not proper. 
“When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant,
he must state that fact in the complaint, or the affidavit if the action is
commenced by affidavit, and such defendant may be designated in any pleading or
proceeding by any name, and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or
proceeding must be amended accordingly . . . .”  (CCP § 474.)   
Ignorance of the name of a defendant has not been interpreted
literally.  (Optical Surplus, Inc. v. Superior Court (1991) 228
Cal.App.3d 776, 783.)  “Ignorance” may include situations where the
plaintiff knew the identity of the person but was ignorant of the facts giving
him a cause of action or knew the name and all the facts but was unaware that
the law gave him a cause of action.  (Ibid.)  Ignorance of the
facts is the critical issue.  (Ibid.)  The question of the
plaintiff's good faith in this regard is for the determination of the trial
court.  (Ibid.) 
In opposition, Cross-Complainant argues that it became aware
of the agreement between the Hendersons and Luxor after it filed its
cross-complaint.
Here, while the cross-complaint identifies the Luxor
Cross-Defendants by name, “ignorance” may include situations where the
plaintiff knew the identity of the person but was ignorant of the facts giving
him a cause of action or knew the name and all the facts but was unaware that
the law gave him a cause of action.  (Ibid.)
As the Luxor Defendants note in their demurrer and motion to strike, the
cross-complaint does not contain any allegations against them. Whether the
plaintiff had knowledge of sufficient facts at the time of filing is generally
a question of fact. (McOwen v. Grossman (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 937,
945.) If the cross-complaint does not contain any allegations against them,
their basis for liability has not been stated either. As a result, demurring on
this basis is inappropriate as it requires a review of the evidence, which is
not allowing on a demurrer.
Moreover, the cross-complaint alleges
that Cross-Defendant
ROES 1 through 10 are sued under fictitious names because their true names and
capacities are unknown to Cross-Complainant. For the
purpose of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleading in the complaint are
assumed to be true.  (See Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966.)  To defeat the amendment, the burden is on Luxor to
prove Cross-Complainant’s earlier awareness of its identity and facts
creating its liability.  (See Fara Estates Homeowners Ass’n v. Fara
Estates, Ltd. (9th Cir. 1998) 134 F.3d 377, 377 (applying California law); Breceda
v. Gamsby (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 167, 179.) Cross-Defendants have failed to
provide any judicially noticeable documents or point to any allegations within
the cross-complaint that prove Cross-Complainant had knowledge of the facts or
law giving Cross-Complainant a cause of action at the time it filed the cross-complaint.   
However,
Cross-Defendants also argue that Cross-Complainant
improperly seeks to substitute two named parties – Luxor and Dayani – into one
fictitiously named cross-defendant. This should be corrected. The demurrer is
sustained on this basis.
          Cross-Defendants also argue that Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30 required
Cross-Complainant to file its cross-complaint at the time Cross-Complainant
filed its answer. Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30,
properly applied, should be used to prevent rather than cause a forfeiture of
claims.  (See, e.g., McKee v.
Mires (1952) 110 Cal.App.2d 517, 523 (“greatest liberality is to be
encouraged in the allowance of [bringing causes of action] in order to see that
justice is done”); see also Silver
Orgs. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 98-99 (section 426.30 must be
liberally construed to avoid forfeiture of causes of action); see also Foot's
Transfer & Storage Co. v. Superior Court (1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 897, 901
(Foot’s Transfer) (“the long-standing rule favor[s] the allowance of
amended pleadings”).) 
While Code of Civil Procedure
section 426.30 employs the mandatory word "shall" with respect to
allowing an amendment of a pleading or the filing of a cross-complaint, it also
provides that the court shall grant leave to a party to amend his pleading or
to file a cross-complaint "if the party who failed to plead the cause
acted in good faith." 
 
          As a result,
the demurrer is overruled on this basis.
 
2.     Failure to State Claims and
Uncertainty
The Luxor Cross-Defendants also argue that all
Cross-Complainant’s claims are about the Henderson’s. They argue that when Roe
1 is read into the cross-complaint, the allegations make no sense. For example,
if Cross-Defendants are Roe 1, then the cross-complaint alleges that they
entered into a contract for the lease of the property in 2020, but the
cross-complaint then inconsistently alleges that Luxor did not even own the
premises until August of 2022. (Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 8, 17.) 
In opposition, Cross-Complainant argues that the
cross-complaint alleges that the Luxor Cross-Defendants entered into a purchase
agreement with the Hendersons whereby they would assume the assets, liability
and all contractual obligations incurred by the Hendersons. 
The cross-complaint fails to allege what Cross-Complainant
alleges in its opposition. Upon careful review of the cross-complaint, the court
agrees that the cross-complaint fails to state sufficient facts against
Cross-Defendants and is uncertain as against the Luxor Cross-Defendants. The
cross-complaint combines the allegations against all Cross-Defendants and fails
to clarify the theory of liability against the Luxor Cross-Defendants. A
demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims
renders the complaint so confusing that defendant cannot tell how he or she is
supposed to respond. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139.) The cross-complaint is entirely confusing for the reasons
the Luxor Cross-Defendants argue and more. The only allegation specifically
against the Luxor Defendants is that they purchased the subject property in
August of 2022 and they sued when Cross-Complainant did not pay rent. It is
unclear how they breached any agreement and whether it was the oral agreement
to waive the rent or the original lease agreement. Thus, the Luxor
Cross-Defendant cannot reasonably determine what issues or claims are stated. (Khoury, supra, 14 Cal.App.4th at 616.)
As such, the demurrer is sustained in its entirety, with 30
days leave to amend.
          III.     MOTION TO STRIKE 
A.  
Legal Standard 
 
Code Civ. Proc. §436 provides: “The court may, upon a motion
made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms
it deems proper: 
(a) Strike
out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
(b) Strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”        
B.    Motion to Strike
As the demurrer is sustained the motion to strike is denied
as moot.
IV.     CONCLUSION AND ORDER
          Cross-Defendants’
demurrer is SUSTAINED with 30 days leave to amend. The motion to strike is
denied as moot.
