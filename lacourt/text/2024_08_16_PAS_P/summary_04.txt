Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Luxor Cross-Defendants. The judge sustained the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend, meaning that the cross-complaint must be re-filed with additional information to clarify the claims against the Luxor Cross-Defendants. The judge also denied the motion to strike as moot, since the demurrer was sustained.

The judge found that the cross-complaint failed to state sufficient facts against the Luxor Cross-Defendants and was uncertain, making it difficult for the defendants to respond. The judge also found that the cross-complainant improperly substituted Luxor Cross-Defendants for fictional cross-defendants, and that the claims against the Luxor Cross-Defendants were not clear.

The judge ordered the cross-complainant to re-file the cross-complaint with additional information to clarify the claims against the Luxor Cross-Defendants.
