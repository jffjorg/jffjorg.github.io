And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to advance the hearing date for his motion for summary judgment. The case arose from a physical altercation and shooting that occurred in 2014, and the plaintiffs filed a complaint in 2016 alleging causes of action for assault and battery, conspiracy, negligence, loss of consortium, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The defendant filed his motion for summary judgment on June 25, 2024, which was timely filed and served. The plaintiffs argue that the notice dates for the motion were not properly calculated and that the notice provided by the defendant is invalid. However, the court finds that the motion was timely filed and served, and that the court may not refuse to hear a timely filed motion for summary judgment.

The judge has granted the motion to advance the hearing date for the motion for summary judgment, and the case will be heard on a date before the original trial date of October 8, 2024.
