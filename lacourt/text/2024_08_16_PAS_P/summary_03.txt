And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a demurrer filed by the defendant, Wennberg. The judge notes that the demurrer combines two separate grounds for demurrer into the same paragraphs, which violates a California rule of court. The judge admonishes Wennberg to comply with this rule going forward. The judge also declines to consider an argument raised by Wennberg in their reply because it was raised for the first time and is not permitted.
