```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiffs' motion to compel response to written discovery and to have matters deemed admitted. The motion is denied because it combines four separate motions to compel and fails to pay the required filing fees. The court also declines to award sanctions to the plaintiffs, as there was no meet and confer in this matter. The court finds that the defendant did respond to the outstanding discovery requests on August 6, 2024, making the motion moot.
