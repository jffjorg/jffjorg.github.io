[1] The Court notes that Defendant Wennbergâ€™s
demurrer combines the grounds for demurrer to the first and second causes of
action into the same paragraphs. (See Demurrer p. 3:5-14.) This violates Rule
3.1320(a) of the California Rules of Court, which requires each ground for a
demurrer to be stated in a separate paragraph. (CRC 3.1320(a).) The Court
admonishes Defendant Wennberg to comply with the requirements of the California
Rules of Court going forward.


[2] To the extent Defendant Wennberg attempted
to argue in the reply that the second cause of action failed allege sufficient
facts to support it, (Reply, 4:21-5:28), the Court declines to consider that
argument here because it was raised for the first time on reply, which
generally is not permitted. (See Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537-1538.)
