ORDER SUSTAINING THE DEMURRER TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CAUSES OF ACTION IN THE VERIFIED
SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT WITH LEAVE TO AMENDI.        INTRODUCTION
          In this real property boundary dispute, Plaintiffs Ralston
C. Riggs and Tina M. Riggs allege that there is a dispute regarding the
boundaries of their property located at 1190 Morada Place, Altadena, CA 91001,
following a survey conducted by Defendant Petra Wennberg in 2019 but not
disclosed to Plaintiffs until February 2022. 
          The verified second amended complaint contains six causes
of action: (1) Implied Agreement of Boundary Fence/Driveway; (2) Implied
Agreement of Boundary Fence/Driveway (Estoppel); (3) Implied Easement; (4)
Equitable Easement; (5) Declaratory Relief; and (6) Injunctive Relief.
          Defendant Wennberg filed this demurrer on May 6, 2024. Plaintiffs
filed an opposition on August 5, 2024. Defendant Wennberg filed a reply on August
9, 2024.
Before
the Court are Defendant Wennberg’s challenges to the first and second causes of
action of the verified second amended complaint. Defendant Wennberg contends
that both causes of action fail to state sufficient facts and/or are uncertain.

The
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to both causes of action. 
II.      DEMURRER
A. Legal Standard
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a
complaint fails to state a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is treated as “admitting all
material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-Defendants Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer is that the pleadings are
“deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.) 
Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.)
Allegations
need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable
facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462,
1474.) 
“We
treat the demurrer as admitting all the properly pleaded material facts and
consider matters which may be judicially noticed, but we do not treat as
admitted contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Align
Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d
343].) Further, ‘ “ ‘we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading
it as a whole and its parts in their context.’ ”’ (Ibid.) Because a
demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true
even the most improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with
the plaintiff's ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.)
‘“Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint also are
accepted as true and are given precedence, to the extent they contradict the
allegations.”’ (Paul v. Patton (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091.)
Although a demurrer does not ordinarily reach affirmative defenses, it ‘“will
lie where the complaint ‘has included allegations that clearly disclose some
defense or bar to recovery.’ ”’ (Casterson v. Superior Court (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 177, 183, Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406. )
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is
uncertain. (CCP § 430.10(f).) Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are
only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible a defendant cannot
reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best
Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
          B. Meet and Confer Requirement Met
          The Declaration of Osvaldo Rocha is offered in support of
counsel’s compliance with Code Civ. Proc. Section 430.41. Rocha declares that
he met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel via email on April 29, 2024 and
May 6, 2024. (Rocha Decl. ¶ 4.) 
The
meet and confer requirement has not been met, as there is no indication that
the parties met and conferred in person, by telephone, or by video conference.
(CCP § 430.41(a).) Nevertheless, the Court may not overrule a demurrer for
failure to adequately meet and confer. (Id., § 430.41(a)(4).) The Court
will still consider the demurrer, but admonishes Defendant Wennberg to comply
with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going forward.
          C. Demurrer
Defendants
contend that the demurrer to the first and second causes of action should be
sustained because they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action and are uncertain. (See Demurrer p. 3:5-14.)[1] The
Court agrees. The second amended complaint is verified, which subjects it to
additional restrictions when pleading. “ ‘A complaint may plead inconsistent
causes of action [citations], although it be verified, if there are no
contradictory or antagonistic facts [citation].’ [Citation.] Thus, ‘unless the
alternate pleadings contain antagonistic statements, the statement of facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action in one count is not a bar to the
maintenance of a separately stated count in the same pleading based upon
inconsistent allegations.’ [Citation.]” (Berman v. Bromberg
(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 944-945 (“Berman”).)
Plaintiffs
allege in the first cause of action in the second amended complaint that the prior
owners were uncertain of the true boundaries “when they built the Boundary
Fences, the driveway access strip and the paved asphalt driveway serving the
1190 Lot.” (SAC, ¶ 27.) On the other hand, Plaintiffs allege in the second
cause of action that the prior owners “knew they were not
building the Boundary Fences, the concrete vehicle access strip, and the paved
driveway serving the 1190 Lot on the 1190 Lot; and they knew that major parts
of the Boundary Fences, and most of the concrete vehicle access strip and most
of the paved driveway at the entrance and other places at the South end of the
1184 Lot were not on the 1190 Lot on the 1184 Lot… That knew that
if the Boundary Fences were installed where the true boundary between the two
lots was would effectively prevent any sale of the 1190 Lot.” (SAC, ¶ 40(a),
emphasis in original.) These allegations directly conflict with each other, which
is not permissible in a verified complaint. (Berman, supra,  56 Cal.App.4th at pp. 944-945; Faulkner v.
California Toll Bridge Authority (1953) 40 Cal.2d 317, 328 (“Faulkner”),
internal citations and quotation marks omitted [“Furthermore, although a
plaintiff may plead inconsistent counts or causes of action in his complaint
[citation] even where, as here, it be verified, if there are no contradictory or
antagonistic facts… the rule does not permit the pleader to blow both hot and
cold in the same complaint on the subject of facts of which he purports to
speak with knowledge under oath.”])
The
Court finds Plaintiffs’ various citations to Witkin regarding the criticisms of
the rule set forth in Beatty v. Pacific States Savings & Loan Co. (1935)
4 Cal.App.3d 697 (“Beatty”), and later found in Berman and Faulkner,
to be unavailing here because a treatise is not binding authority. (Ammerman
v. Callender (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1087.) To the extent Plaintiffs
rely on Tanforan v. Tanforan (1916) 173 Cal. 270 (“Tanforan”) for
the common proposition that parties are generally free to plead inconsistent
legal theories, Tanforan did not involve a verified complaint. (See
generally, 183 Cal. 270.) Faulkner, on the other hand, is California
Supreme Court precedent issued almost 40 years after Tanforan that deals
directly with the issue of inconsistent allegations in a verified complaint and
incorporates the rule set forth in Beatty. (Faulkner, supra, 40
Cal.2d at p. 328.) The other authorities Plaintiffs rely on, namely Adams v.
Paul (1995) 11 Cal.4th 593 and Walton v. Walton (1995) 31
Cal.App.4th 292, do not address inconsistent allegations vis-à-vis verified
complaints, nor do they address the holding of Beatty found in Faulkner,
Berman, and other cases. Plaintiffs cited no other controlling authority in
their opposition on that this issue.
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Court will permit Plaintiffs one more opportunity to amend.
The Court notes that Defendant Wennberg’s moving papers’ only real issue was
the inconsistent allegations and did not address any other defects in the
second amend complaint.[2]
Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the first and second cause of
action with leave to amend.
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Defendant
Wennberg’s demurrer is sustained to the first and second causes of action with
leave to amend. 
Plaintiffs
Ralston C. Riggs and Tina M. Riggs are given 30 days to amend the second
amended complaint.
