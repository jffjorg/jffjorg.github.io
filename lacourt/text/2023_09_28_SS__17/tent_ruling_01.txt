LUCIA RODRIGUEZ 
                           
        
  vs.
 
MARTINI ASSOCIATES DEVELOPMENT, LLC 
 
                                          


 Case
  No.:  21STCV07577
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 28, 2023



 
Plaintiff’s motion to strike Defendant’s answer is GRANTED
 
            On 2/25/2021, Plaintiff Lucia
Rodriguez (Plaintiff) filed suit against Martini Associates Development, LLC
(Defendant), alleging: (1) age discrimination; (2) disparate treatment of a
medical condition; (3) retaliation; and (4) wrongful termination. 
 
            Now, Plaintiff moves to strike
Defendant’s answer.  
 
            The motion is unopposed.
 
Discussion

 
            Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s
answer should be stricken because Defendant’s LLC status has been terminated
since 12/15/2022 and it is currently not represented by counsel. 
 
            The Court agrees. 
 
Corporations and LLC's are entities which must be in good
standing in order to participate in litigation in any court. Moreover, a
corporation cannot represent itself in court, either in propria persona or
through an officer or agent who is not an attorney. (Nerco Constr. Engineers
v Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 729.) 
 
            Here, Defendant’s counsel was
relieved on 10/13/2022. There is no indication that Defendant has obtained new
counsel, despite having had ample time to do so, and Defendant did not oppose
this motion to offer any substantial justification for its conduct. 
As such, Defendant has indicated that it is either unwilling
or unable to participate in this litigation. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to strike
Defendant’s answer is granted. Plaintiff may seek the entry of default with the
Clerk.
 
It is so
ordered.
