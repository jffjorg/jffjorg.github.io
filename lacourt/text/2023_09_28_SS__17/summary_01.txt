The defendant's counsel was relieved on October 13, 2022, and there is no indication that the defendant has obtained new counsel. The court finds that the defendant has either unwillingly or unable to participate in the litigation, and therefore the defendant's answer is stricken. The plaintiff may now seek the entry of default with the clerk.

## English Summary

In this case, Lucia Rodriguez is suing Martini Associates Development, LLC for age discrimination and other related claims. The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Rodriguez's motion to strike Defendant's answer. 

The judge's reasoning is that Martini Associates Development, LLC's status as a legal entity has been terminated since December 15, 2022, and it is currently not represented by an attorney.  California law requires corporations and LLCs to be in good standing to participate in litigation, and they cannot represent themselves in court. Since Martini Associates Development, LLC  failed to obtain new counsel after its previous representation ended, the judge concludes that it is unable or unwilling to participate in the lawsuit. 

As a result, the judge is granting the motion to strike the defendant's answer, which essentially means the defendant is no longer able to formally respond to the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff can now proceed with seeking a default judgment from the court.
