And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer due to the defendant's LLC status being terminated and lack of representation by counsel. The defendant's counsel was relieved on October 13, 2022, and there is no indication that the defendant has obtained new counsel. The court finds that the defendant has either unwillingly or unable to participate in the litigation, and therefore the defendant's answer is stricken. The plaintiff may now seek the entry of default with the clerk.
