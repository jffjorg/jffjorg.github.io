English text:

The tentative ruling for case number 23STCV03331, to be heard on September 28, 2023 in Department 17 of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, denies the defendant's special motion to strike. The plaintiffs, Dariush Eghbali, Darisuh Eghbali Inc., and Boniad Ayeneh dba Ayeneh Foundation, brought a lawsuit against Nader Rafiee, OITN, Mehran Abshah, and IPN TV for defamation. The defendant, Mehran Abshah, moved to strike the plaintiff's complaint. The court applied the two-prong test for special motions to strike under CCP section 425.16. First, the court found that the plaintiff's claim implicated protected activity, as the defendant's speech concerned a matter of public interest. However, the court also found that the plaintiffs had satisfied the second prong of the analysis, as they had stated a legally sufficient claim and presented evidence that substantiated their claim. The court rejected the defendant's arguments that the plaintiffs had failed to request a retraction, had not suffered actual damages, had not pled facts constituting actual malice, and had failed to plead that the three statements attributed to the defendant were "of and concerning" the two corporate affiliates. The court noted that there were triable issues as to whether the defendant's work constituted a "daily or weekly news publication" for the purposes of Civil Code section 48a. The court also found that the plaintiff had incurred special damages as a result of the defendant's accusation of criminal behavior. The court further found that the plaintiffs had presented evidence that could show that the defendant acted with actual malice in making the alleged defamatory comments. The court concluded that the plaintiffs' claims concerned protected activity, but that they had also presented evidence that substantiated their claim. As such, the court denied the defendant's special motion to strike.
