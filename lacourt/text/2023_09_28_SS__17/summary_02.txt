Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's special motion to strike the complaint. The court finds that the defendant's speech concerns a matter of public interest and implicates protected activity, but also finds that the plaintiff has stated a legally sufficient claim and presented evidence that substantiates that claim. The court concludes that the plaintiff has met its burden to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim.
