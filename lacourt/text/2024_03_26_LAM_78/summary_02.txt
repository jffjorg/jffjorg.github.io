And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the motion for attorney's fees and costs filed by defendants Farzana Sheikh, Saeed Mala, and Danial Sheikh. The defendants sought to recover attorney's fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.420, which allows a party to recover reasonable expenses incurred in proving requests for admission that were denied by the opposing party. However, the Judge found that the plaintiff had good reason to deny the requests for admission, as it would have conceded its claims against the defendants if it had admitted to their involvement in the alleged conspiracy. The Judge also found that the defendants' demand for fees and costs was co-extensive with expenses that would have been incurred regardless of whether the requests for admission were admitted. Finally, the Judge noted that only expenses resulting from a responding party's failure to admit a request for admission are awardable under the statute.
