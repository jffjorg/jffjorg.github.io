And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for a default judgment in the amount of $461,464.81, consisting of $446,554.49 in damages, $14,299.57 in interest, and $610.75 in costs. The default judgment is a result of the defendant's failure to pay licensing fees between August 2022 and June 2023, in breach of a premier seat licensing agreement entered into in December 2021. The plaintiff provided evidence to support its claim, including a declaration from its Vice President of Ticketing and calculations of the defendant's missed licensing fees. The judge has also ordered the moving party to provide notice and will enter the proposed judgment (JUD-100) received on December 20, 2023.
