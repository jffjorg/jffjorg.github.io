  Case Number:  23NWCV00237    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  F Giron, et al. v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
23NWCV00237
 
This lemon law action was filed on January 24, 2023. Trial
is currently scheduled to begin on February 21, 2025. Defendant’s Motion for
Summary Adjudication is currently scheduled to heard after trial, on May 22,
2025. Defendant now moves ex parte to Continue Trial and Related Dates so that
its Motion for Summary Adjudication may be heard before trial. Defendant argues
good cause exists because it has a statutory right to bring a summary judgment
motion and because Plaintiffs have not been able to depose Defendant’s PMQ due
to its limited availability. 
 
Defendant’s Ex Parte Application to Continue Trial and
Related Dates is GRANTED pursuant to California Rules of Court rule
3.1332(c)(6) (a party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony,
documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts). A continuance
for a trial date on or after September 25, 2025, is reasonable and permits
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Adjudication to be heard before trial. The Court
will confer with the parties to select new trial and FSC dates. The discovery
cut-off will track the new trial date. Moving party to give notice.
