And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., is seeking to continue the trial date and related dates in the lemon law action filed by F Giron, et al. The defendant argues that good cause exists for the continuance because it has a statutory right to bring a summary judgment motion and because the plaintiffs have not been able to depose the defendant's PMQ due to limited availability. The court grants the defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial date and related dates, and sets a new trial date on or after September 25, 2025, which will allow the defendant's motion for summary adjudication to be heard before trial. The court will confer with the parties to select new trial and FSC dates, and the discovery cut-off will track the new trial date.
