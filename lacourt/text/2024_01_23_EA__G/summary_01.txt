And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Loa Int'l (USA) Transport Co. Inc. v. George Liu. The case involves a breach of contract action and claims of intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, and violation of California Unfair Competition Law, among others.

The judge has overruled George Liu's demurrer to Loa's second cause of action, which alleges intentional interference with contractual relations. The judge found that the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) provided sufficient facts to establish the existence of a contractual relationship between Loa and a third-party, as well as Liu's intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of that relationship.

The judge has also denied Liu's motion to strike punitive damages from Loa's SAC. The judge found that the SAC adequately alleged Liu's actions were malicious, and therefore, the SAC sufficiently alleged the elements necessary to support a claim for punitive damages.

As a result, Liu is ordered to file an answer to the Second Amended Complaint in 10 days.
