Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The court will sustain the demurrer of the Torres-Gutierrez Defendants in its entirety with 20 days leave to amend. In addition, the court will overrule in part the demurrer of the Torres-Uzeta Defendants as to the sixth cause of action against Rosa Torres and otherwise sustain it in its entirety with 20 days leave to amend.

The court found that the Torres-Gutierrez Defendants' demurrer was sustained because the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for slander of title, elder abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, and false imprisonment.

The court also found that the Torres-Uzeta Defendants' demurrer was overruled in part because the complaint did adequately state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for elder abuse against Rosa Torres.
