And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a default prove-up hearing for a case where the plaintiff is seeking damages and trebled damages from the defendant. The plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement where the defendant would supply workers to the plaintiff's warehouse, and the plaintiff would supervise the employees and pay the defendant for their wages and benefits. However, the defendant failed to file proper IRS forms and did not remit the refund to the plaintiff. The judge agrees that the defendant's actions constitute the receipt of stolen property and that trebled damages are appropriate.

The judge has calculated the damages as follows: $284,806.64 for the first quarter of 2021, $252,151.34 for the third quarter of 2021, and $344,226.45 for the statutory penalty. The total award is $873,437.56. The judge will also award attorneys' fees and costs of $75,088.84.

The judge does not believe that an accounting is necessary and will not require the defendant to provide any additional information. The judge will sign the judgment and will calculate the interest through the date of entry of judgment. The judgment will also provide for post-judgment interest.

The judge notes that the defendant does not have the benefit of the money that the IRS has not yet remitted, and therefore, the court will not treble the damages for that amount. The judge will issue an order or statement to aid the IRS in sending the money directly to the plaintiff rather than to the defendant.
