BACKGROUND
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff
Peter Farkas’ (“Plaintiff”) rental of the recreational room (Room) at an RV
park owned by Defendants Stewart Silver (“Silver”) and Oceans 11 RV Park, LLC
dba Cali Lake RV Resort (“Cali Lake RV Resort”) (collectively, “Defendants”).
 
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this action.
Subsequently, Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on June 22,
2023.
 
On July 27, 2023, Defendants filed their Cross-Complaint
against Cross-Defendants Farkas and Beatrix Nagy (“Nagy”) and Does 1 to 10,
alleging (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Private Nuisance, (3) Public Nuisance, (4)
Trespass, (5) Waste, (6) Negligence and Negligence Per Se, and (7) Declaratory
Relief.  
 
On December 11, 2023, the Department F47 Court sustained in
part and denied in part Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC, granting Plaintiff 30
days leave to amend. (12/11/23 Minute Order.) 
 
Subsequently, on December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed his
operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants and Does 1
through 10, alleging (1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability, (2)
Negligence, (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and (4) Violation
of Bane Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 52.1). Following this, Defendants filed their
Answer to SAC on January 24, 2024.
 
On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel Theodore Theodosiadis
(“Counsel”) filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”).
 
            No Opposition papers have been
received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
            In
addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subsection (d) requires that
the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal
service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must
be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:
            (A) The service address is the current residence or
business address of the client; or
(B)
The service address is the last known residence or business address of the
client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and
MC-052. Counsel has also lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the Court. 
 
Counsel has provided a
declaration stating that the Motion is necessitated by “specific facts ...
confidential and required to be kept confidential pursuant to California
Business and Professions Code Section 6068(e), rule 3-100(A), California Rules
of Professional Conduct, and by the attorney client privilege (Evi. Code §
950).” (MC-025, ¶ 2.) Additionally, Counsel states that “In the event that this Court
desires further information to ascertain the good faith basis for this motion
and for withdrawal, it is respectfully requested that the court have an in
camera hearing outside of the presence of all other parties so that the
specific facts demonstrating good cause for this withdrawal may be demonstrated
to the court. See, e.g., Manfredi & Levine v Superior Court, 66
Cal.App.4th 1128, 1136-1137, 3-700(B) or (C).” (Ibid.) 
 
The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory.
Counsel states in his declaration that the Motion was served by personal
service and by mail at Plaintiff’s last known address. (MC-052, ¶ 3(a)(2).) Additionally,
Counsel has confirmed that this address is current by email confirmation. (Ibid.)
Proof of Service has been attached to the Motion papers, demonstrating proper
service on Plaintiff and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
 
The next hearing scheduled for this action is a Post-Mediation
Status Conference set for September 19, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department F49 at
9425 Penfield Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311. (MC-052, ¶ 4.) A jury trial is set
for March 17, 2025. (Id. ¶ 6.))
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Peter Farkas’s Counsel Theodore Theodosiadis’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.
 
Moving counsel to give notice.
