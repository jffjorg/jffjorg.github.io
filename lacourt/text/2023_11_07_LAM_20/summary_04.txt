And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a dispute between Whitestone Builders, Inc. (the plaintiff) and Valerie Taylor and Derek Taylor (the defendants) regarding renovations to a duplex. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants, alleging breach of contract, account stated, common count, unjust enrichment, and foreclosure on mechanic's lien. The defendants filed a second amended cross-complaint against the plaintiff and others, alleging various claims including disgorgement, rescission and restitution, and declaratory relief. The plaintiff has now moved for summary adjudication of the defendants' claim for disgorgement.

The judge has found that the plaintiff, Whitestone Builders, Inc., was properly licensed as a contractor at all times relevant to the dispute. The judge has also found that the plaintiff had workers' compensation insurance coverage at the time of work, despite the fact that it failed to report payroll and did not have a valid license. The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, finding that there are no triable issues of fact and that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The judge's ruling is based on a review of the pleadings, evidence, and law. The judge has considered the Business and Professions Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, and various case citations, including Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. and Wright v. Issak. The judge has also considered the evidence presented, including the testimony of Marlene A. Hernandez, an underwriter for the State Compensation Insurance Fund, and the documents submitted by the parties, including the Certificates of Licensure and the payroll records of Southland Roofing, Inc.
