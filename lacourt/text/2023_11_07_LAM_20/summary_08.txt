And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling relates to a lawsuit filed by Franciscan AAH, LLC against unnamed defendants for failure to pay commercial rent. The plaintiff seeks to file a first amended complaint because it discovered that the defendants further breached the lease by failing to repair and maintain the premises in the required condition. The court may grant or deny the motion for leave to amend the pleading. California laws favor the liberal allowance of amendments, and the court will generally grant the motion unless the party seeking to amend has been dilatory or the delay will cause prejudice to the opposing party. Since there is no opposition, the motion is granted.
