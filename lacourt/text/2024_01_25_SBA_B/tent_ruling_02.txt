Motion to Set Aside
Default and Default Judgment
 
            The court considered the moving and
opposition papers.
RULING
            The motion is DENIED.
BACKGROUND
            On December 3, 2003, plaintiff Larry
Flynt, ind. and dba Hustler Casino filed a complaint against defendant John K.
Horne.    On February 3, 2004, a default was entered
against defendant.  On March 18, 2004, a
default judgment was entered against defendant.  On January 23, 2014, an application for and
renewal of judgment was filed.  On
October 18, 2023, an application for and renewal of judgment was filed.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
“The court may, upon terms as may
be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  Application for this relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. . . .”  CCP §473(b).
DISCUSSION
            Pursuant
to CCP §473, defendant (self-represented) requests that the court vacate the default
judgment against him.
            As
the court noted above, the default judgment was entered on March 18, 2004, and the judgment
was renewed in January 2014 and October 2023.
            Defendant
states in his declaration that based on inadvertence, he never received notice
of the case.  He states that the very
first knowledge he received of the case was in October 2023.  He explains that when the case was first
filed the address where he was purportedly served was a postal service
address.  He states that “early in the
2000s, due to financial difficulties” he could no longer afford to keep the
mailbox service.  He did not leave a
forwarding mailing address.  In September
2019, as he was without a permanent address and desperately needed one, he
returned to the same postal service address. 
He states that the only difference is the box number, which is now
#510.  He further states that because the
owners of the service know him they recognized that although plaintiff used the
“old #375” they inserted the renewal in his new box.  John Horne decl.
In
opposition, plaintiff argues that the motion is untimely under CCP §473(b) and
defendant failed to file a proposed pleading. 
Plaintiff contends that defendant was properly served with the summons
and complaint on December 9, 2003 at 269 Beverly Drive, #375, Beverly Hills;
served with the request for entry of default on January 22, 2004; a copy of the
request for court judgment on March 16, 2004; a copy of the notice of entry of
judgment on March 30, 2004; notice of renewal of judgment on January 29, 2014; and
notice of renewal of judgment on November 1, 2023.
            The
court rules as follows:  
            As to CCP §473(b), the motion is
untimely as it was not filed within six months of entry of judgment.
Renewal of a judgment is a
ministerial act performed by a court clerk upon receipt of an application for
renewal.  CCP §§683.120(b), 683.150(a).  CCP §683.150(a) states, that “Upon the filing
of the application, the court clerk shall enter the renewal of the judgment in
the court records.”  CCP §683.170 allows
a judgment debtor to move to vacate the renewed judgment on any ground that
would be a defense to an action on the judgment, within 60 days after service
of the notice of renewal pursuant to CCP §683.160.  Defendant did not timely file a motion under
CCP §683.170.
            The
motion is thus DENIED.
ORDER
            The
motion is DENIED.
            Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
