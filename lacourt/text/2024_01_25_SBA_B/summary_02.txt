And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion filed by defendant John K. Horne to set aside the default judgment entered against him in 2004. The defendant claims that he never received notice of the case due to inadvertence and that the default judgment was entered as a result of his mistake. However, the court has ruled that the motion is untimely and that the defendant failed to file a proposed pleading. The court has also noted that the default judgment was renewed in 2014 and 2023, and that the defendant did not timely file a motion to vacate the renewed judgment. As a result, the court has denied the motion to set aside the default judgment.
