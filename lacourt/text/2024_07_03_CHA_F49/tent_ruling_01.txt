Theodosiadis, for Plaintiff Peter Farkas (the “Counsel”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None
NOTICE: OK

REQUESTED: An
order relieving Counsel for Plaintiff Peter
Farkas
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The

BACKGROUND
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff
Peter Farkas’ (“Plaintiff” or “Farkas”) rental of the recreational room (Room)
at an RV park owned by Defendants Stewart Silver and Oceans 11 RV Park, LLC dba
Cali Lake RV Resort (Cali Lake RV Resort) (collectively, “Defendants”).
Plaintiff contends that Defendants improperly converted the room into a
dwelling unit and he rented it as such. Defendants contend, in their demurrer,
that they rented the Room to Farkas for storage purposes only and he and his
friend began to reside in the unit in violation of the agreement.
 
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff
initiated this action by filing a Complaint against Defendants, which was
subsequently amended on June 22, 2023, alleging: (1) Breach of Implied Warranty
of Habitability; (2) Negligence; (3) Negligent Hiring; (4) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (5) Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress; (6) Violation of Bane Act (Civil Code § 52.1) and (7) Private Nuisance.
 
On December 11, 2023, Department
F47 Court sustained in part Defendants’ demurrer filed on July 26, 2023,
thereby granting Plaintiff 30 days to amend his Third, Fourth, Fifth, and
Seventh Causes of Action. 
 
Subsequently, on December 20, 2023,
Plaintiff filed his operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), alleging: (1)
Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability; (2) Negligence; (3) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (4) Violation of Bane Act (Civil Code § 52.1.) Following this,
on January 24, 2024, Defendants filed their Answer to the SAC.
 
On March 29, 2024, Counsel filed
the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff (the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition or Reply papers have
been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
            In
addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subsection (d) requires that
the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal
service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must
be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:
            (A) The service address is the current residence or
business address of the client; or
(B)
The service address is the last known residence or business address of the
client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and
MC-052. Counsel has also lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the Court.
 
Counsel
has provided a declaration stating that the Motion is necessitated by “specific
facts ... are confidential and required to be kept confidential pursuant to
California Business and Professions Code Section 6068(e), rule 3-100(A),
California Rules of Professional Conduct, and by the attorney client privilege
(Ev[id.] [Code] § 950).” (MC-052, ¶ 2.) Additionally, Counsel provides
that “In the event that this Court
desires further information to ascertain the good faith
basis for this motion and for withdrawal, it
is respectfully requested that the court have an in camera
hearing outside of the presence of all other parties so that the specific facts demonstrating good cause for this
withdrawal may be demonstrated to the court. See,e.g., Manfredi & Levine v
Superior Court, 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1136-1137, 3-700(B)
or (C)..”
(Ibid.) 
 
The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory.
Counsel states in his declaration that the Motion was served by mail at Plaintiff’s
last known address. (MC-052, ¶ 3(a)(2).) Moreover, Counsel has confirmed within
the past 30 days that this address is current by email. (Id. ¶
3(b)(2)(c).)
 
However, having reviewed the Motion, the Court finds the
following defects:
 
-         
Counsel has not
completed section 6 on Form MC-053 regarding the client’s current or last known
address and telephone number.
 
-         
Information is missing
in sections 7-9 on Form MC-053 regarding future hearing and trial. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court CONTINUES the Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel to allow additional time for Counsel to address the
defects in the mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-053.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Peter Farkas’s Counsel Theodore
Theodosiadis’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is CONTINUED.
 
Moving counsel to give notice.
