And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel Hastings Wound Solutions to comply with its deposition subpoena. The judge finds that Hastings Wound Solutions has failed to comply with its discovery obligations and has failed to file any objections or responses to the subpoena. The judge orders Hastings Wound Solutions to comply with the subpoena and produce the requested documents.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against Hastings Wound Solutions in the amount of $560.00. The judge finds that Hastings Wound Solutions' failure to comply with the subpoena and failure to respond to the motion warrants the imposition of sanctions. The judge uses a lodestar approach to calculate the reasonable amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred in preparing the motion, and finds that the total and reasonable amount is $560.00.
