Rollins (“Plaintiff”  or “Rollins”) RESPONDING PARTY: None NOTICE: OK   RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court to compel nonparty Hastings Wound Solutions’ (“HWS”) compliance  with the subpoena for deposition and production of documents. Rollins also requests  the Court to impose monetary sanctions against HWS, in favor of Plaintiff, in  the amount of $1,560.00.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED. The Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.    BACKGROUND   On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff Rollins (deceased) filed a  complaint against Defendant Walditrudez P. Lopez (“Lopez” or “Defendant”) and  Does 1 through 250, alleging (1) Elder Abuse (Welfare and Institutions Code §§  15600 et seq.), and (2) Negligence. Subsequently, on May 8, 2024, Lopez filed  an Answer to the Complaint.   On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel  nonparty HWS’s compliance with the deposition subpoena (the “Motion”).   No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the  Court.   ANALYSIS   A party seeking discovery from a person who is not a party  to the action may obtain discovery by oral deposition, written deposition, or  deposition subpoena for production of business records.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §  2020.010.)¿ A deposition subpoena may command: (1) only the attendance and  testimony of the deponent, (2) only the production of business records for  copying, or (3) the attendance and testimony of the deponent, as well as the  production of business records, other documents, electronically stored  information, and tangible things.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.020.)¿  ¿  A service of a deposition subpoena shall be effected a  sufficient time in advance of the deposition to provide the deponent a  reasonable opportunity to locate and produce any designated documents and,  where personal attendance is commanded, a reasonable time to travel to the  place of deposition.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.220, subd. (a).)¿ Personal  service of any deposition subpoena is effective to require a deponent who is a  resident of California to: personally appear and testify, if the subpoena so specifies;  to produce any specified documents; and to appear at a court session if the  subpoena so specifies.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.220, subd. (c).)¿ A deponent  who disobeys a deposition subpoena may be punished for contempt without the  necessity of a prior order of the court directing compliance by the witness.¿  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.240.)¿  ¿  A “written notice and all moving papers supporting a motion  to compel an answer to a deposition question or to compel production of a  document or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally served  on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service  by mail¿or electronic service¿at an address¿or electronic service  address¿specified on the deposition record.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule  3.1346.)¿  ¿  A nonparty deponent may be subject to contempt or monetary  sanctions for disobeying a court order (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd.  (k)) or for “flouting” the discovery process by suppressing or destroying  evidence (Temple Community Hospital v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th  464, 476).¿ A nonparty may be punished by contempt (Code Civ. Proc., §  2020.240) or payment of $500.00 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1992).¿    A.     Motion to  Compel Deposition   On May 15, 2024, Plaintiff  subpoenaed HWS to depose its custodian of records and to obtain documents that reference  Plaintiff from HWS’s records. (Crownover Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. “1.”) HWS failed to  attend the noticed deposition set for June 5, 2024, and to date, HWS has failed  to produce the requested records, or any responses or objections thereto,  despite Plaintiff’s attempt to obtain the same. (Id. ¶ 4.)   The Court finds that HWS has failed to comply with its  discovery obligation.  In addition, HWS has failed to file any objections  and explain to the Court why it failed to provide the requested documents or a  response.  HWS has also failed to file an opposition to the  Motion. Nor does HWS file a motion to quash the subpoena at issue.   Accordingly, the Court  GRANTS the Motion, ordering HWS to comply with Plaintiff’s subpoena.       B.      Monetary  Sanctions   Additionally, Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions against HWS  in the amount of $1,560.00, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections  2025.480, 2025.440(b), 2020.240, and 2023.030. (Notice of Mot. at p. 2.)    Code  of Civil Procedure section 2025.440, subdivision (b) sets forth, “If a deponent  on whom a deposition subpoena has been served fails to attend a deposition or  refuses to be sworn as a witness, the court may impose on the deponent the  sanctions described in Section 2020.240.” Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure  section 2020.240 provides, in part, “A deponent who disobeys a deposition  subpoena in any manner described in subdivision (c) of Section 2020.220 may be  punished for contempt under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  without the necessity of a prior order of court directing compliance by the  witness.”   Accordingly,  utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the  circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of  attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work in preparing the Motion is $560.00,  calculated at a reasonable hourly rate of $500 for one hour reasonably spent  plus $60.00 for filing fees.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s  unopposed Motion to Compel Hastings Wound Solutions’ Compliance with Deposition  Subpoena is GRANTED.   Plaintiff’s  Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.   Hastings  Wound Solutions is ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $560.00 to  Plaintiff.   Moving  party to give notice.
