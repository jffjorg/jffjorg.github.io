Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Theodore Theodosiadis, counsel for plaintiff Peter Farkas, is continued. The motion is necessitated by "specific facts ... are confidential and required to be kept confidential pursuant to California Business and Professions Code Section 6068(e), rule 3-100(A), California Rules of Professional Conduct, and by the attorney-client privilege (Ev[id.] [Code] ยง 950)." The judge finds Counsel's reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory, but notes that the motion is defective in that Counsel has not completed section 6 on Form MC-053 regarding the client's current or last known address and telephone number, and information is missing in sections 7-9 on Form MC-053 regarding future hearing and trial. The judge continues the motion to allow additional time for Counsel to address these defects.
