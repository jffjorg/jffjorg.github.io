MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Airgas USA, LLC  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Joe Ledesma
Motion to Compel Compliance and for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Airgas USA, LLC (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order
(1) compelling plaintiff Joe Ledesma (“Plaintiff”) to comply with the court’s
October 20, 2023 orders (i) to serve further answers to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories – Employment, and (ii) to produce responsive documents to
Defendant’s Requests for Production, (2) imposing evidence, issue, or
terminating sanctions against Plaintiff for his misuse of the discovery
process, (3) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and against
Plaintiff in the amount of $6,435, and        (4) awarding sanctions against Plaintiff
in the amount of $1,500, payable to the court pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 177.5.
If
a party engages in the misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.)¿ Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 provides, in relevant
part, that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to,
the following: . . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. . . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.”¿ 
“The
trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after
considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to
determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party;
and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’”¿ (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390, quoting Lang
v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)¿ “Generally, ‘[a] decision
to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.¿ But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’”¿ (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)¿ 
On October
20, 2023, the court issued two orders (1) granting Defendant’s motion to compel
Plaintiff’s further responses to its Form Interrogatories – Employment and
ordering Plaintiff to serve full and complete answers to the specified
interrogatories within 20 days of the date of the order, and (2) granting
Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to its Requests for
Production of Documents and ordering Plaintiff to serve written further
responses and to produce responsive documents to those demands within 20 days
of the date of the order.  (Oct. 20, 2023
Order re Mot. to Compel Further Resp. to Form Interrogatories, p. 2:10-18; Oct.
20, 2023 Order re Mot. to Compel Further Resp. to Req. for Prod., p.
2:10-18.)  The court also ordered
Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant.  (Ibid.) 
Defendant
has produced evidence showing that (1) on December 1, 2023 (i.e., more than 20
days after the date of the court’s October 20, 2023 orders), Plaintiff served
supplemental responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories – Employment and Requests
for Production, and (2) as of the date that Defendant filed this motion,
Plaintiff had not (i) served complete responses to interrogatories numbers
204.2, subdivision (c) (because Plaintiff did not state the date on which the
illness or injury occurred), 204.5 (because Plaintiff did not state whether he
needed any accommodation to perform any function of his job), and 210.2
(because Plaintiff did not set forth how he calculated the amount of lost
wages, lost overtime and raises, and lost benefits), or (ii) produced any
responsive documents.  (Ehsani-Nia Decl.,
¶¶ 11-12, 16; Ehsani-Nia Decl., Ex. 2 [Form Interrogatories – Employment];
Ehsani-Nia Decl., Ex. 11, Pl. Supp. Responses to Form Interrogatories, pp. 18:8-21:8
[supplemental response to no. 204.2], 21:20 [supplemental response to 204.5],
26:16-17 [supplemental response to no. 210.2].)  
Thus, the
court finds that Defendant has submitted evidence showing that Plaintiff did
not fully comply with the court’s October 20, 2023 orders (1) to produce
discovery within 20 days of the date of the court’s orders,[1] (2) to produce complete answers to
interrogatories numbers 204.2, subdivision (c), 204.5, and 210.2, and (3) to
produce responsive documents within 20 days of the date of the court’s order
granting Defendant’s motion to compel further responses to its document
demands.  
In
opposition, Plaintiff submits the declaration of his counsel, who asserts that
“Plaintiff has also served all responsive documents in his possession.”  (Rand-Lewis Decl., ¶ 12.)  Plaintiff’s counsel has further stated that he
erroneously believed all responsive documents had been served due to a
miscommunication with others in the office. 
(Ibid.)  While Defendant
concedes that Plaintiff made an additional production of documents with his
opposition, Defendant contends that the production is still deficient because it
was “not uniformly identified with a Bates number” and therefore “there is no
way to determine whether a full production has been made.”  (Reply, pp. 4:25-26, 5:22-24.) 
First, the
court denies Defendant’s request that the court order Plaintiff to
comply with its October 20, 2023 orders.  However, in order to remedy the prejudice caused
to Defendant by Plaintiff’s failure to fully comply with the court’s orders,
the court will order Plaintiff (1) to serve further, full and complete answers
to interrogatories numbers 204.2, subdivision (c), 204.5, and 210.2, and (2) to
serve further written responses to demand numbers 13, 15-44, and 46-59 (i.e.,
the Requests for Production of Documents to which Plaintiff stated responsive
documents would be produced) that comply with Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.280’s requirement that “[a]ny documents or category of documents produced
in response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall be
identified with the specific request number to which the documents respond.”  (Ehsani-Nia Decl., Ex. 12, Supp. Responses to Requests, pp.
2:13-14, 2:19-5:23.)
Second, the
court finds, after considering the totality of the circumstances, including
that Plaintiff has partially complied with the court’s October 20, 2023 orders,
that terminating sanctions against Plaintiff are not appropriate.  (Los Defensores, Inc., supra,
223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390.)  The court
therefore exercises its discretion to deny Defendant’s motion for terminating
sanctions. 
Third, the
court denies Defendant’s request for evidence or issue sanctions against
Plaintiff because (1) Defendant did not comply with California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345 by failing to file a separate statement in support of its request
for issue and evidence sanctions, and (2) Defendant has not shown, in its
moving papers, how its proposed issue or evidence sanctions to prohibit
Plaintiff from offering into evidence any documents that support Plaintiff’s 12
causes of action and claims for general, special, emotional distress, and
punitive damages are tailored to the harm suffered by Plaintiff’s failure (i)
to serve full and complete answers to certain of the interrogatories and (ii)
to produce responsive documents within the time ordered by the court.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1345 [“The motions
that require a separate statement include a motion: [¶¶] For issue or
evidentiary sanctions”]; Mot., pp. 15:27-16:3 [proposed issue or evidence
sanction]; Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016)
246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604 [“The trial court should select a sanction that is
tailor[ed] . . . to the harm caused by the withheld discovery”] [internal
quotations and citations omitted].) 
Fourth, the
court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions because Defendant has
shown, as set forth above, that Plaintiff did not fully comply with the court’s
October 20, 2023 orders by failing to serve full and complete responses to the
discovery and to produce documents within the time ordered by the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd.
(i), 2030.300, subd. (e), 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
The court finds that $2,250 (5 hours x $450 hourly rate) is a reasonable
amount of sanctions to impose against Plaintiff in connection with this
motion.  (Ehsani-Nia Decl.,
¶¶ 17-18.)
Finally,
the court denies Defendant’s request that the court impose monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,500, to be paid to the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 177.5.)  
ORDER
            The court grants in part defendant
Airgas USA, LLC’s motion to compel compliance and for sanctions as follows. 
            The court orders plaintiff Joe
Ledesma (1) to serve on defendant Airgas USA, LLC further, full and complete

(c), 204.5, and 210.2, which comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.210-2030.250, within 20 days of the date of this order, and (2) to serve
on defendant Airgas USA, LLC further written responses to
defendant Airgas USA, LLC’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 13, 15-44, and
46-59, which comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.280, within 20
days of the date of this order. 
            The court denies defendant Airgas
USA, LLC’s motion for terminating, issue, and evidence sanctions.
            The court grants defendant Airgas
USA, LLC’s motion for monetary sanctions.

USA, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
