And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to compel compliance and for sanctions filed by Defendant Airgas USA, LLC. The Defendant seeks to compel Plaintiff Joe Ledesma to comply with court orders to serve further answers to interrogatories and produce responsive documents. The Defendant also seeks to impose sanctions for the Plaintiff's misuse of the discovery process.

The court finds that the Plaintiff has partially complied with the court's orders, but has failed to fully comply. The court orders the Plaintiff to serve further, full and complete answers to certain interrogatories and to produce responsive documents. The court also grants the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,250.

The court denies the Defendant's request for terminating, issue, and evidence sanctions, as well as the request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500 to be paid to the court. The court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's orders was not willful, and that the Defendant has not shown that the proposed issue or evidence sanctions are tailored to the harm suffered by the Plaintiff's failure to comply.
