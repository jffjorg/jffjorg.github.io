And here is a summary in English text:

The court has considered the defendants' motion for summary judgment and has denied it. The defendants, Paul William Blake Jr. and Armando Zenteno, had argued that the plaintiff, Martin B. Canter, could not prove causation and damages in his claims for fraud and legal malpractice. They also argued that the actual innocence rule bars the plaintiff's action and that the unclean hands defense applies. The court finds that the defendants have not met their burden to show that these defenses apply. The court also notes that the plaintiff's alleged misconduct in the underlying criminal action is not connected to the claims against the defendants and therefore the unclean hands defense does not apply. The court concludes that the defendants have not shown that the plaintiff cannot prove his claims and therefore denies the motion for summary judgment.
