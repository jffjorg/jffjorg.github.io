[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
motion to be relieved as counsel for
  defendant 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Andrew J. Knez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Andrew J. Knez (“Defendant’s Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel
for defendant James Jones (“Defendant”). 
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿¿ 
The court finds that
Defendant’s Counsel has not shown that he served Defendant with the papers
filed in connection with this motion. 
The court acknowledges that
Defendant’s Counsel has asserted, on the mandatory “Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel — Civil” form, that Defendant’s
Counsel served Defendant with copies of the motion papers by mail at
Defendant’s last known address, which Defendant’s Counsel confirmed within the
past 30 days is current.  (MC-052,
¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(1)(b).)  However,
Defendant’s Counsel has also filed two proofs of service of the moving papers
with the court, both of which are defective. 
The first proof of service,
submitted to establish service by mail, appears to list the correct address for
Defendant (22431 Antonio Parkway, Suite B160, #1004, Rancho Santa Margarita,
California 92688), but states that service was made on an individual named
“Leslie Bushnell,” not Defendant.  (Feb.
23, 2024 Proof of Service, p. 2:11-13, 2:17-19.)  The second proof of service, submitted to
establish service by email, again states that service was made on “Leslie
Bushnell,” not Defendant, and appears to list an email address associated with
Leslie Bushnell.  (Feb. 23, 2024 Proof of
Service, p. 2:11-15 [listing Leslie Bushnell as defendant and listing email
address of service to be “lbushnelljwjtrustee@gmail.com”].) 
Thus, the court finds that
the proofs of service filed by Defendant’s Counsel are defective and therefore
do not establish that Defendant’s Counsel served Defendant with the pending
motion to be relieved as his counsel. 
The court therefore
exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on Defendant’s Counsel’s
motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant in order to ensure that
Defendant is served with all the moving papers filed in connection with this
motion.
The court orders that the
hearing on Andrew J. Knez’s motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant
James Jones is continued to May 3, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders Andrew J.
Knez (1) to give notice of this ruling and the new hearing date on this motion
to defendant James Jones and to all other parties who have appeared in this
action, and (2) to file new proofs of service establishing that (i) defendant
James Jones was served with the moving papers filed in connection with this
motion to be relieved as counsel, and (ii) defendant James Jones and all other
parties who have appeared in this action were served with a copy of this order.

 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
