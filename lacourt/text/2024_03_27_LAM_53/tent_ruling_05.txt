The court notes that, in opposition, Plaintiff appears to assert that he
calculated his deadline to serve responses and to pay monetary sanctions based
on the date of service of the notice of rulings.  (Opp., p. 3:4-13.)  However, the court did not order Plaintiff to
serve responses and to produce responsive documents within 20 days of the date
of service of the order, and instead ordered Plaintiff to serve responses and
to produce responsive documents “within 20 days of the date of this
order.”  (Oct. 20, 2023 Order re Mot. to
Compel Further Responses to Interrogatories, p. 2:17-18; Oct. 20, 2023 Order re
Mot. to Compel Further Responses to Requests, p. 2:17-18.)
