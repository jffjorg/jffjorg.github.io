The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant James Jones. The motion is unopposed, but the attorney, Andrew J. Knez, has not shown that he served the defendant with the motion papers. The court finds that the proofs of service filed by the attorney are defective and therefore cannot confirm service. The court exercises its discretion to continue the hearing to ensure that the defendant is served with the motion papers. The hearing is continued to May 3, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. The attorney is ordered to give notice of this ruling and the new hearing date to the defendant and all other parties who have appeared in this action, and to file new proofs of service establishing that the defendant and all other parties were served with the motion papers.
