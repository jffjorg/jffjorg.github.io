[1] The
court notes that (1) the caption and the prayer of the First Amended Complaint
list and/or reference two causes of action for fraud and malpractice, but (2)
the body of the First Amended Complaint appears to allege only one cause of
action for fraud.  (FAC pp. 1 [caption
page], 5 [“FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION – FRAUD”], 13 [praying for damages for the
second cause of action].)  Defendants do
not appear to take issue with this pleading and have expressly moved for
summary judgment on the ground that both causes of action fail.
