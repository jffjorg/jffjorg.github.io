Significant Statements:
  - The motion for preliminary injunction is denied without prejudice.
  - The court previously sustained defendant Irina's demurrer to the Complaint because Plaintiffs' presentation of the "partnership" and FlightHelp was confusing and the merger clause in the partnership agreement appeared to supersede any previous agreements or understandings between Jordan and Irina.
  - The operative pleading is the First Amended Complaint, which includes additional causes of action.
