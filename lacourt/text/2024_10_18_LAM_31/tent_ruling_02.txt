MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
The Regents of the University of California
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Anthony
Espino
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
Anthony Espino (Espino or Plaintiff) began his employment at Ronald Reagan UCLA
Medical Center (UCLA Medical Center) as a registered nurse in September
2010.  In March of 2015, Espino fell at
work and sustained an injury to his shoulder. 
Espino reported the injury to his employer and was seen by The Regents’
in-network medical provider.  Espino was given
a doctor’s note placing him on light duty. 
Espino gave the note to his supervisor, Jasmine Briones (Briones), who
thereafter placed Espino on light duty.  However,
Briones, Christine Pizzuli (Pizzuli), Director of Nursing, and other co-workers
grew skeptical of Espino’s injury.  As
alleged, Briones, in particular, directly retaliated against Espino by refusing
to accept Espino’s doctor’s note and routinely ignoring Espino’s attempts to
communicate.  
 
            On August
20, 2015, Plaintiff was diagnosed with three labrum tears and was placed on
supplemental disability.  Plaintiff
underwent surgery on his injured shoulder in October 2015 and again in
September 2018.
 
In August 2019, Espino’s QME doctor declared that Espino had
reached his maximum medical improvement (MMI) and could no longer return to his
job because he was permanently injured.  However,
despite that medical conclusion, Espino sought another medical opinion and was
thereafter approved for a subsequent surgery in contradiction to the QME’s MMI
report.
 
On March 6, 2023, Nina Cail (Cail), a disability management
consultant for UCLA Medical Center requested an interactive process dialogue
meeting with Espino.  On March 13, 2023,
Espino replied to Cail that his request for further surgery was approved.  Espino believed he had prolonged any
interactive process with this communication.
 
In November 2020, UCLA Medical Center sent Espino a Notice
of Unauthorized Leave.  Espino did not
receive the letter until January 15, 2021.
 
On December 9, 2020, UCLA Medical Center sent Espino an
intent to terminate letter unless Espino responded by December 28, 2020.
 
On December 28, 2020, Espino emailed Briones and asked for
help because he believed UCLA Medical Center had bypassed the interactive
process.
 
On January 6, 2021, UCLA Medical Center terminated Espino
for unauthorized leave.  
 
On January 15, 2021, Espino received the notice of
Unauthorized Leave.
 
On January 3, 2024, Espino received a right to sue letter.  This action followed.
 
On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against
defendant The Regents of the University of California (erroneously sued as
Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, hereafter The Regents or Defendant).  On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the First
Amended Complaint (FAC) against The Regents for (1) disability discrimination
in violation of FEHA, (2) failure to engage in the interactive process in
violation of FEHA, (3) harassment in violation of FEHA, (4) retaliation in
violation of FEHA, (5) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and
retaliation in violation of FEHA, (6) failure to accommodate in violation of
FEHA, and (7) and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  
 
On August 8, 2024, The Regents filed this demurer to each
cause of action in the FAC.  
 
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.
 
On October 8, 2024, The Regents filed a reply. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
            A demurrer
for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)¿ When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged
facts as true.¿ (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)¿ “Because a demurrer challenges defects on the face of
the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside the pleading that are
subject to judicial notice.”¿ (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.)¿ 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
The Regents demur
to each cause of action.  The court addresses
each in turn.
 
A. Disability Discrimination in Violation of FEHA (1st
Cause of Action)
 
            The first cause of action for
disability discrimination is based on the following allegations: Defendant knew
that Plaintiff severely injured his shoulder and was able to perform his
essential light duty job duties for which he was assigned without reasonable
accommodation.  Defendant discriminated
against and took adverse employment actions against Plaintiff due to his
injury, including but not limited to ridiculing and dehumanizing Plaintiff and
wrongfully terminating him.  For
instance, a coworker publicly inquired with an orthopedic nurse on the
legitimacy of Plaintiff’s injury.  On another
occasion, Briones asked Plaintiff to scape labels off the shelves then grew
impatient from Plaintiff’s inability to assert enough pressure to scrape off
the labels.  Briones suddenly scraped the
labels off herself, slapped the scraper on the table when she finished, and
left the room without wanting to hear Plaintiff’s explanation that he was still
experiencing shoulder pain.  Plaintiff is
informed and believes that his shoulder injury was a substantial motivating
reason for the Defendant's decision to discharge Plaintiff, as Defendant didn't
believe Plaintiff was telling the truth.            (FAC,
¶¶ 23-25, 49-52.)
 
            Government Code section 12940,
subdivision (a) prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee
on the basis of a medical condition or physical disability.  FEHA discrimination claims are subject to the McDonnell
Douglas Corp. v. Green (1973) 411 U.S. 792 burden-shifting framework.  (Guz v. Bechtel National Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 317, 354-356.)  Under this framework,
“the plaintiff initially has the burden to establish a prima facie case of
discrimination.”  (Sandell v.
Taylor-Listug, Inc. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 310.)  
 
To establish a
prima facie case of disability discrimination, the plaintiff must establish
that he suffered from a disability, that he could perform the essential duties
of the job, and that he was subjected to an adverse employment action because
of the perceived disability. ¿(Id.)  “The employee must also show
the employer knew of his or her disability at the time it made the adverse
employment decision. [Citation.].”  (Prue v. Brady Co./San Diego, Inc.
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1378.)¿ “The plaintiff, of course, must plead a
prima facie case in order to survive demurrer.” 
(Caldwell v. Paramount Unified Sch. Dist. (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th
189, 203.) 
 
            Defendant
argues the second element of Plaintiff’s prima facie case is not and cannot be
satisfied: that Plaintiff could perform the essential duties of the job with or
without reasonable accommodation at the time he was terminated.  In support, Defendant points out that because
 Plaintiff performed light duty work prior
to his doctor placing him on disability in August 2015, “it stands to reason
that Plaintiff could not continue performing these light duty assignments after
August 2015.”  (Dem., p. 14:14-15, citing
FAC, ¶ 26.)  
 
The point has
merit.  Plaintiff was placed on
disability leave in August 2015 where he remained until his termination in
2021.  In other words, the allegations
are susceptible to the reasonable inference that he could not perform the
essential duties of his job with reasonable accommodations because he could not
perform even light duty work.  
Further, although well-pleaded
allegations are accepted as true and liberally construed in favor of the
plaintiff at the demurrer stage, Plaintiff does not allege the requisite facts to
overcome the demurrer, even as liberally construed.  Plaintiff contends he could perform the
essential duties of his job with reasonable accommodations.  Plaintiff bases this contention on two
points: (1) he successfully performed light duty work as a reasonable
accommodation until he was placed on disability leave, and (2) Plaintiff
demonstrated his intent and ability to return to work with the proper
accommodations through additional surgeries and medical treatment.  
However, the first
point runs headlong into the problem described above: Plaintiff was not performing
any duties at the time he was terminated. 
The second point fares no better. 
Seeking surgery or other medical treatment may be considered a
reasonable accommodation (see, e.g., Soria v. Univision Radio Los Angeles,
Inc. (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 570, 599 (Soria); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2,
§ 11065, subd. (p)(2)(M)) but Plaintiff’s allegations on his ability to perform
the essential duties of his job are unclear. 
Plaintiff alleges that he “was able to perform his essential light duty
job duties for which he was assigned without reasonable accommodation for his
severe shoulder injury” (FAC, ¶ 50), and “was willing and able to perform the
essential job duties with reasonable accommodation for his disability” (FAC, ¶
99).  At best, these allegations are inconsistent.
 But, taken together with Plaintiff’s
alleged disability leave from 2015 to 2021, these allegations point to one
conclusion: Plaintiff, although willing to perform the essential duties of his
position, could not and indeed was not performing any duties at the time of his
termination.  Critically, the allegations
do not make clear that Plaintiff would have been able to perform the essential
duties of his job after undergoing a third surgery.  Indeed, Plaintiff does not allege telling Defendant
that he would be able to perform the essential duties of his job after the
surgery, nor does he allege having undergone a third surgery at all.[1]    
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is GRANTED.     
            
B.     Failure
to Engage in Good Faith Interactive Process (2nd
Cause of Action)[2]

            The second cause action is based on the
following allegation: despite knowing that Plaintiff needed a third surgery to
repair a severe shoulder injury, Defendant failed to engage in an interactive
process with Plaintiff.  (FAC, ¶¶ 60, 61,
63.)  
 
            FEHA requires employers to engage in
a good faith interactive process to determine effective reasonable
accommodations, if any, “in response to a request for reasonable accommodation
by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability . . . .”¿ (Gov.
Code, § 12940, subd. (n); Raine v. City of Burbank (2006) 135
Cal.App.4th 1215, 1222.)¿ To establish a claim for failure to engage in the
interactive process, a plaintiff must show: (1) defendant was an employer; (2)
plaintiff was defendant’s employee; (3) plaintiff was disabled; (4) plaintiff
requested reasonable accommodation; (5) plaintiff was willing to participate in
a timely good faith interactive process with plaintiff to determine whether a
reasonable accommodation could be made; (6) defendant failed to participate in
this process; (7) plaintiff was harmed; and (8) defendant’s failure to engage
in a good-faith interactive process was a substantial factor in causing
plaintiff’s harm.¿ (CACI No. 2546.)¿¿¿ 
 
            Defendant appears to challenge the
fourth element of a failure to engage in interactive process claim.  The Regents argue this cause of action fails
because Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to establish there existed a
job with Defendant that Plaintiff could perform with severe injuries. 
 
Defendant
identifies the wrong accommodation.  Nowhere
in the FAC does Plaintiff allege that he requested reassignment.[3]  Having not requested reassignment as a
reasonable accommodation, the second cause of action cannot fail for
Plaintiff’s failure to allege the existence of another job.  
 
Rather, the implied
accommodation is the approval for a third surgery.  Plaintiff informed Defendant that he was
approved for another surgery.  The
question, then, is whether Plaintiff sufficiently alleges requesting leave to
have the third surgery.  A term of leave
from work can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA.  (Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 215, 226.)  Although
Plaintiff notified Cail, Defendant’s disability management consultant, that he
was approved for a third surgery, Plaintiff does not allege if or when he
planned to have the surgery.  (See, e.g., Moore
v. Regents of University of California (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 216,
228 [holding that employee sufficiently requested accommodation of leave
for surgery when she stated she “would likely” need surgery at some point in
the next few months]; see also Soria, supra, 5 Cal.App.5th at p. 599
[finding, in reversing summary adjudication of a failure to accommodate claim, there
was sufficient evidence “to permit a finder of fact to conclude Soria
sufficiently communicated to Nava she intended to have surgery [in December
2011] and was requesting time off as an accommodation.”].)  Defendant’s challenge to the fourth element of
the cause of action finds a solid foothold. 
There are insufficient facts to construe “approval for surgery” without
any reference to when the surgery might occur as a “request for leave to have
surgery”.   
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the second cause of action is SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is GRANTED.      
 
B.    
Harassment in Violation of FEHA (3rd
Cause of Action) 
 
The third cause of
action is based on the allegations that Defendant’s supervisory employees
harassed Plaintiff based on a disbelief in the veracity of Plaintiff’s
injury.  (FAC, ¶ 72.)  
 
Defendant argues
this cause of action is time-barred.  Plaintiff
does not clearly allege when the complained-of conduct occurred.  Defendant argues it must have occurred
between March 2015 (when Plaintiff suffered the alleged injury) and August 2015
(when Plaintiff was placed on disability leave).  Plaintiff does not challenge’s Defendant’s timeline.
 
 
Having occurred in
2015, the applicable version of the FEHA statute requires filing of an
administrative complaint within one year of the unlawful conduct.  (See Pollock v. Tri-Modal Distribution
Services, Inc. (2021) 11 Cal.5th 918, 929-930 (applying former FEHA statute
to conduct occurring in 2017 and finding the failure to promote claim was time
barred for plaintiff’s failure to file a complaint within one year of the
conduct).)  
 
Here, Plaintiff
alleges he received his right to sue letter on January 3, 2024.  Plaintiff’s harassment claim is clearly time
barred.  
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff argues the continuing violation doctrine applies because Defendant’s
failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to reasonably
accommodate Plaintiff occurred in 2020. 
The argument lacks merit.  A
failure to engage in the interactive process or to reasonably accommodate in
good faith are distinct causes of action with different elements of proof.  (See Miller v. California Dep't of Corr.
& Rehab. (2024) ---Cal.Rptr.3d ---,  No. E081230, 2024 WL 4262759, at *7 [“an
employer's failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to provide
a reasonable accommodation represent independent causes of action subject to
different elements of proof. (Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank (2000) 85
Cal.App.4th 245, 255-256, 102 Cal.Rptr.2d 55 (Jensen) [a claim for
discrimination and a claim for failure to accommodate have different elements
of proof, although there is some overlap]; Bagatti v. Department of
Rehabilitation (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 344, 360-361, 118 Cal.Rptr.2d 443
[Section 12940, subd. (m) “defines a separate and distinct unfair employment
practice independent of [section 12940, subd. (a)]”]; Gelfo v. Lockheed
Martin Corp. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 34, 54, 43 Cal.Rptr.3d 874 (Gelfo)
[the employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual and
failure to engage in a good faith interactive process represent independent
violations of the FEHA].) And an employer may be liable for the failure to
engage in the interactive process or failure to provide a reasonable
accommodation, without being liable for discrimination. (See Wysinger v.
Automobile Club of Southern California (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 413, 419,
424-425, 69 Cal.Rptr.3d 1 [jury verdict in favor of employer on discrimination
and failure to accommodate claim is not inconsistent with verdict in favor of
employee on interactive process claim]; King v. United Parcel Service, Inc.
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 426, 442, 60 Cal.Rptr.3d 359 [“An employer's failure to
provide reasonable accommodation is a violation of the statute even in the
absence of an adverse employment action”].) 

 
Significantly,
Plaintiff does not allege any conduct between 2015 and 2020 that may be
construed as harassment.  In essence,
Plaintiff attempts to link conduct separated by several years.  Plaintiff does not present any argument or
authority to show such a gap in time may still constitute an ongoing pattern of
conduct such that the continuing violation doctrine applies.   
 
Accordingly, the demurrer
to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED. 
Leave to amend is DENIED.
 
C.    
Retaliation in Violation of FEHA (4th
Cause of Action)
 
The fourth cause
of action is based on the following allegations: Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff
for requesting accommodations and pursuing medical treatments by skipping the
interactive process and wrongfully terminating him.  (FAC, ¶¶ 79-81.) 
 
FEHA retaliation
claims are subject to the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting
analysis.  (Yanowitz L’Oreal USA Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028,
1042.)¿¿As with the first cause of action, the court begins by considering
whether Plaintiff states a prima facie case for retaliation. 
 
To establish a
prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that: (1) plaintiff
engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer subjected the plaintiff to an
adverse employment action; and (3) the protected activity and the employer’s
action were causally connected. (Yanowitz, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p.
1042.)¿¿¿ 
 
            Defendant attacks the third
element.  Defendant argues that, because
Plaintiff’s request for accommodations occurred in 2015 (a protected activity),
there is no causal link to the adverse actions in 2020 (failure to engage the
interactive process) or 2021 (termination). 

 
            Plaintiff does not allege facts to
demonstrate a causal connection between the protected activity which occurred
in 2015 and the adverse actions which occurred in 2021.  And, to the extent Plaintiff relies on leave
to have another surgery, the court has found Plaintiff has not adequately
alleged having made a request for that accommodation.  
 
            Accordingly, the demurrer to the
fourth cause of action is SUSTAINED. 
Leave to amend is GRANTED.
 
D.   
Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation
in Violation of FEHA (5th
Cause of Action)
 
This cause of
action is based in part on Plaintiff’s retaliation claim.
 
A cause of action
for failure to prevent discrimination or retaliation requires the following
elements: (1) plaintiff was an employee of defendant; (2) plaintiff was
subjected to discrimination/retaliation in the course of employment; (3)
defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the
discrimination/retaliation; (4) plaintiff was harmed; and (5) defendant’s
failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination/retaliation was
a substantial factor in causing plaintiff’s harm.¿ (CACI No. 2527; Jumaane
v. City of Los Angeles (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1410.)¿ “The employer’s
duty to prevent discrimination and retaliation is affirmative and mandatory.”¿
(Northrop Grumman Corp. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 1021, 1035.)¿     
 
Because the court has
found that Plaintiff does not state a claim for disability discrimination or
retaliation in violation of the FEHA, the demurrer to the fifth cause of action
is SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is GRANTED.

 
E.    
Failure to Accommodate in Violation of FEHA (6th
Cause of Action)
 
The sixth cause
action is based on the following allegation: despite knowing that Plaintiff
needed a third surgery to repair a severe shoulder injury, Defendant failed to provide
a reasonable accommodation.  (FAC, ¶¶ 98,
100.)  
 
“There are three
elements to a failure to accommodate claim: (1) the plaintiff has a disability
covered by the FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual (i.e., he or
she can perform the essential functions of the position); and (3) the employer
failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff’s disability.”¿ (CACI No. 2541; Hernandez
v. Rancho Santiago Cmty. College Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1187,
1193-1194.)  One of the principles of underlying a cause of action for
failure to provide a reasonable accommodation is that the employee must request
an accommodation. (Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc. (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 935, 954.)
 
As stated
elsewhere, Plaintiff does not sufficiently allege he could perform the
essential functions of his position. 
(See, supra, Section III (A).) 
The second element of this claim is not satisfied.  
 
The third element
is also insufficiently pleaded.  As
alleged, Defendant provided two reasonable accommodations: (1) assigning
Plaintiff light duty work in March 2015 and (2) granting Plaintiff an extended leave
for disability beginning in August 2015. 
To the extent Plaintiff relies on the third surgery, the court has found
the allegations do not indicate Plaintiff requested leave to have another
surgery.  Therefore, Defendant cannot be
held liable for failing to accommodate a request which was not made.   
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the sixth cause of action is SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is GRANTED.    
 
F.     
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (7th
Cause of Action)
 
The seventh cause
of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) is based on Defendant’s
alleged failure to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff, bypassing the interactive
process, and for wrongfully terminating his employment.  (FAC, ¶¶ 106-107.)  
 
Defendant argues
the IIED claim is time barred.  A cause
of action for IIED must be brought within 2 years.  (Code Civ Proc., §
335.1; Pugliese v. Superior Court (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1444, 1450.)  “A cause of action for intentional infliction
of emotional distress accrues, and the statute of limitations begins to run,
once the plaintiff suffers severe emotional distress as a result of outrageous
conduct on the part of the defendant.”  (Cantu
v. Resol. Tr. Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 889.)
 
Here, the last
alleged conduct (Plaintiff’s termination) occurred on January 6, 2021.  (FAC, ¶ 42.) 
Plaintiff filed this action more than three years later.  The IIED claim is time-barred.  Plaintiff does not address this argument in
his opposition and therefore concedes the point.
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the seventh cause of action is SUSTAINED.  Because amendment would be futile, leave to
amend is DENIED.   
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
The demurrer is Sustained.
 
With the exception of the seventh cause of action, leave to
amend is Granted.   Plaintiff is directed to file and serve the Second
Amended Complaint within 30 days of this order.
 
Defendant to give notice.
