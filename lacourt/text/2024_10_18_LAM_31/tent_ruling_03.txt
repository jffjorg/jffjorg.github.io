[1] Plaintiff argues the continuing
violation doctrine applies to this claim. 
However, Defendant does not challenge the first cause of action on
statute of limitation grounds.  The court
therefore does not address Plaintiff’s argument.


[2] Defendant grouped its challenge to
the second cause of action with the sixth cause of action for failure to
accommodate.  For clarity, the court
addresses these causes of action separately. 


[3] Conversely, Plaintiff cannot point
to Defendant’s failure to offer Plaintiff another position in support of this
claim where he did not request reassignment.
