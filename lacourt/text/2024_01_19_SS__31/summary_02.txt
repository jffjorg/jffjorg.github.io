And here is the summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim in a lawsuit filed by Silvia Reyes against the County of Los Angeles. The case is about an alleged improper disposal of hypodermic needles, which resulted in a needle stick injury to Plaintiff. The Defendant, County of Los Angeles, is seeking to add Dr. Kaochoy Saechao, a non-retained expert witness, to its list of expert witnesses. The Defendant argues that Dr. Saechao's testimony is necessary to authenticate Concentra's records and to assist in determining whether Plaintiff contracted bloodborne diseases or other injuries due to the needle stick incident. Plaintiff does not oppose the motion. The court grants the motion to augment the Defendant's expert witness list to add Dr. Saechao as a non-retained expert.
