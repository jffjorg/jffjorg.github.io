Summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default judgment entered against RSSN, Inc. dba Sage Restaurant and Lounge. The plaintiff, Jocelyn Sherry, had filed a lawsuit against the defendant for damages arising from a slip and fall incident. The defendant, however, claims it did not receive notice of the lawsuit and that the agent for service of process, Aaron T. Hatch, was incorrectly assigned. The defendant filed an answer to the complaint in September 2023, but the default judgment was entered in September 2023. The defendant moved to set aside the default judgment, arguing that it had a reasonable excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. The judge has granted the motion, setting aside the default judgment and ordering the defendant to re-file its answer within 10 days.
