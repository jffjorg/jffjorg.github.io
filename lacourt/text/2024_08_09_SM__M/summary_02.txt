And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the defendant's motion for attorneys' fees incurred on appeal in the amount of $74,502.75. The defendant is the prevailing party on the second appeal and seeks fees associated with the second appeal. The lease agreement provides for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, collectively not to exceed $100,000. The court finds that an appeal is not a separate "action or proceeding" arising out of the agreement, and therefore the fee cap of $100,000 applies to the entire lawsuit, including the appeal. The court awards the defendant $30,070.00 in fees, which is the reduced amount of the lodestar figure adjusted based on the factors specific to the case.
