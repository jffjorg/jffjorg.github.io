Legal
Standard
 
A party may seek discretionary relief under section
473(b) due to “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §
473(b).) A motion for discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable
time but in no instance exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal,
order, or proceeding was taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the
court may in its discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including
attorney fees, incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers
Cadillac (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is
granted, the court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions
up to $1,000 to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client
Security Fund, or “[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP §
473(c)(1)(A), (B), (C).)
 
A motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted. . .” (CCP § 473(b).)
However, this requirement is
not jurisdictional; substantial compliance may suffice. (Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving
papers].) 
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiff Patrick R. Naylon moves 1)
to vacate the dismissal of this action entered on January 4, 2024; 2) to
restore this action to the Court’s active calendar; 3) to require Defendant to
file its answer to the Complaint; 4) vacate sanctions order against Plaintiff;
and 5) sanction Defendant and counsel of record for failure to serve the
January 4, 2024, Minute Order.  Even
though Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement, the Court will still address the
issues raised in the motion.
 
As set forth below, the Court vacates
the dismissal and sanctions order and places this action back on calendar due
to mistake,
inadvertence and surprise. Plaintiff explains that through August 2024
and February 2024, he was experiencing serious health problems which resulted
in three surgeries, which interrupted his ability to prosecute this action. (Naylon
Decl., ¶ 5.) He also explains that his business address is 3835 E. Thousand
Oaks Blvd., Suite 277, Thousand Oaks CA 91362. (¶ 2.) The Clerk inadvertently
omitted the suite number on the notice of the January 4, 2024, order to show
cause. (¶ 3.) Plaintiff states that he never received a copy of the October 18,
2023, Minute Order or notice of the January 4, 2024, OSC. (¶ 4.) Plaintiff
explains that he first learned that this action was dismissed in a February
2024 meeting with the defendant HOA. (Id.) Plaintiff also shows cause to vacate
the $500.00 sanctions order, as his failure to appear was the result of a lack
of notice. 
 
Accordingly, the motion to vacate
is GRANTED in part.
 
Plaintiff does not show any grounds
to require Defendant to file its answer, to vacate sanctions order against
Plaintiff; or sanction Defendant/counsel for failure to serve the January 4,
2024, order. Plaintiff has not submitted proof of service of summons on
Defendant. On the face of the record, Defendant has not made a general appearance.
The Court therefore has no jurisdiction to order Defendant to answer or
sanction Defendant.   Furthermore, the parties
have settled this matter.
 
The Court sets an OSC re Dismissal/Settlement for September 24,
2024, at 8:30 a.m.
