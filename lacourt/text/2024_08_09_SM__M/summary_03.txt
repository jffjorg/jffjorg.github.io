And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Naylon v. Wilshire Borgata Owners Assoc. (Case No. 23SMCV01723). The Plaintiff, Patrick R. Naylon, has moved to vacate the dismissal of the action, which was entered on January 4, 2024, and to restore the action to the calendar. The Judge has granted the motion in part, finding that the dismissal was the result of mistake, inadvertence, and surprise. The Plaintiff had been experiencing serious health problems and had undergone three surgeries, which interrupted his ability to prosecute the action. The Clerk had also inadvertently omitted the suite number on the notice of the January 4, 2024 order. The Judge has vacated the dismissal and sanctions order and placed the action back on the calendar. However, the Judge has not granted the Plaintiff's request to require the defendant to file an answer or to vacate the sanctions order against the Plaintiff, as the Plaintiff has not submitted proof of service of summons on the defendant and the defendant has not made a general appearance. Additionally, the parties have settled the matter, and the Court has set an OSC re Dismissal/Settlement for September 24, 2024.
