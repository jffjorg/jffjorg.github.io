RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            This is a discrimination and constructive discharge action.  Plaintiff, Allen Chen, was hired as an
internal audit manager by KPMG, LLC (“KPMG”).  During his employment, Plaintiff notified his
Performance Management Leader, Alia Pallera, that he would be taking paternity
leave on March 3, 2023 in anticipation of the birth of his child. On February
15, 2023, Plaintiff was terminated from his employment with KPMG.
 
            On August
8, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants, KPMG, Alia Pallera,
Richard Ho, and Joseph Roppo, alleging causes of action for: 
 
(1)  
Pregnancy Paternal Discrimination
(Cal. Govt. Code § 12945); 
(2)  
Failure to Prevent Discrimination
and Harassment (Cal. Govt. Code §§ 12940(j) and (k)); 
(3)  
Constructive Discharge in Violation
of Cal. Govt. Code § 12940 et seq. (Cal. Govt. Code § 12940 et seq.);
(4)  
Constructive Discharge in Violation
of Public Policy: Government Code Section 12940 et seq. (California
Common Law); 
(5)  
Constructive Discharge in Violation
of Public Policy: California Constitution (California Constitution); 
(6)
Negligent Supervision, Hiring and Retention (California Common Law); and 
(7)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (California Common Law).
 
            On January
25, 2024, Defendants filed this demurrer to the First, Sixth, and Seventh
causes of action in Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
 
            The demurrer
is unopposed.[1] 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER  
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 764, 769.)   
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Meet and Confer 
 
“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)¿ Here, defense counsel has complied with the meet and
confer requirement.  (See Declaration of Noel H. Hernandez, ¶¶ 3-7.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendants advance
the following arguments: (1) The First Cause of Action fails against the
individual defendants because supervisors cannot be held individually liable
for discrimination; (2) The Sixth and Seventh Causes of Action are barred by
workers’ compensation, and (3) The Sixth and Seventh Causes of Action fail to allege
sufficient facts to state causes of action. 
The court addresses each cause of action in turn.
 
1.     
First Cause of Action for Pregnancy Paternal
Discrimination (Cal. Govt. Code § 12945)
 
Government Code
section 12945 is the Pregnancy Disability Leave Law.  It “is part of the FEHA and requires
employers to provide employees up to four months of leave for disability
due to an employee's pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions.  (Chin & Wiseman, et al., Cal. Prac. Guide
Employment Litigation (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 12:1420.)  
 
Defendants argue
the individual defendants Alia Pallera, Richard Ho, and Joseph Roppo cannot be
held individually liable for discrimination under the FEHA.  The court agrees.  “[I]ndividuals who do not themselves qualify
as employers may not be sued under the FEHA for alleged discriminatory acts.”  (Reno v. Baird (1998) 18 Cal. 4th 640,
663.)  As alleged, KPMG, and not Pallera,
Ho, and Roppo was Plaintiff’s employer. (See Complaint, ¶¶ 4-7.)  Therefore, individual defendants Pallera, Ho,
and Roppo cannot be held liable for the allegedly discriminatory conduct.  Plaintiff, having not filed an opposition
does not offer any argument to the contrary. 
 
2.     
Sixth Cause
of Action for Negligent Supervision, Hiring and Retention (California Common
Law)
 
The elements of a claim for Negligent Hiring, Supervision,
or Retention of an employee are: (1) that the defendant hired the employee; (2)
that the employee was/became unfit to perform the work for which they were
hired; (3) that the employer knew or should have known that the employee
was/became unfit and that they created a particular risk to others; (4) that
the employee’s unfitness harmed the plaintiff; and (5) that the employer’s
negligence in hiring or retaining the employee was a substantial factor in
causing plaintiff’s harm.  (CACI No. 426.) “Negligence liability will be
imposed on an employer if it ‘knew or should have known that hiring the
employee created a particular risk or hazard and that particular harm
materializes.’ ”¿ (Phillips v. TLC Plumbing, Inc. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th
1133, 1139.)
 
Defendants argue Plaintiff’s negligent hiring claim is
barred by the workers’ compensation exclusivity rule.  Not so. 
“The touchstone of the workers' compensation system is industrial injury
which results in occupational disability or death. (Shoemaker v.
Myers, supra, 52 Cal.3d 1, 16, 276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054; Union
Iron Wks. v. Industrial Acc. Com. (1922) 190 Cal. 33, 39, 210 P. 410.)
Labor Code section 3208 defines “injury” as “any injury or disease
arising out of the employment....” (Italics added.)”  (Livitsanos v. Superior Ct. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 744, 752.)  Contrary to
Defendants’ position, Plaintiff does not allege injuries arising out of the
employment.  Rather, the gravamen of the
allegations is injury resulting from his termination of employment.  (See Complaint, ¶¶ 14-20.)  Workers’ compensation exclusivity does not
apply to Plaintiff’s claims.
 
Defendants next argue the Sixth Cause of Action fails to
allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action.  On this point, the court agrees.  The allegations supporting the negligent
hiring claim are boilerplate, bereft of factual allegations, and fail to
differentiate between KPMG (the employer) and Pallera, Ho, and Roppo
(Plaintiff’s supervisors).  (See
Complaint, ¶¶ 52-58.)  The Sixth Cause of
Action is uncertain and subject to demurrer on this ground.
 
3.     
Seventh
Cause of Action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (California
Common Law)
 
The elements of an
intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”) claim are: (1) that
defendant’s conduct was outrageous; (2) that defendant intended to cause
plaintiff emotional distress, or that defendant acted with reckless disregard
of the probability that plaintiff would suffer emotional distress, knowing that
plaintiff was present when the conduct occurred; (3) that plaintiff suffered
severe emotional distress, and (4) that defendant’s conduct was a substantial
factor in causing plaintiff’s severe emotional distress.¿ (CACI No. 1600; Hughes
v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050-51.)¿ “It is not enough that the
conduct be intentional and outrageous.¿ It must be conduct directed at the
plaintiff, or occur in the presence of a plaintiff of whom the defendant is
aware.”¿ (Christensen v. Superior Court (1991) 54 Cal.3d 868,
903-904.)¿ 
 
Defendants also
assert the workers’ compensation exclusivity rule against Plaintiff’s IIED
claim.  The challenge fails for the
reasons detailed above: Plaintiff’s alleged injuries did not arise from the
course of his employment but rather the termination of his employment.  
 
Defendants next
argue the IIED claim fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of
action.  The court agrees.  “A simple pleading of personnel management
activity is insufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of
emotional distress even if improper motivation is alleged.  If personnel management decisions are
improperly motivated, the remedy is a suit against the employer for
discrimination.”  (Janken v. GM Hughes
Electronics (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 80.) 

 
Here, the
Complaint alleges that “the Defendants made various false statements about
Plaintiffs [sic] work and productivity all without proof and which contradict
various employee reviews of the Plaintiff.” 
(Complaint, ¶ 15.)  “It is clear
that the Defendants actions were to deny the Plaintiff lawful leave in order to
save funds lawfully owed to the Plaintiff.” 
(Complaint, ¶ 16.)  Under these
allegations, Defendants made a personnel management decision to terminate
Plaintiff’s employment.  Ostensibly, the
decision was based on Plaintiff’s flagging work and productivity, but as
alleged, was a cover for the improper motivation to deny Plaintiff paternal
pregnancy leave.  As Janken
instructs, such allegations are insufficient to state a claim for IIED.  Plaintiff’s remedy, as he has done, is to
pursue claims of discrimination.  The
Seventh Cause of Action is deficient.
 
 IV.
      CONCLUSION
            
Based on the foregoing, the unopposed demurrer is SUSTAINED
as follows:
 
As to the individual defendants Pallera, Ho, and Roppo, the
demurrer to the First Cause of Action is sustained without leave to amend.
 
As to all defendants, the demurrer to the Sixth and Seventh
Causes of Action is sustained with leave to amend.
 
Plaintiff is to serve and file the First Amended Complaint within
30 days of this order.
 
Defendants to give notice.
