 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Hun Sung Park’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to
  Respond to Special Interrogatories, Set Four and Impose Monetary Sanctions
  [Res ID # 0963];
Defendant Hun Sung Park’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to
  Respond to Request to Produce Documents, Set Four and Impose Monetary
  Sanctions [Res ID # 0963];
Defendant Hun Sung Park’s Motion to Deem Admitted
  Genuineness of Documents and Impose Monetary Sanctions [Res ID # 1575].
 



 
I. Background
On May 8, 2024, Defendant Hun Sung
Park (Park) served a fourth set of special interrogatories, production requests
and request for admission (SROGs, Set Four; RPDs, Set Four; RFAs, Set Four) on
Plaintiff Korean American Presbyterian Church (Church.) 
Based on Church’s nonresponse to
this discovery, on July 3, 2024, Park filed motions to (1) compel responses to SROGs
Set Four, (2) compel responses to RPDs, Set Four, and (3) deem the genuineness
of any documents specified in RFAs, Set Four, be deemed admitted. All three
motions request monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Church and its counsel.
The motions attach proofs of service showing service of the three motions on Church
by electronic mail. 
Church has not filed any
oppositions to the motions. 
On August 27, 2024, Park filed
three notices of non-opposition to the motions. 
Park’s motions are now before the
Court.
 
II. Motions
to Compel Discovery Responses to Interrogatories and Production, and Motion to
Deem Admitted 
A. Legal Standard
A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 404 (Sinaiko).) The discovering party can also make a motion to
deem as admitted any unanswered requests for admission or any requests answered
in a late or unverified response. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses must be signed by
responding party under oath]; see Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no response].) To
establish this ground, a movant must show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.080, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce], 2033.070
[admission requests]);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260,
subds. (a), (b) [demand to produce], 2033.250, subds. (a), (b) [admission
requests]); and
(3) No timely response (see Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 [interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce],
2033.280, subd. (b) [admission requests]).
A court must deny a motion to
compel initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of
discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12,
19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of discovery].) 
B. Analysis 
Here, Park provides proof of
service of SROGs Set Four, RPDs Set Four and RFAs Set Four on Church. (All
Motions, Lorimier Decl., Exs. A [discovery and proof of service].)
Park provides evidence that the
deadline for initial responses has passed and that Church has not responded. The
discovery was served on May 8, 2024, thus the deadline for initial responses
was June 10, 2024. (All Motions, Lorimier Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  
Last, a brief review shows that the
discovery contains requests within the scope of discovery for this action
because the interrogatories, production requests, and admission requests at
issue involve matters germane to the claims before the Court.
Park’s motions are thus GRANTED as
to (1) compelling responses to SROGs Set Four, (2) compelling responses to
RPDs, Set Four, and (3) deeming the genuineness of the documents specified in
RFAs, Set Four, as admitted.
C. Requests for Sanctions
1. Legal
Standard
The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes the motion. As relates to interrogatories and production requests,
the Court can deny sanctions if it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanctions unjust, a standard not applicable to admission requests. (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c)
[demand to produce], 2033.280, subd. (c); see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p.
404 [interrogatories and demand to produce]; Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [RFA sanctions are mandatory; no discretion].)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
2. Analysis
The failure to respond to
authorized methods of discovery is a sanctionable discovery abuse. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Here, such an abuse has occurred
through Church’s non-response to SROGs, Set Four, RPDs, Set Four, and RFAs, Set
Four.
These abuses justify an award of
sanctions equal to the amounts requested by Park, which seek reasonable
compensation for the time spent on these motions by counsel against both Church
and its counsel. (Mot., pp. 2, 4; Decl of de Lorimier at ¶ 4.)
Sanctions are thus GRANTED against
Plaintiff Church and its counsel in the amount of (1) $400 in relation to SROGs,
Set Four, (2) $400 in relation to RPDs, Set Four, and (3) $400 in relation to
RFAs, Set Four. 
 
III. Conclusion
Defendant Hun Sung Park’s Motion to
Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Special Interrogatories, Set Four and Impose
Monetary Sanctions [Res ID # 0963] is GRANTED.
 
Defendant Hun Sung Park’s Motion to
Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Request to Produce Documents, Set Four and
Impose Monetary Sanctions [Res ID # 0963] is GRANTED.
 
Defendant Hun Sung Park’s Motion to
Deem Admitted Genuineness of Documents and Impose Monetary Sanctions [Res ID #
1575] is GRANTED. 
 
Responses without objections are
ordered as to the Special Interrogatories and Request for Production of
Documents within 30 days. The Requests for Admissions are deemed admitted. Sanctions
in the total amount of $1200 against Plaintiff Church and its counsel, jointly
and severally, is payable to Defendant’s counsel within  30 days.
