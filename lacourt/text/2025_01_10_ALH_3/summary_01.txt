And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to reopen discovery filed by the defendant, Qinpei Li, and has tentatively ruled that it will not reopen discovery as requested. The defendant had accused the plaintiff, William Henry Meurer, of producing illegal evidence and engaging in harassing conduct, but the court found that the defendant had not made a good faith effort to conduct discovery and had not provided sufficient evidence to support the reopening of discovery. The court has instead continued the hearing to January 28, 2025, to consider the defendant's motion to file a cross-complaint, which will likely require the reopening of discovery. The court has also advised the parties that they should be prepared to address whether this matter belongs in family court and if any such court continues to have jurisdiction over the parties.
