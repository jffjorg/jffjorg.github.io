ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Xiaofu Zhang (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, filed the
instant action for dental malpractice against Defendants Ravinder Steven Singh,
DDS (“Defendant Singh”) and Singh Dental Corporation dba Long Beach Total
Dental Care (erroneously sued as Long Beach Total Dental Care) (“Defendant
Singh Dental”) (collectively, Defendants”) on April 5, 2021. Defendants filed
an Answer to the Complaint on October 12, 2021. The Court dismissed the action
on December 20, 2022 and a judgment of dismissal was entered on December 27,
2022. (Judgment, 12/27/22.) 
 
Plaintiff filed a Motion to Vacate Dismissal on March 28,
2023. Following numerous continuances, the Motion to Vacate Dismissal was
denied on January 29, 2024. (Minute Order, 01/29/24.)
 
On April 10, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion to
Deem Plaintiff a Vexatious Litigant and ordered Plaintiff to post security in
the amount of $5,000.00. (Minute Order, 04/10/24.) The Court also ruled that
“Plaintiff is prohibited from filing any new litigation in the courts of the
State of California in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the
presiding judge or justice of the court where the litigation is proposed to be
filed.” (Ibid.) The purpose of these orders was to protect Defendants
from Plaintiff’s continued post-judgment motions challenging the Court’s
rulings. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deny the Motion and
Vacate Granting the Motion to Deem Me As Vexatious Litigant on May 21, 2024. Defendants
filed an opposition on June 13, 2024. To date, Plaintiff has not posted
security as ordered. Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion to Deny the Motion, etc. is
placed off calendar.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
