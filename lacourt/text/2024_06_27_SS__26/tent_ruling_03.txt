 Case Number:  23STLC06329    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  26   
Gibson v. Edina Fitness, LLC, et al.MOTION TO STRIKE
(CCP §§ 435 - 437)
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Plaintiff Walter Gibson’s Motion to Strike Affirmative
Defenses is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff Walter Gibson (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendants Edina Fitness, LLC and Linda Cuyar
(“Defendants”). Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on December 6, 2023.
On March 7, 2024, the Court overruled Defendants’ demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint. (Minute Order, 03/07/24.) Defendants filed an answer to the First
Amended Complaint on March 19, 2024.
 
On April 5, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Strike Affirmative Defenses. Defendant
Edina Fitness filed an opposition on June 10, 2024.  
 
Discussion
 
The Motion to Strike is brought pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure sections 435 to 437 on the grounds that the affirmative defenses in
the answer are irrelevant. Section 436, subdivision (b) states that: 
 
The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper:
 
(a) Strike out any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
 
(b) Strike out all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) However, motions to strike in
courts of limited jurisdiction may only be brought on the basis that “the
damages or relief sought are not supported by the allegations of the complaint.”
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (d).) Plaintiff, therefore, cannot move to
strike the affirmative defenses for lack of relevance. Also, motions to strike
are not allowed with respect to answers: “Motions to strike are allowed only on
the ground that the damages or relief sought are not supported by the
allegations of the complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (d)
[emphasis added].)
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff Walter Gibson’s Motion to Strike
Affirmative Defenses is DENIED.
