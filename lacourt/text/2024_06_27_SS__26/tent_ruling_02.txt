§ 2033.280)

ANALYSIS:
 
On November 14, 2022, Plaintiff Upgrade Grantor Certificate
Trust 2019 1 (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Karen
Luthart (“Defendant”). Proof of service of the Summons and Complaint was not
filed until January 2024, and Defendant filed an answer on February 26, 2024.
Due to inadvertence, the answer did not appear in the Court’s system until
March 7, 2024. In the meantime, Plaintiff, unaware of the answer, filed a
request for entry of default on March 4, 2024, which was entered by the clerk.
Accordingly, the Court vacates the entry of default dated March 4, 2024.
 
Plaintiff served Defendant with Requests for Admissions on March
26, 2024. (Motion, D’Anna Decl., Exh. 1.)
To date, Defendant has not served responses to the Requests for Admission. (Id.
at ¶3.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission
Admitted (“the Motion”) on May 14, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Upgrade Grantor Certificate Trust 2019 1’s Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted is GRANTED. THE DEFAULT ENTERED AGAINST
DEFENDANT KAREN LUTHART ON MARCH 4, 2024 IS VACATED.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
