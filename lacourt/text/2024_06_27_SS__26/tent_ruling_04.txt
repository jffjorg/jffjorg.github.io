ANALYSIS:
 
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff Jose R. Avilez (“Plaintiff”)
served Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories on Defendant
Raymond Sharifpour dba White Diamond Auto Sales (“Defendant Sharifpour”). (Motions, Sadr Decl., Exh. 3.) Despite a meet
and confer effort extending the deadline to serve verified responses without
objections, Defendant Sharifpour has not served responses to the discovery. (Id.
at ¶¶6-8 and Exhs. 4-5.) Plaintiff filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion
to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions, on April 25, 2024. Amended notices of motion and motions were filed
on May 16, 2024. No oppositions have been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Based on Defendant Sharifpour’s failure to serve initial
responses to the discovery, the Motions to Compel Responses to Interrogatories,
are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) There is no requirement for a prior
meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses can be
filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Furthermore, the motion can be brought at
any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290.) Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling
Defendant Sharifpour to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without
objections.
 
Defendant Sharifpour’s failure to timely respond constitutes
a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)
Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and
2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is
excessive for simple and unopposed motions. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation,
sanctions are awarded against Defendant Sharifpour in the amount of $970.00
based on one hour of attorney time billed at $650.00 per hour and costs of $320.00.
(Motions, Sadr Decl.,
¶¶11-12.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Jose R. Avilez’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. DEFENDANT RAYMOND SHARIFPOUR
DBA WHITE DIAMOND AUTO SALES IS TO
SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN
20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT RAYMOND SHARIFPOUR DBA WHITE
DIAMOND AUTO SALES AND COUNSEL OF
