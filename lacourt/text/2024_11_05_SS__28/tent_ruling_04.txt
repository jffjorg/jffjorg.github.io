PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Metro
asks the Court to compel Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of
documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories,
set one.  Metro also asks the Court to
impose sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Motions to compel discovery responses 
On July
17, 2024, Metro served request for production of documents, set one, special
interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one. 
Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time
Metro filed these motions. 
The
Court grants Metro’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to request for
production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff to serve code-compliant
verified responses without objections by December 5, 2024 and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by December 5, 2024. 
The
Court grants Metro’s motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to special
interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, and orders
Plaintiff to serve verified code-compliant responses to the special and form
interrogatories without objections by December 5, 2024. 
B.   Sanctions 
Metro
requests monetary sanctions on each motion. 
Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, the Court
shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories or a demand for inspection unless the Court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].) 
Plaintiff
did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a
demand for inspection. Therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. 
In City of Los Angeles v. Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (2024) 17
Cal.5th 46 (PwC), the Supreme Court held: “It is already
well-established that a court may not rely on [Code of Civil Procedure] section
2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by any other applicable
sanctions provision in the Act.  A court may invoke its independent authority to
impose sanctions under sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 only when confronted with
an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a pattern of abuse, not already
addressed by a relevant sanctions provision. And where it invokes that
authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules generally governing the
imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp.
74-75.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300,
subdivision (c), limit the Court’s authority to impose sanctions when (as here)
the non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to
interrogatories or inspection demands. 
Because these statutes address this issue, the Court may not invoke its
independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (PwC,
supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp. 74-75.) 
The
Court denies Metro’s sanctions requests. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s
motion to compel Plaintiff Ebrahim Toutain’s responses to request for
production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff Ebrahim Toutain to serve code-compliant verified
responses to the request for production of documents without objections by
December 5, 2024 and to produce the documents, electronically stored
information, and/or other things requested without objections by December 5,
2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority’s motion to compel Plaintiff Ebrahim Toutain’s responses to special
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Ebrahim Toutain to serve
code-compliant verified responses to the special interrogatories without
objections by December 5, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority’s motion to compel Plaintiff Ebrahim Toutain’s responses to form
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Ebrahim Toutain to serve
code-compliant verified responses to the form interrogatories without
objections by December 5, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority’s requests for sanctions.
