And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel further discovery responses filed by State Farm General Insurance Company, the plaintiff-in-intervention. The court notes that the Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts requires parties to engage in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) before the hearing on a motion to compel further discovery responses. However, State Farm did not schedule or participate in an IDC before the hearing. As a result, the court takes the motion off calendar and may deny or continue the motion if the parties fail to schedule and complete an IDC in the future.
