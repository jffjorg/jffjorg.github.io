Summary:

The judge has denied Target Corporation's motion for summary judgment, ruling that there are triable issues of fact. The plaintiff, Lori Manby, slipped and fell on a liquid substance in a Target parking lot, but did not see anything on the ground before or after the accident. The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's deposition testimony raises a triable issue of fact, as she testified that she had "sludge" on her clothes after the accident, which could have caused her to fall. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's failure to report the accident on the day of the accident does not preclude her from raising a triable issue of fact. The case will proceed to trial on April 9, 2025.
