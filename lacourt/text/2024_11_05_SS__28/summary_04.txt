Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions filed by Metro to compel Plaintiff's responses to discovery requests and has ruled as follows. Metro's motions to compel responses to request for production of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one are granted. The Court orders Plaintiff to serve code-compliant verified responses to the discovery requests without objections by December 5, 2024, and to produce the requested documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by December 5, 2024.

Metro has also requested sanctions for Plaintiff's failure to provide timely responses to the discovery requests. However, the Court denies these requests, citing California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, which limit the Court's authority to impose sanctions in this situation. The Court further notes that the Supreme Court's decision in City of Los Angeles v. Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (2024) 17 Cal.5th 46 holds that a court may not invoke its independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 when a non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to interrogatories or inspection demands.
