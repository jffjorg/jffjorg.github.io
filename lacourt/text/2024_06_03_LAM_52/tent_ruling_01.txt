  Case Number:  23STCV09772    Hearing Date:   June 3, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment
Plaintiff Antonio Alexander Acosta Juarez requests court judgment by default
against defendants DB & JB Construction Inc dba DB Construction and Douglas
E. Bracamonte.  Plaintiff’s application meets
all requirements for default judgment.  
Plaintiff
did not, however, request dismissal of defendants Does 1-10.  A request for default judgment must
include “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought
or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(7).)  Plaintiff does not seek
default judgment against the Doe defendants. 
They therefore must be dismissed. 

The court hereby dismisses defendants Does 1-10
without prejudice.
Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is granted.  The court
will sign the proposed judgment plaintiff submitted on form JUD-100 and will
enter judgment.
