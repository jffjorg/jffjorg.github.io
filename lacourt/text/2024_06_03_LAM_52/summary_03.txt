And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants a preliminary injunction against defendant Lani Pollock in part. The court finds that plaintiffs Cambria Investment Management, L.P. and Cambria GP, LLC have demonstrated a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits of their claims for breach of contract, intentional interference with contract, and intentional interference with economic relations. The court also finds that the balance of interim harm to the parties supports granting a preliminary injunction. The court grants the injunction in three manners: (1) prohibiting defendant from disclosing any "Proprietary Information" in her possession, custody, or control that belongs to plaintiffs; (2) prohibiting defendant from using all email and social media accounts bearing the name "Eric Richardson" or information derived or obtained from those accounts to contact employees, directors, partners, or parties to contracts or economic relationships with plaintiffs; and (3) prohibiting defendant from disclosing any information about Cambria's business relationships or proprietary information. The court does not require plaintiffs to post an undertaking.
