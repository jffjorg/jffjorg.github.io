English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling modifies the judgment in this case by adding West Hollywood Collision Center (WHCC) and WEHO Collision Center (WEHO) as successors of Final Touch Collision Center. The ruling is based on the "successor corporation" theory, which holds that when a corporation sells or transfers all of its assets to another corporation, the latter is also liable for the former's debts and liabilities. The Plaintiff, Plaintiff Consumers County Mutual Insurance Company, has presented evidence showing that WHCC and WEHO performed the same business in the same location, used the same type of repair bills, and held insured vehicles for ransom. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has carried its burden to show that WHCC and WEHO should be added to the judgment as successors of Final Touch. The Motion is granted, and the objections are sustained.
