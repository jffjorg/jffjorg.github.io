Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel arbitration by The Private Suites Holdings, LLC (TPS) against Iman Frederick, a former employee. The judge finds that an agreement to arbitrate exists, but has scheduled an evidentiary hearing to resolve factual disputes. The judge also finds that the class waiver in the arbitration agreement is unenforceable, as the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) is inapplicable to this case. The judge is inclined to sever the specific-performance sentence in the arbitration agreement, and has ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs on this issue.
