I.          BACKGROUND
 
On June 6, 2023, Arbitrator Mark Burstein (“Arbitrator
Burstein”) issued an arbitration award in favor Petitioners Board of Trustees
of the Cement Masons Southern California Health and Welfare Fund; Board of
Trustees of Southern California Pension Trust; Board of Trustees Eleven
Counties Cement Masons Vacation Savings Plan; Board of Trustees Cement Masons
Joint Apprenticeship Trust; and Board of Trustees Cement Masons Southern
California Individual Retirement Account (Defined Contribution) Trust
(collectively, “Petitioners”) and against Respondent Sisakian Contracting Corp.
(“Sisakian”) in the principal sum of $2,845.77. The arbitration arose out of a
dispute regarding the payment of fringe benefit contributions due under labor
agreements between the parties.  The arbitration
award also directs Sisakian to pay accrued interest at the rate of 10%, all
reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs incurred, and court costs required to enforce
the award.
 
On October 23, 2023, Petitioners filed a Verified Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award against Sisakian.
 
            On November
16, 2023, Petitioners filed this motion for an order confirming the arbitration
award, including attorneys’ fees and costs.  Petitioners seek a total judgment of
$6,141.31, consisting of the principal arbitration award of $2,845.77, interest
in the sum of $37.94, attorneys’ fees in the sum of $2,647.25, and costs in the
sum of $611.05.
 
            The motion
is unopposed. 
             
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Once arbitration is concluded,
“any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the
superior court.”¿ (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003)
107¿Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)¿ Any of the parties may file a petition with the
court, which must then “confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it,
or dismiss the petition.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§§¿1285, 1286; EHM
Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood,¿Inc. (2018) 21
Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)¿“It is well settled that the scope of judicial review
of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.” (California Faculty Assn. v.
Superior Court¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)¿ “Neither the trial court,
nor the appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency
of the evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an
award because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on
the award’s face.”¿ (EHM Productions, supra, at p. 1063-64.)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Petitioners
seek an order confirming the arbitration award issued on June 6, 2023, and
awarding interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs.
 
An arbitrator’s award is enforceable only after being
confirmed by a court of law. (O’Hare, 107 Cal.App.4th at p. 278.)¿ “An
award that has not been confirmed or vacated has the same force and effect as a
contract in writing between the parties to the arbitration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1287.6.)¿ Thus, the court must first evaluate and confirm the initial
arbitration award.¿        
            
A.   
Filing
Requirements (CCP § 1285.4)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition
under this chapter shall: 
 

Set forth the substance of or
     have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner
     denies the existence of such an agreement. 


Set forth the names of the
     arbitrators. 
Set forth or have attached a
     copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if
     any.” 

 
Here, Petitioners submit the written Final Award issued by
Arbitrator Burstein.  (Pet., Ex. 4.)  Petitioners also submit a copy of the
arbitration agreement between the parties. 
(Pet., Ex. 2.) Petitioners have satisfied the filing requirements. 
¿¿ 
B.    
Service of the Arbitration Award
& Timeliness of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 provides that: “The
neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party
to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided
in the agreement.”¿ In addition, a party may seek a court judgment confirming
an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than four years,
but not less than 10 days, after the award is served.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§§
1288, 1288.4.)¿ 
¿ 
Here, Petitioners submit proof of service showing the Final
Award was served by Arbitrator Burstein by certified mail on June 6, 2023.  (Pet., Ex. 5.)  This motion followed on
November 16, 2023.  The motion is timely. 
 
C.    
Service of
the Petition, and Notice of Hearing (CCP § 1290.4)¿¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4, the statute
governing proper service of this motion states, in pertinent part:¿¿ 
¿ 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time
and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition
is based shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement
for the service of such petition and notice.¿ 
¿ 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner
in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be
made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been
served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State
shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an
action.¿ 
¿ 
Here, Petitioners served Sisakian with a copy of this motion
and notice of motion on November 16, 2023 by certified mail which is consistent
with the parties’ agreement.¿ (See Pet., Ex. 2, ¶¶ B.5.1.6, B.5.1.8.)  Petitioners demonstrate that the motion was
properly served.¿ 
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the unopposed motion for an order confirming the arbitration
award, including attorneys’ fees is GRANTED. 
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
