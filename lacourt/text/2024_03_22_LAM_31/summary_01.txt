And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Judge Kerry Bensinger of the Superior Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Board of Trustees of the Cement Masons Southern California Health and Welfare Fund, et al. v. Sisakian Contracting Corp. (Case No. 23STCP03908). The ruling concerns a motion filed by the petitioners to confirm an arbitration award, including attorneys' fees and costs.

The arbitration award was issued on June 6, 2023, in favor of the petitioners and against the respondent, Sisakian Contracting Corp., in the principal sum of $2,845.77. The award also directed Sisakian to pay accrued interest at the rate of 10%, all reasonable attorneys' fees, costs incurred, and court costs required to enforce the award.

The petitioners seek a total judgment of $6,141.31, consisting of the principal arbitration award, interest, attorneys' fees, and costs. The motion is unopposed, and the court must now confirm the arbitration award and award interest, attorneys' fees, and costs.

The court has found that the petitioners have satisfied the filing requirements, including serving a copy of the arbitration award and the petition on the respondent. The court has also determined that the motion is timely and was properly served on the respondent.

Based on the foregoing, the court has granted the motion for an order confirming the arbitration award, including attorneys' fees.
