And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before the hearing on February 28, 2024. The court will not consider the plaintiff's sur-reply because it was filed without leave of court and does not contain new evidence. The court also finds that the defendant, Robles, has challenged the enforceability of the delegation clause in the agreement.

The judge notes that Robles was hired as COO and signed an agreement and release. However, Robles claims that she was not given a meaningful opportunity to review the agreement or have it reviewed by her own counsel. The court finds this claim to be unreliable.

The court also addresses the issue of whether the agreement's venue provision is enforceable. The provision states that if the arbitration provision is unenforceable, all claims shall be decided by trial before the court and not by a jury, and that the venue for any such trial shall be in the state or federal courts located in Clark County, Nevada. The court finds this provision to be problematic and in violation of California law.

Finally, the court notes that Robles has not filed her answer or cross-complaint, but the parties consider the impact of her potential FEHA claims, including her claims for sexual harassment, on the merits of the motion to compel arbitration. The court leaves the issue of whether Robles's potential causes of action survive scrutiny for another day.
