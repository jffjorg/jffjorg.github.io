Ruling:
  - The court finds that the delegation clause is not clear and unmistakable and therefore decides the enforceability of the arbitration agreement
  - The court holds that the arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable due to the confidentiality provision, which favors the employer and makes it difficult for the employee to pursue a claim
