MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.  
RESPONDING PARTY: None
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to compel Defendant Salvador Medina to respond to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and to impose monetary sanctions against Defendant

TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged breach of contract.
 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A. (“Plaintiff” or “BMO Bank”) initiated the action against
Defendants Medina Truck & Transport, Inc. (“MT&T”), Salvador Medina
(“Medina”) (collectively, “Defendants”) and Does 1-20. The Complaint alleges:
(1) Breach of Written Agreement (against MT&T); (2) Breach of Continuing
Guaranty (against Medina); (3) Claim and Delivery (against all Defendants); and
(4) Conversion (against all Defendants).
 
On May 30, 2024, the Court
overruled a demurrer with motion to strike, filed by Medina on December 2,
2023. Subsequently, Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint on June 12,
2024.
 
On the same day, May 30, 2024,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s application for writ of possession against
Medina.
 
On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Compel Reponses to Form Interrogatories, Set One
(the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition or Reply papers
have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a party to
whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary
sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no
time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that
needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was
properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired,
and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Additionally,
“[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response ... [t]he party to whom the
interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
Defendants’ counsel, Michael
Brown (“Brown”), attests that on or about December 20, 2023, Defendant Medina was
served with the first set of Form Interrogatories by both mail and email. (Brown
Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “1.”) This service established that responses were due on January
24, 2024. On February 6, 2024, Brown’s send a meet and confer letter to
Medina’s counsel requesting responses. (Id. ¶ 5.)  However, as of the date of filing of the
Motion, Medina has not served any responses. (Id. ¶ 6.) 
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Defendant Medina failed to serve a timely response,
thereby waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those based on
privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless,
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), “[t]he court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve
a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.”
 
Here,
Defendant Medina did not file an Opposition to the Motion. Nor did he move
separately for relief from the waiver. Additionally, there is no record
indicating any responses have been subsequently served by Medina prior to the
hearing. Consequently, the Court finds that relief under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision(a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the unopposed
Motion.
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust....” 
 
Additionally,
California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
The Court finds the mandatory sanction
applies in this case. Utilizing the lodestar approach, the Court determines the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $547.50, calculated based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $325.00 for 1.5 hours reasonably spent, plus a $60.00
filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.’s unopposed Motion to Compel
Defendant Salvador Medina to Respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is
GRANTED.
 
Defendant Salvador
Medina is ordered
to serve verified responses, without objection, to the Form Interrogatories,
Set One, within 20 days. 
 
Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.’s Request
for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Defendant Salvador
Medina and his
attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay $547.50 to Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.’s counsel within 20 days.
