Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a proposed decision by the judge in the case of DrinkPAK, LLC v. Paylocity Corp., regarding a demurrer filed by Paylocity Corp. to the plaintiff's complaint. The judge has partially sustained and partially overruled the demurrer.

The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to state a claim for breach of contract under Illinois law.

The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the causes of action for implied indemnity and contribution, finding that the plaintiff's claims do not fit under either of these theories under Illinois law.

The judge has granted the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint.
