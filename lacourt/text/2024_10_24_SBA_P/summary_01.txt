And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages in its entirety, with leave to amend. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of its conduct, but failed to take steps to prevent the injury. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations did not rise to the level of malice, despicable, or oppressive conduct, and that the defendant's failure to implement maintenance procedures was not sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge noted that the plaintiff's allegations were more akin to recklessness, and that the defendant's actions did not constitute a "despicable" or "vile" disregard for the plaintiff's safety. The judge also granted leave to amend, as there is a reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can plead additional facts to support a claim for punitive damages.
