And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the nuisance and negligence claims, with twenty days leave to amend. The court finds that the nuisance claim fails because it is barred by Civ. Code § 3482, which states that nothing done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can be deemed a nuisance. The court also finds that the negligence claim fails because it is unclear when the building was first used in an improper manner, and the statute of limitations has expired. The court grants the request for a hearing on the demurrer and orders the moving party to give notice.
