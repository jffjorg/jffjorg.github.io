And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of plaintiff's counsel, Khashayar Eshraghi, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, but the judge denied the motion on procedural grounds. Specifically, counsel failed to provide the minimum notice period required by law, and the proof of service filed showed that the plaintiff was served personally on July 1, 2024, which conflicted with counsel's declaration stating that the plaintiff was served by mail. The judge also noted that counsel had not corrected the zip code in the proposed order as previously ordered. The motion is denied, and counsel must provide notice of the court's ruling and file proofs of service.
