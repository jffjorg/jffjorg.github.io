And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Cross-Complainant Foot Locker Retail, Inc.'s motion to be relieved from waiver of objections to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories (Set One). The motion was opposed by Cross-Defendant A.J. Molino & Associates, Inc. Cross-Complainant had requested an extension to May 31, 2024, which was granted, but then requested another extension until June 5, 2024. However, Cross-Complainant did not complete the responses until June 5, 2024, and did not provide a sufficient explanation for the delay. The judge found that Cross-Complainant's delay was not due to excusable neglect and therefore denied the motion.
