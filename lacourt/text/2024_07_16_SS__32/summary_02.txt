And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery. The Plaintiff, Carlos Vitro, seeks to reopen discovery to depose the Defendant's PMK and request document productions. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's counsel, Dmitri Hurt, has failed to act diligently in seeking discovery, having only obtained the case file on May 3, 2024, despite being substituted in on March 20, 2024. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's counsel has failed to provide specificity regarding prior counsel's efforts and has not replied to the Defendant's arguments. As a result, the Court has denied the motion to reopen discovery.
