And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court's tentative ruling is a clarification of the record regarding the substitution of counsel in this case. Counsel argues that on May 3, 2024, Plaintiff's former counsel appeared for a hearing to be relieved, and the Court allowed for former counsel to be relieved and moved the motion off calendar. However, this is incorrect. The motion was actually off calendar as moot because a substitution of counsel had previously been filed. Additionally, current counsel filed an ex parte application on April 16, 2024, stating that they substituted in on March 20, 2024, and requested additional time to prepare for trial. The Court finds that this request is reasonable, given the need for new counsel to get up to speed, conduct discovery, and prepare for trial.
