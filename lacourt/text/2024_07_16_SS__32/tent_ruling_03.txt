[1] Counsel
argues that on May 3, 2024, Plaintiff’s former counsel appeared for a hearing
for a motion to be relieved and the Court “allowed for Former Counsel to be
relieved and moved the motion off calendar.” (Motion at p. 1.) This is
incorrect. The motion was off calendar as moot because a substitution of
counsel had previously been filed. (See Minute Order dated May 3, 2024.)
Moreover, current counsel filed an ex parte application on April 16, 2024, making
clear that current counsel “substituted in … on March 20, 2024,” and requested
additional time because “new counsel will need more time to get up to speed,
conduct discovery, and prepare for trial.” (See Ex Parte Application Dated
April 16, 2024 at p. 1-2.)
