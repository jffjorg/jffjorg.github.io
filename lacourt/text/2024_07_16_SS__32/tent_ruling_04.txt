TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


July
  16, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV26196




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to be Relieved from Waiver of Objections to Form Interrogatories and Special
  Interrogatories (Set One)




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant/Cross-Complainant Foot Locker
  Retail, Inc.




OPPOSING PARTY:


Cross-Defendant
  A.J. Molino & Associates, Inc.  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant/Cross-Complainant Foot
Locker Retail, Inc. (“Cross-Complainant”), moves for relief from waiver of
objections to Cross-Defendant A.J. Molino & Associates, Inc.’s (“Cross-Defendant”)
Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One. Cross-Defendant
opposes and Cross-Complainant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A party who fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories waives
any objection to the demand, including based on privilege or work product,
unless the court finds that the party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance and the party’s failure was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(a).) 
 
The Civil Discovery Act does not include a definition of
“substantial compliance,” and few cases have addressed the circumstances under
which a response will be deemed not in substantial compliance. (See St. Mary
v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778 (St. Mary).)
Substantial compliance means actual compliance with respect to the substance
essential to every reasonable objective of the statute. (Id. at 779.)
However, substantial compliance should not be understood as requiring actual
compliance with every specific statutory requirement. (Ibid.)¿¿ 
¿ 
A court may not find that only some portions of a document
containing responses are code-compliant, but must instead determine whether the document as whole
substantially complies. (St. Mary, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at 779–80
[this position is supported by the fact that there is an effective statutory
vehicle to compel a responding party to cure unsatisfactory responses].)¿ 
 
The
statutory language “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect” in the
discovery statute should be interpreted using the same general principles
developed in application of the identical language in section 473, subdivision
(b). (Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 263,
275.) Although the party moving for relief under section 473 has the burden to
show that the mistake, inadvertence, or neglect was excusable, any doubts as to
that showing must be resolved in favor of the moving party. (New Albertsons,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1420.)¿¿ 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Cross-Defendant served Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special
Interrogatories, Set One on Cross-Complainant on March 5, 2024. The responses
were originally due April 5, 2024. (Sohrabian Decl. ¶ 2-3.) These responses
were served on prior counsel. During this time, Cross-Complainant changed
representation and the case file was being transferred to current counsel (who
moved to a different firm). Current counsel substituted into this case on April
22, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5.) However, the file still had not been transferred.
As a result, Cross-Complainant requested an extension to May 31, 2024, which
Cross-Defendant granted. However, “[o]n Friday, May 31, 2024, our office
experienced technical issues with the file, so our office emailed
Cross-Defendant’s counsel in the evening that we would have responses by Monday
morning, June 3, 2024. On June 3, 2024, Cross-Defendant’s counsel indicated
that he had not granted the extension and therefore objections were waived.” (Id.
¶ 10-11.) Cross-Complainant’s counsel, Tiffany E. Sohrabian, declares that “[o]ur
firm explained that we were having technical issues and a further extension was
granted to Wednesday, June 5, 2024.” (Id. ¶ 12.) “On June 5, 2024,
Cross-Complainant served Cross-Defendant with discovery responses.” (Id.
¶ 13.)  
 
In opposition, Cross-Defendant confirms that extensions were granted
until Friday, May 31, 2024. However, on Monday, June 3, 2024, after seeing the
May 31, 2024 email, Cross-Defendant stated that responses without objections
were due by June 3, 2024. (Kim Decl. ¶ 24, Exh. J.) Cross-Complainant requested
an extension by June 5, 2024 and asked for the discovery to be re-sent because
the files could not be opened. (Id., Exh. J.) Cross-Defendant then
re-sent the discovery on June 3 and expected responses without objections by
June 5, 2024. (Kim Decl. ¶ 25–26.) Cross-complainant provided responses on June
5, 2024. (Id. ¶ 28.)
 
Cross-Defendant argues that counsel acted negligently by attempting to
complete the responses at the end of the day when they were due. (Opp., 5.) It
also argues that the responses are not substantially compliant. 
 
Cross-Complainant describes the “technical issues with the file” with
limited detail and asserts in reply, without a supporting declaration, that “when
Defendant Foot Locker’s counsel attempted to open the discovery documents on
May 31, 2024, in order to complete the responses, she discovered that the files
were corrupted and she was unable to open them. 
Further, she was unable to obtain another copy of the discovery
documents on May 31, 2024, because she did not realize this until after the end
of the business day.” (Reply, 2.) Counsel further argues that “counsel served
the responses as soon as possible once she obtained the discovery documents
from Cross-Defendant’s counsel.” (Id.) However, it appears that when
Cross-Complainant did receive the re-served electronic versions of discovery on
June 3, Cross-Complainant did not complete the responses on the same day, and
did not provide them until June 5, and indeed requested until June 5 to provide
responses rather than offering to provide them the same day. Cross-Complainant
does not explain the further untimeliness or otherwise provide a basis for the
Court to find excusable neglect. This delay undermines Cross-Complainant’s
argument that a “technical issue” resulted in delay. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Cross-Complainant Foot Locker Retail, Inc.’s Motion to be
Relieved from Waiver of Objections to Form Interrogatories and Special
Interrogatories (Set One) is DENIED.
 
Moving
party to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
