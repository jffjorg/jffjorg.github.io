And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' special motion to strike the first amended complaint, which alleges that the defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct in connection with a default judgment entered against the plaintiff, Julie Ann Allarie. The court found that the defendants' alleged conduct was protected by the litigation privilege, which immunizes litigants from liability for torts arising from communications in judicial proceedings.

The court also awarded the defendants $7,600 in attorneys' fees and costs, which was reduced from the original amount of $15,914.50 due to the excessive number of hours spent by defense counsel on the anti-SLAPP motion.

The court's ruling is based on the California anti-SLAPP statute, which allows courts to strike lawsuits that arise from protected activity and lack even minimal merit. The court found that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the litigation privilege and lacked minimal merit, and therefore, the court granted the defendants' special motion to strike.
