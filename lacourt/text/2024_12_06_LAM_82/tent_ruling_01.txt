INTRODUCTION

 
In
2006, the voters passed Proposition 83, commonly known as “Jessica’s Law,” which
amended certain provisions of Penal Code section 667.6, the provision that
governs sentencing of certain sex offenses. 
Two years later, on July 26, 2008, “Petitioner Jessica M. was kidnapped
at knifepoint, forced to orally copulate her attacker, forcibly raped, forcibly
sodomized, and forcibly digitally penetrated” by Sergio Linares, who was 25
years and nine months old at the time.  (Petition
for Writ of Mandate (“Pet.”) ¶¶ 1, 14 & Exh. F; Declaration of Jessica M. ¶
3.)  Linares pleaded no contest to five
forcible sex offenses and admitted a weapons enhancement.  Pursuant to section 667.6(c), Linares was
sentenced to a total of 50 years’ imprisonment based upon a series of
consecutive sentences.  At the time
Linares was sentenced, he was not eligible for a “youth offender parole
hearing” under Penal Code section 3051. 
However, between 2015 and 2019, the Legislature amended section 3051 and
raised the relevant age from 23 years old to 25 years old, which now entitles
Sergio Linares to regular parole hearings, notwithstanding his “full, separate,
and consecutive sentences.”  
 
Petitioners
Jessica M. and Crime Survivors, Inc. (collectively, “Petitioners”) seek a writ
of traditional mandate or prohibition under Code of Civil Procedure sections
1085 and/or 1103 against California Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation (the “Department” or the “CDCR”) and the Board of Parole
Hearings (the “Board”) (collectively, “Respondents”).  Petitioners seek a writ preventing Respondents
from holding youthful offender parole hearings for, and granting parole to, any
inmate sentenced to consecutive terms under section 667.6.  Respondents argue that Petitioners do not
present a justiciable controversy because they do not have standing and the
issue is not ripe since they identify no inmate who has been paroled.  Respondents also argue that there was no
unconstitutional amendment of section 667.6.
 
The
court questions whether this issue is ripe. 
On March 29, 2023, the Board denied Linares parole under section 3051,
and on October 2, 2024, Linares stipulated to a three-year period of
unsuitability for parole.  Because
Linares has only served about 16 years of a 50-year sentence for violent sexual
offenses he committed when he was almost 26 years old, it is unlikely he will
be paroled under section 3051 for the foreseeable future, if at all.  Nevertheless, the court assumes without
deciding that Petitioners present a justiciable controversy with respect to
Linares and similarly-situated inmates. 
The court denies the petition on the merits, finding that there has been
no unconstitutional amendment of section 667.6. 

BACKGROUND 
 
A.        Factual Background 
 
“On
July 26, 2008, Petitioner Jessica M. was kidnapped at knifepoint, forced to
orally copulate her attacker, forcibly raped, forcibly sodomized, and forcibly
digitally penetrated by a stranger,” who was later identified as Sergio
Linares.  (Petition for Writ of Mandate
(“Pet.”) ¶ 1 and Exh. F; Declaration of Jessica M. ¶ 3.)  Linares was 25 years and nine months old when
he committed the crime.  (Pet. ¶ 14 &
Exh. F.)  Linares was identified,
apprehended, and charged with multiple criminal counts and faced a maximum
sentence of 136 years-to-life in state prison. 
(Pet. ¶ 1.)  
 
On
December 12, 2008, Linares pleaded no contest to five forcible sexual offenses
and admitted a weapons enhancement: (1) Two counts of forcible oral copulation
under Penal Code section 288a(c)(2); (2) One count of forcible rape under Penal
Code section 261(a)(2); (3) One count of forcible sodomy under Penal Code
section 286(c)(2); (4) One count of forcible digital penetration under Penal
Code section 289(a)(1); and (5) A weapons enhancement for use of a knife.  (Ibid.)  Linares was sentenced to eight years’
imprisonment on each sex offense and ten years’ imprisonment for the weapons
enhancement, to run consecutively, for a total term of imprisonment of 50
years.  (Pet. ¶¶ 1, 14 and Exh. E and F.)

 
B.        Penal Code section 667.6(c) and
Proposition 83
 
Two
years before the crime, in 2006, California voters passed, by a wide margin,
Proposition 83, tilted: “The Sexual Predator Punishment and Control Act:
Jessica’s Law.”  (Pet Exh. G and H; Resp.
RJN Exh. 5.)  Proposition 83 increased
the penalties for certain sex offenses, prohibited probation in lieu of prison
for some sex offenses, and extended parole for habitual sex offenders.  Proposition 83 also enacted lifetime
monitoring using global positioning satellite technology; felony status for
possession of child pornography; and indeterminate, involuntary civil
commitment for sexually violent predators. 
(Resp. RJN Exh. 5 at 43-44.)[1]  Proposition 83 was focused, in substantial
part, on predators who victimize children. (Id. at 44 [“Proposition
83—Jessica’s Law—will protect our children by keeping child molesters in prison
longer; keeping them away from schools and parks; and monitoring their
movements after they are released.”]
 
Article
IV, section 9 of the California Constitution mandates that “[a] section of a
statute may not be amended unless the section is re-enacted as amended.”  Accordingly, to comply with Article IV,
section 9, section 667.6 was reenacted along with certain changes in
Proposition 83.  (See Resp. RJN
Exh. 5 at 49.)  However, Proposition 83 did
not amend the judge’s discretion to impose consecutive sentences for forcible
sex crimes against the same victim on the same occasion.  (See ibid.)  Proposition 83 made the following amendments
to section 667.6(c) with the new changes noted in bold italics:  
            
In lieu of the
term provided in Section 1170.1, a full, separate, and consecutive term may be
imposed for each violation of Section 220, other than an assault with intent
to commit mayhem, provided that the person has been convicted previously of
violating Section 220 for an offense other than an assault with intent to
commit mayhem, paragraph (2), (3), (6), or (7) of subdivision (a) of Section
261, paragraph (1), (4), or (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 262, Section
264.1, subdivision (b) of Section 288, Section 288.5 or subdivision (a) of
Section 289, of committing sodomy in violation of subdivision (k) of Section
286, of committing oral copulation in violation of subdivision (k) of Section
288a, or of committing sodomy or oral copulation in violation of Section 286 or
288a by force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful
bodily injury on the victim or another person whether or not the crimes were
committed during a single transaction an offense specified in
subdivision (e) if the crimes involve the same victim on the same occasion. A
term may be imposed consecutively pursuant to this subdivision if a person is
convicted of at least one offense specified in subdivision (e). If the
term is imposed consecutively pursuant to this subdivision, it shall be served
consecutively to any other term of imprisonment, and shall commence from the
time the person otherwise would have been released from imprisonment. The term
shall not be included in any determination pursuant to Section 1170.1. Any other
term imposed subsequent to that term shall not be merged therein but shall
commence at the time the person otherwise would have been released from prison.
 
(RJN
Exh. 5 at 49.)  In other words, as
relevant to this petition, Proposition 83 expanded the list of qualifying
offenses and moved them from subsection (c) to subsection (e).  The new list contained the same offenses as
well as additional one: 
 
(e) This section
shall apply to the following offenses: 
 
(1) Rape, in
violation of paragraph (2), (3), (6), or (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 261.

 
(2) Spousal rape,
in violation of paragraph (1), (4), or (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 262. 
 
(3) Rape, spousal
rape, or sexual penetration, in concert, in violation of Section 264.1. 
 
(4) Sodomy, in
violation of paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (c), or subdivision (d) or
(k), of Section 286. 
 
(5) Lewd or
lascivious act, in violation of subdivision (b) of Section 288. 
 
(6) Continuous
sexual abuse of a child, in violation of Section 288.5. 
 
(7) Oral
copulation, in violation of paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (c), or
subdivision (d) or (k), of Section 288a. 
 
(8) Sexual
penetration, in violation of subdivision (a) or (g) of Section 289. 
 
(9) As a present
offense under subdivision (c) or (d), assault with intent to commit a specified
sexual offense, in violation of Section 220. 
 
(10) As a prior
conviction under subdivision (a) or (b), an offense committed in another
jurisdiction that includes all of the elements of an offense specified in this
subdivision.
 
(RJN
Exh. 5 at 49.)  In other words,
Proposition 83 removed the list of qualifying offenses from subsection (c) and
created a subsection (e) with largely the same offenses.  Each of the crimes for which Linares was
convicted was included in the original language of section 667.6(c).  (Cf. Pet. Exh. E & RJN Exh. 5 at
49.)       
 
            C.        Penal
Code section 3051
 
“The
Legislature first created this system of youth offender parole hearings in
2013, following a series of court decisions identifying Eighth Amendment limits
on the sentencing of juvenile offenders.” 
(People v. Hardin (2024) 15 Cal.5th 834, 843.)[2]  In 2013, the Legislature passed, and the
Governor signed, Senate Bill No. 260 (SB 260) which added section 3051 to the
Penal Code, titled: “Youth Offender Parole Hearings.”  Originally, section 3051 authorized youth
offender parole hearings after 15, 20, or 25 years of imprisonment for persons
who were convicted of committing a “controlling offense” before they turned 18
years old.  “Controlling offense” is
defined as “the offense or enhancement for which any sentencing court imposed
the longest term of imprisonment.”  (Pen.
Code § 3051(a)(2)(B).)   
 
Subsequently,
in 2015, 2017, and 2019, the Legislature passed, and the Governor signed,
Senate Bills Numbers 261 and 394 and Assembly Bill Number 965 (SB 261, SB 394,
and AB 965), which amended section 3051 by raising the age for of those
eligible for youthful parole hearings to include inmates who committed their
crimes when they were 25 years old or younger. 
“In expanding section 3051 beyond the
constitutional minimum age of 18 set out in Graham …, the
Legislature considered scientific evidence that neurological development,
particularly in areas of the brain relevant to judgment and decisionmaking,
continues beyond adolescence and into the mid-20’s.”  (Hardin, supra, 15 Cal.5th at 846.)  As relevant to this petition, section 3051
states as follows:
 
A person who was
convicted of a controlling offense that was committed when the person was 25
years of age or younger and for which the sentence is a determinate sentence
shall be eligible for release on parole at a youth offense parole hearing
during the person’s 15th year of incarceration. 

 
(Pen.
Code § 3051(b)(1).)  The hearing must
“provide for a meaningful opportunity to obtain release” (Pen. Code § 3051(e)),
and includes an assessment of the offender’s “growth and maturity” that
“take[s] into consideration the diminished culpability of youth as compared to
that of adults [and] the hallmark features of youth.” ( Pen. Code § 3051(f)(1).)

 
            D.        Procedural
History 
 
Pursuant
to section 3051, Linares qualified for and received a youth offender parole
hearing on March 29, 2023.  Jessica M.
attended the parole hearing and provided the following victim impact statement:
 
As I say here,
resurfacing through trauma that I had thought was behind me in 2008, his
sentence to 50 years with no parole, provided me with some sense of
closure.  Even though it did not change
how I was violated, a crime was [] committed against me, and I have little
right, rights outside of this statement. 
The system promised me that he would serve 50 years without parole, and
now the system has broken that promise. 
There needs to be a change.
 
(Jessica
M. Decl. ¶ 6.)  On March 29, 2023, the
Board denied Linares parole for three years. 
(Pet. ¶ 20 and Exh. O.)
 
On
June 29, 2024, after an administrative review, the Board notified Jessica M.
that Linares’ parole hearing had been advanced to October 2, 2024.  At the hearing on October 2, 2024, Linares
stipulated to a three-year period of unsuitability for parole.  When questioned by the presiding Commissioner
about the stipulation, Linares’ attorney explained that Linares “wanted to
participate in more programming.” 
(Jessica M. Decl. ¶¶ 8-11.)
 
In
her declaration, Jessica M. states that Linares’ “stipulation of being
unsuitable for 3 years does not give me 3 years of peace because his parole
hearing can be advanced as it was last time.” 
(Id. ¶ 12.)  She declares
that “[t]his instability is overwhelming and prevents me from returning to a
level of peace and healing that I’ve worked on for such a long time.”  (Id. ¶ 13.)  Petitioners filed the instant petition for
writ of mandate on September 10, 2024.  
 
E.         Summary of the Parties’ Positions   
 
            Petitioners
allege that the subsequent amendments to Penal Code section 3051 “nullify”
Proposition 83 as it relates to inmates sentenced to Penal Code section
667.6(c) and (d).  (Pet. ¶ 23.)  In other words, Petitioners argues that affording
sex offenders a youth offender parole hearing after 15 years “indirectly
amends” the language of “full, separate, and consecutive” sentences for
forcible sex crimes under Penal Code section 667.6(c) and (d).  (Pet. ¶¶ 23, 24.)  
 
Pursuant
to Article II, section 10(c) of the California Constitution, “[t]he Legislature
may not amend an initiative statute without subsequent voter approval unless
the initiative permits such amendment, and then only upon whatever conditions
the voters attached to the Legislature's amendatory powers.”  (People v. Rojas (2023) 15 Cal.5th
561, 568.)  The “Amendment Clause” of
Proposition 83 provides as follows:
 
The provisions of
this act shall not be amended by the Legislature except by a statute passed in
each house by rollcall vote entered in the journal, two-thirds of the
membership of each house concurring, or by a statute that becomes effective
only when approved by the voters.  However,
the Legislature may amend the provisions of this act to expand the scope of
their application or to increase the punishments or penalties provided herein
by a statute passed by majority vote of each house thereof.
 
(Resp.
RJN Exh. 5 at 57, § 33.)  It is
undisputed that SB 260, SB 261, SB 394, and AB 965 were passed with simple
majorities and not with two-thirds majorities of both houses of the
Legislature.  (Pet. ¶¶ 15-18, Exh. K-N
and Respondents’ Answering Brief (“Ans. Br.”) 20:13-14.)  Therefore, Petitioners contend that SB 260,
SB 261, SB 394, and AB 965 “are void” to the extent they conflict with section
667.6.  (Pet. ¶ 41.)
 
[ADD SUMMARY OF RESPONDENTS’
POSITION]

STANDARD OF
REVIEW
 
“There are two essential requirements to the issuance of a
traditional writ of mandate: 
(1) a clear, present and
usually ministerial duty on the part of the respondent, and (2) a clear,
present and beneficial right on the part of the petitioner to the performance
of that duty.” (California
Ass’n for Health Services at Home v. Department of Health Services (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 696, 704.)  “A writ of mandate is granted only where
necessary to protect a substantial right and only when it is shown
that some substantial damage will be suffered by the petitioner if
said writ is denied.”  (Schmier v.
Supreme Court (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 703, 707-708.).   
 
“Mandamus is …
appropriate for challenging the constitutionality or validity of statutes or
official acts.”  (Wenke v. Hitchcock (1972)
6 Cal.3d 746, 751.)  The court exercises
its independent judgment on questions of law arising in mandate proceedings.  (Christensen
v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  “Interpretation of a statute or regulation is
a question of law subject to independent review.”  (Ibid.)  However, the court affords a presumption of
constitutionality to legislative acts.  “In
considering the constitutionality of a legislative act [the court] presume[s]
its validity, resolving all doubts in favor of the Act. Unless conflict with a
provision of the state or federal Constitution is clear and unquestionable,
[the court] must uphold the Act.”  (Amwest Surety Ins. Co. v. Wilson (1995)
11 Cal.4th 1243, 1252, citations omitted.)
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES 
 
            Petitioners request judicial notice of four exhibits.  Three of these exhibits are orders from Laura
Peterson v. Board of Parole Hearings, Case Number 34-2022-80003792, a case
pending before the Superior Court of California in and for the County of
Sacramento.  The fourth exhibit is a stipulation
to dismiss the related appeal.  The court
denies the request because “trial court decisions are not precedent.”  (B.F. v. Superior Court (2012) 207
Cal.App.4th 621, 627, fn. 2; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(a).)
 
            Respondents
request judicial notice of five exhibits. 
The court rules as follows:
 
            1.         Exhibit #1 – California Ballot
Pamphlet: June 8, 1982 – Proposition 8: GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452(c).   
 
            2.         Exhibit #2 – California Official Voter
Information Guide: November 4, 2008 – Proposition 9: GRANTED pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452(c).   
 
            3.         Exhibit #3 – Proposed Parole
Consideration Decision: October 2, 2024 – Linares, Sergio: GRANTED pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452(c).
 
            4.         Exhibit #4 – Senate Bill 260, Chapter
312 – GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(c).
 
            5.         Exhibit #5 – Official Voter Information
Guide: November 7, 2006 – Proposition 83: GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452(c).  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        Justiciability 
 
Petitioners pray for a statewide writ of
mandate or prohibition directing Respondents “to … refrain from enforcing Penal
Code § 3051, subdivision (b) for inmates sentenced to full, separate and
consecutive terms under Penal Code § 667.6” and “from releasing any inmate
granted parole under Penal Code§ 3051 prior to completion of a full, separate
and consecutive sentences lawfully imposed pursuant to Penal Code § 667.6.”  (Pet. Prayer ¶¶ 3-4.)  As
an initial matter, Respondents argue that Petitioners do not raise a
justiciable controversy.  
 
California courts will decide only justiciable
controversies.  The concept of justiciability is a tenet of common law
jurisprudence and embodies the principle that courts will not entertain an
action which is not founded on an actual controversy.  Justiciability thus involves the intertwined
criteria of ripeness and standing.  
 
(Wilson & Wilson
v. City Council of Redwood City (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1559, 1573
[citations, internal quotations, and internal alterations omitted].)  Respondents argue that Petitioners do not
have standing to initiate new litigation to enjoin post-judgment proceedings
related to the execution of a defendant’s sentence.  Respondents also argue that the petition is
not ripe for judicial review because Petitioners do not identify any individual
whose release is pending because of a youth offender parole hearing.  
 
                        1.         Standing

 
            To
have standing to seek a writ of mandate, a party must be “beneficially
interested.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1086.)  “A petitioner is beneficially interested if he
or she has some special interest to be served or some particular right to be
preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the
public at large.”  (Rialto Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rialto (2012) 208
Cal. App. 4th 899, 913.)  “One who is in fact adversely
affected by governmental action should have standing to challenge that action
if it is judicially reviewable.”  (Carsten
v. Psychology Examining Com. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 793, 796-97.)
 
Nevertheless, a petitioner who is not
beneficially interested in a writ may have “citizen standing” or “public
interest standing” to file a petition under the “public interest exception” to
the beneficial interest requirement.  (Rialto,
supra, 208 Cal.App.4th at 913-914.) 
“The public interest exception applies where the question is one of
public right and the object of the action is to enforce a public duty—in which
case it is sufficient that the plaintiff be interested as a citizen in having
the laws executed and the public duty enforced.”  (Ibid. [citations and internal
quotations omitted].)  
 
            2.         Ripeness 
 
By contrast, the ripeness doctrine requires
that “[t]he controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal
relations of parties having adverse legal interests. It must be a real and
substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a
conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law
would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.” 
(Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group v. City of San Jose (2003) 114
Cal.App.4th 689, 708.)  In deciding
whether a claim is ripe, courts “evaluate both the fitness of the issues for
judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court
consideration.”  (Id. at 708; see
also Pacific Legal Foundation v. California Coastal Com. (1982) 33 Cal.3d
158, 171-172.)
 
3.         Analysis 
 
The court assumes without deciding that
Jessica M. has standing as a crime victim to challenge the constitutionality of
section 3051 as applied to youth offender parole hearings for Sergio Linares.  This
assumption is based, in part, on Article I, section 28 of the California
Constitution, the Victims’ Bill of Rights (the “VBOR”), which provides that a
crime victim has a right “to participate in the parole process” and to “a
prompt and final conclusion of the case and any related post-judgment
proceedings.”  (Cal. Const. Art. I, §
28(b)(9) and (15); see also id. 
§ 28(a)(4)-(6) [discussing the
rights of victims to “sufficient” punishment and “finality in their criminal
cases”].)  The VBOR “clearly demands a
broad interpretation protective of victims’ rights.”  (Santos v. Brown (2015) 238
Cal.App.4th 398, 418.)  Moreover, because
this petition raises a purely legal question, the court assumes without
deciding that the petition is ripe as it relates to Sergio Linares.  Based upon these assumptions, the court will
decide the constitutionality of section 3051 as it relates to inmates sentenced
under section 667.6(c). 
 
However, the court finds that Petitioners
do not have a beneficial interest in the writ beyond Sergio Linares.  As a crime victim, Jessica M. understandably
has concerns about her safety and emotional wellbeing with respect to parole
proceedings of Linares and his potential release from prison.  However, she does not identify any special
interest or right in the parole proceedings of other incarcerated persons.  (See Jessica M. Decl. ¶¶ 6-14.)  Nor does Petitioner Crime Survivors, Inc.
demonstrate that it has standing.  Particia
Wenskunas, the founder/CEO of Petitioner Crime
Survivors, Inc., declares that “CSI provides services to victims including
services to victims who oppose parole for the perpetrators of the crimes
against them” and “[t]he increased number of parole hearings puts a strain on
CSI’s already limited resources.” 
(Wenskunas Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.)
 This evidence is too conclusory,
speculative, and insufficient to establish, as a factual matter, that CSI has any
special interest or “organizational standing” with respect to the requested
statewide writ as it relates to inmates sentenced under section 667.6(d).  (See Opening Brief (“OB”) 10-11,
citing Pacific
Legal Foundation v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. (1977) 74
Cal.App.3d 150, 154-155.)  
 
Petitioners also do not prove that their
petition is ripe with respect to the request for a statewide writ.  The Board heard approximately 4,063 youth
offender parole hearings in 2023.  (See
Dem. 9, citing Board of Parole Hearings 2023 Report of Significant Events,
p. 2.)[3]  For those inmates who were sentenced pursuant
to section 667.6, a judicial determination that section 3051 “amended” section
667.6 as applied to those inmates depends, in part, on the enumerated sex
crimes upon which each inmate’s sentence was based.  (See discussion of changes to list of
enumerated offenses in Proposition 83, infra.)  The constitutionality of section 3051 may
also depend on whether each inmate was sentenced pursuant to the discretionary
subdivision (c) or the mandatory subdivision (d) of section 667.6.  Further, information about each inmate’s age,
underlying crimes, and sentence is necessary to evaluate all relevant constitutional
issues, including the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual
punishment.  (See OB 19-20.)  Because more factual context about inmates
other than Linares is necessary to resolve Petitioners’ request for a statewide
writ, the first prong of the ripeness test is not met.  (See Pacific Legal Foundation, supra,
33 Cal.3d at 171-172.)
 
Nor do Petitioners demonstrate that they
will suffer hardship if court does not consider their request for a statewide
writ.  As discussed, neither Jessica M.
nor CSI have shown, with evidence, that they will suffer any concrete or
irreparable harm if the court declines to issue a statewide writ.  Petitioners also have not identified any
individual whose release is pending or imminent because of a youth offender
parole hearing.  Thus, any alleged harm
to the public is speculative and remote.
 
            Based on the foregoing, Petitioners
have not shown a beneficial interest in the statewide writ that they request or
that the matter is ripe for judicial review as it relates to inmates other than
Sergio Linares, in particular those sentenced under section 667.6(d).  Therefore, the court will consider the
petition for writ of mandate only as it relates to Linares and the legal issues
necessarily implicated by that analysis, viz., the constitutionality of section
3051 as it relates to inmates sentenced under section 667.6(c).      
 
            B.        Constitutionality  
 
            1.         Summary
of Petitioners’ Argument
 
Petitioners
contend that section 3051 amends section 667.6 because it “supersed[es] the statutorily
mandated sentences of most prisoners who committed their controlling offense
before the age of 26.”  (OB 7-8, quoting People
v. Williams (2024) 17 Cal.5th 99, 115.) 
Petitioners contend that this amendment violated article II, section
10(c) of the California Constitution because section 667.6 was “rewritten” by
Proposition 83 and the Legislature did not enact section 3051 with two-third
majorities of the California Assembly and Senate, as required by the  Amendment Clause in Proposition 83.  (OB 8.) 

 
2.         Applicable Law 
 
In
general, “[t]he Legislature may not amend an initiative statute without
subsequent voter approval unless the initiative permits such amendment, and
then only upon whatever conditions the voters attached to the Legislature’s
amendatory powers.”  (People v. Rojas (2023)
15 Cal.5th 561, 568; see Cal. Const., art. II, § 10(c).)  The purpose of this limitation is to “protect
the people’s initiative powers by precluding the Legislature from undoing
what the people have done, without the electorate’s consent.”  (People v. Kelly (2010) 47 Cal.4th
1008, 1025.)  
 
Special
rules apply when voters make changes to an existing statute in an initiative
measure.  When an existing statute is
amended, the state Constitution requires the entire section to be reenacted as
amended.  (Cal. Const., art. IV, § 9.)  
 
The rationale for
compelling reenactment of an entire statutory section when only a part is being
amended is to avoid the enactment of statutes in terms so blind that
legislators themselves were sometimes deceived in regard to their effect and
the risk that the public, from the difficulty of making the necessary
examination and comparison, failed to become apprised of the changes made in
the laws.  
 
(County
of San Diego v. Commission on State Mandates (2018) 6 Cal.5th 196, 208
[internal citations, quotations, and alterations omitted].)  “Consequently, a substantial part of almost
any statutory initiative will include a restatement of existing provisions with
only minor, nonsubstantive changes — or no changes at all.”  (Ibid.)
 
The
California Supreme Court has adopted the following test for determining whether
the state constitutional limitation on legislative amendment applies to an
initiative statute:
 
When technical
reenactments are required under article IV, section 9 of the
Constitution —
yet involve no substantive change in a given statutory provision — the
Legislature in most cases retains the power to amend the restated
provision through the ordinary legislative process.  This conclusion applies unless the
provision is integral to accomplishing the electorate’s goals in enacting the
initiative or other indicia support the conclusion that voters reasonably
intended to limit the Legislature’s ability to amend that part of the statute.  
 
(San
Diego, supra, 6 Cal.5th at 214.)  
 
3.         Proposition 83 Did Not Make Substantive
Changes to Section 667.6(c)
 
            Contrary to Petitioners’ argument,
Proposition 83 did not make substantive changes to Penal Code section 667.6(c) as
it relates to Linares’s sentencing.  The
prior version of section 667.6(c) listed the qualifying offenses in that
subdivision.  Proposition 83 merely moved
the list to a separate subdivision.  While
there were some changes to the list of qualifying offenses, the specific offenses
for which Linares was convicted were included in both the prior and current
versions of the statute.  Therefore, Proposition
83 was merely a technical reenactment of the sentencing authority applicable to
Linares.  Contrary to Petitioners’
argument, this was not “integral to accomplishing the electorate’s goals in
enacting [Proposition 83].”  Nor is there
any indicia to “support the conclusion that voters reasonably intended to limit
the Legislature’s ability to amend that part of the statute.”  Indeed, Proposition 83 did not make any
substantive changes to the court’s sentencing authority in section 667.6(c)
that are relevant to Linares.  Both
before and after Proposition 83, section 667.6(c) authorized—but did not
require—the court to impose consecutive sentences on defendants who commit
multiple qualifying offenses against the same victim on the same occasion.  (See Rep. RJN Exh. 5 at 49.)  
 
            Petitioners acknowledge that
subdivision (e) contains nearly all the same criminal offenses that were
enumerated in section 667.6(c) prior to Proposition 83.  Instead, Petitioners argue that “there are
substantive changes in the removal of the prior conviction requirement for
assault with intent to commit a sex crime (§ 667.6, subd. (e)(9)) and the
addition of subdivision (g) of section 289. (§ 667.6, subd. (e)(8).)”  (OB 18:8-10.) 
Linares was not convicted of assault with intent to commit a sex crime
(Penal Code § 220) or sexual penetration in violation of subdivision (g) of
section 289.   (See Pet. ¶¶ 1, 14
and Exh. E and F.)  Similarly,
Petitioners argue that two additional crimes were added to subdivision
(e).  Again, Linares was not convicted of
either of these two new qualifying offenses. 
Accordingly, the court need not decide whether these changes to the list
of enumerated crimes in section 667.6 could only be amended by two-third
majorities of the Legislature. 
 
Petitioners
suggest that the question of whether Proposition 83 made “technical
reenactments” to section 667.6 cannot be decided with respect to only those
parts of section 667.6 that apply to Linares. 
(See Reply 14:13-14 and 14:20-24.)  Petitioners do not explain why that would be
the case.  To the contrary, San Diego instructs
that, if technical reenactments were required and did not involve “substantive
change in a given statutory provision,” the Legislature generally
“retains the power to amend the restated
provision through the ordinary legislative process.”  (San Diego, supra, 6 Cal.5th at 214
[emphasis added].)  San Diego did
not hold or suggest that this analysis applies only to an entire codified
statute, as opposed to specific provisions within the statute.[4]  
 
Petitioners
also argue that the scope of subdivision (c) was changed from “on the victim or
another person whether or not the crimes were committed during a single transaction”
to “if the crimes involve the same victim on the same occasion.”  This is not dispositive.  The Court of Appeal has instructed that “[t]he
substance, not the form, is what matters.” 
(People v. Superior Court (Pearson) (2010) 48 Cal.4th 564,
573.)  
 
In
sum, Proposition 83 did not make substantive changes to Penal Code section
667.6(c) with respect to any of the qualifying offenses for which Linares was
convicted or the trial court’s authority to impose consecutive sentences.  Instead, as applied to Linares’s conviction
and sentence, Proposition 83 made only non-substantive changes and “technical
reenactments” to section 667.6(c).  As a
result, the Amendment Clause of Proposition 83 does not apply and the
Legislature could amend those parts of section 667.6(c) through the ordinary
legislative process.
 
                        4.         Section 3051 Did Not Amend Section
667.6 as Applied to Linares 
 
In
the alternative, even if Proposition 83 made substantive changes to Penal Code
section 667.6(c) as it relates to Linares’s convictions and sentencing, section
3051 did not amend the sentencing statute. 
Instead, section 3051 “create[d] an earlier postjudgment opportunity for
incarcerated individuals to demonstrate growth, rehabilitation, and readiness
to reintegrate into society.”  (Ans. Br.
21:22-24.)  
 
In
this context, the California Supreme Court has described an amendment as “a
legislative act designed to change an existing initiative statute by adding or
taking from it some particular provision.” 
(Pearson, supra, 48 Cal.4th at 571.)  “The Legislature remains free to address a
‘related but distinct area’ or a matter that an initiative measure ‘does
not specifically authorize or prohibit.’”  (Kelly, supra, 47 Cal.4th at 1025-26
[internal citations and quotation marks omitted].)  Here, section 3051 does not take away or
prohibit anything that was “authorized” by Proposition 83.  Rather, the issue is whether Proposition 83 “prohibits”
the youth offender parole program created under section 3051.  (Pearson, supra, 48 Cal.4th at
571.)  
 
            The principles of statutory
interpretation are well-known and apply to the court’s interpretation of an
initiative like Proposition 83.  
 
We first consider
the initiative’s language, giving the words their ordinary meaning and
construing this language in the context of the statute and initiative as a
whole. If the language is not ambiguous, we presume the voters intended the
meaning apparent from that language, and we may not add to the statute or
rewrite it to conform to some assumed intent not apparent from that
language. If the language is ambiguous, courts may consider ballot summaries
and arguments in determining the voters’ intent and understanding of a ballot
measure. 
 
(Pearson,
supra, 48 Cal.4th at 571.)  The court
first considers the plain language of Proposition 83.  Section 667.6(c) states in relevant part: “In
lieu of the term provided in Section 1170.1, a full, separate, and consecutive
term may be imposed for each violation of an offense specified in subdivision
(e) if the crimes involve the same victim on the same occasion.”  Thus, section 667.6(c) authorizes—but does
not require—consecutive sentences for each of the crimes specified in
subdivision (e).  Significantly, under
section 3051, the incarcerated individual remains subject to the original
sentence, and will forfeit the right to youth offender parole consideration if
“subsequent to attaining 23 years of age” the inmate “commits an additional
crime for which malice aforethought is a necessary element … or for which the
individual is sentenced to life in prison.” (§ 3051(h); see generally People
v. Franklin (2016) 63 Cal. 4th 261, 278-279.)  Proposition 83 and section 667.6 do not
expressly prohibit this type of parole eligibility for youthful offenders in
which the original sentence remains operative.   
 
            The court also considers whether Proposition
83 and section 667.6 should be read to implicitly prohibit a program
creating parole eligibility for youthful offenders.  The court answers this question in the
negative.  “[S]tatutes covering the same subject matter are to
be construed together and harmonized, if possible, to maintain the integrity of
both statutes.”  (Id. at 797.)  “[C]ourts
should construe all legislative enactments to give them some meaning.”  (Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 415
(1970).)  Parole eligibility for youthful
offenders represents “a related but distinct area” than the sentencing scheme
established by section 667.6(c).  (Kelly,
supra, 47 Cal.4th at 1025-26.) 
Specifically, although a form of punishment, “parole constitutes a
distinct phase from the underlying prison sentence.”  (People v. Nuckles (2013) 56 Cal.4th
601, 609.)  Section 667.6 is a sentencing
statute, not a parole statute, and section 3051 does not amend the sentencing
authority set forth in section 667.6. 
Further, as summarized above, “[t]he Legislature first created this
system of youth offender parole hearings in 2013, following a series of court
decisions identifying Eighth Amendment limits on the sentencing of juvenile
offenders.”  (Hardin, supra, 15
Cal.5th at 843, 846.)  In fact, in a 2012
decision, the California Supreme Court urged the Legislature to “enact
legislation enabling a parole eligibility mechanism” that would provide “an
opportunity to obtain release on a showing of rehabilitation and maturity” for
youthful offenders serving lengthy sentences. (People v. Caballero
(2012) 55 Cal.4th 262, 269, fn. 5.)  The
plain language of Proposition 83 does not show an intent by the electorate to foreclose
legislation that responds to developments in the law with respect to Eighth
Amendment limits on the sentencing of juvenile offenders.  (See Resp. RJN Exh. 5.)  
 
Petitioners’
remaining arguments are not persuasive.  In
the opening brief, Petitioners cite the following statement from the
legislative findings for Proposition 83: “Existing laws that punish aggravated
sexual assault, habitual sexual offenders, and child molesters must be
strengthened and improved.”  (OB
18:21-23; see Resp. RJN Exh. 5 at 46, Sec. 2(h).)  In reply, Petitioners cite the following
statement from the Argument in Favor of Proposition 83: “Proposition 83 will: …
Require dangerous sex offenders to serve their entire sentence and not be
released early for any reason.”  (Reply
12:26-28, citing Resp. RJN Exh. 5 at 44.) 
These generic statements from the ballot materials do not mention
“parole” and do not show that the voters intended in Proposition 83 to prohibit
parole eligibility for youthful offenders. 

 
Finally,
Petitioners argue that there “can be no doubt” that section 3051 amended
section 667.6 in light of the following paragraph from a recent California
Supreme Court decision: 
 
Section 3051 “reflects
the Legislature's judgment that 25 years is the maximum amount of time that
[most youth] offender[s] may serve before becoming eligible for parole.” (Franklin, supra, 63 Cal.4th at p.
278, 202 Cal.Rptr.3d 496, 370 P.3d 1053; see id. at p. 281, 202 Cal.Rptr.3d 496, 370 P.3d 1053 [§ 3051 “effectively
reforms the parole eligibility date of a [youth] offender's original
sentence”].) By superseding the statutorily mandated sentences of most
prisoners who committed their controlling offense before the age of 26, section 3051 “changed the
manner in which the [youth] offender's original sentence operates by capping
the number of years that he or she may be imprisoned before becoming eligible
for release on parole.” 
 
(People
v. Williams (2024) 17 Cal.5th 99, 115 [modifications to Franklin in
original].)  In this discussion from Williams,
and also in the decision cited therein, People v. Franklin (2016) 63
Cal. 4th 261, the California Supreme Court did not consider whether section
3051 “amended” section 667.6 within the meaning of the constitutional limits on
legislative amendments established by Article II, section 10(c) of the
California Constitution.  Indeed, while
other parts of Proposition 83 were discussed in Williams and Franklin,
section 667.6 was not even mentioned. 
Furthermore, although Williams and Franklin refer to
section 3051 as “changing” the original sentences of certain juvenile
offenders, the Supreme Court did not opine that the voters intended to
“prohibit” such changes when they enacted Proposition 83.  “‘It is axiomatic that language in a judicial
opinion is to be understood in accordance with the facts and issues before
the court. An opinion is not authority for propositions not
considered.’”  (People v. Knoller (2007)
41 Cal.4th 139, 154-55.)
