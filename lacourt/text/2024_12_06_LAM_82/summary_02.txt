And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling discusses the application of certain legal decisions to individuals under the age of 18 at the time of a crime. The judge notes that these decisions only apply to individuals under 18 and that the Eighth Amendment prohibits life without parole sentences for nonhomicide crimes committed before the age of 18. The judge also references several court cases, including Hardin and Graham v. Florida, which support this interpretation. Additionally, the judge mentions that petitioners have raised no objection to a report in their opposition to the demurrer. Finally, the judge clarifies the meaning of certain terms, including "provision," in the context of statutory interpretation.
