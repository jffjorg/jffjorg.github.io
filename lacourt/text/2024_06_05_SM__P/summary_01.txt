And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court denied Howarth's motion for summary judgment/adjudication with respect to Mardirossian's nuisance claim. While Howarth argued that falling leaves and overhanging branches are not actionable bases for a nuisance claim, the court found that Mardirossian presented evidence that the leaves and branches interfered with his use and enjoyment of his property. The court also denied Howarth's motion as to Mardirossian's trespass claim, finding that there was a triable issue of material fact as to whether the presence of falling leaves constituted a trespass. The court denied the motion for summary adjudication as to Mardirossian's negligence claim, finding that Mardirossian presented evidence that the falling leaves caused him and his gardener to spend time and effort cleaning the court.
