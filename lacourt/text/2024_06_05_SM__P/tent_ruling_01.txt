Mardirossian v.
Howarth, Case No. 20SMCV01557
Hearing date June
5, 2024
Defendant Howarth’s
Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication 
 
Mardirossian’s
First Amended Complaint alleges: (1) nuisance; (2) trespass; and (3) battery
against his neighbor Howarth, who moves for summary judgment/adjudication. 
 
Evidentiary
Objections
Mardirossian’s
objections numbers 4, 5, and 11-13 to the Howarth declaration are OVERRULED. Mardirossian’s
objections 1-2 SUSTAINED (relevance); objections 3, 6-9 SUSTAINED (hearsay);
objection 10 SUSTAINED (improper legal opinion); objection 14-15 (lack of
authentication). Mardirossian’s objections to the supplemental declaration
submitted with the reply brief are OVERRULED. 
 
Defects in Mardirossian’s Separate Statement 
Howarth argues Mardirossian’s separate statement is defective because he
does not respond to the material facts stated by Howarth. Mardirossian did not fail
to respond to the actual material facts. As to trespass (facts 15-25), Mardirossian
failed to dispute or indicates a fact is disputed but does not cite evidence. The
Court will deem Howarth’s material facts 15-25 undisputed. 
 
Pertinent
Allegations of the FAC 
Mardirossian
alleges: On Howarth’s adjacent property, there are trees, brush, bushes,
shrubs, and landscaping, which is unreasonably intrude onto Mardirossian’s
property and unreasonably interferes with the use or enjoyment of his property.
FAC, ¶ 8. Excessive leaves and plant debris cause increased risk of harm,
including possible falling branches and increased spreading of wildfire. FAC, ¶
8. A portion of Howarth’s fencing, located on the west side of Mardirossian’s
property, extends beyond the legal boundaries of Howarth’s property and
encroaches onto Mardirossian’s property. FAC, ¶ 8.
 
First Cause of
Action for Nuisance 
Mardirossian
alleges Howarth “created a dangerous condition of overgrown trees, brush,
bushes, shrubs, and landscaping causing, among other things, intruding branches
and plant growth onto [Mardirossian’s] property, excessive accumulation of
leaves and debris on [Mardirossian's] property, and the potentially dangerous
conditions of falling branches and spreading of wildfire onto [Mardirossian]
property.” FAC, ¶ 11.
 
To state a cause
of action for nuisance, plaintiff “must prove an interference with his use and
enjoyment of its property. Second, the invasion of the plaintiff’s interest in
the use and enjoyment of the land must be substantial, i.e., it caused
the plaintiff to suffer substantial actual damage. Third, the interference with
the protected interest must not only be substantial, it must also be unreasonable,
i.e., it must be of such a nature, duration, or amount as to constitute
unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the land.” Today’s
IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2022)
83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1176. 
 
“A de minimus
interference with the enjoyment of land does not constitute a nuisance.” Smith
v. David (1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 101, 114. Thus, to succeed on a nuisance
cause of action, a plaintiff must show that an invasion was substantial. San
Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1996) 13 Cal.4th 893, 938. Additionally,
to constitute a nuisance, “[t]he interference with the protected interest . . .
must also be unreasonable.” Id. 
 
“Trees whose
branches extend over the land of another are not nuisances, except to the
extent to which the branches overhang the adjoining land. To the extent they are
nuisances, the person over whose land they extend may cut them off or have his
action for damages . . . .” Crance v. Hems (1936) 17 Cal.App.2d 450,
451-52. “[I]t has been held that no landowner has a cause of action from the
mere fact that the branches of an innoxious tree, belonging to an adjoining
landowner, overhanging his premises, his right to cutoff the overhanging
branches being considered a sufficient remedy.” Bonde v. Bishop (1952)
112 Cal.App.2d 1, 6. 
 
As to the fear of
a future injury, a private nuisance claim is not sufficient where it based
“solely [on] the fear of a future injury.” Koll-Irvine Center Property
Owners Ass’n. v. County of Orange (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1041-42. 
 
Howarth’s Evidence

Mardirossian could
not identify a date or photograph when a branch from a tree fell onto his
property. HSF 11. Mardirossian produced two photographs showing leaves on his
property. HSF 3; Begland Decl., Exh. 2. The leaves have not stopped him from
using the tennis court. HSF 6; Begland Decl., Ex. 1 at p. 210:13-21,
225:5-226:7; HSF 7; Begland Decl., Ex. 1 at p. 226:2-7. There have only been
one or two instances where Mardirossian has not had time to blow the leaves off
the tennis court and was unable to use the tennis court. HSF 8; Begland Decl.,
Ex. 1 at p. 227:4-10. Mardirossian could not identify facts supporting the
allegation of increased risk of fire but testified overgrown trees “could be
fuel to a fire.” HSF 13; Begland Decl., Ex. 1 at p. 151:24-152:15. Howarth
“continued to have the trees in [the] area that [he] own[s] or control trimmed
back regularly.” Howarth Decl., ¶ 17. 
 
Mardirossian’s
Evidence
Mardirossian produced
photographs of the trees and conditions. Feit Decl., ¶ 7; Ex. 6. After a nearby
2019 fire, Mardirossian sent a letter to neighbors encouraging them to take
additional fire protection measures. Mardirossian Separate Statement of Additional
Material Facts (MAMF) 1-3; Feit Decl., Ex. 4 at p. 39:10-16. The fire came
within 300 feet of Howarth’s residence. MAMF 2; Feit Decl., Ex. 4 at p. 40:5-7.
Mardirossian informed neighbors of the need for fire prevention measures, such
as cutting foliage. MAMF 3; Feit Decl., Ex. 4 at p. 40:18-42:10, 248:6-16. 
 
Howarth has an
obligation to trim branches which create the risk of falling or risk of fire. MAMF
7; Feit Decl., Ex. 4 at p. 111:2-17, 112:4-8, 112:22, 112:25-114:4, 115:4-15. Howarth’s
trees are overgrown, and Mardirossian cleaned his backyard and tennis court due
to the leaves. MAMF 10; Feit Decl., Ex. 4 at p. 242:18-243:8, 243:18-22.
Mardirossian stated the leaves interfere with his use and enjoyment of the
property. MAMF 10; Feit Decl., Ex. 4 at p. 243:18-22. 
 
Analysis Re:
Nuisance
Howarth argues falling
leaves and overhanging branches are not actionable bases for a nuisance claim,
relying on Bonde v. Bishop (1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 1 for the proposition
that “a landowner has no right of action against a neighbor for leaves falling
from the neighbor’s tree(s) on to the landowner’s property, because the
plaintiff has a right to time the branches that overhang his property to the
property line.” The portion of Bonde, supra, 112 Cal.App.2d 1
cited states “no landowner has a cause of action from the mere fact that the
branches of an innoxious tree, belonging to an adjoining landowner, overhang
his premises, his right to cut off the overhanging branches being considered a
sufficient remedy” was not the holding of the case and is dicta. Bonde, supra,
112 Cal.App.2d 1, 6. 
 
In Bonde, defendants’
tree limb fell, damaging plaintiffs’ garage and fence, and branches dropped
onto the roof, driveway and patio. Bonde, supra, 112 Cal.App.2d
1, 3. Plaintiffs were required to clean debris. Bonde, supra, 112
Cal.App.2d 1, 3. Bonde found the branches were a nuisance because “[t]he
fact that an overhanging branch did fall, the age of the oak tree, the evidence
of some decay, indicates that there is some danger of the overhanging limbs
falling.” Bonde, supra, 112 Cal.App.2d 1, 4. 
 
Bonde does not state a
landowner lacks a right of action against a neighbor for falling leaves or
overhanging branches. The issue was not falling leaves, but falling tree limbs
and branches. Howarth’s reliance on Crance v. Hems (1936) 17 Cal.App.2d
450 is also inapposite, as that case concerned the growth of tree roots across
a boundary line. Crance v. Hems, supra, 17 Cal.App.2d 450, 451. 
 
Mardirossian’s
citation to Clary v. City of Crescent City (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 274 is
inapposite, as that case involved a public nuisance and concerned overgrown
weeds and rubbish on vacant lots. Clary, supra, 11 Cal.App.5th
274, 277. Mardirossian’s reliance on Thain v. City of Palo Alto (1962)
207 Cal.App.2d 173, 177 is also inapposite, as that case challenged a municipal
weed abatement ordinance.  
 
Fear of “potentially
dangerous conditions of falling branches and spreading of a wildfire onto
[Mardirossian’s] property” does not constitute an actionable nuisance. FAC, ¶
11. The fact that a wildfire may occur or that a branch may fall is not an
actionable basis for a nuisance cause of action. Koll-Irvine, supra,
24 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1041-42. Unlike plaintiffs in Bonde,
Mardirossian presented no evidence that a tree branch has fallen on his
property. The fact that overhanging branches are present, without more, does
not rise to the level of a nuisance. 
 
As to the risk of
fire, Mardirossian presented no substantial evidence, such as an expert
declaration, to establish the branches and leaves create the potentially
dangerous condition of the spreading of a wildfire (or increase the risk beyond
what the non-overhanging foliage presents). Nor is fear of increased fire
damage actionable nuisance.
 
Falling leaves,
however, are actionable as a nuisance. Mardirossian presented evidence the
leaves fell on his property, forcing him to clean his tennis court.
Mardirossian testified the accumulating leaves interfere with his use and
enjoyment of his property. Mardirossian employed a gardener to clean the leaves
from his tennis court. Mardirossian presented evidence that the leaves come
from a tree on Howarth’s property. There are triable issues of fact as to
whether the falling leaves constitute a nuisance. Denied as to the nuisance
cause of action.
 
Second Cause of
Action for Trespass
Mardirossian
alleges Howarth “caused the entry onto [Mardirossian’s] property of overgrown
tree branches, brush, bushes, shrubs, other similar landscape features, and
excessive accumulation of leaves and debris, without Plaintiff’s consent or
permission. FAC, ¶ 13. Mardirossian alleges “it was recently learned that a
portion of [Howarth’s] fencing, located on the westerly side of
[Mardirossian’s] property, extends beyond the legal boundaries of [Howarth’s]
property, and trespasses and encroaches onto [Mardirossian's] property, without
the consent of [Mardirossian].” FAC, ¶ 13. 
 
Howarth argues the
trespass claim fails because overhanging branches and falling leaves do not
constitute trespass and, with respect to the allegedly encroaching fence,
Howarth lacks the required intent, since he did not install the fence. Apparently,
also, Howarth recently moved the fence.
 
“The elements of
trespass are: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or control of the property; (2) the
defendant’s intentional, reckless, or negligent entry onto the property; (3)
lack of permission for the entry or acts in excess of permission; (4) harm; and
(5) the defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing the harm.” Ralphs
Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245, 262. “The
essence of the cause of action for trespass is the ‘unauthorized entry’ onto
the land of another. Such invasions are characterized as intentional torts,
regardless of the actor’s motivation.” Miller v. National Broadcasting Co. (1986)
187 Cal.App.3d 1463, 1480. “[T]he intent required as a basis for liability as a
trespasser is simply an intent to be at the place on the land where the
trespass allegedly occurred.” Id. “Ratification is the voluntary
election by a person to adopt in some manner as his own an act which was
purportedly done on his behalf by another person, the effect of which, as to
some or all persons, is to treat the act as if originally authorized by him.” Rakestraw
v. Rodriguez (1972) 8 Cal.3d 67, 73. A plaintiff alleging a trespass cause
of action must show interference with his exclusive possessory rights. McBride
v. Smith (2018) 18 Cal.App.5th 1160, 1174. 
 
Howarth’s Evidence

The fence was
constructed before Howarth purchased the property in 1996; it is unknown who
constructed it. HSF 20-21. There was a 2000 lot line adjustment for the
boundary line on the west side of Mardirossian’s property. HSF 22-23.
Mardirossian testified that, at the time he purchased the property, neither
Howarth nor any other person gave him any assurance that the Safety Fence is on
the property boundary between the Howarth Property and the Mardirossian
Property. HSF 24. Mardirossian testified he assumed the fence was on the
property boundary but did not obtain a survey. HSF 25. The Fence was moved off
the Mardirossian Property at Howarth’s expense. Howarth Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 6-7;
Ex. 1-2. 
 
Mardirossian’s
Evidence
Howarth’s survey
shows a portion Howarth’s wrought iron fence encroaches onto his property. MAMF
14-15; Feit Decl., Ex. 2, Lai Decl. Howarth admitted the fencing encroaches
onto and prevents Mardirossian from accessing some trees. MAMF 16-18; Feit
Decl., Ex. 3 at p. 116:21-117:11, 118:8-16, 164:1-9, 166:4-8. Mardirossian
granted Howarth time to relocate the fencing to avoid litigating the issue.
MAMF 20-23; Feit Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 5. 
 
Analysis as to
Trespass
There is a triable
issue of material fact as to whether the presence of falling leaves constituting
a trespass. There is evidence the trees are on Howarth’s property and interfere
with Mardirossian’s use and enjoyment of the tennis court. As to overgrown
branches, Mardirossian presented no evidence the presence of overhanging
branches interfered with his possessory rights. 
 
Concerning the fence,
Howarth presented evidence in reply that the has been moved from the
Mardirossian Property. Based on this, it appears the issue regarding the
fencing is moot. Given that there is still an issue of triable fact as to
falling leaves, summary adjudication is denied. 
 
Third Cause of
Action for Negligence
The third cause of
action for negligence is premised on “[Howarth’s] fencing [trespassing] onto
[Mardirossian’s] property, overgrown tree branches, brush, bushes, shrubs,
other similar landscape features, intruding branches and plant growth onto
[Mardirossian’s] property, excessive accumulation of leaves and debris on
[Mardirossian’s] property, and the potentially dangerous conditions and
unreasonable increase of harm from falling branches and spreading of wild fire
onto [Mardirossian’s] property. FAC, ¶ 16. “The elements of any negligence
cause of action are duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and damages.” Peredia
v. HR Mobile Services, Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680, 687. The fear of
harm from falling branches and the spreading of wildfire, without more, does
not give rise to a negligence claim under Koll-Irvine, supra, 24
Cal.App.4th 1036, 1041-42. 
 
Howarth argues he
has no duty to prevent branches overhanging another’s property. Howarth’s
citation to Bonde, supra, 112 Cal.App.2d 1 is inapposite, as that
case did not address a negligence cause of action or state a rule of law that a
landowner has no duty to prevent branches from overhanging onto another’s property.
Howarth argues he has no duty to prevent leaves from falling onto
Mardirossian’s property but does not present legal authority to support such
proposition. 
 
Howarth argues the
falling leaves have not caused actionable damages, citing Fields v. Napa
Mill Co. (1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 442, 447 for the proposition that “a
negligent act is not actionable unless it results in injury to another.” “Nominal
damages, to vindicate a technical right, cannot be recovered in a negligence
action, where no actual loss has occurred.” Fields, supra, 164
Cal.App.2d at 448. Mardirossian presented evidence falling leaves caused him and
his gardener to spend time and effort cleaning the court. There is an issue as
to negligence, preventing the court from granting the motion for summary
adjudication. Denied.
 
Motion DENIED.
