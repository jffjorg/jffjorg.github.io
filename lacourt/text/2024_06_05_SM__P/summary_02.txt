And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, Augustus, have filed a motion to vacate the judgment entered in this case. The defendants argue that the judgment was obtained through extrinsic fraud or mistake, and that Hsieh's attorney committed misconduct. The defendants point to several issues, including the non-disclosure of the property's ownership, the lack of disclosure of investigations by the Los Angeles City Health Department and County of Los Angeles Building and Safety, and allegations of false statements made by Hsieh's attorney. The judge finds that the defendants have failed to provide evidence of extrinsic fraud or mistake, and that their conclusory statements do not warrant the relief requested. The motion to vacate the judgment is denied.
