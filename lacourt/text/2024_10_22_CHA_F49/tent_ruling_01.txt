Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV03549

 
Motion
filed: 9/3/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Cole Baber 
RESPONDING PARTY: none 
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court granting Defendant Cole Baber relief from a waiver of his
objections to Plaintiff Pablo Gaspar’s Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is DENIED as MOOT.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiffs
sustained in a vehicle accident on November 8, 2022.
 
On November 20, 2023, Plaintiffs Pablo Gaspar (“Pablo”) and
Joanna Gaspar (“Joanna”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) initiated this action against
Defendant Cole Baber (“Defendant” or “Baber”) and
Does 1 to 25, alleging (1) Motor Vehicle Liability, and (2) General Negligence.
Subsequently, Defendant filed his Answer to the Complaint on March 28, 2024.
 
On September 4, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff Pablo’s motion to
compel Baber’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
On the same day, September 4, 2024, Baber filed the instant Motion
for Relief from Waiver of Objections to Plaintiff Pablo’s Form Interrogatories,
Set One.
 
No Opposition or Reply has been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230,
and 2030.240. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion for
Relief from Waiver of Objections
 
Defendant Baber seeks an
order granting him relief from the waiver of objections to Plaintiff Pablo’s
Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
However, this issue has been
addressed in the Court’s September 4, 2024, Minute Order, which denied
Plaintiff Pablo’s motion to compel responses and found, in part, “Based
on the declaration submitted by Defendant’s counsel and the application of
relevant legal principles, the Court, in its discretion, finds that Defendant
has sufficiently demonstrated excusable neglect, thereby justifying relief from
the waiver that would preclude him from asserting any objections to the
interrogatories. The Court perceives no prejudice to Plaintiff resulting from
the delay, other than the need to pursue their case on the merits.” (9/4/2024
Minute Order at p. 4.) 
 
Accordingly, relief from the waiver of objections to
Plaintiff Pablo’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, was already granted in the
Court’s Minute Order dated September 4, 2024. 
 
In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the
Motion is MOOT and accordingly DENIES the Motion.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Cole
Baber’s Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, is DENIED as MOOT.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
