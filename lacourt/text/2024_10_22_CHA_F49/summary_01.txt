And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Cole Baber's motion for relief from waiver of objections to Plaintiff Pablo Gaspar's Form Interrogatories, Set One. The motion was filed on September 4, 2024, after the court denied Plaintiff Pablo's motion to compel responses to the interrogatories. The judge found that the defendant has already been granted relief from the waiver in a previous minute order dated September 4, 2024, which found that the defendant's failure to serve a timely response was due to excusable neglect. Since the issue has already been addressed, the motion is deemed moot and denied.
