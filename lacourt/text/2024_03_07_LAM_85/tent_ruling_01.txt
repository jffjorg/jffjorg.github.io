Ben and Reef Gardens,
Inc. et al v. Department of Regional Planning for the County of Los Angeles,
22STCP03855

Tentative decision on (1) petition
for writ of mandate: denied; (2) motion to dismiss: off calendar as moot



 
 
            Petitioners
Ben and Reef Gardens, Inc. (“B&R”), Ronit Waizgen (“Waizgen”), and Shaul
Yakovi (“Yakovi”) seek a writ of mandate compelling Respondent Department of
Regional Planning (“DRP”) for the County of Los Angeles (“County”) to set aside
its decision to deny Petitioners’ Conditional Use Permit (“CUP”) application,
and to process the application so Petitioners can receive a decision on the
merits.
            DRP
moves to have this case dismissed for delay of prosecution.  The court has read the motion to dismiss,[1] notice
of non-opposition, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioners
commenced this proceeding on October 24, 2022, alleging a cause of action for
administrative mandamus.  The Petition alleges
in pertinent part as follows.  
            B&R
and Waizgen are owners of 32222 Agua Dulce Canyon Road, Santa Clarita, CA
(“Property”).  On December 19, 2012, Petitioners
filed a CUP application for a special event facility (“Project”) at the
Property.  Yakovi is the project manager
who initiated and managed this CUP application.
            The
County worked with Petitioners to process the CUP for years.  Petitioner remained in constant contact with Regional
Planner Richard Claghorn (“Claghorn”) beginning in October 2020.  Claghorn’s tone shifted from cooperative to
uncooperative between two emails on February 4, 2021.
            On
March 18, 2021, Claghorn said he could no longer discuss the CUP application
with Petitioners.  Petitioners also received
a letter from DRP that, because of the longstanding inactive status, the Project
was scheduled for denial on April 20, 2021. 
If Petitioners wanted to avoid denial, DRP needed a written request to
keep the Project alive by April 18, 2021. 
            Petitioners
submitted such requests on March 22 and April 16, 2021.  The second request explained that the County
had created a Catch 22 by its inspectors continually refusing requests to
inspect the Property to comply with agency demands.
            Despite
Petitioners’ letters, a DRP hearing officer denied the CUP application for lack
of activity on April 20, 2021.  Because
DRP only asked Petitioners for requests to keep the Project alive which were
provided, it should not have even conducted that hearing.  
On April 29, 2021, Petitioners appealed the CUP
application’s denial to the Regional Planning Commission (“Commission”).  Petitioners meanwhile tried to work with
County agencies to clarify certain agency requests and address Project safety
concerns.  These agencies refused to
speak to Petitioners, asserting that the Project was “on hold” while
Petitioners were the subject of litigation with the County.
            The
Commission held an online public appeal hearing on July 21, 2021.  Petitioners asked for a continuance to work
with DRP to bring make the appeal hearing on the merits of the CUP application.  The Commission instead allowed public
testimony on the CUP’s merits.  After the
hearing, the Commission concluded that the CUP application was inactive because
Petitioners had not demonstrated any progress to resolve the outstanding issues.  It therefore upheld the DRP hearing officer’s
denial of the CUP application.
            On
August 2, 2021, Petitioners appealed the Commission’s findings to the County
Board of Supervisors.  The only issue
properly before the Board of Supervisors was whether it should deny the CUP
application for inactivity.  The Board of
Supervisors instead considered the merits of the CUP application and welcomed
public comment.  It then denied
Petitioners’ appeal.
            Petitioners
seek mandamus compelling DRP to reverse its denial of the CUP application and
to process it on the merits.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
October 28, 2022, Petitioners filed a Notice of Errata to add verifications from
all three Petitioners to the Petition.
            On
January 27, 2023, Petitioners served DRP with the Petition and Summons.
            On
April 24, 2023, DRP filed an Answer.
            On
August 31, 2023, the court denied Petitioners’ request for extra-record
discovery and set a trial date for March 7, 2024.
            On
November 2, 2023, pursuant to DRP’s ex parte application to set the
briefing schedule, the court set a December 18, 2023 deadline for Petitioners’
opening brief.
            On
December 27, 2023, DRP filed notice of Petitioners’ failure to file their
opening brief.
            On
January 8, 2024, the court continued the trial to April 25, 2024.
            On
February 27, 2024, the court advanced the trial back to March 7, 2024, and
scheduled DRP’s motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute on the same date.
 
            B.
Statement of Facts
            Petitioners
commenced this action on October 24, 2022. 
Schrager Decl., ¶2.  The County
produced the Administrative Record on June 5, 2023, and certified it on August 31,
2023.  Schrager Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  
            At
a trial setting conference on August 31, 2023, the court set trial for March 7,
2024 and ordered that the parties lodge the trial notebook, administrative
record, and joint appendix by February 23. 
Schrager Decl., ¶¶ 5-7, Ex. B. 
The parties agreed to stipulate to a briefing schedule.  Schrager Decl., ¶7, Ex. B.  
            On
September 22, 2023, DRP emailed Petitioners a proposed briefing schedule.  Schrager Decl., ¶9, Ex. C.  After Petitioners responded with their concerns,
DRP explained its reasoning and asked Petitioners to provide a proposed
schedule.  Schrager Decl., ¶¶ 10-12, Ex.
C.  Despite follow-up emails through
October 23, 2023, Petitioners never responded. 
Schrager Decl., ¶¶ 13-16, Ex. C.
            On
October 27, 2023, DRP sent Petitioners a proposed stipulation for the briefing
schedule.  Schrager Decl., ¶17, Ex. C.  DRP warned that if Petitioners did not
respond by November 1, it ould file an ex parte application for the
court to set a briefing schedule. 
Schrager Decl., ¶17, Ex. C.  After
another warning email on November 1 received no response (Schrager Decl., ¶¶ 18-19,
Ex. C), DRP filed the ex parte application on November 2, 2023.  Schrager Decl., ¶20.  
            That
afternoon, DRP learned the court had granted the ex parte application
with modifications.  Schrager Decl.,
¶21.  The court-ordered briefing schedule
required Petitioners to file an opening brief by December 18, 2023.  Schrager Decl., ¶22, Ex. D.  DRP served Petitioners with the court’s order
by email on November 2, 2023.  Schrager
Decl., ¶23, Ex. D.  
            Petitioners
did not file their opening brief on December 18, 2023.  Schrager Decl., ¶24.  On December 27, 2023, DRP filed a Notice of
Petitioner’s failure to file an opening brief. 
Schrager Decl., ¶25, Ex. E.  
            On
January 8, 2024, the court sua sponte continued the trial to April 25,
2024 on its own motion.  Schrager Decl.,
¶26, Ex. F.  This order did not change
the briefing schedule.  Schrager Decl.,
¶26, Ex. F.  
            To
date, Petitioners have not filed an opening brief, emailed DRP’s counsel about
plans to do so, or met and conferred regarding an alternate briefing
schedule.  Schrager Decl., ¶27.  Due to the Administrative Record’s size, DRP
planned to work on the opposition brief as soon as it received the opening
brief.   Schrager Decl., ¶28.  Allowing Petitioners to file and serve a
brief now would prejudice the DRP by giving it inadequate time to respond.  Schrager Decl., ¶29.  
 
            C. Analysis
            At
a trial setting conference on August 31, 2023, the court set trial for March 7,
2024 and ordered that the parties lodge the trial notebook, administrative
record, and joint appendix by February 23. 
Schrager Decl., ¶¶ 5-7, Ex. B. 
The parties agreed to stipulate to a briefing schedule.  Schrager Decl., ¶7, Ex. B.  
            After
Petitioners failed to provide a proposed briefing schedule or even respond, DRP
filed the ex parte application for the 
court to do so on November 2, 2023. 
Schrager Decl., ¶20.  The court
granted the application and ordered Petitioners to file an opening brief by
December 18, 2023.  Schrager Decl., ¶22,
Ex. D.  Petitioners failed to do so by
that date or at all.
            A
petitioner has the burden to demonstrate that the administrative record does
not contain sufficient evidence to support the agency’s decision.  State Water Resources Control Board Cases,
(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 674, 749.  Petitiioners’
failure to file an opening brief citing to the record means that it cannot meet
this burden.  Moreover, a memorandum of
points and authorities is required for mandamus.  See CCP §1094; CRC 3.1113(a).   The absence of a memorandum is an admission
that the motion is not meritorious and may be denied.  CRC 3.1113(a).
            The
petition for writ of mandate will be dismissed with prejudice.  See CCP §581(d).  The clerk shall prepare a judgment of
dismissal with prejudice with the court’s electronic signature.[2]
