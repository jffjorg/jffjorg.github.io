And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for writ of mandate and dismissing the case with prejudice. The petitioners, Ben and Reef Gardens, Inc., Ronit Waizgen, and Shaul Yakovi, seek a writ of mandate compelling the Department of Regional Planning for the County of Los Angeles to set aside its decision to deny their Conditional Use Permit (CUP) application. The judge finds that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate that the administrative record does not contain sufficient evidence to support the agency's decision, and that they have failed to file an opening brief in response to the respondent's motion to dismiss. The judge also notes that a memorandum of points and authorities is required for mandamus, and that the petitioners' failure to file one is an admission that the motion is not meritorious and may be denied. As a result, the petition for writ of mandate will be dismissed with prejudice.
