And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on a future court hearing. The defendant, Gohar, failed to lodge a courtesy copy of her opposition in violation of the Presiding Judge's order. The judge admonishes Gohar's counsel to provide courtesy copies in all future filings. The judge also rules on the substance of an injunction, stating that a mandatory injunction carries a heavy burden and can only be granted in extreme cases. The judge grants Jila's request for judicial notice of Ebrahim's death certificate and notes that both parties signed the Property Management Agreement.
