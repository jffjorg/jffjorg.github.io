            [3] The
City requests judicial notice of (1) a link to an audio recording of the potion
of the CHC meeting about the Property (RJN Ex. A); (2) Planning and LADBS’
report to the City Council on the Property’s status (RJN Ex. B); (3) sections
50284 and 50287, as enacted in 1972 and as effective January 1, 2012 (RJN Exs.
C-F); (4) the contract between Planning and Historic Resources Group (“HRG”)
for historic preservation studies, surveys, and related services (“HRG
Contract”) (RJN Ex. G); and (5) a June 20, 2023 Revised Notice to Proceed Re: Mills
Act Historical Property Contract Program; Inspection of Existing Contracts to
Historic Resources Group (RJN Ex. H).
            The request for RJN Exs. C-F is granted.  Evid. Code §452(b).  NWOO objects to judicial notice of RJN Exs.
A-B and G-H.  It cites Mangini v. R.
J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1057, 1063, which requires that
judicially noticed matter must be relevant. 
RJN Obj. at 3.  NWOO does not
explain why these documents would be irrelevant as they concern the City’s Mills
Act program, the Property, and the City’s treatment thereof.  RJN Exs. A-B, G-H.  
            NWOO also asserts that, although a document’s existence
can be judicially noticed, the truth of statements contained in the document
and their proper interpretation are not subject to judicial notice.  Tenet Healthsystem Desert, Inc. v. Blue
Cross of California, (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 821, 836.  RJN Obj. at 3.  The City cites People v. Dunlap, (“Dunlap”)
(1993) 18 Cal. App. 4th 1468, 1477-82, to assert that records authored by public
employees are routinely admitted in court proceedings to establish the facts
articulated in the records.  Reply at 7,
n.1.  
Dunlap only held that statutes requiring the
recording and reporting of a person’s criminal history were judicially
noticeable, which the trial court could combine with the presumption that
official duty was regularly performed to find that rap sheet information was sufficiently
trustworthy to be admissible.  18 Cal.
App. 4th at 1478-80.  Dunlap said
nothing about judicial notice of the rap sheets themselves.
None
of the audio (RJN Ex. A), the staff memorandum to the City Council (RJN Ex. B),
the contract (RJN Ex. G), and the Notice to Proceed (RJN Ex. H) is an official
agency act.  The City’s staff memoranda (RJN
Ex. B) would be subject to judicial notice if it were part of the legislative
history of a City Council resolution or other legislative action, but the City
makes no showing that it is.  See Evans
v. City of Berkeley, (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1, 7, n. 2.  The requests for RJN A-B and G-H are
denied.  See Evid. Code §§ 452(c).  


            [4] NWOO
cites a bulletin from the California Office of Historic Preservation to assert
that the property tax reduction usually amounts to 40-60% of the taxes
otherwise due.  Opp. at 7.  The City objects to this evidence as
irrelevant because this does not reflect the tax benefit for Mills Act
properties in Los Angeles.  Reply at
3.  NWOO did not request judicial notice
of this bulletin and the court cannot use it as evidence on demurrer. 


[5] Sections 50281 and 50282 only require that the contract
between the City and property owner provides for five-year inspections; they do
not expressly provide that the City has such a duty.  Mandamus generally is not
an appropriate remedy for enforcing a contractual obligation against an
agency.  300 DeHaro Street Investors
v. Department of Housing & Community Development, (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 1240, 1254.  This is because
breach of contract is an adequate remedy at law, and the duty which mandamus
enforces is not the contractual duty of the entity, but the official duty of
its officer or board.  Ibid.  Moreover, a public agency is as free to
breach a contract during performance, with accompanying liability for doing so,
as a private contracting person or entity. 
Id. at 1254-55.  See
also Pomona Police Officers’ Assn. v. City of Pomona, (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 578, 590.  Since the City’s
duties in a Mills Act contract are public duties, this argument has no
traction, and the City does not make it anyway.


[6] NWOO also cites Health Services, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 706, which held that the absence of a privately enforceable
right for damages under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 did not mean that mandamus,
which is an equitable remedy, was unavailable to compel a state agency to act
pursuant to law.  So long as the
petitioner was beneficially interested, mandamus was available to compel the
agency to act.  Id.  Opp. at 13. 

Health Services is distinguishable
because, as with Common Cause, supra, 49 Cal.3d at 440, the Mills
Act is not silent about a private enforceable right.  Rather, the Legislature affirmatively amended
the Mills Act to eliminate a private enforceable right for landowners.  


[7]
Although the parties argue mootness of the Jardinette claims (Dem. at 22-23; Opp.
at 18-20), the court declined to judicially notice the evidence supporting the
City’s argument and the issue need not be addressed.
