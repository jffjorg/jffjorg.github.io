            [1] Defendant Gohar
failed to lodge a courtesy copy of her opposition in violation of the Presiding
Judge’s First Amended General Order Re: Mandatory Electronic Filing.  Her counsel is admonished to provide courtesy
copies in all future filings.


            [2] The courts
look to the substance of an injunction to determine whether it is prohibitory
or mandatory.  Agricultural Labor
Relations Bd. v. Superior Court, (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.  A mandatory injunction — one that mandates a
party to affirmatively act, carries a heavy burden: “[t]he granting of a
mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v.
Furlotti, (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 187, 1493.


            [3] However, a
court may issue an injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause
of action in the complaint.  CCP
§526(a)(3).


            [4] Jila
requests judicial notice of Ebrahim’s death certificate.  RJN Ex. 1. 
The request is granted.  Evid.
Code §452(c).


            [5] This is
incorrect.  Both Gohar’s and Jila’s
signatures are on the Property Management Agreement.  Horn Reply Decl., ¶4, Ex. 6.
