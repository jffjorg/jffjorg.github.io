Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the City's request for judicial notice of various documents related to the Mills Act program and the Property. The City is seeking to have the court take judicial notice of these documents, which include an audio recording of a CHC meeting, a planning and LADBS report, a contract between Planning and HRG, and a notice to proceed with a Mills Act Historical Property Contract Program. NWOO objects to judicial notice of these documents, citing Mangini v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and asserting that they are irrelevant or not subject to judicial notice.

The judge denies the City's request for judicial notice of RJN Exs. A-B and G-H, citing Tenet Healthsystem Desert, Inc. v. Blue Cross of California and holding that the documents are not official agency acts and therefore not subject to judicial notice. The judge grants the City's request for judicial notice of RJN Exs. C-F, citing Evidence Code ยง452(b).

The judge also addresses NWOO's claims regarding the City's duties under the Mills Act contract. NWOO argues that the City has a duty to inspect the Property every 5 years, but the judge holds that mandamus is not an appropriate remedy for enforcing a contractual obligation against an agency. The judge further holds that the City's duties in a Mills Act contract are public duties, and that breach of contract is an adequate remedy at law.

Finally, the judge notes that the parties argue mootness of the Jardinette claims, but declines to judicially notice the evidence supporting the City's argument and does not address the issue.
