And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is for a case between the City of Covina and Knox et al. On January 30, 2024, the Court held a status conference and hearing on the motion for attorney fees and issued a minute order directing the plaintiff to file an updated motion for attorney fees. The Court then continued the hearing on both motions to August 1, 2024, per the Receiver's request. On August 6, 2024, the Receiver filed a declaration requesting a 75-day continuance of the hearing, which the Court granted. The hearing is now scheduled for October 22, 2024. Due to the lack of a filing in connection with the first matter, the Court will not consider the motion for attorney's fees until then.
