v. Knox, et al.,
Case No. 19PSCV00195On January 30,
2024, the Court held a status conference and hearing on the motion for attorney
fees and issued a minute order that provides, in relevant part, as follows:

          “Court and Counsel confer regarding
the case status and status of Motion for Attorney
fees. Plaintiff is to file an updated Motion for Attorney Fees as to all
parties.

The new Motion
for Attorney’s Fees is to be scheduled on 4/18/2024 at 9:00 AM to be
heard with the Motion Re: Order Approving Receiver's Final Report and
Final Accounting. . .”
On April 18,
2024, the Court continued the hearing on both motions to August 1, 2024, per
the Receiver’s request; notice was waived. On June 11, 2024, the Court issued a
“Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order,” wherein the August 1, 2024
scheduled hearing was continued to August 8, 2024; notice was given to the Receiver
only.

On August 6,
2024, the Receiver filed a “Declaration Re The Receiver’s Final Report and
Final Accounting and Discharge Motion,” wherein he requested a 75-day
continuance of the August 8, 2024 hearing; that day, the Court issued a “Notice
Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order,” wherein the August 8, 2024 scheduled
hearing was continued to October 22, 2024; notice was given to counsel. On
August 6, 2024, the Receiver filed (and electronically served) a “Notice of
Continued Hearing on Motion of the Receiver Re the Receiver’s Final Report and
Final Accounting and Discharge Motion,” advising therein of the continued
October 22, 2024 hearing date.
The
following matters are scheduled for hearing on October 22, 2024 in this case:
(1) Hearing on Motion—Other Motion re Order Approving Receiver’s Final Report
and Final Accounting, Receiver’s Fees and Costs and Discharging Receiver and
(2) Hearing on Motion for Attorney’s Fees.
The
Court has not received any filing in connection with the first matter; as such,
it is premature to consider the motion for attorney’s fees. The Court will
inquire with the Receiver at the time of the hearing as to status.
