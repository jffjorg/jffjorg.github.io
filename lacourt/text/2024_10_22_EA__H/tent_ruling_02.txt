Plaintiff Cristian Joya’s unopposed Supplemental
Motion for an Order Compelling Responses to Interrogatories is GRANTED. E. Padilla, G. Padilla, and Royal are ordered
to provide responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories,
Set No. One within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling. Sanctions are

I.        Background 
Plaintiff
Cristian Joya (“Joya”) alleges as follows:
In 2014, Joya obtained a judgment against Jose M.U.
Calderon aka Jose Miguel Urbina Calderon (“Calderon”) in Case No. LAM13CM0168.
Sylvia Espinoza (“Espinoza”) is Calderon’s wife. On September 8, 2015, an
Abstract of Judgment (“Abstract”) was recorded against Calderon and Espinoza’s
property located at 16264 Doublegrove Avenue in La Puente
(the “Doublegrove Property”). In 2020, Calderon and Espinoza transferred their
interests in the Doublegrove Property to Edgar Padilla, Jr. (“E. Padilla”) and
Giovanny Padilla (“G. Padilla”) without satisfying the Abstract. 
On September
15, 2023, Joya filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against E.
Padilla, G. Padilla, Calderon, Espinoza and Does 1-25 for:
1.       Set Aside Voidable Transfers on the
Grounds of Actual Intent (Civil Code § 3439.04(a)(1)),
2.       Set Aside Voidable Transfers on the
Grounds of Inadequate Consideration (Civil Code § 3439.04(a)(2)), and
3.       Quiet Title. 
On January
4, 2024, Plaintiff filed an “Amendment to Complaint,” wherein Royal Pacific
Funding Corporation (“Royal”) was substituted in lieu of Doe 1. 
On January
17, 2024, Royal, E. Padilla, and G. Padilla filed a cross-complaint, asserting
causes of action against Joya and Roes 1-20 for:
1.       Declaratory Relief, and
2.       Equitable Subrogation. 
On March 1,
2024, Espinoza’s default was entered. On March 4, 2024, Calderon’s default was
entered. 
The Final
Status Conference is set for January 24, 2025. Trial is set for February 7,
2025.
II.      Legal Standard
 A response to interrogatories is due 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) “If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, . . . [t]he party propounding
the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).)
 
III.     Discussion
Plaintiff
moves the Court, per Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, for an order
compelling E. Padilla’s, G. Padilla’s, and Royal’s responses to Plaintiff’s
Form Interrogatories, Set No. One. Plaintiff also seeks sanctions in the amount
of $1,890.00 against E. Padilla, G. Padilla, Royal, and their attorney of
record.
A.       Filing Fees
At the outset, the Court notes that
Plaintiff’s motion improperly combines three separate motions into one,
including one motion to compel form interrogatories against E. Padilla, one
motion to compel form interrogatories against G. Padilla, and one motion to
compel form interrogatories against Royal. Plaintiff has only paid one filing
fee and reserved a hearing for one motion. This is improper. Plaintiff is
ordered to pay an additional $120.00 in filing fees at or before the time of
the hearing (i.e., $60.00 filing fee/motion, multiplied by 3, minus 1 filing
fee already paid).
Counsel for Plaintiff is admonished to
adhere to court filing and reservation guidelines in any future filings and to
file (and pay for) separate motions for each discovery vehicle at issue in the
future. Failure to do so may result in the motions being placed off calendar,
in the Court’s discretion.
          B.       Merits
In
support of Plaintiff’s motion, Plaintiff’s counsel David Chase (“Chase”)
represents as follows:

Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories, Set No. One on E. Padilla, G. Padilla, and Royal on March 14, 2024,
April 2, 2024, and May 17, 2024, respectively. (Chase Decl., ¶ 2, Exhs. 1-3[FN1].)
Although counsel for E. Padilla, G. Padilla, and Royal has asked for, and
received, extensions of time to provide responses to the aforesaid discovery,
all extensions of time have passed and no responses have been received. (Id.,
¶ 3.) 
The unopposed motion is granted. The Court orders E. Padilla, G. Padilla, and Royal to provide responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set No. One within 20 days from the date of the notice of
ruling.
C.       Sanctions 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions against E. Padilla, G. Padilla,
Royal, and their attorney of record in the
amount of $1,890.00 [calculated as follows: 3 hours preparing motion plus 3 hours
“through the date of the hearing” at $300.00/hour, plus $90.00 filing fee]. 
Utilizing
a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court
finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is
$630.00 (i.e., 1.5 hours attorney time at $300.00/hour, plus $180.00 filing
fees). Sanctions are payable within 30 days from the date of the notice of
ruling.
