And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions: (1) a motion to be relieved as counsel for defendants Thomas Kim and Global Lien Services, which is granted, and (2) a motion for attorney fees by plaintiffs Young Sook Kim and Boo Kon Kim, which is denied.

The motion for attorney fees is based on a contractual fee provision in a Promissory Note Secured by Deed of Trust, which provides that the prevailing party is entitled to attorneys' fees and court costs. However, the Court finds that the provision does not apply in this case because neither side brought a cause of action arising from the Promissory Note, and the Note is ancillary to this action. The Court also finds that the reciprocity rule, which applies when a nonsignatory party is liable for attorney fees, does not apply in this case because neither side sued for any cause of action or defense arising from the Promissory Note.
