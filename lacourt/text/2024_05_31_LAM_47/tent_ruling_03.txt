STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for employment discrimination and negligence that was
filed on September 15, 2022. Plaintiff, by and through unnamed successors in
interest, alleges that Defendant allowed Los Angeles Police Department officer
Adam Mezquita to be exposed to various carcinogens, resulting in his sudden
death from leukemia in September 2019.
 
Defendant the City of Los Angeles moves
to dismiss the action following Plaintiff’s failure to amend the Complaint. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant the City of Los Angeles moves
to dismiss the action following Plaintiff’s failure to amend the Complaint. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
581(f) provides that the Court “may dismiss the complaint as to that defendant
when . . . (2) [e]xcept where section 597 [concerning pleas in abatement]
applies, after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend,
the plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by the court and either
party moves for dismissal.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 581(f).) 
 
On September 18, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the
Complaint on all causes of action and granted leave to amend within 30 days after
the date of that hearing. (September 18, 2023 Minute Order.) The Court
sustained Defendant’s demurrer on the basis that Plaintiff did not allege
exhaustion of administrative remedies and brought a common law tort claim
against an entity with governmental immunity, not on the basis of any plea in
abatement. (Id.) To date, no amended Complaint has been filed. Defendant
is therefore entitled to an order dismissing the action.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss is GRANTED.
 
Dismissal is entered with prejudice
this date. 
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
