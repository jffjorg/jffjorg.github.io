And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling in the case of Walker et al. v. Avalonbay, et al. addresses a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant. The defendant's proof of service states that electronic service was made, but the court's record does not reflect any manifestation of express consent to electronic service. The court notes that the parties have corresponded extensively via email, but this does not override the statutory notice protections for self-represented litigants. The court is concerned that the plaintiff may not have received actual notice of the motion, and therefore continues the hearing to a date in June to allow the moving papers to be mailed and provide the plaintiff with an opportunity to respond.
