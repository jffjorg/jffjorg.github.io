  Case Number:  21STCV03253    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  47 21STCV03253 Walker et al v. Avalonbay, et al. TentativeDefendants move for judgment on the
pleadings pursuant to the Court’s April 26, 2024 Minute Order. However,
although Defendant’s proof of service for this motion states that service was
made electronically, nothing in the Court’s record reflects any manifestation
of express consent to electronic service on Plaintiffs as required by Code of
Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(2)(A). Although the Court is aware that the
parties have corresponded extensively via e-mail through the course of this
proceeding, that pattern cannot override the statutory notice protections for
self-represented litigants. These protections are especially critical in the
context of a potentially dispositive motion, such as a motion for judgment on
the pleadings. Further, the lack of response from Plaintiffs, who historically
have seldom failed to respond to Defendant’s filings when notice was properly
given, suggests to the Court that actual notice may not have been received in
this instance. As the pending motion could potentially dispose of some or all
of Plaintiffs’ claims in advance of the July 9, 2024 trial date, the Court
thinks it best to continue the hearing to a date in June to allow the moving
papers to be mailed and provide Plaintiffs with actual notice of the motion and
an opportunity to oppose or otherwise respond to the motion.  IT IS SO ORDERED. Dated:  May 31, 2024                         ___________________________________                                                                                    Theresa M.

All interested parties must be copied on the email. It should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
