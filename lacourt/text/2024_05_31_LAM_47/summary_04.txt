And here is a written summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Andreas Kratky, et al. v. Downtown Prime, LLC, et al. (BC682898). The case involves a breach of lease action and a fraud and breach of lease filed by the plaintiff, Jenna King, and nine other individuals against the defendants, Downtown Prime, LLC, and others. The parties entered into a short form settlement agreement, which was later disputed by the plaintiff, Jenna King. The court granted the defendants' motion to enforce the settlement and entered judgment on July 20, 2020.

The plaintiff, Jenna King, has now moved for an order enforcing the settlement agreement to pay her $63,030 from the settlement funds of $99,000, with the remainder to be interpleaded with the court. The defendants, joined by Scottsdale Insurance Company, have moved for an order permitting them to interplead the settlement funds with the court and be discharged from liability. The court has granted the defendants' motion and ordered the defendants and intervenor to deposit the balance of the settlement funds totaling $99,000 with the court. Upon confirmation that the funds have been deposited with the court, the defendants and intervenor will be discharged from all liability with respect to those funds and thereafter dismissed with prejudice.

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement, finding that the dispute between the plaintiff and BASTA regarding the proper amount owed to BASTA for services rendered is unresolved. The court has also permitted Scottsdale Insurance Company to intervene and join the defendants' motion for interpleader and discharge of liability.
