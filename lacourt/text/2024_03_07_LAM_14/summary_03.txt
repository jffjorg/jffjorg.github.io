And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Baltzer v. Equity Residential Management. The plaintiff, Baltzer, alleged that the defendant, Equity Residential Management, violated the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA) by performing a credit check on Baltzer without providing the results of the investigation. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendant, Transunion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc., was involved in the violation.

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by the defendant, Equity Residential Management, with respect to the second and third causes of action, which alleged invasion of privacy and declaratory relief. The judge found that the plaintiff had not properly pled a common law claim for invasion of privacy and that the declaratory relief claim was not ripe for adjudication.

The judge has also sustained the demurrer filed by the defendant, Transunion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc., with respect to the entire complaint. The judge found that the complaint did not contain sufficient allegations to support any claim against Transunion.

The judge has denied the motion to strike filed by the defendant, Equity Residential Management, with respect to the request for punitive damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief. The judge found that the request for declaratory relief was not ripe for adjudication and that the request for injunctive relief was not supported by the pleadings.

The judge has taken off calendar the motion to strike filed by the defendant, Transunion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc., as it was made moot by the ruling on the demurrers.

The judge has ordered the parties to amend their pleadings to comply with the ruling on the demurrers and to provide additional allegations to support their claims.
