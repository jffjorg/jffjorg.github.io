As for the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Plaintiff, CW Owner, to compel the Defendant, Masitbi, LLC, and others, to provide further responses to Form Interrogatories. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants rented space from them in Michigan but failed to pay rent. The motion is denied as moot because the Defendants have already provided further responses. The Judge also denies the request for sanctions of $5,461.25. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff failed to file exhibits referenced in their moving papers and that the two form emails sent by the Plaintiff's counsel were not a proper attempt to meet and confer. The Judge also criticizes the Defendants for including improper "Preliminary Statements" and "General Objections" in their responses, which can cause confusion and make it difficult to determine what information is being withheld. The Judge concludes that given the deficiencies and misunderstandings on both sides, the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
