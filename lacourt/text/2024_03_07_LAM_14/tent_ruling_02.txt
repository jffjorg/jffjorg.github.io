(1)        Aanestad Motion
 
Attorney Haley K. Aanestad (“Aanestad”)
now seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Jane CV Doe. 

Decision
 
            The motion
is GRANTED, effective upon the filing
of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. 
 
Governing Rule
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 requires that counsel fill out forms MC-051, MC-052,
and MC-053. These forms serve two basic functions: (1) ensuring that notice is
given to the client and (2) providing the court with an adequate explanation of
why the matter is being handled via motion rather than mutual consent. See Code
of Civil Procedure § 284; California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362.
 
Discussion
 
            Counsel Aanestad
has completed the required forms. Those forms indicate that the client has been
served by mail at the most recent address counsel can find by way of an
internet records search and contact with third parties. 
 
            Counsel Aanestad
indicates that she and her firm wish to withdraw because the client will no
longer communicate with her.
 
            Counsel has
complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1362, and relief is appropriate under
the circumstances of this case. The motion is GRANTED, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed
order upon the client.
 
(2)        Moore
Motion
 
Attorney Thomas M. Moore (“Moore”) now
seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Jane CV Doe. 
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is DENIED, without prejudice. 
 
Governing Rule
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 requires that counsel fill out forms MC-051, MC-052,
and MC-053. These forms serve two basic functions: (1) ensuring that notice is
given to the client and (2) providing the court with an adequate explanation of
why the matter is being handled via motion rather than mutual consent. See Code
of Civil Procedure § 284; California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362.
 
Discussion
 
            Counsel Moore
has not completed the required forms. He must execute his own version of form
MC-052. Ms. Aanestad’s cannot serve for both.
