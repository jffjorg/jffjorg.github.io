And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding two motions to withdraw as counsel for the plaintiff, Jane ES Doe, in a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Unified School District, Robert Pimental, Irene Hinojosa, and DOES 1-100. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants were negligent in allowing a teacher to sexually abuse students for a period of 10 years between 2002 and 2012, despite multiple complaints lodged with the schools' principal.

The first motion to withdraw is granted, as counsel Haley K. Aanestad has complied with the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 and has served the client with notice of the motion. The client has been served by mail at the most recent address counsel can find through an internet records search and contact with third parties. Counsel Aanestad and her firm wish to withdraw because the client will no longer communicate with her.

The second motion to withdraw is denied, without prejudice, as counsel Thomas M. Moore has not completed the required forms and must execute his own version of form MC-052.
