And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on plaintiff Deandra Aguiar's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The motion was filed due to defendant FCA US LLC's lack of response to requests for production Nos. 16-21. Defendant has since served supplemental responses, which the Judge has considered. The Judge has determined that defendant's responses to Nos. 16, 17, 18, and 21 are valid representations of inability to comply with the requests. These responses include a diligent search and reasonable inquiry, and state that no responsive documents exist or have ever existed.

The Judge has also considered the supplemental responses to Nos. 19 and 20, which were initially objected to by defendant. The Judge has sustained defendant's objections to these requests, as they do not reasonably particularize the documents being sought. The Judge has denied plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production, as defendant has properly objected to the requests and has provided valid statements of partial compliance.
