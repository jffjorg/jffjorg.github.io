And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties in the case. The motions at issue are LAUSD's motions in limine No. 1, which seek to exclude evidence of alleged sexual abuse by David Lee Scott against people other than the two plaintiffs, and plaintiffs' motion to consolidate their two actions for trial.

The judge has denied LAUSD's motions in limine, finding that the evidence of alleged sexual abuse by David Lee Scott is relevant to the issues of the entities' knowledge about him and the entities' liability for negligent hiring, retention, or supervision. The judge has also denied plaintiffs' motion to consolidate their actions, finding that the evidence admissible in one trial may not be admissible in the other trial and would be unduly prejudicial.

The judge has also addressed defendant's argument that the revival of causes of action previously barred by the claim presentation deadline constitutes a gift of public funds, finding that the statute was enacted for a public purpose and is constitutional.

Finally, the judge has denied defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the complaint meets the applicable pleading requirements.
