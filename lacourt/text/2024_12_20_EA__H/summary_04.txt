And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the distribution of funds in a labor dispute. The dispute involves a settlement agreement between a plaintiff and a defendant, which was amended on July 1, 2024. The judge has determined that the pre-amendment version of Labor Code § 2699 applies, which requires a 65% distribution of funds to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA). The judge has also noted that the settlement agreement contains an escalator clause, which will increase the General Settlement Amount (GSA) if the number of pay periods exceeds 4,437. The judge has estimated that the number of pay periods is 4,034, but has noted that this figure is an estimate and actual worked pay periods may be lower. The judge has also ordered the defendant to pay $11,737.70 in costs incurred by the plaintiff's counsel. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after consideration of further evidence and arguments at the upcoming hearing.
