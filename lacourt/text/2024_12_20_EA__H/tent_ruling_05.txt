v. Hon, Case No. KC068890


TENTATIVE RULING ON DISTRIBUTION OF PROPERTY
PROCEEDS


 I.       Background 
This is a partition case that has been pending for several
years involving the property located at 1446 Cabinda Drive in Hacienda Heights
(the “subject property”). In August 2020, following trial, Judge Gloria
White-Brown determined that Plaintiff Herman Yee (“Plaintiff” or “Yee”) was
entitled to partition of the subject property and directed Plaintiff’s counsel
to prepare and submit an Interlocutory Order wherein Plaintiff has a 50%
interest in the subject property and Defendants Ann Hon (“Hon”) and Charles Lai
(“Lai”) (collectively “Defendants”) shared a 50% interest. The court further
ordered partition of the subject property and directed the property to be
listed for sale on or before November 2, 2020.
In
the Interlocutory Judgment, Judge White-Brown ordered that “[a]fter the sales,
the referee shall report back to the Court, at which time this Court shall take
up the issue of determining apportionment, off-sets, credits, costs and issue a
final judgment in this case.” 
On
December 1, 2020, Judge White-Brown appointed Matthew L. Taylor (“Taylor”) as
Referee and instructed him to list the subject property for sale as soon as
possible. The sale was delayed due to, among other things, prolonged litigation
regarding liens on the subject property. 
On
July 18, 2024, a “Stipulation and Order Confirming Sale of Real Property by
Partition Referee” was entered. 
The
case was transferred to this Court on August 5, 2024. On September 20, 2024,
the Court held a Status Conference Re: Sale of Property and set a briefing
schedule for the parties to address the appropriate distribution of the sale
proceeds. At that time, the Court set a further Status Conference Re: Sale of
Subject Property for December 20, 2024. 
On
November 26, 2024, Taylor filed a “Notice of Completion of Sale of Real
Property,” confirming that the sale had been completed.
 
II.      Discussion 
As
noted above, on September 20, 2024, the instant action came on calendar for a
Status Conference Re: Sale of Subject Property; at that time, the Court
continued the Status Conference to December 20, 2024 and set a briefing
schedule as follows: opening briefs due by November 8, 2024 and responsive
briefs due by December 6, 2024.
Since
September 20, 2024, the parties have filed or submitted the following papers:
·      
November 8, 2024: “Amended Opening
Brief[FN1] of Defendants Ann Hon and Charles Lai Regarding the
Partition Accounting of Credits and to Establish the Purchase Price with
Attached Exhibits; and Request for Fees and Costs” (“Amended Opening Brief”);
·      
November 12, 2024: Plaintiff Herman
Yee’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds
from Sale of Real Property,” “Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support
of Plaintiff Herman Yee’s Motion for Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds
from Sale of Real Property,” “Declaration of Vladie P. Viltman in Support of
Plaintiff Herman Yee’s Motion for Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds from
Sale of Real Property,” “Declaration of Brian E. Soriano in Support of
Plaintiff Herman Yee’s Motion for Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds from
Sale of Real Property,”[FN2]
·      
November 14, 2024: “Opening Brief Re
Plaintiff Herman Yee’s Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds from Sale of
Real Property,” “Declaration of Vladie P. Viltman in Support of Opening Brief
Re Plaintiff Herman Yee’s Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds from Sale of
Real Property,” “Supplemental Declaration of Vladie P. Viltman in Support of
Opening Brief Re Plaintiff Herman Yee’s Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds
from Sale of Real Property” and “Declaration of Brian E. Soriano in Support of
Opening Brief Re Plaintiff Herman Yee’s Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds
from Sale of Real Property;”
·      
December 6, 2024: “Defendants’
Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds
from Sale of Real Property; Declaration of Julia Sylva in Support Thereof;” and “Responsive Brief Re Plaintiff Herman
Yee’s Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds from Sale of Real Property” and
“Supplemental Declaration of Brian E. Soriano in Support of Responsive Brief Re
Plaintiff Herman Yee’s Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds from Sale of
Real Property;”
·      
December 13, 2024: “Plaintiff’s
Sur-Reply Brief to Defendants’ Opposition to his Opening Brief Re Accounting
and Distribution of Proceeds from Sale of Real Property” and “Supplemental
Declaration of Vladie P. Viltman in Support of Plaintiff’s Sur-Reply Brief to
Defendants’ Opposition to his Opening Brief Re Accounting and Distribution of
Proceeds from Sale of Real Property;” and
·      
December 16, 2024: “Defendants’
Sur-Reply Brief to Plaintiff’s Sur-Reply Brief to Defendant’s Opposition to his
Opening Brief Re Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds from Sale of Real
Property; Declarations of Ann Hon and Julia Sylva in Support Thereof.”
The
Court declines to consider the parties’ December 13, 2024 and December 16, 2024
filings, as “sur-reply” and “sur-reply to sur-reply” briefs are not
contemplated by Code, nor were they permitted by the Court’s September 20, 2024
order.
The
Court also declines to consider Plaintiff’s November 14, 2024 Opening Brief on
the basis that Plaintiff had already provided courtesy copies of his “Motion
for Accounting and Distribution of Proceeds from Sale of Real Property” (the “Motion”)
to the Court on November 12, 2024 and electronically served the Motion on
Defendants on November 8, 2024. Further, Defendants’ opposition filed December
6, 2024 is directed to Plaintiff’s Motion. The Court construes the Motion as
Plaintiff’s Opening Brief.
Counsel
for Plaintiff is directed to file the Motion forthwith, without any alteration,
for the purpose of ensuring that the Court’s docket is complete.
 
Merits
On
September 10, 2020, an Interlocutory Judgment was entered, which ordered,
adjudged and decreed, in relevant part, that Plaintiff held an undivided 50%
ownership interest in the subject property, that Defendants each held an
undivided 25% ownership interest in the subject property, that Defendants were
tenants in common, that there were no other owners of the subject property, and
that the subject property would be partitioned by sale. (Soriano Decl. dated
Nov. 8, 2024 [“11/8/24 Soriano Decl.”], ¶ 4, Exh. B; Defendants’ Amended
Opening Brief [“AOB”], Exh. 1.) The Interlocutory Judgment further provided
that, in the event the parties were unable to agree upon a proposed referee, the
Court would appoint a referee to sell the subject property “at the best price
possible” and that “[a]fter the sales, the referee [would] report back to the
Court, at which time this Court [would] take up the issue of determining
apportionment, off-sets, credits, costs and issue a final judgment in this
case.” (Id.)
On
December 1, 2020, Judge Gloria White-Brown (Ret.) appointed Matthew L. Taylor
as referee. (11/8/24 Soriano Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. C.) 
On
July 18, 2024, a “Stipulation and Order Confirming Sale of Real Property by
Partition Referee” (“July 18, 2024 Order”) was entered, wherein Judge Peter A.
Hernandez approved and confirmed the proposed sale of the subject property to
Defendants for the purchase price of $1,050,000.00. (11/8/24 Soriano Decl., ¶
9, Exh. G, Page 11, ¶ 1). The July 18, 2024 Order further provided, in relevant
part, as follows: 
“4.
For the Proposed Sale, the following provisions apply: . . . 
ii.
The Partition Referee shall cause escrow to pay the following costs or claims
directly from the proceeds of the sale and prior to the close of escrow: (a)
any unpaid real property taxes relating to the Subject Property prorated as of
the date of close of escrow; (b) any costs of sale including costs associated
with the purchase of a policy of title insurance for the sale; (c) sales
commissions owed to real estate brokers or agents involved with the sale of the
Subject Property as set forth herein; (d) any normal and customary charges
associated with the sale of real property; including real estate commissions,
escrow fees, title insurance costs, recording fees, messenger fees, property
taxes, and the like; (e) any involuntary liens (such as tax or judgment liens)
owed by the record owners of the Subject Property; (f) voluntary liens (such as
deeds of trust) encumbering the Subject Property as described herein. . . . 
7.
The Partition Referee shall take possession from escrow of the net proceeds
(after payment of any costs of sale in accordance with the listing agreement
and the sale contract signed by the Partition Referee and any payments
authorized by this order) of any sale of the Subject Property and shall deposit
the net proceeds into an interest-bearing account for the benefit of the
Parties, subject to further Court Order. 
8.
To the extent that any involuntary liens (such as deeds of trust, tax liens or
judgment liens) are paid through the escrow of the Subject Property and not
expressly provided for herein, the Party indebted for said liens shall be
charged with full payment of any such lien and said Party’s share of the net
proceeds from the sale of the Subject Property shall be reduced accordingly.
Plaintiff Herman Yee’s net proceeds from the sale of the Subject Property shall
be reduced by payments required to pay the following liens and deeds of trust:
the Betsy Eng DOT; the Arnold Yee DOT; the Gon DOT; and the Yee-FTB DOT. 
9.
After payment of all costs, expenses, and disbursements authorized by this
Order and by any prior Court Orders in this action, the Partition Referee shall
deposit the net proceeds of the sale of the Subject Property into an
interest-bearing account for the benefit of the Parties, until further Order of
this Court. . . 
15.
The Court hereby approves total real estate commissions in the amount of 2% of
the purchase price, or $21,000. . . 
17.
The escrow officer is directed to pay from the sales proceeds of the Subject
Property the following amounts of money to fully-resolve the following Deeds of
Trust recorded against the Subject Property: a. Betsy Eng DOT - $45,000.00 (no
interest) b. Arnold Yee DOT - $7,000.00 (no interest) c. Gon DOT - $70,000 (no
interest) d. Yee-FTB DOT - $ 2,089.26 (plus interest and penalties demanded by
the Franchise Tax Board) . . .”
Escrow
on the subject property apparently closed on November 26, 2024. (Defendants’
Dec. 6, 2024 Opp., 9:22).
“The
court may, in all cases, order allowance, contribution, or other compensatory
adjustment among the parties according to the principles of equity.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 872.140.) “Every partition action includes a final accounting
according to the principles of equity for both charges and credits upon each
cotenant’s interest. Credits include expenditures in excess of the cotenant’s
fractional share for necessary repairs, improvements that enhance the value of
the property, taxes, payments of principal and interest on mortgages, and other
liens, insurance for the common benefit, and protection and preservation of
title.” (Wallace v. Daley (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1035-1036.) 
Defendants
take the position that “[s]ince at least 2007, [they] have spent over $500,000[FN3] on
the maintenance of the [subject] property (Exhibit 5) and they have paid in
excess of $460,000 in attorney’s fees and costs.” (AOB, 2:23-26.) 
Defendants
further assert that Plaintiff is not entitled to reimbursement or an offset in
the form of rent for the subject property: “[I]n the absence of third party
tenants, an ouster, or an agreement, a CoTIP [i.e., “cotenant in possession”]
is not entitled to rent or other reimbursement for a CoTIP’s exclusive use and
possession, because each cotenant is entitled to occupy all of the common
property.” (In re Fazzio (1995) 180 B.R. 263, 269, citing Pico v.
Columbet (1859) 12 Cal. 414, 420). Indeed, Judge White-Brown specifically
remarked, “[t]he Court does not find . . . that defendants wrongfully denied
Herman Yee the benefit of living at the [subject] property since 2007. The
court finds that Yee left [the subject property] on his own volition and has
not attempted to return.” (11/8/24 Soriano Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. A, 10:23-25.) 
Defendants
propose that, out of the $845,273.00 in funds on deposit (See Supp. Soriano
Decl. filed Dec. 6, 2024, ¶ 3, Exh. A), they be credited with $535,344.20, that
Plaintiff’s interest be debited $164,119.90 for liens identified in the July
18, 2024 Order, that estimated fees of $50,000.00 for the partition referee be
split between Plaintiff and Defendants, and that the estimated $95,808.90 net
proceeds be split in half between Plaintiff and Defendants for payment of
attorney’s fees. 
The
Court’s issue with Defendants’ position regarding reimbursement for
expenditures made for the subject property, however, is that it is not
supported by any admissible evidence. None of Defendants’ exhibits attached to
the AOB have been authenticated. The identity of the individual(s) who prepared
Exhibit 5 is unclear. Further, Exhibit 5 appears to be an itemization of
purported expenses paid by Defendants on the subject property, unsupported by
any actual mortgage or bank statements, tax records, receipts, or other
documentation. The Court queries why such documentation was not furnished;
Defendants have had ample time to procure supporting documentation, as this
case has been pending since 2016. It is also unclear to the Court why
Defendants believe they would be entitled to reimbursement for expenses on the
subject property such as water, gas, electric, and internet. The Court
disregards Exhibit 5. 
Plaintiff
asserts that he is entitled to offset Defendants’ request for reimbursement of
expenditures made for the subject property by the reasonable value of
Defendants’ use. (Hunter v. Schultz (1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 24, 31.) The
Court need not entertain any such offset request because Defendants’ request
for reimbursement is declined as stated above.
Plaintiff
has provided Defendants and the Court with a proposed distribution attached as
Exhibit F to Soriano’s Supplemental Declaration filed December 6, 2024. The
proposed distribution reflects total proceeds of $1,050,583.84, minus
$41,190.94 in costs shared between the parties, resulting in a $504,696.45
subtotal of proceeds to Plaintiff and $504,696.45 subtotal of proceeds to
Defendants. The proposed distribution further identifies debits of $164,119.90
to Plaintiff, resulting in a calculation of $340,576.55 for Plaintiff’s
proceeds less debits. The proposed distribution identifies proposed debits of
$340,969.23 to Defendants (including estimated
partition referee fees of $30,000.00 and payment of Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees
in the amount of $310,969.23), resulting in a calculation of $340,576.55 for
Plaintiff’s proceeds less debits. 
The
Court is inclined, at this juncture, to adopt Plaintiff’s proposed
distribution, up until his proposed debit of $340,969.23 to Defendants. The
Court agrees that referee fees should be split equally between Plaintiff and
Defendants but declines to speculate at this juncture the amount of fees Mr.
Taylor will be requesting, absent the benefit of a noticed motion. The Court
also declines to rule on the issue of attorney’s fees absent a noticed motion.
The Court is inclined to order that the monies remaining, up until Plaintiff’s
proposed debit of $340,969.23 to Defendants, be held on deposit in an
interest-bearing account for the benefit of the parties (as set forth in
Paragraphs 7 and 9 of the July 18, 2024 Order) for a maximum period of 60 days,
until the respective receiver’s fees and attorney’s fees motions are
determined. 
The
Court will hear further from the parties at the time of the hearing.
