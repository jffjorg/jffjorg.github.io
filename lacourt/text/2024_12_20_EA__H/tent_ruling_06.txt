[FN1] The Amended Opening Brief supersedes
the “Opening Brief of Defendants Ann Hon and Charles Lai Regarding the
Partition Accounting of Credits and to Establish the Purchase Price with
Attached Exhibits; and Request for Fees and Costs” filed earlier that same
date.



[FN2] These documents are dated
November 8, 2024. While the Court is in receipt of courtesy copies of these
documents, it does not appear that these documents were actually filed, as they
are not reflected on the Court’s docket. 


[FN3] Defendants subsequently specify
that this figure, which “include[es], but [is] not limited to, mortgage
payments, taxes, insurance and upkeep[,]” is actually “exceeding $535,344.85”
and is comprised of “[e]xpenses [p]aid by Hon 1997 to 2024.” (AOB, 4:11-14.)
