v. Freevolt USA, Inc., Case No. 22PSCV01097


ORDER ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION
Plaintiff Weidong Zang’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
Plaintiff Weidong Zang (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: 
          On February 19, 2020, Plaintiff and
Defendant Freevolt USA, Inc. (“Defendant”) entered into a contract wherein
Defendant agreed to install a 25.5 KW solar photovoltaic system (85 solar
panels system) at Plaintiff’s property located at 14736 Valley Blvd., La
Puente, CA 91746 (“Project”) in exchange for payment. Defendant guaranteed to
complete the Project within 3 months, or would compensate Plaintiff's
electricity bills for any delays up to $2,000 per month. Plaintiff followed
Defendant’s directions and completed a loan application for $100,000 to cover
the expenses of the Project (“Loan”), and paid Defendant $2,000 as a deposit.
The loan was later approved, and Defendant received $90,000 from proceeds of
the loan (the remaining $10,000 of the loan proceeds was on hold for the reason
of incompletion of the Project). Plaintiff made payments for the Loan from
April of 2020-present. Defendant never started the Project after entering into
the contract.
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint,
asserting a breach of contract cause of action against Defendant and Does 1-25.
On January 30, 2023, Defendant’s default was entered.
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s application for default
judgment.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted:
          1.       Paragraph
2(a) of Judicial Council form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment lists
the “Demand of complaint” as $157,346.75, which coincides with the amounts identified
in the prayer of Plaintiff’s complaint, minus the $500.00 court costs
identified in Paragraph 12(vii) therein (court costs are separately identified
in Paragraph 2(d) of CIV-100). Paragraph 12(vi) of the prayer in Plaintiff’s
complaint seeks $1,000.00 in legal fees “to demand the completion of the
Project (Attorney letters).” Plaintiff has failed to identify any entitlement to
attorney’s fees.
          2.       The
Purchase and Installation Agreement attached as Exhibit 1 to Plaintiff’s declaration
filed November 22, 2024 does not appear to be the same Purchase and
Installation Agreement attached as Exhibit 1 to Plaintiff’s declaration filed
July 11, 2024. Exhibit A, Attachment 1 to Plaintiff’s complaint appears to
contain two versions of the Purchase and Installation Agreement, one with a
handwritten notation on the right-hand side reading, “ELN $100,000.00 + check
$15,400.00” and the other appearing to read “ELN 12 years.” Plaintiff is directed
to explain why these agreements are different.
          3.       The
monetary amounts identified in Paragraphs 9-11 of Plaintiff’s Declaration
(i.e., $35,970.37, plus $2,000.00, plus $84,263.75, plus $24,112.63) total $146,346.75,
not $157,346.75 as requested. Plaintiff is requested to reconcile this
discrepancy.
          4.       Plaintiff
incorrectly lists the “6/16/2020” billing statement as $1,193.43. It is actually
$1,139.43.
          5.       Plaintiff
fails to attach any documentary evidence in support of his statement in
Paragraph 3 of his declaration that “Defendant received $90,000 of the loan
proceeds to complete the Project.”
The
Court instructs Plaintiff to comply with California Rules of Court rule 3.1800
in any future default prove up application. Any subsequent default prove-up
application must be full and complete and not refer back to any previously
submitted documents.
