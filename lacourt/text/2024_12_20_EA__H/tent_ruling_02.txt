 Case Number:  23PSCV01611    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  H Granvista  Construction Corporation v. JM Creative Investments LLC, et al.,    Case No. 23PSCV01611   ORDER ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION Plaintiff Granvista Construction  Corporation’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.   Background Plaintiff  Granvista  Construction Corporation (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:           On May 16, 2022, Plaintiff entered  into a written agreement with JM Creative Investments LLC (“JM Creative”), Alan  Robertson (“Robertson”), Peninsula Retail Partners V LLC (“Peninsula”), Brett  Del Valle (“Del Valle”), and NES Investment LLC (“NES”), wherein Plaintiff  agreed to perform various tenant improvement work at the property located at  2200 S. Azusa Avenue in West Covina (“property”) in exchange for $346,399.00.  Additional change orders were issued with the work Plaintiff performed.  Plaintiff is still owed $25,919.18. On  June 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, asserting causes of  action against JM Creative, Roberston, Peninsula, Del Valle, NES, Ploutos Inc.  (“Ploutos”), and Does 1-20 for: (1) breach of contract, (2) common counts, (3)  unjust enrichment, and (4) quantum meruit. On  August 22, 2023, NES’s default was entered. On October 31, 2023, Plaintiff  dismissed “all Defendants other than NES INVESTMENTS LLC,” without prejudice. Pending  before the Court is Plaintiff’s application for default judgment.   Discussion Plaintiff’s  Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The  following defects are noted: The  Court is in receipt of, and has reviewed, Plaintiff’s Second Supplemental  Submission in Support of Request for Judgment; Declaration of Alvaro Garcia in  Support of the Request for Entry of Default Judgment” filed October 9, 2024. The  Court agrees that the amounts set forth in the three contracts total $352,739.00,  that the amounts set forth in the change orders total $70,805.48, and that  these amounts together equal $423,544.48. Plaintiff indicates that a $6,000.00  “HVAC Credit” was given, for a total balance of $417,544.48. The Court,  however, upon further review of Alvaro Garcia’s (“Garica”) declaration filed  August 21, 2024, is unclear as to how the balance of $25,918.55 was calculated.  Garcia attests that total payments of $391,625.93 were made, via a $70,547.80  “1st Payment,” a $190,649.50 “2nd Payment,” and a  $130,428.63 “3rd Payment.” Plaintiff, however, has only attached a  copy of a cancelled check for $60,428.63 and two wire transfers (i.e., one for  $70,547.80 and a second for $190,649.50). The  Court requests that Plaintiff provide a statement of account, to the extent one  exists, and/or an explanation as to how the $25,918.55 balance was calculated. The  Court advises Plaintiff that any subsequent default prove-up application must  be full and complete in and of itself. The Court will not accept any further  piecemeal submissions.
