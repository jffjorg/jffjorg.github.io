[FN1] Labor Code § 2699 was recently
amended on July 1, 2024. Subdivision (m) now provides for a distribution of 65%
(rather than a 75% distribution) paid to the LWDA. The Court cites to the pre-amendment
version of the statute, which applies herein based on the pre-amendment filing
date of the initial complaint and related administrative exhaustion letter.
(See Lab. Code § 2699(v) [“(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amendments made
to this section by the act adding this subdivision shall apply to a civil
action brought on or after June 19, 2024. (2) The amendments made to this
section by the act adding this subdivision shall not apply to a civil action
with respect to which the notice required by subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1)
of subdivision (a), paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), or subparagraph (A)
of paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 2699.3 was filed before June 19,
2024.” 


[FN2] The Agreement is attached as
Exhibit 1 to the Corrected Declaration of Nicole Barvie (“Barvie Decl.”). Unless
otherwise noted, citations herein are to provisions of the Agreement.



[FN3] Any unapproved amounts revert
to the Net Settlement Amount. (Agreement, Section 3, ¶ 3.2.2.3).


[FN4] This figure does not exclude
pay periods which an Aggrieved Employee did not work during an entire pay
period; as such, this figure is an estimate and actual worked pay periods are
believed to be lower than 4,034. (Barvie Decl., ¶ 21, fn. 5.)



[FN5] The Agreement contains an
escalator clause which provides that if the number of pay periods ends up
exceeding 4,034 pay periods by 10% or more, then Defendant must increase the
GSA to account for the pay periods exceeding 4,437 or, alternatively, at Defendants’
election, exclude from the PAGA Period any pay period after reaching 4,437 pay
periods. (Agreement, Section 8, ¶ 8.2.)



[FN6] Castro’s counsel incurred
$11,737.70 in costs as of the motion filing date. (Barvie Decl., ¶ 39).
