And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Granvista Construction Corporation, has applied for a default judgment against the defendants, JM Creative Investments LLC, et al. However, the court has denied the application without prejudice due to several defects. The court has reviewed the plaintiff's submissions, including a declaration by Alvaro Garcia, and has noted several issues. The court is unclear about how the remaining balance of $25,918.55 was calculated and is requesting that the plaintiff provide a statement of account or an explanation for the calculation. The court advises the plaintiff that any subsequent default prove-up application must be full and complete in and of itself, and will not accept further piecemeal submissions.
