 Case Number:  24PSCV00758    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  H Castro
v. Pomona Valley Mining Co., Case No. 24PSCV00758


ORDER ON PAGA SETTLEMENT


Plaintiff
Alma Castro’s, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, Motion
to Approve PAGA Settlement is GRANTED.
 
I.        Background 
Plaintiff
Alma Castro, individually and on behalf of all persons similarly situated (“Plaintiff”
or “Castro”), alleges that Pomona Valley Mining Co. (“Defendant”) denied its
non-exempt employees minimum and overtime pay and meal and rest periods and
committed other Labor Code wage and hour violations. 
On
March 12, 2024, Castro filed a Representative Action Complaint, asserting a
cause of action against Defendant and Does 1-50 for civil penalties pursuant to
Labor Code § 2699, et seq. for violations of Labor Code §§ 201, 202, 203, 204
et seq., 210, 218, 221, 351, 510, 512, 558, 1194, 1197, 1197.1, 1198, 2800,
2802 and the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 11040,
Subdivision 5(A)-(B). 
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s motion to approve the Private Attorneys General
Act (“PAGA”) settlement agreement.

II.      Legal Standard
Labor
Code § 2699, subdivision (l)(2) states: “The superior court shall review and
approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part [Labor
Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”)].  The proposed settlement shall be submitted to
the [Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”)] at the same time that it
is submitted to the court.”[FN1] 
Any
settlement of any civil action filed under PAGA must be “fair and adequate in
view of the purposes and policies of the statute.”  (O’Connor
v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2016) 201 F.Supp.3d 1110, 1135.)

Seventy-five percent of all PAGA
penalties must be paid to the LWDA. (Lab. Code § 2699(i).) Further, reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs are awarded to a prevailing employee. (Lab. Code §
2699(g)(1).)

 
III.     Discussion
Plaintiff
requests entry of an order granting of the parties’ “Private Attorneys General
Act (PAGA) Settlement Agreement and Release” (the “Agreement”). 
 
Terms of the Settlement Agreement
The
essential terms of the Agreement[FN2] are as follows:
Definition of Aggrieved Employees: “Aggrieved Employee(s)” or “PAGA Group Members” means “all
persons within the State of California who are or were employed by [Defendant]
as hourly paid non-exempt employees during any portion of the PAGA Period”
(Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.4).
Definition of PAGA Period: “PAGA Period” means “the period from January 2, 2023 to
September 6, 2024.” (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.22; Barvie Decl., ¶ 18.)
Definition of PAGA Pay Period: “PAGA Pay Periods” means “pay period during which an Aggrieved
Employee worked for [Defendant] for at least one day during the PAGA Period.”
(Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.23.)
Definition of Gross Settlement Amount
(“GSA”): The GSA is a
non-reversionary $185,000.00 (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.12 and Section 3, ¶ 3.1;
Barvie Decl., ¶ 5), which includes the following[FN3]:
          Individual
PAGA Payments: The “Individual PAGA
Payment” is the “Aggrieved Employee’s pro-rata share of 25% of the PAGA Penalties
calculated according to the number of Pay Periods the Aggrieved Employee worked
during the PAGA Period” and then multiplying the result by each Aggrieved
Employee’s PAGA Pay Periods. (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.13 and Section 3, ¶
3.3.2; Barvie Decl., ¶¶ 18 and 20.)
Aggrieved
Employees assume full responsibility and liability for any taxes owed on their
Individual PAGA Payment. (Agreement, Section
3, ¶ 3.3.2.1.) Administrator (defined below) will prepare and issue IRS
1099 Forms. (Id.) Defendant estimates there are approximately 111 Aggrieved
Employees who worked approximately 4,034 PAGA Pay Periods[FN4] within the PAGA Period. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶ 4.1; Barvie Decl., ¶ 21.)[FN5] Twenty-five percent of PAGA Penalties will be approximately $21,500.00. (Barvie
Decl., ¶ 17.) 
          LWDA PAGA Payment: Seventy-five
percent of the PAGA Penalties paid will be distributed to the LDWA. (Agreement Section 1, ¶ 1.15). This
will be approximately $64,500.00. (Agreement, Section 3, ¶ 3.3.1; Barvie Decl.,
¶ 16.)
          Plaintiff’s Counsel Fees and
Litigation Expenses Payments: Attorney’s fees to be paid to Plaintiff’s counsel
are not to exceed 40% of the GSA (i.e., $74,000.00). (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.19 and Section 3, ¶ 3.2.2.1; Barvie Decl., ¶¶
16 and 25.) Costs are not to exceed $15,000.00.[FN6] (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.20 and
Section 3.2.2.2; Barvie Decl., ¶¶ 16 and 25.) 
          Plaintiff
Enhancement Payment: Plaintiff will
receive a service payment of $5,000.00. (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.28;
Barvie Decl., ¶¶ 16 and 25.) Administrator (defined below) will pay this
amount using IRS Form 1099 and Plaintiff assumes responsibility for employee
taxes owed on this payment. (Agreement, Section 3, ¶ 3.2.1.) 
          Administration
Expenses Payment: Settlement administration fees are not to exceed $5,000.00.
(Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.3 and Section 3, ¶ 3.2.3; Barvie Decl., ¶¶ 16 and 25.)
Definition of Net Settlement
Amount (“NSA”): The NSA is the GSA,
less the Plaintiff’s Counsel Fees and Litigation Expenses Payments,
Plaintiff Enhancement Payment, and the Administration Expenses Payment.
(Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.16.) The remainder is to be paid to the LWDA and
PAGA Group Members. (Id.)
Claims Process: There is no claims process.
Settlement Administrator: Apex Class Actions (“Apex”) is the third-party settlement administrator. (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.2.) 
Within
15 business days after the Court issues its order approving the settlement,
Defendant will deliver the Aggrieved Employee Data (i.e., “Aggrieved Employee identifying
information in [Defendant’s] possession including the Aggrieved Employee’s name,
last-known mailing address, social security number and number of PAGA Pay
Periods within the PAGA Period”) (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.5 and Section 4, ¶
4.2; Barvie Decl., ¶ 24) to Administrator in the form of a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet. (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.5.) Defendant will fully fund the GSA
by transmitting funds to Administrator not later than 20 business days after
the Effective Date (i.e., “the date the Court has (1) approved the settlement
terms and (2) issues a Judgment in the Action”). (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.11
and Section 4, ¶ 4.3; Barvie Decl., ¶ 24.) 
Within
14 business days after Defendant funds the GSA, Administrator will mail checks
for all Individual PAGA Payments, the LWDA PAGA Payment, the Administration
Expenses Payment, Plaintiff Enhancement Payment, and the Plaintiff’s Counsel
Fees and Litigation Expenses Payments. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶ 4.4; Barvie
Decl., ¶ 24)). The checks will be sent via First Class U.S. Mail, postage
prepaid. (Id.) 
Before
mailing any checks, Administrator will update the recipients’ mailing addresses
using the National Change of Address Database. (Id.) Within 7 business
days of receiving a returned check, Administrator must re-mail checks to the
USPS forwarding address provided or to an address ascertained through the
Aggrieved Employee Address Search (i.e., made by “using all reasonably
available sources, methods and means including, but not limited to, the
National Change of Address database, skip traces and direct contact by . .
.Administrator with Aggrieved Employees”). (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.6 and
Section 7, ¶ 7.3.) Administrator need not take further steps to deliver checks
to Aggrieved Employees whose re-mailed checks are returned as undelivered.
(Agreement, Section 7, ¶ 7.3.)
Uncashed Funds: The face of each check shall prominently state the date
(not less than 180 days after the date of mailing) when the check will be
voided. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶ 4.4; Barvie Decl., ¶ 24.) Administrator will
promptly send a replacement check to any Aggrieved Employee whose original
check was lost or misplaced, requested by the Aggrieved Employee prior to the
void date. (Agreement, Section 7, ¶ 7.3.) Administrator will cancel all checks
not cashed by the void date. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶ 4.4.) Any uncashed check
canceled after the void date will be transmitted by Administrator to the
California Controller’s Unclaimed Property Fund in the name of the Aggrieved
Employee. (Agreement, Section 7, ¶ 7.3; Barvie Decl., ¶ 24.).
Notice to LWDA: Concurrently with this motion, Castro provided a copy of
the Agreement to the LWDA. (Barvie Decl., ¶¶ 5 and 25, Exh. 3.) Castro will
also submit to the LAWDA a copy of the Court’s judgment and order approving the
Agreement within 10 days after entry of judgment or order. (Barvie Decl., ¶ 25.)
Release: “PAGA Claims” means “all claims
asserted in the action, all claims asserted in the PAGA Notice sent by or on behalf of Plaintiff to the LWDA, all claims that could
have been asserted in the Action (whether under federal law or state law) or
any other claims under PAGA, based on the facts alleged, including but not
limited to any and all claims for PAGA penalties based on the Labor Code
sections asserted therein, including, PAGA Penalties for violations under the
California Labor Code §§ 201, 202, 203, 204 et seq., 210, 218, 221, 226 et
seq., 226.3, 226.7, 227.3, 246 et seq., 350, 351, 353, 510, 512, 558, 1194,
1197, 1197.1, 1198, 2699, 2699.3 et seq., 2800, 2802, the applicable IWC Wage
Orders, and California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 11040, Subdivision
5 (A)-(B).” (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.24; Barvie Decl., ¶¶ 22-23.) 
“Released
Parties” means Defendant “its past and present officers, directors,
shareholders, owners, current and former employees, agents, representatives,
members, attorneys, insurers, re-insurers, assigns, affiliates, principals,
heirs, representatives and their respective successors and predecessors in
interest, management companies, parent companies and any and all other entities
with whom they have been, are now, or may hereafter be affiliated and/or deemed
joint employers or jointly liable with [Defendant].” (Agreement, Section 1, ¶
1.29.)  
Fairness and Adequacy of Settlement
“Despite
the fact that a representative action under PAGA is not a class action and is
instead a type of qui tam action, a standard requiring the trial court to
determine independently whether a PAGA settlement is fair and reasonable is
appropriate.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 76
[internal quotations and citations omitted].) “[A] trial court should evaluate a
PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in
view of PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future
ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws. (Id. at 77.)
Arm’s
Length Bargaining Process 
On
September 6, 2024, the parties participated in a full-day mediation conducted
by with Tagore Subramaniam (“Subramaniam”), Esq., “an experienced attorney and mediator
in wage and hour representative actions.” (Barvie Decl., ¶ 13.) At the
conclusion of the mediation, the parties reached an agreement for settlement in
principle based on Subramaniam’s proposal, which led to the signing of the
Agreement. (Id., ¶ 14.) The settlement was negotiated after extensive
arm’s length negotiations, with Subramaniam’s assistance. (Id.). 
          Sufficiency
of Investigation and Discovery 
On
January 3, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a notice and draft complaint to the LWDA.
(Barvie Decl., ¶ 10.) On March 12, 2024, after the statutory notice period
expired, Castro filed the operative complaint. (Id., ¶¶ 11-12.) 
Prior
to the September 6, 2024 mediation, the parties engaged in significant efforts
to obtain evidence regarding the claims asserted, including all of Defendant’s
relevant wage and hour policies, the exchange of detailed statistical data
regarding assignments performed by Plaintiff and the Aggrieved Employees, the
production of hundreds of pages of documents, including a large sample of
payroll records and time records, and detailed briefing and analysis in
connection with the mediation. (Barvie Decl., ¶ 13.) Plaintiff was able to
perform damages calculations and assess her claims relevant to Defendant’s
defenses based on this information. (Id., ¶ 13.)
          Experience
of Counsel 
Barvie
has provided the Court with satisfactory information relative to her firm’s, as
well as her personal, experience in class action and representative action
(PAGA) litigation. (Barvie Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. 6.)
          Strengths
and Weaknesses of Plaintiff’s Case 
Barvie
has provided the Court with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of Plaintiff’s
action on pages 8-10 of her corrected declaration. With the assistance of an
expert, Castro calculated that the maximum amount of statutory PAGA civil
penalties was potentially $1,526,700 based on 4,034 pay periods applicable to
the Aggrieved Employees during the PAGA Period. (Barvie Decl., ¶ 27.) The
valuation of $1,526,700.00 is the civil penalty amount without “stacking,”
which is where more than one civil penalty is imposed in a pay period for the
same conduct. (Id., ¶ 27, fn. 10.) Castro is not aware of any PAGA award
which permitted stacking. (Id.)
The
GSA is 12.12% of Defendant’s maximum liability exposure. (Id., ¶ 29) The
settlement amount of PAGA claims here constitutes approximately $45.86 per pay
period. (Id., ¶ 26.) 
Defendant
maintains that it did not violate the Labor Code and that the Aggrieved
Employees were properly compensated. (Id., ¶¶ 30 and 31.) Defendant also
asserted additional defenses as to the amount of the penalties. (Id.)
Defendant could also argue that no penalties prior to the PAGA notification
should be awarded because the violations were not intentional. (Id.) 
The
Court finds that the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate in view of
PAGA’s purposes,” based on the foregoing.
Scope
of the Release
“PAGA Released Claims” means “all claims asserted in the ACTION, all claims asserted in
the PAGA NOTICE sent by or on behalf of PLAINTIFF to the LWDA, all claims that
could have been asserted in the ACTION (whether under federal law or state law)
or any other claims under PAGA, based on the facts alleged, including but not
limited to any and all claims for PAGA penalties based on the Labor Code
sections asserted therein, including, PAGA PENALTIES for violations under the
California Labor Code §§ 201, 202, 203, 204 et seq., 210, 218, 221, 226 et
seq., 226.3, 226.7, 227.3, 246 et seq., 350, 351, 353, 510, 512, 558, 1194,
1197, 1197.1, 1198, 2699, 2699.3 et seq., 2800, 2802, the applicable IWC Wage
Orders, and California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 11040, Subdivision
5 (A)-(B).” (Agreement, Section 1, ¶
1.24.) 
“Because
an aggrieved employee’s action under the Labor Code Private Attorneys General
Act of 2004 functions as a substitute for an action brought by the government
itself, a judgment in that action binds all those, including nonparty aggrieved
employees, who would be bound by a judgment in an action brought by the
government. The act authorizes a representative action only for the purpose of
seeking statutory penalties for Labor Code violations . . .” (Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th
969, 986.) 
Castro
has additionally agreed to a general release of all claims arising out of her
employment and a waiver of rights under Civil Code section 1542. (Agreement,
Section 5, ¶ 5.1.1 and 5.1.1.1 and Barvie Decl., ¶¶ 48.) 
The
Court finds that the release is fair, reasonable, and adequate.
Notice 
“PAGA
has no notice requirements for unnamed aggrieved employees, nor may such
employees opt out of a PAGA action.” (Baumann
v. Chase Inv. Services Corp. (9th Cir. 2014) 747 F.3d 1117,
1122.)
Again,
within 15 business days after the Court issues its Order approving the
settlement, Defendant will provide Apex with Aggrieved Employee Data in the
form of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, which will include each Aggrieved
Employee’s name, last-known mailing address, social security number and number
of PAGA Pay Periods within the PAGA Period. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶ 4.2 and
Section 1, ¶ 1.5.) 
Within
14 days after Defendant funds the GSA (i.e., due no later than 20 business days
after the Effective Date), Apex will mail checks for all Individual PAGA
Payments. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶¶ 4.3 and 4.4.) Before
mailing any checks, Apex will update the recipients’ mailing addresses using
the National Change of Address Database. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶ 4.4.) Within
7 business days of receiving a returned check, Apex must re-mail checks to the
USPS forwarding address provided or to an address ascertained through the
Aggrieved Employee Address Search, which involves the use of all reasonably
available sources, methods and means including, but not limited to, the National
Change of Address database, skip traces and direct contact by Apex with
Aggrieved Employees. (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.6 and Section 7, ¶7.3.) 
The
Court finds that the foregoing procedure is appropriate.
Attorney
Fees and Costs 
The
Agreement provides that attorney’s fees
to be paid to Castro’s counsel are not to exceed 40% (i.e., $74,000.00) of the GSA.
(Agreement, Section 3, ¶ 3.2.2 and Barvie Decl., ¶¶ 25 and 38). Costs have been
incurred in the amount of $11,737.70. (Barvie Decl., ¶ 38, fn. 15.) 
The
Court finds the requested attorney’s fees to be reasonable pursuant to the
percentage method from a “common fund.” (Lafitte v. Robert Half Intern. Inc.
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 486.) 
Castro’s
has provided the Court with a Lodestar calculation of $48,178.00, with a
multiplier of 1.5 with additional work to be performed (Barvie Decl., Decl., ¶¶
6 and 41, Exh. 4). The Court further finds the requested costs to be reasonable
and adequately supported by Barvie’s declaration. (Id., ¶¶ 7, 44 and 45,
Exh. 5.)
Enhancement
Award 
Castro
will receive $5,000.00 as an
enhancement payment. (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.28 and Section 3, 3.2.1; Barvie
Decl., ¶¶ 48.) The Court finds this award to be reasonable and adequately
supported by Barvie’s declaration.
Administration
Costs 
Settlement
administration costs will not exceed $5,000.00. (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.3
and Section 3, ¶ 3.2.3; Barvie Decl., ¶¶ 16 and 25). The Court finds these
costs to be reasonable. 
Conclusion 
The
motion is granted.
