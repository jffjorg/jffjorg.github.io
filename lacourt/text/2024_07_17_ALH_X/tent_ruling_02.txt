RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
Defendant moves for an order dismissing Plaintiff’s complaint based on alleged
discovery misconduct.
             
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Katherine Perez sued
defendants Octavio Lara, fictitiously-named John Doe, and Does 1 to 50 on May
26, 2023, for negligence and related claims arising from a car accident that
occurred on June 3, 2021 on Interstate 210.
 
On December 28, 2023, Lara filed his
answer.
 
On January 8 and 10, 2024, Lara moved
for an order compelling Plaintiff to produce further responses to several sets
of discovery; he subsequently removed the motions from calendar.
 
On March 21, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved.
 
On April 18, 2024, the Court granted
Lara’s motion to compel Plaintiff to appear for deposition and produce
documents. The Court also imposed monetary sanctions on Plaintiff.
 
On May 24, 2024, Lara filed the instant
motion for terminating sanctions, contending that Plaintiff has not complied
with the Court’s April 18, 2024, and has not indicated she has any intent to do
so.
 
Plaintiff filed no opposition, and Lara
no reply.
 
A final status conference is set for
August 8, 2024, and jury trial on August 20, 2024.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The
motion is DENIED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The Civil Discovery Act requires the court to impose
monetary sanctions on a party who unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel
initial or further discovery responses. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c),
2030.300(d), 2031.300(c), 2031.310(h), 2033.280(c), 2033.290(d).) If a party
then fails to obey an order compelling initial or further response, the Act
permits the court at its discretion to impose escalating sanctions, including
issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions. (See id., §§ 2030.300(e),
2031.310(i).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
On April 18, 2024, the Court ordered Plaintiff to appear for
deposition and produce documents on May 21, 2024, and to pay $450.00 in
monetary sanctions within sixty (60) days. (See 04-18-2024 Minute Order.)
Lara’s counsel’s uncontradicted declaration establishes Plaintiff did not
comply with any part of this order. (McNulty Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.) The Court has the
discretion to impose escalating sanctions.
 
However, a terminating sanction remains
slightly premature. In imposing discovery sanctions, “[t]he trial court should
consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party seeking
discovery[.]” (Id., 992.) Sanctions should be tailored to the harm
created by the withheld discovery and should not be used as punishment. (Ibid.)
The court should also consider whether the discovery misconduct was “willful”
and whether the requesting party was prejudiced by the other’s failure to
comply. (Do It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin
& Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 37.)
 
Case law suggests the court
should take an incremental approach to sanctions, holding that terminating
sanctions should be used “sparingly” and as a “last resort,” (Department of
Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191);
that terminating sanctions are the “ultimate sanction” and should not be
“automatically imposed for every such disobedience of a discovery order” (Karz
v. Karl (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 637, 649); and that less severe alternatives
should be attempted unless there is reason to believe they would be ineffective.
(Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016)
246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)
 
Here, the facts do not
sufficiently establish a willful failure to comply with the Court’s order, nor
do they establish that lesser sanctions cannot induce Plaintiff’s compliance.
The Court might have imposed lesser sanctions, but Lara did not request any in
the alternative.
 
The Court recognizes that
Defendant will suffer prejudice if trial proceeds as scheduled. The Court therefore
orders a short continuance and reserves a hearing date for a renewed sanctions
motion. The Court will consider terminating sanctions at that time if Plaintiff
still has not complied with the Court’s order. Whether or not Plaintiff
complies, the Court will consider lesser sanctions as appropriate to remediate
any prejudice caused by Plaintiff’s misconduct.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court denies the motion
without prejudice.
 
The Court advances to this date
the final status conference and jury trial set for August 8 and August 20,
2024, respectively, and continues them to October 3 and October 15, 2024.
 
The Court reserves a hearing date
for Defendant’s renewed sanctions motion on September 4, 2024, at which the
Court will reconsider terminating or lesser sanctions depending Plaintiff’s
compliance with the Court’s April 18, 2024 order.
 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice by overnight mail and file proof of such with the Court.
