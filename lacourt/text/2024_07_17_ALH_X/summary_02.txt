```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions without prejudice. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiff's alleged discovery misconduct, specifically failure to comply with a court order to appear for deposition and produce documents. The court has imposed monetary sanctions on the plaintiff, but will consider terminating or lesser sanctions if the plaintiff still fails to comply with the order at a later date. The trial date has been continued to October 15, 2024, and a hearing date has been set for September 4, 2024, at which the court will reconsider the sanctions.
