And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the May 16, 2024 order denying the plaintiff's motion to vacate the ruling in favor of the defendant's application for arbitration. The plaintiff had filed multiple motions to vacate and quash, but the court had denied each of them. The plaintiff's latest motion argues that the court did not consider evidence that was already available at the time of the May 16, 2024 ruling, but the judge finds that this does not justify a renewed motion for reconsideration. The judge also finds that there has been no change in the law since November 2023 that would warrant reconsideration of the prior order. As a result, the motion is denied.
