REQUESTED 
 
Defendant moves for an order recalling and quashing a post-judgment writ
of possession and dismissing Plaintiff’s case.
             
BACKGROUND
 
This is an unlawful detainer case.
Plaintiff Alliance Portfolio sued defendants The Bissell House, an unknown
entity; 201 Orange Grove, Inc.; William D. Hoyman; and all persons known and
unknown with an interest in the real property located at 201 Orange Grove Ave.,
South Pasadena 91030 (“the Property”). Plaintiffs alleged Defendants
illegally continued in possession of the Property after foreclosure.
 
On April 11, 2023, defendant William D.
Hoyman moved to quash service of the summons and complaint.
 
On April 13, 2023, the clerk entered the
defaults of defendants The Bissell House and 201 Orange Grove, Inc. On May 8,
2023, the clerk entered the defaults of all persons known and unknown with an
interest in the Property. 
 
On June 12, 2023, the Court denied
defendant Hoyman’s motion to quash.
 
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed
the Doe defendants from the case. On the same date, the clerk entered defendant
Hoyman’s default.
 
On June 26, 2023, the Court entered
judgment against The Bissell House, 201 Orange Grove, and Hoyman.
 
On June 27, 2023, defendant Hoyman filed
a demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint.
 
On August 2, 2023, Hoyman applied ex
parte to vacate the default and default judgment entered against him. The
Court granted Hoyman’s application on August 3, 2023. As to the other two
defaulted defendants, the Court stayed execution of the writ of possession.
(See 08-03-2024 Minute Order.)
 
The case was tried to the bench on
October 3, 2023. Defendant Hoyman orally moved for judgment on the pleadings at
trial. The parties stipulated that Hoyman was “not a ‘foreclosed upon’ borrower
in this action”, and the Court granted Hoyman’s motion. (See 10-03-2023 Minute
Order.)
 
On October 17, 2023, Plaintiff moved
“for an order reauthorizing issuance of the existing writ of possession
previously signed and issued by [the] Court”.
 
On November 16, 2023, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion, ruling in pertinent part:
 
“Plaintiff moves for an
order lifting this court’s previous stay of the July 18, 2023, writ of
possession. On June 26, 2023, default judgment for unlawful detainer for
possession was entered in Plaintiff’s favor. On July 18, 2023, a writ of
possession was issued for the subject property. On August 3, 2023, this court
granted Defendant William D. Hoyman’s motion to set aside default and stayed
the writ of possession up to and including August 16, 2023. At trial on October
3, 2023, the court awarded judgment to Defendant after an oral motion for
judgment on the pleadings. 
 
Plaintiff seeks an order lifting
the stay of the previous writ of possession. However, the previously issued
writ of possession stated that Defendant William D. Hoyman was a judgment
debtor. However, after trial and motion for judgment on the pleadings, the writ
of possession is no longer accurate.
 
Plaintiff’s’ motion ... is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to file an
updated application for writ of possession.”
 
(11-16-2023 Minute Order, pp. 1-2.)
 
On November 21, 2023, the Court entered judgment in Hoyman’s
favor.
 
Plaintiff struggled to obtain a writ of possession against The
Bissell House and 201 Orange Grove. On May 8, 2024, Plaintiff appeared on an ex
parte application to clarify an existing order regarding the writ of
possession. The Court ruled as follows, in pertinent part:
 
“The Court confirms that defendant
William D. Hoyman is not a named defendant, and the writ of possession EXCLUDES
WILLIAM D. HOYMAN as a party on the Writ. 
 
The Court orders any writ of
possession issued to the contrary recalled and quashed. 
 
Counsel for the plaintiff is
ordered to prepare the Order for Issuance of the Writ and submit to defense
counsel for approval. 
 
Upon approval of the Order, the
Writ of Possession is ordered submitted to this Court for review.”
 
(05-08-2024
Minute Order, p. 1.)
 
On
June 17, 2024, the clerk issued Plaintiff an updated Writ of Possession. The
writ names 201 Orange Grove and The Bissell House as judgment debtors subject
to the writ. An attachment page conspicuously states:
 
“WILLIAM D. HOYMAN, AN
INDIVIDUAL, WHO IS AN OCCUPANT OF 201 ORANGE GROVE, AVE., SOUTH PASADENA,
CALIFORNIA, IS NOT A JUDGMENT DEBTOR. WILLIAM D. HOYMAN IS EXCLUDED FROM
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS WRIT. ALL OTHER OCCUPANTS ARE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS WRIT.”
 
(06-17-2024 Writ of Possession, p. 3.)
 
On June 21, 2024, defendant Hoyman filed the instant “Motion
re: Order to 1) Recall and Quash the Writ of Possession; and, 2) to Set Aside
Default and Default Judgment Against all Defaulted Defendants with Judgment;
and 3) to Dismiss this Case in its Entirety.”
 
On July 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed its opposition. Defendant
filed no reply.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The
motion is DENIED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            1. Application to Recall and Quash
 
Hoyman argues the
Court should recall and quash the writ because Hoyman prevailed at trial. This argument
is superfluous. Hoyman prevailed at trial, but he is not named in the writ. In
fact, the Court ordered that the writ include language specifically excluding
him, and it does.
 
            2. Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment
 
Hoyman has
established no grounds to vacate the default or default judgment entered
against his co-defendants. 
 
The caption of
Hoyman’s motion suggests he relies on Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 or
473.5 (although the motion does not cite them). Both sections bar motions after
six months of notice of entry of judgment. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 473(b),
473.5(a).) Hoyman filed his motion more than a year after his co-defendants
were defaulted. The motion is untimely.
 
On the merits,
Hoyman’s motion also fails. His standing to assert these arguments on his
co-defendants’ behalf is questionable. Even if he does have standing, Hoyman must
demonstrate lack of actual notice (section 473.5) or mistake,
inadvertence, etc. (section 473) in order for the Court to grant his motion.
His motion relitigates the facts of his case rather than arguing he satisfies
those sections.
 
Hoyman has not
established he is entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473
or 473.5.
 
            3. Motion to Dismiss
 
Finally, and most
importantly: there is a final judgment in this case. A party “cannot attack the
judgment once the time has elapsed for appeal or other direct attack.
[Citations.]” (Westphal v. Westphal (1942) 20 Cal.2d 393, 397.) “[A]
court has no jurisdiction to modify or change its judgment after the time for
presenting a motion for new trial has elapsed and the time for appeal therefrom
has expired, except as provided section 473 ... .” (Johnson v. Superior
Court of Yuba County (1939) 31 Cal.App.2d 111, 113.)
 
There are no grounds
for the Court to grant any of the relief Hoyman seeks in his motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court denies the motion.
