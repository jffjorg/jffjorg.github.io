RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
Plaintiff moves for reconsideration of the Court’s May 16, 2024 order denying
Plaintiff’s “Motion to Vacate ruling in favor of the defendant’s application
for arbitration.”
             
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Zhiwei Chen filed this action against defendant Verizon Wireless Services, LLC
on on August 28, 2023. Plaintiff has been self-represented since the outset of
the suit. Plaintiff alleges Defendant committed an intentional tort wherein Defendant
“used technical means to take control of [Plaintiff’s] phone ... [and] forged
the plaintiff’s signature with the intention of taking possession of
plaintiff’s property.” (Compl., p. 4, ¶ IT-1.)
 
On
November 7, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel the parties to
arbitrate their dispute. The Court stayed the action pending the completion of
arbitration.
 
On
March 27, 2024, one hundred forty-one (141) days after the Court’s November
2023 order, Plaintiff filed a “Motion to Quash to vacate /quash the ruling of
November 7, 2023”, which he subsequently removed from calendar.
 
On
April 16, 2024, one hundred sixty-one (161) days after the Court’s November
2023 order, Plaintiff filed a “Motion to Vacate ruling in favor of the
defendant’s application for arbitration”.
 
On
May 16, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to vacate.
 
On May
20, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for reconsideration of the May 16,
2024 ruling. That motion is now before the Court.
 
Defendant
filed no opposition, although Plaintiff filed no proof of service indicating Plaintiff
gave Defendant notice of his motion.
 
Plaintiff
filed no reply.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The
motion is DENIED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
When an application for an order has been made to a judge,
or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).)
 
“If a court at any time determines that there has been a
change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered, it may
do so on its own motion and enter a different order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008
(c); see also Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106-1107.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter:
Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate was, in operation, a motion to reconsider, which
the Court denied. (See 05-16-2024 Minute Order, p.2 [recharacterizing motion by
relief sought].) The instant motion is a motion to reconsider the Court’s
ruling on a motion to reconsider. Any renewed motion, including a renewed
motion for reconsideration, must be justified by new facts or law. (See Le
Francois v. Goel, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 1099.) Plaintiff objects
that the Court did not consider evidence that was already available at the time
of the May 16, 2024 ruling. This does not justify a renewed motion for
reconsideration of the Court’s November 2023 order, nor does it justify a
motion to reconsider the motion to reconsider.
 
For the same reason, reconsideration
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(a) is unwarranted. Plaintiff
specified no new or different facts, circumstances etc. in his
declaration(s) accompanying his motion.
 
Reconsideration under section
1008(c) is similarly unwarranted. Plaintiff cites no relevant change in the law
since November 2023, and the Court is aware of none. The Court declines to
exercise its own discretion to reconsider either prior ruling.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is denied.
 
Court to provide notice.
