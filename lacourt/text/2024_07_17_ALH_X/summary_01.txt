Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to recall and quash the writ of possession and to dismiss the case. The defendant, William D. Hoyman, argues that the writ should be recalled and quashed because he prevailed at trial, but the judge finds that this argument is unnecessary since Hoyman is not named in the writ and the writ already excludes him. The judge also finds that Hoyman's motion to vacate default and default judgment is untimely and that Hoyman has not established he is entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 or 473.5. Finally, the judge concludes that there are no grounds for the Court to grant any of the relief Hoyman seeks in his motion and denies the motion.
