Defendants demur to four of Plaintiffs’ seven causes of action and move
to strike Plaintiffs’ prayers for punitive damages.
             
BACKGROUND
 
This is a habitability case. Plaintiffs
Aida Hernandez and Ruben Hernandez sued defendants Stephen S. Young and Betty
Young, individually and as trustees of the Stephen S. Young and Betty Young
Trust, on December 7, 2023, asserting causes of action for:
 
            1.         Tortious
Breach of the Warranty of Habitability,
            2.         Breach
of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment,
            3.         Nuisance
(Negligence),
            4.         Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress,
            5.         Negligent
Maintenance of the Premises,
            6.         Nuisance
(Intentional Tort), and
            7.         Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress.
            
As
alleged in the complaint and accepted as true for a demurrer and motion to
strike: Defendants own the property located at 2190 S. Oak Knoll Ave., San
Marino 91108 (“the Property”). (Compl., ¶ 11.) Plaintiffs have rented the
Property from Defendants since around October 2015. (Id., ¶¶ 12-13.) Throughout
Plaintiffs’ tenancy, the Property has suffered from uninhabitable conditions
including severe vermin infestations, faulty plumbing and electrical systems,
deteriorating structural integrity, and lack of maintenance of landscaping and
foliage. (Id., ¶ 14.)
 
On March
27, 2024, Defendants demurred to and moved to strike portions of Plaintiffs’
complaint. On July 3, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their opposition. On July 7, 2024,
Defendants replied.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants’
demurrers to the first and seventh causes of action are SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND.
 
Defendants’
demurrers to the second and sixth causes of action are OVERRULED.
 
Defendants’
motion to strike is denied as MOOT.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            Demurrer
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10; Young v.
Gannon (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 209, 220.) 
 
When considering a demurrer, a court reads the allegations
stated in the challenged pleading liberally and in context, and “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5
Cal.3d 584, 591.) Put differently: for purposes of demurrer, the court treats
all facts alleged – but only the facts alleged – in the complaint as
true. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School District (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 732.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
 
            Motion
to Strike
 
“The
court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435 [notice of motion to
strike whole or part of complaint], or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading.” (Id. § 436 (a).) Irrelevant matters include
immaterial allegations that are not essential to the claim or those not
pertinent to or supported by an otherwise sufficient claim. (Id., §
431.10.) The court may also “[s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.” (Id. § 436 (b).) Motions to strike are used to
reach defects or objections to pleadings that are not challengeable by
demurrer, such as words, phrases, and prayers for damages. (See Code Civ. Proc.
§§ 435, 436, and 437.)
 
DISCUSSION (Demurrer)
 
Defendants demur to Plaintiffs’
first, second, sixth, and seventh causes of action, on the grounds that none
states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
 
            1.
First Cause of Action for Tortious Breach of the Warranty of Habitability
 
Breach of the implied warranty of habitability, as any breach of
contract, may be regarded as a tortious breach where an injured party
demonstrates the defendant’s intentional, malicious, and outrageous conduct. (Smith
v. David (1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 101, 112, fn.3; Jones v. Kelly
(1929) 208 Cal. 251, 255-256.) California
law defines malice as “either (1) conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury to the plaintiff or (2) ‘despicable conduct which is carried on by
the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others.’ ” (Mock v. Michigan Millers Mutual Ins. Co. (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 306, 330.)
 
Plaintiffs have stated a claim
for breach of warranty, but they have not stated a claim for tortious breach.
The complaint refers solely to the conditions on the Property. It alleges no
facts that suggest Defendants possessed any state of mind, malicious or
otherwise. Plaintiffs rely on the assertion that (1) Defendants had actual and
constructive notice of the poor conditions on the Property and (2) the poor
conditions caused Plaintiffs substantial distress. The former allegation is
insufficient to show malice, and the latter is irrelevant.
 
The demurrer to the first cause
of action is sustained with leave to amend.
 
            2.
Second Cause of Action for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
 
A tenant suffering breach of quiet enjoyment may remain in
place and sue their landlord for breach of the implied covenant, which is a
breach of a promise contained in their lease. (Andrews v. Mobile Aire
Estates (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 588-590) The elements track with a
breach of contract or covenant case: (1) a lease; (2) the tenant’s performance
or excuse; (3) the landlord’s substantial interference with the tenant’s
beneficial use and enjoyment; and (4) some injury to the tenant’s rights under
the lease – generally, the failure to obtain the full value bargained for when
the tenant paid rent to occupy the premises without disturbance. (Ibid.)
 
“ ‘[T]he implied covenant of
quiet enjoyment is similar to, and sometimes overlapping with, the warranty of
habitability.’ [Citation.] ‘[T]he “line between” the landlord's interference
with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment and the landlord’s failure to maintain the
leased premises in a “tenantable” condition can be “blurred.” ’ [Citation.]” (Fairchild
v. Park (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 919, 923, fn. 1.) A claim can be stated for
one or the other on the same basic facts. (See Hjelm v. Prometheus Real
Estate Group (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1155, 1165 [“bedbug infestation and/or
raw sewage on the property may violate the warranty of habitability or the
covenant of quiet enjoyment”].)
 
Plaintiffs have stated a claim
for breach of the warranty of habitability. They have also alleged the
violations were severe and their landlords had notice of the poor conditions,
which is sufficient to allege Defendants affirmatively substantially interfered
with Plaintiffs’ use of the Property. These allegations state a claim for
breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
 
            3.
Sixth Cause of Action for Nuisance (Intentional Tort)
 
Although Defendants included Plaintiffs’ sixth cause
of action for nuisance in their Notice of Demurrer, they did not discuss the
nuisance claim in their moving papers. The Court disregards this portion of
their demurrer because they failed to argue the point.
 
            4. Seventh Cause of Action for
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
To prevail on a
claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must plead
and prove (1) defendant’s outrageous conduct; (2) defendant's intent to cause
distress or reckless disregard for its likelihood; (3) plaintiff's severe or
extreme emotional distress; and (4) causation. (See Huntingdon Life Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty
USA, Inc. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1259.)
 
 “ ‘Conduct, to be “ ‘outrageous’ ” must be so
extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized
society.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) Similarly, “[s]evere emotional distress means ‘
“emotional distress of such substantial quality or enduring quality that no
reasonable [person] in civilized society should be expected to endure it.” ’ ”
(Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1051.)
 
The facts in Plaintiffs’
complaint do not describe conduct that exceeds all bounds of what might
ordinarily be tolerated. In fact, the sorts of wrongs Plaintiffs allege are
(regrettably) relatively commonplace. A tenant may recover against her
landlord for intentional infliction of emotional distress in extreme cases,
such as direct threats of violence against tenants (Newby v. Alto Riviera
Apartments (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 288) or knowing permission for severe
habitability problems to persist across many buildings and units (McNairy v.
C.K. Realty (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1504). But no facts of that sort
are alleged here. Plaintiffs have not stated a claim.
 
DISCUSSION (Motion to
Strike)
 
Because the Court
sustains Defendants’ demurrer with leave to amend, the motion to strike is
denied as moot. But in the interest of avoiding unnecessary motion practice,
the Court offers the following observation:
 
A motion to strike is the
procedure to attack a purportedly improper remedy such as unjustified punitive
damages. (Venice Town Council, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1996) 47
Cal.App.4th 1547, 1561-1562.) But a complaint including a request for punitive
damages must also include allegations showing that the plaintiff is entitled to
such an award. (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253,
1255.) 
 
A claim for punitive damages
cannot be pleaded generally and allegations that a defendant acted “with
oppression, fraud and malice” toward plaintiff are insufficient legal
conclusions to show that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of punitive
damages. (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.) Specific
factual allegations are required to support a claim for punitive damages. (Ibid.)
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Defendants’
demurrers to the first and seventh causes of action are SUSTAINED WITH  20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Defendants’
demurrers to the second and sixth causes of action are OVERRULED.
 
Defendants’
motion to strike is denied as MOOT.
 
Moving party to give notice.
