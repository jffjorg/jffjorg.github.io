English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion for a preliminary injunction to prohibit a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of a property. The plaintiff, Gohar Tsilikyan, is seeking to cancel a deed of trust on the property, alleging that the defendants, Narek Eric Kazarian and Spectrum Lending, LLC, never funded the $500,000 loan. The court finds that the plaintiff is unlikely to prove that the defendants never funded the loan, citing the defendants' evidence of Kazarian's testimony that he hand-delivered the $500,000 in cash to Vahe Babloyan. The court also notes that the plaintiff and co-borrowers waited two years to protest not receiving the loan proceeds. The court finds that the balance of interim harm to the parties does not support granting a preliminary injunction, as denying the injunction may result in the plaintiff losing her interest in the real property. The court discharges the order to show cause re: preliminary injunction.
