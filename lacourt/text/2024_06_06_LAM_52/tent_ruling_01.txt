  Case Number:  22STCV37866    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Preliminary
Injunction
            Plaintiff Gohar Tsilikyan moves for
a preliminary injunction to prohibit defendants Narek Eric Kazarian and Spectrum
Lending, LLC from conducting a nonjudicial foreclosure sale or from
transferring any interest in real property at 1328 Ruberta Ave., Glendale, CA
91201. 
“In deciding whether to issue a
preliminary injunction, a court must weigh two ‘interrelated’ factors: (1) the
likelihood that the moving party will ultimately prevail on the merits and
(2) the relative interim harm to the parties from issuance or nonissuance of
the injunction.”  (Butt v. State of
California (1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 677–678 (Butt).)  The second factor concerns “the
comparative consequences of the issuance and nonissuance of the
injunction” before trial.  (Common
Cause v. Board of Supervisors (1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 442.)  “The trial court’s determination must be
guided by a ‘mix’ of the potential-merit and interim-harm factors; the greater
the plaintiff’s showing on one, the less must be shown on the other to support
an injunction.”  (Butt, supra, 4
Cal.4th at p. 678.)  
Likelihood of Prevailing
            Plaintiff
shows little likelihood of prevailing on the merits of her claims.  Plaintiff’s papers do not identify the
elements of any of her causes of action. 
The gravamen of this case is that she seeks to cancel a deed of trust on
the subject property on the basis that defendants never funded the $500,000
loan for which they acquired that security interest.  
It is undisputed that, on or about October
25, 2020, plaintiff executed three documents for this transaction: the disburse
instructions and authorization (Tsilikyan Decl., ¶¶ 3-5, Ex. 4), the note
secured by deed of trust (Ex. 5), and the short form deed of trust and
assignment of rents (Ex. 6).  Plaintiff
and her co-borrowers, Vahe Babloyan, Karen Garush Berkibekyan, and Senik
Avetisyan each submitted declarations stating, “Kazarian never transferred the
$500,000.00 loan proceeds to” any of the four of them “or to anyone else.”  (Babloyan Decl., ¶ 5; Berkibekyan Decl., ¶ 5;
Avetisyan Decl., ¶ 5; Tsilikyan Decl., ¶ 5.) 

In opposition, Kazarian testifies, “I, Mr.
Kazarian, on behalf of Spectrum hand-delivered in-person $500,000.00 in cash to
Vahe Babloyan in my office located at 1915 W. Glenoaks Blvd., #101, Glendale,
California 91201.  The hand-delivery of
this $500,00.00 in cash to Mr. Babloyan represents and constitutes the subject
business loan in this lawsuit.  This $500,000.00
in cash was received by Mr. Babloyan in my office at that time in the presence
of others.  This $500,000.00 in cash was
counted and confirmed at that time by Mr. Babloyan, as well as myself and
others.”  (Kazarian Decl., ¶ 5.)  Kazarian also states he sent the following
text message to Vahe Babloyan on October 1, 2021: “Need this Monday before noon
[¶] $350k + 20 + $10 [¶] $6500 payment for $500k [¶] $10,600 for the FCI
Tarzana.”  (Id., ¶ 6, Ex. B.)  Babloyan replied, “Ok brat I should have it
by tomorrow noon.”  (Ibid.)  
After considering all evidence in the
record, the court finds plaintiff is unlikely to prove defendants never funded
the $500,000 loan.  Defendants’ evidence
raises a crucial question: if they never funded the loan in October 2020, why
did Babloyan tell Kazarian in October 2021 that he would make payments on it by
noon the next day?  In response,
Tsilikyan’s reply argues, “[T]here is no context to these text messages to
constitute evidence of tender of the $500,000.00 loan proceeds.”  (Reply, p. 3.)  But she presents no testimony by Babloyan
that the text message was about anything else. 
She does not argue Babloyan owes some other debt to Kazarian that would
result in a “$6500 payment for $500k.”  (Kazarian
Decl., Ex. B.)  Plaintiff also presents
no evidence that she or the other co-borrowers disputed whether defendants paid
the loan proceeds until she filed this action in December 5, 2022—two years
after they should have received the $500,000. 
It is not credible that they waited two years to protest never receiving
$500,000 defendants owed. 
One other circumstance undermines the
credibility of plaintiff and her co-borrowers. 
Plaintiff blames defendants for claiming there were three separate loans
of $500,000 instead of a single loan cross-collateralized by different
properties.  (App., pp. 5-6.)  The promissory notes and deeds of trust do indicate
three separate loans of $500,000.  (App.,
Exs. 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9.)  But each
borrower signed “disbursement instructions and authorization” stating the
proceeds would be disbursed “to Vahe Babloyan” and they “understand that there
will be only one time $500,000 (five-hundred thousand) funding and do
acknowledge that this loan is in conjunction with
the Note and deed dated on October 23, 2020 with property address 12662 Meadowlark
Ave, Granada Hills, CA and 6703 Nagle Ave, Van Nuys, CA.”  (App., Exs. 1, 4, 7.)  
Before the secured lenders took any action
to foreclose on the properties, plaintiff and two of her co-borrowers filed separate
lawsuits against Kazarian, including two by Berkibekyan: this action; Berkibekyan
v. Kazarian, No. 22STCV37873; Avetisyan v. Kazarian, No.
22STCV37904; and Berkibekyan v. Kazarian, 23STCV16584.  The
borrowers filing serial lawsuits over what they knew was a single loan
indicates they—not defendants—were the ones trying to obfuscate what happened.
Balance of Interim Harm
            The
balance of interim harm to the parties does not support granting a preliminary
injunction.  Given the low likelihood of
prevailing on the merits, plaintiff must make a strong showing on this
element.  She does not.  Denying the injunction may result in her
losing her interest in real property. 
But generally “a preforeclosure, preemptive action is not authorized by
the nonjudicial foreclosure statutes because it creates an additional
requirement that a foreclosing entity first demonstrate in court that it is
entitled to foreclose.”  (Kan v. Guild
Mortgage Co. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 736, 743.)  Doing so “ ‘ “would be inconsistent with the
policy behind nonjudicial foreclosure of providing a quick, inexpensive and
efficient remedy.” ’ ”  (Ibid.) 
            On
the other hand, the interim harm to defendants would involve substantially
interfering with their ability to enforce their security interest or acquire
any other remedy.  Defendants present
evidence that, in another action against Kazarian regarding one of the other
properties secured by the same $500,000 loan, the court issued a temporary
restraining order precluding all the co-borrowers, including plaintiff
Tsilikyan, from transferring any interest in that property.  (Matevosyan Decl., Ex. C.)  Defendants show a reasonable likelihood that
they would suffer irreparable interim harm.
Disposition
The order to show cause re: preliminary
injunction is hereby discharged.
