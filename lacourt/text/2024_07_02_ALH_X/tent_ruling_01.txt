Plaintiff
filed no opposition, and Defendant no reply.

The motion is GRANTED.

REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendant requests
judicial notice of Plaintiff’s complaint. The Court grants Defendant’s request,
but not as to the truth of the complaint’s contents, so all pertinent
information already appears in the Court’s file.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Code
of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 requires a trial court to grant a petition to
compel arbitration ‘if the court determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists.’”  (Avery v.
Integrated Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 50, 59 (Avery),
quoting Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2).) The party seeking to compel arbitration
bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by
the preponderance of the evidence.  (Engalla,
supra, 15 Cal.4th 951, 972.)  A
petition to compel arbitration must allege both a “written agreement to
arbitrate” the controversy, and that a party to that agreement “refuses to
arbitrate” the controversy. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.) It then becomes
plaintiff’s burden, in opposing the motion, to prove by a preponderance of the
evidence any fact necessary to her opposition. (Ibid.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant advances the retail sales agreement
between Plaintiff and Defendant, whereby Plaintiff purchased the vehicle
subject to this action. (Kim Decl., Exh. 1.) The agreement is signed by both
parties. (Id., at p. 1.) At page 7, the agreement contains an
“ARBITRATION PROVISION”, which provides that “[a]ny claim or dispute, whether
in contract, tort, statute or otherwise, ... between you and us ... which
arises out of or relates to your ... purchase or condition of this vehicle, this
contract or any resulting transaction or relationship ... shall, at your or our
election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration ... .” (Id., at p.
7.)
 
The arbitration provision binds both parties,
and its scope covers the instant dispute.
 
Defendant’s counsel attests that Plaintiff
refused Defendant’s request to stipulate to arbitrate their dispute. (Ameripour
Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
Defendant’s burden under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.2 is satisfied.
 
Plaintiff filed no opposition, and therefore
has not carried his burden to show why the arbitration agreement should not be
enforced.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. The action is stayed in its entirety
pending further order of the Court. The Court sets an OSC Re: Status of
Arbitration for March 24, 2025, at 8:30 am.
 
Moving Party to give notice.
