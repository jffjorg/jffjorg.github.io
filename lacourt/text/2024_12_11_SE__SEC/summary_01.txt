The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses, stating that the Defendant has not provided responses to the interrogatories and that the Plaintiff has not shown good cause justifying the discovery sought. The judge has also denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the Plaintiff was not successful in moving for a motion to compel further responses.
