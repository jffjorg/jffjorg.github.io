  Case Number:  23NWCV01442    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2024    Dept:  SEC GRISSOM V. FCA US LLCCASE NO.: 23NWCV01442HEARING: 12/11/2024#4TENTATIVE ORDERI. Plaintiff Georgia Grisson’s motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, set one, is DENIED.II. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.Moving party to give notice.Georgia Grisson (Plaintiff) moves the Court for an order Compelling FCA US LLC (Defendant) to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories and special interrogatories, set one.BackgroundThis is a lemon law action. On May 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant alleging violations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. On or about February 24, 2029, Plaintiff leased a 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicle (Subject Vehicle). (Complaint, ¶ 4.) Plaintiff alleges that after taking the vehicle for repairs three times, the Subject Vehicle continues to have defects including service light illumination, dashboard lights shutting off, acceleration issues, and transmission noises. (Complaint, ¶ 12.)Legal StandardWhere responses to interrogatories have been served but the requesting party believes that they are deficient because the answers are evasive or incomplete, or, because an objection is without merit, that party may move for an order compelling a further response. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 subd. (a).) The motion must set forth good cause justifying the discovery sought and be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 subd. (b).) The motion must be made within 45 days after service of verified responses in question, or any verified supplemental responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 subd. (c).)“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or bothpay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 subd. (a).)Meet and ConferA motion to compel further response to interrogatories must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.300 subd. (b).) The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿Here, the parties have not adequately met and conferred. Counsel for Plaintiff states she sent one meet and confer letter via email to Defendant and did not get a response. (Hollins Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5.) One email to counsel does not constitute a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal discovery.DiscussionPlaintiff seeks a Court order compelling Defendant’s further responses to form and special interrogatories, set one. At issue are form interrogatories nos. 1.1, 3.3, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 15.1, 17.1, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6 and special interrogatories, set one, nos. 1-25.Plaintiff served the first set of form interrogatories and special interrogatories on June 21, 2023. (Hollins Decl., ¶ 3.) On June 17, 2023, Plaintiff granted Defendant’s request for a 30-day extension to respond to discovery. (Hollins Decl., ¶ 3.) The responses were then due on August 25, 2023. (Hollins Decl., ¶ 4.) To date, no responses were filed.Here, the Court finds that Defendant has not provided responses to form interrogatories or special interrogatories, set one. A party may move to compel further responses “[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 subd. (a).) Here, Plaintiff has not received a response warranting further response.Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories is DENIED.SanctionsPlaintiff requests sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 subd. (c) and 2030.300 subd. (d). Plaintiff requests $3,060 in sanctions.The Court declines to award sanctions. “The court shall impose a monetary sanction…against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 subd. (e). Here, Plaintiff was not successful in moving for a motion to compel further responses. However, the Court declines to award sanctions for Defendant because Defendant failed to submit discovery responses.
