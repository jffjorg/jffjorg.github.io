(Defendant). Plaintiff’s first amended complaint (FAC) alleged a single cause of action for breach of contract – lease. Plaintiff leased the real property located at 15220 Canary Avenue, La Mirada, California (Property) to Defendant for a five year and four-month term beginning on September 1, 2015. (FAC, ¶ 6.) The base rent was set at $44,774.40. (FAC, ¶ 6.) Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to make rent payments and failed to repair and maintain the property in good condition. (FAC, ¶¶ 10, 13.)On October 13, 2023, Defendant filed a cross-complaint. On November 2, 2023, Defendant filed a first amended cross-complaint (FACC) alleging breach of contract – written lease and common count. The FACC alleges Defendant was not required to pay the rent for month two or any month after month sixty-one under the Lease. (FACC, ¶ 7.)Undisputed Material FactsPlaintiff is the owner of the Property. (UMF, ¶ 1.) On August 12, 2015, the parties entered a written commercial lease agreement (Lease) for a term of 64 months beginning on September 1, 2015, and ending on December 31, 2020. (UMF, ¶ 2.) The Lease required rent to be paid on the first of each month, and if it was not received after five days of that date, there was an added late charge of 10% of the overdue amount. (UMF, ¶ 5.) The Lease required Defendant to maintain the Property in good order, condition, and repair. (UMF, ¶ 6.)Evidentiary ObjectionsPlaintiff makes the following evidentiary objections to the declaration of Sunil Dhanraj:Paragraph 3: Overruled.Paragraph 5: Overruled.Paragraph 6: Overruled.Paragraph 8: Overruled.Paragraph 9: Overruled.Paragraph 10: Overruled.Paragraph 11: Sustained (lack of personal knowledge).Legal StandardThe function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c subd. (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)The moving party’s initial burden of proof, in moving for summary judgment, does not include disproving affirmative defenses, but instead involves proving each element of a cause of action. (Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 554, 564.)Once a moving party has satisfied the initial burden of proof, the burden “shifts to the opposing party to show, by responsive separate statement and admissible evidence, that triable issues of fact exist.” (Ostayan v. Serrano Reconveyance Co. (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1411, 1418, disapproved on other grounds by Black Sky Cap., LLC v. Cobb (2019) 7 Cal.5th 156, 165. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)An issue of damages must dispose of an entire cause of action. (DeCastro West Chodorow & Burns, Inc. v. Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 410, 422.) Summary adjudication as to punitive damages is proper only if a reasonable jury could not find clear and convincing proof of malice, fraud or oppression. (Johnson & Johnson v. Superior Court (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 762.)DiscussionPlaintiff moves for summary judgment on its single claim for breach of contract pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(a)(1), or in the alternative, summary adjudication, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 437c(f)(1), (2).For a cause of action for breach of contract, Plaintiff must establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)Here, Plaintiff has established the elements for its cause of action for breach of contract. Plaintiff established the first element because it is undisputed that the parties entered into the Lease. (UMF, ¶ 2.) Plaintiff performed its covenants, conditions, and promises under the Lease. (Poliquin Decl., ¶ 8.) Defendant breached the Lease by failing to pay the base rent for the period between October to December of 2020. (Poliquin Decl., Exh. 2.) Additionally, Defendant has not paid accrued late fees associated with untimely rental payments. (Poliquin Decl., ¶ 9.) Defendant also breached the lease by failing to keep the property in good order, condition, and repair as warranted by Paragraph 7.1(a) of the Lease. (Poliquin Decl., ¶ 12.) Lastly, Plaintiff provides evidence that it suffered damages totaling $220,024,19 consisting of unpair rent, late fees, and repair charges. (Poliquin Decl., ¶ 11; Exh 2.)The burden therefore shifts to Defendant to show that triable issues of fact exist. Defendant argues there are four triable issues. Defendant argues triable issues of fact exist as to (1) whether rent is unpaid, (2) late fees, (3) whether Defendant damaged the premises, and (4) whether Defendant can prevail on its FACC.Defendant contends that rent is not unpaid because the Rent Adjustment Addendum did not list rent payment amounts. Paragraph three of the Rent Adjustment Addendum includes the new base rents to be paid each month except for months 62 through 64. (Poliquin Decl., Exh 2.) Defendants argue that given the precedent of the pre-lease negotiations and that the Rent Adjustment Addendum specified that the month of September was “free,” that there was no rent payment charged between months 62 and 64. In response to requests for production of documents set two, requesting documents of any communications between Plaintiff and Defendant regarding the rental payments for October through December, Defendant provided the Lease. (Goldstein Decl., Exh 4.) The Lease states that the base rent of $44,744.40 applies between the dates of September 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020. (Goldstein Decl., Exh 4.) Therefore, there is unpaid rent for the months of October, November, and December of 2020.Defendant additionally contends that the June 2020 rent is not unpaid. Defendant provides an email in which Plaintiff deducts half of the June rent, the full July rent, and late charges from the balance in the security deposit. (Dhanraj Decl., Exh. 104.) In reply, Plaintiffs argue that the amount requested in unpaid rent subtracts the security deposit and is therefore correct. However, subtracting the security deposit does not adjust for months in which the security deposit was used to cover the rent payments. Accordingly, there is a triable issue of fact as to the amount due for the unpaid rent.Next, Defendant argues a triable material fact exists regarding late fees. Defendant argues that the liquidated damages cause is unenforceable under Ridgley v. Topa Thrift & Loan Assn. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 970, 977. Defendant argues that the liquidated damages cause did not reflect “a reasonable endeavor by the parties to estimate a fair average compensation” for the late fees. (See Ridgley, supra, 17 Cal.4th at 977.) However, as Plaintiff’s point out in reply, Ridgley is not current law as applied to non-consumer contracts. Moreover, it is undisputed that there was a late fee of 10% of any overdue amount. (UMF, ¶ 5; Poliquin Decl., Exh. 1, ¶ 13.4.)Defendant also contends late fees were improperly added for the month of July 2020. Defendant includes the wire transfers depicting a full and timely rent payment on July 1, 2020. (Dhanraj Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. 103.) Accordingly, there is a triable material fact as to the amount of late fees owed.Third, Defendant contends there is a triable material fact regarding whether Defendant damaged the premises. Specifically, Defendant argues certain claimed damages are not the fault of Defendant. Defendant provides emails with Plaintiff in which Defendant provides notice of issues with the bathroom inNovember of 2016. (Dhanraj Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. 109.) These emails are from one year after the commencement of the lease period. Defendant has not met its burden of providing substantial responsive evidence sufficient to constitute a triable issue of fact. (See Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)Lastly, Defendant contends there is a triable material fact as to whether it can prevail on its FACC. This issue will be discussed below as it is the subject of Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication.Motion for Summary AdjudicationIn the alternative, Plaintiff moves for summary adjudication on three grounds: (1) there is no defense to Plaintiff’s breach of contract action, (2) the FACC’s first cause of action for breach of contract cannot be established, and (3) the FACC’s second cause of action for common counts cannot be established.Plaintiff’s Breach of Contract ActionPlaintiff moves for summary adjudication on the grounds that there is no defense to Plaintiff’s breach of contract action. As set forth above, there is a triable issue of material fact as to the damages in Plaintiff’s breach of contract action. Accordingly, there is a defense. Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication as to its breach of contract cause of action is DENIED.Defendant’s Breach of Contract ActionPlaintiff moves for summary adjudication on the grounds that Defendant cannot establish all the elements in the FACC’s first cause of action for breach of contract. Specifically, Plaintiff argues Defendant cannot establish all the elements because Defendant breached the contract.For a cause of action for breach of contract, Defendant must establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)Here, Plaintiff has met its initial burden to show all the elements are not met. Plaintiff established the first element because it is undisputed that the parties entered into the Lease. (UMF, ¶ 2.) Plaintiff shows Defendant breached the Lease by failing to pay the base rent for the period between October to December of 2020. (Poliquin Decl., Exh. 2.) The burden thus shifts to Defendant to show a triable issue of fact exists.As explained in further detail above, Defendant relies on the Lease and Rent Adjustment Addendum to show that there is a triable issue of fact. However, the Lease states that the base rent of $44,744.40 applies between the dates of September 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020. (Goldstein Decl., Exh 4.) Therefore, Defendant did not pay rent for the months of October, November, and December of 2020. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication as to the FACC’s first cause of action for breach of contract is GRANTED.Defendant’s Common Counts Cause of ActionPlaintiff moves for summary adjudication as to the FACC’s second cause of action for common counts on the grounds that Defendant cannot establish all the elements.A cause of action for common counts – money had and received requires that (1) “defendant is indebted to plaintiff in a certain sum,” (2) “for money had and received by the defendant for the use of plaintiff.” (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.)Here, Plaintiff has met its initial burden. Plaintiff established that Defendant breached the Lease by failing to pay rent for the months of October, November, and December of 2020. The burden therefore shifts to Defendant.Defendant has shown there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Defendants owe an amount under the Lease. As explained above, Defendant has shown that the security deposit was applied to the rent payments in June of 2020. (Dhanraj Decl., Exh. 104.) Therefore, outside of the rent payments for October, November, and December of 2020, there are triable issues of material fact as to the amount owed by Defendant based on the security deposit. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication as to the FACC’s second cause of action is DENIED.
