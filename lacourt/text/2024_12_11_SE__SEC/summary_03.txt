  - The moving partyâ€™s initial burden of proof, in moving for summary judgment, does not include disproving affirmative defenses, but instead involves proving each element of a cause of action.
  - An issue of damages must dispose of an entire cause of action.
  - Summary adjudication as to punitive damages is proper only if a reasonable jury could not find clear and convincing proof of malice, fraud or oppression.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication on the defendant's first cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the defendant has failed to establish all the elements of that cause of action.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication on the defendant's second cause of action for common counts, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding the amount owed by the defendant.
