The FAP restarts the paragraph numbering in its statement of facts.

LACEC notes that, on April 5, 2024 and in connection with the previous
demurrer, Judge Beckloff granted judicial notice of LAAC sections 24.21 through
24.29 and minutes from the November 8, 2023 LACEC meeting.  Cameron Decl., ¶10.  Apparently, LACEC believes that once a matter
has been judicially noticed in a case, it may be used for all purposes.  This is incorrect.  LACEC should have re-presented these exhibits
to the court for the instant demurrer. 
Lee does not object to this procedure, however. 


[3] Counsel
for Lee and LACEC met and conferred telephonically on the demurrer to the FAP
on May 24, 2024, but continue to have disagreeing viewpoints as to the
underlying law.  Cameron Decl., ¶9.  LACEC has satisfied the requirements of CCP section 430.31(a).

LACEC also argues that the court should not grant Lee injunctive relief as he
has failed to establish such a remedy is necessary.   Dem. at 9-10.  As Lee points out, a demurrer cannot be made
to the relief sought.  The proper remedy
would have been a motion to strike, a fact pointed out by both Lee and Judge
Beckloff.  See Opp. at 7.
