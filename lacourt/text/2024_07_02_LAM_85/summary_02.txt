And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to the FAP and the use of judicially noticed exhibits by LACEC. The Judge notes that LACEC believes that once a matter has been judicially noticed, it can be used for all purposes, which is incorrect. The Judge also points out that LACEC should have re-presented the exhibits to the court for the instant demurrer. The Judge does not object to this procedure, however. The Judge also discusses the disagreement between counsel for Lee and LACEC regarding the underlying law. Additionally, the Judge notes that a demurrer cannot be made to the relief sought and that the proper remedy would have been a motion to strike. The Judge concludes that LACEC has satisfied the requirements of CCP section 430.31(a) but that the court should not grant Lee injunctive relief as he has failed to establish that such a remedy is necessary.
