And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Karla Meeks' motion to compel Defendant RP Realty Partners, LLC's deposition as moot. The defendant had failed to appear for its noticed deposition, but the parties had agreed to reschedule the deposition for May 7, 2024. The court found that the plaintiff's counsel had refused to cooperate with the defense counsel's unavailability for the noticed date. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the plaintiff had not engaged in meaningful meet-and-confer communication before filing the motion. The court encouraged the parties to resolve discovery disputes without court intervention in the future.
