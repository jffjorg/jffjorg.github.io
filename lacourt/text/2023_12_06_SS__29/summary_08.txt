And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved from the case. The motion is denied without prejudice. The counsel for the plaintiffs has declared that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, making it difficult for them to continue prosecuting the case. However, the counsel failed to file proof of service of the Notice of Motion and Declaration in Support to all parties who have appeared in the matter, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d). The Judge is unsure if the client was served at their last known address or the Court's address. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the moving party is directed to give notice.
