And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to continue trial from January 12, 2024 to early May 2024. The motion was filed by the defendants, Cedar-Sinai Medical Center and ABM Building Solutions LLC, due to ongoing discovery and to give them adequate time to prepare for trial. The defendants' motions to compel are scheduled for January 5, 2024 and January 19, 2024, after the discovery cut-off date of December 28, 2023. The Judge finds that the defendants have established good cause for continuing the trial date and that it will not unduly prejudice the plaintiff. The trial is continued to early May 2024, and the final status conference and all deadlines are reset accordingly.
