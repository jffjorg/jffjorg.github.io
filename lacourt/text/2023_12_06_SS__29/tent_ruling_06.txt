Background

on August 1, 2019.

2021, alleging the cause of action of Negligence. 
 
On
December 2, 2022, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Demand for Production. 
 
Defendants filed the Motions to
Compel S Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand for

for each motion, $2,580.00 total. The Court has not received any opposition.
 
 
Legal Standard
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party
must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial
responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
 
“[P]roviding
untimely responses does not divest the trial court of its authority [to hear a
motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not
contain objections [and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion
to compel responses … the trial court retains the authority to hear the
motion.”  (Id. at pp. 408-409.)  This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”  (Id.
at p. 408.)  If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,” the trial court may
“deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in
part, and just impose sanctions.”  (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)  
 
Discussion
On December 2,
2022, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Demand for Production. (Declaration of Tioni A. Phan, ¶ 2.)
Plaintiff did not respond. (Id. ¶ 3.)
Defendant need show nothing more.  Her motions to compel are GRANTED.
Defendant’s
requests for sanctions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of a motion to compel responses, and the economies of scale associated with
filing multiple discovery motions, the Court sets sanctions on each motion in
the amount of $360, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied
by counsel’s billing rate of $200 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Declaration of Tioni A. Phan, ¶ 8.)
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s
motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand
for Production are GRANTED.  The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant written responses,
without objection, within 30 days of notice of this order.
Defendant’s
requests for sanctions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay monetary
sanctions to Defendant under the Civil Discovery Act in the total amount of $1,080
($360 for each of the three motions) within 30 days of notice of this order.
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
