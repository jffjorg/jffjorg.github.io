  Case Number:  19STCV11835    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
The
motion to continue trial is GRANTED
Background
This arises from
a fall that occurred on April 12, 2017.  Plaintiff
Samuel Aurebach (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on April 5, 2019, asserting a cause
of action under premise liability against Defendant Cedar-Sinai Medical Center.
Plaintiff amended his complaint on June 23, 2021, to add Defendant ABM Building
Solutions LLC.
 
Defendants filed this Motion to Continue
Trial on November 8, 2023. 
Trial is set for January 12, 2024.
Legal
Standard
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the
court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make
them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance
should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12,
18.) 
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative
showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of
non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when determining whether good cause for a
trial continuance is present. A court considers factors such as: (1) the
proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance,
extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; (3) the prejudice that
parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (4) any
other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).)
Discussion
Here, Defendants move to continue trial to a
date after Defendants' Motions to Compel currently scheduled for January 5, 2024
and January 19, 2024. (Declaration of Joseph M. Radochonski, ¶ 11.) Defendants state that the discovery-motion cut-off
date is December 28, 2023. (Id.) Defendants argue they moved for an Ex
Parte for the motions to be timely heard, but the Ex Parte was denied. (Id.,
¶ 12.) Further, Defendants states Plaintiff’s counsel has recently request to
conduct a site inspection and depose Defendants’ person most knowledge. (Id.,
¶ 13.)
Defendants contend good cause exists to
continue the trial date as discovery continues to be ongoing, and to give Dependents
adequate time to prepare for trial. (Id., ¶ 14.) Defendant states this
is the sixth request for continuance. (Id., ¶ 3.) 
The Court finds that Defendants have
established good cause for continuing trial as Defendant's discovery motion
hearing dates are set after the discovery cut-off date. Further, Plaintiff’s
counsel has not opposed this motion; it thus appears that the continuance will not
unduly prejudice Plaintiff. 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the motion to continue trial. Trial is continued to early May 2024.  The Final Status Conference and all deadlines
are reset based on the new trial date. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
