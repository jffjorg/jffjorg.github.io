And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike with leave to amend. The motion sought to strike the portions of the plaintiff's complaint seeking attorney's fees and punitive damages. The court found that the plaintiff failed to allege facts that support the recovery of attorney's fees and that the prayer for punitive damages was insufficient. The court granted the defendant's motion to strike these portions of the complaint and granted the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint. The court also ordered the defendant to respond to the operative pleading and the plaintiff to file the amended complaint within 14 days.
