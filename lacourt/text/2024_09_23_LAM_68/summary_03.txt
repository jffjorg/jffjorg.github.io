And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to compel arbitration filed by Milestones Behavioral Treatment Program, Inc. (Petitioner) against Joseph Jose (Respondent). The Petitioner seeks to compel arbitration based on an arbitration provision in a Business Purchase Agreement and recover attorney fees. The judge finds that the Petitioner complies with the requirements for service and presentation of the dispute to arbitration, and therefore shifts the burden to the Respondent to establish a lack of enforceability of the arbitration agreement. Since the Respondent has not submitted any opposition, the Petitioner's petition to compel arbitration is granted. The judge also denies the Petitioner's request for attorney fees, citing lack of legal, statutory, or contractual support for the recovery of the requested fee.

The judge orders the parties to select an arbitration organization and individual arbitrator within the organization, or an individual arbitrator with no affiliation. If the parties cannot agree, they are to submit a list of one to two organizations and/or arbitrators from each party, and the court will select the organization or individual. The parties have 30 days from the date of the order to begin the selection process.

The court will set an Order to Show Cause re: Status of Arbitration, and the Petitioner is to give notice.
