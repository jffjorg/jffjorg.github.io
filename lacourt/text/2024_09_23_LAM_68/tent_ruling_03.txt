SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Petitioner Milestones Behavioral Treatment Program, Inc.,
filed a petition to compel arbitration on August 6, 2024. 
 
RULING: Granted in
Part/Denied in Part.
Petitioner
Milestones Behavioral Treatment Program, Inc. filed a petition to compel
arbitration based on the arbitration provision in the Business Purchase
Agreement And Joint Escrow Instructions as to Respondent Joseph Jose. Petitioner
also seeks recovery of attorney fees. The court electronic filing system shows no
opposition or reply at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
“A
written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a
controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon
such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.) “On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the
existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party
thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines
that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
“In the absence of any existing contract action, a section 1281.2 petition may
be filed independently, in which case it commences an independent lawsuit to
enforce the agreement to arbitrate.” (Frog Creek Partners, LLC v. Vance
Brown, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 515, 532.) 
 
The law creates a general presumption in favor of
arbitration. In a motion to
compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a preponderance of evidence
the existence of the arbitration agreement and that the dispute is covered by
the agreement. “‘Under “both
federal and state law, the threshold question presented by a petition to compel
arbitration is whether there is an agreement to arbitrate.”’” (Long v. Provide Commerce, Inc. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 855, 861.) “Private arbitration is a
matter of agreement between the parties and is governed by contract law. (Platt Pacific, Inc. v. Andelson (1993)
6 Cal.4th 307, 313.) In a
motion to compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a preponderance of
evidence the existence of the arbitration agreement and that the dispute is
covered by the agreement. The burden then shifts to the resisting party to
prove by a preponderance of evidence a ground for denial (e.g., fraud,
unconscionability, etc.). (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin'l Securities Corp.
(1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413-414; Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164–165; Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr.,
Inc. (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 754, 758.) Any challenges to the formation of the arbitration agreement
should be considered before any order sending the parties to arbitration. The trier of fact weighs all evidence, including
affidavits, declarations, documents, and, if applicable, oral testimony to
determine whether the action goes to arbitration. (Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr.,
Inc., supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 758.)
 
Barring a conflict supporting a preemption of a specific
provision under FAA, the court adheres to the California standard for
compelling arbitration in that FAA and California adhere to the same standards
for review of arbitration agreements. The court finds no conflict with the FAA
under the terms of the agreement. (Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior University (1989) 489 U.S. 468, 477–479; Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman Properties 8 LLC (2020)
46 Cal.App.5th 337, 346; see Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc.
(2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, 1119; Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana (2022) 142 S.Ct.
1906.) 
 
The petition
incorporates a copy of the relied upon agreement, which contains an arbitration
provision. [Declarations of Joyce Williams and Philip Green.] Petitioner
represents the dispute arose upon Respondent’s refusal to comply with the
contract provisions, specifically payment of $285,000 after assumption of
business operations. The petition and notice of hearing were both served on
Respondent.
 
The court finds Petitioner complies with all requirements
for service and presentation of the dispute to arbitration. The burden
therefore shifts to Plaintiff to establish a lack of enforceability of the
arbitration agreement. (Rosenthal
v. Great Western Fin'l Securities Corp., supra, 14 Cal.4th at pp. 413-414; Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic, supra, 72 Cal.App.5th at pp. 164–165; Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr.,
Inc., supra,
144 Cal.App.4th at p. 758.) Respondent
submits no opposition. 
 
The
petition to compel arbitration is GRANTED.
 
On
the request for attorney fees, the court neither finds any legal, statutory or contractual
support for the recovery of the requested fee as the prevailing party in
compelling the arbitration agreement. (Findleton
v. Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians
(2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 565, 572 (footnote 3); Acosta v. Kerrigan (2007)
150 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1132; Bell v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (2001) 87
Cal.App.4th 805, 833.) The motion for attorney fees is therefore DENIED.
 
As for the arbitration process, the agreement itself only
requires the appointment of a qualified arbitrator with no other specific
criteria. Given the absence of selection criteria, the court cites to the
applicable code section:
 
If
the arbitration agreement does not provide a method for appointing an
arbitrator, the parties to the agreement who seek arbitration and against whom
arbitration is sought may agree on a method of appointing an arbitrator and
that method shall be followed. In the absence of an agreed method, or if the
agreed method fails or for any reason cannot be followed, or when an arbitrator
appointed fails to act and his or her successor has not been appointed, the
court, on petition of a party to the arbitration agreement, shall appoint the
arbitrator.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.6.)
 
The motion to compel is brought under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281, et seq. The court therefore finds the language of
section 1281.6 applicable.
 
The participating parties are therefore ordered to select an
arbitration organization and individual arbitrator within the organization, or
an individual arbitrator with no affiliation. If the parties cannot agree on an
organization, and/or arbitrator, the court orders the parties to submit a list
of one to two organizations and/or arbitrators from each party, where the court
will select the organization or individual. In other words, the parties may
submit up to a total of two nominations per side. The parties have 30 days from
the date of this order to begin the selection process, with any proposed list
due the day after the lapse of the 30-day period. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.6.) 
 
The court will set an OSC re: Status of Arbitration.
 
Petitioner to give notice.
