The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add new defendants, an additional product, and two new causes of action for statutory violations. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that it seeks to evade the motion for judgment on the pleadings and that the addition of new defendants is premature and causes undue prejudice. The court found that the proposed amendments comply with the Rules of Court provisions and that the delay in seeking leave was not prejudicial. The court also declined to consider the arguments regarding the notice of defect violations raised in the motion for judgment on the pleadings and questioned the defendants' standing to raise arguments on behalf of unnamed defendants. The plaintiff is ordered to separately file the first amended complaint within 10 days of the order.
