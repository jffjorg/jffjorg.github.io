And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to compel responses to their Requests for Production, Set 1, and imposes sanctions on the Plaintiff and their counsel. The motion was filed on September 29, 2023, after the Defendant served the Requests for Production, Set 1 on July 14, 2023, and the Plaintiffs failed to serve responses by the agreed-upon deadline of August 29, 2023. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs' failure to comply with their discovery obligations warrants an order compelling responses without objections, and also entitles the Defendant to sanctions in the amount of $720.00.
