  Case Number:  21STCV07006    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  14 #2Case Background Plaintiff alleges that  Defendants rented his house for a small vacation party of no more than 9  people, expressly promising not to add guests or conduct any commercial  activity, including filming, while they were occupying the premises. Defendants  then brought 40 people and a commercial film crew to the property, battered the  Plaintiff when he told them to leave, stole his phone, and vandalized the  property. On February 22, 2021,  Plaintiffs filed their Complaint for (1) Fraud, (2) Breach of Contract, (3)  Battery, (4) Conversion, and (5) Trespass against Defendants Jonathan Kirk  (“Kirk”), Kinsza Virgil (“Virgil”), and DOES 1-40. On April 1, 2022, the  default of Defendant Virgil was entered. On June 6, 2022, Defendant Kirk filed  his Answer. On November 1, 2022, this court  entered a separate default judgment against Defendant Virgil. On November 23,  2022, Defendant Virgil filed her notice of appeal. On January 6, 2023, the  Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The case remains pending as to  Defendant Kirk. On November 8, 2022, this court  granted a stay on discovery directed to Defendant Kirk. On July 24, 2024, Willim  Briggs, Joshua Rosenberg, and Christina Nordster, Counsel for Defendant  Jonathan Kirk, filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. On August 7, 2024, the Court  continued the hearing on the motion to be relieved as counsel to allow Counsel  to file form MC-052. On August 8, 2024, Counsel  filed the missing form. Jury Trial is currently set for  September 3, 2024. Instant Pleading Counsel for Defendant Jonathan Kirk move to be relieved  as counsel. Decision The motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant  Jonathan Kirk filed by Willim Briggs, Joshua Rosenberg, and Christina Nordster  is GRANTED, effective upon the filing  of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. Box 5(a) of form  MC-053 must be checked to accurately reflect this order.   Legal Standard California Rules of Court Rule  3.1362 requires that counsel fill out forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. These  forms serve two basic functions: (1) ensuring that notice is given to the  client and (2) providing the court with an adequate explanation of why the  matter is being handled via motion rather than mutual consent. See Code of  Civil Procedure § 284; California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362. Discussion Counsel completed the required forms. Those forms  indicate that Counsel served Kirk at his last known address which they  confirmed was current via telephone, conversation, and private investigator, at  least 30 days before the hearing on this matter. Briggs represents that he has a medical condition which  renders it difficult for him to carry out representation effectively under Cal.  Rules of Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.16(b)(8). Additionally, there has been a breach  of the engagement agreement and a breakdown of the attorney-client  relationship. Counsel complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1362,  and relief is appropriate.  Conclusion The motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant  Jonathan Kirk filed by Willim Briggs, Joshua Rosenberg, and Christina Nordster  is GRANTED, effective upon the filing  of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. Box 5(a) of form  MC-053 must be checked to accurately reflect this order.
