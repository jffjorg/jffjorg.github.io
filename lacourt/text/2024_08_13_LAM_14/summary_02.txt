And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer with 60 days' leave to amend. The defendant, Zonzon Organic, LLC, is a self-represented corporation that failed to pay rent and failed to repay missed rent. The judge has ruled that a corporation must be represented by an attorney in court, citing the cases of Clean Air Transp. Sys. v. San Mateo County Transit Dist. and CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon. The defendant's answer is defective because it was not properly subscribed by an attorney, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 446(a). The judge has allowed the defendant 60 days to amend its answer and obtain legal representation.
