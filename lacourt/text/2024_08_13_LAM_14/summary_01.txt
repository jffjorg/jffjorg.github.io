```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Jonathan Kirk, filed by Willim Briggs, Joshua Rosenberg, and Christina Nordster. The motion was filed due to a medical condition that renders it difficult for Briggs to carry out representation effectively, as well as a breach of the engagement agreement and a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The judge has ordered that the relief be effective upon the filing of proof of service of the signed order upon the client.
