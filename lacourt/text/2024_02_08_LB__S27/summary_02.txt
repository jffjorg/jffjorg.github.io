And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and the motion for judgment on the pleadings directed at the original complaint. The ruling states that the breach of contract cause of action has not meaningfully changed since the original complaint was filed, and that the Court's previous ruling on the motion for terminating sanctions is dispositive in this regard.

The judge has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings and overruled the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint. The ruling also states that the fraud-based causes of action are pled with the requisite specificity, despite the defendants' arguments to the contrary.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file a responsive pleading within ten days and has given notice of the ruling. The parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so, and must include the case number and identify the party submitting on the tentative.
