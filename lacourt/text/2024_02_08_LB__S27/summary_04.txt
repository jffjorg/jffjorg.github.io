Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to vacate the order granting a new trial. The defendants argue that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the new trial because the 75-day time limit for doing so had expired. The plaintiff argues that the court had the power to reconsider its prior ruling and that the defendants' failure to request oral argument on the new trial order constitutes a concession. The judge finds that the court's power to reconsider its prior ruling expires upon entry of judgment, and that the plaintiff's motion for new trial was deemed denied by operation of law when the 75-day time limit expired. The judge also finds that the defendants did not concede the relief by failing to request oral argument, and that the plaintiff could have and should have insisted on a ruling on the motion prior to the expiration of the 75-day period. The motion to vacate the new trial order is granted, and the court's prior order is vacated.
