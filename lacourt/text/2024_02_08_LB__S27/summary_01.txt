And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to dismiss and a motion for terminating sanctions. The moving parties, defendants and cross-defendants, are seeking to dismiss the cross-complaint, the first amended complaint, and the first amended cross-complaint. The opposing parties, plaintiffs and cross-complainants, are opposing the motion to dismiss.

The judge has found that the 3/23/23 hearing was actually the first phase of the trial of this action, and that trial commenced on that date. Therefore, the five-year statute is satisfied, and the motion to dismiss is denied.

The moving parties are also seeking terminating sanctions against Acapulco Inn Holdings LLC, which is a suspended corporation. The judge has found that the corporation is not participating in the action, and that an order terminating its claims would have no practical effect. Therefore, the motion for terminating sanctions is denied.

The case is set for a hearing on February 8, 2024. The parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court and identify the party submitting. If a party does not submit on the tentative, the party must make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
