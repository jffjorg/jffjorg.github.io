Significant Statements:

  - "Defendant does not, in its opposing points and authorities and/or separate statement, address many of the objections asserted. Those objections are therefore not justified and overruled."
  - "One element of a Song-Beverly complaint is that the defendant's failure to buy back was not reasonable. Clearly, a manufacturer's communications with its dealerships concerning whether, when, and how to comply with warranty terms are relevant to this issue."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by Victor Felix against Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (Volkswagen) for violation of the Song-Beverly Act. The case involves a dispute over the production of documents related to the diagnosis of electrical and engine defects in a subject vehicle. Volkswagen had objected to the production of these documents, but failed to justify its objections. The judge has therefore overruled these objections and ordered Volkswagen to serve further responses, without objections, within ten days. The judge also notes that the responses provided by Volkswagen are deficient and do not meet the burden of justifying objections. The judge cites relevant law and case authority in support of its ruling, including the Song-Beverly Act, CCP ยง2031.240(b) and (c)(1), Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255, and Santana v. FCA US LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.4th 334, 346.
