And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Royal LLC to dismiss the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Teodora Vasquez, Gladyz Perez, and Scarlett Vasquez. The Plaintiffs allege that Royal failed to maintain the property they rented from February 2017 to October 2020, resulting in various negative conditions. The judge finds that the continuing violation doctrine applies to the Plaintiffs' tort claims, including negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and overrules Royal's demurrer as to those claims. The judge also overrules Royal's demurrer as to the contract claim, but does not decide the issue of whether the claim is timely or not under the applicable statute of limitations. The judge's ruling allows the Plaintiffs' claims to proceed, but the parties may still have an opportunity to further develop the factual record and argue the issue of timeliness at a later stage in the litigation.
