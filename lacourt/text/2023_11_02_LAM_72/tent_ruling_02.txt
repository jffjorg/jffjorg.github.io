Defendant Royal LLC (“Royal”) moves to dismiss the First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed by Plaintiffs Teodora Vasquez, Gladyz Perez,
and Scarlett Vasquez (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).
 
As set out in this order, Royal’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
Background
 
          From
February 1, 2017 to October 27, 2020, Plaintiffs lived at 5937 S. Avalon
Boulevard, Unit 6, Los Angeles, CA 90003 (the “Property”). Plaintiffs rented
the property from Royal. Plaintiffs allege that Royal failed to maintain the
property, resulting in a number of conditions including plumbing problems, lack
of hot water, lack of working heating facilities, pest issues, mold issues,
other sanitation problems, and structural problems with the building. These
conditions continued until they caused Plaintiffs to vacate the property on
October 27, 2020.
 
Plaintiffs filed the Complaint on September 13, 2022,
alleging (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the implied warranty of
habitability; (3) nuisance; (4) negligence; (5) intentional infliction of
emotional distress (“IIED”); (6) wrongful eviction; and (7) violation of Civil
Code section 1942.4.
The Court sustained a demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ breach of
contract, negligence, and IIED claims on the basis of the statute of
limitations. The FAC, which is now the operative complaint, was filed on
September 7, 2023 and alleges the same causes of action as the complaint. 
 
Royal demurred to Plaintiffs’ breach of contract,
negligence, and IIED claims on September 13, 2023. Plaintiffs filed an
opposition and Royal filed a reply.
          
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
 
“In order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be
raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the
face of the complaint; it is not enough that the complaint shows merely that
the action may be barred.” (McMahon v. Republic Van & Storage Co.
(1963) 59 Cal.2d 871, 874.)
 
 
Discussion
 
Royal demurs on the grounds that the statute of limitations
has run for Plaintiffs’ breach of contract, negligence, and IIED claims. 
 
“[A]t common law, a cause of action accrues when it is
complete with all of its elements[.]” (Aryeh v. Canon Business Solutions,
Inc. (2013) 55 Cal.4th 1185, 1191 [internal quotations and citations
omitted].) This is known as the “last element” accrual rule: ordinarily, the
statute of limitations runs from the occurrence of the last element essential
to the cause of action. (Ibid.)
 
The Court previously sustained a demurrer as to these same
three causes of action on the basis that Plaintiffs alleged only that the
wrongful acts occurred in April 2018, more than four years before the Complaint
was filed. The FAC now alleges that the negative conditions at the Property
remained until the time when Plaintiffs vacated the Property.
 
 
Negligence and IIED
 
          The
statute of limitations for negligence is two years. (Code Civ. Proc. § 335.1.) The
statute of limitations for IIED is two years. (Unruh-Haxton v. Regents of
University of California (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 343, 356-357, citing Code
Civ. Proc. § 335.1.)
 
Royal argues that “if continuing injury from a completed act
generally extended the limitations periods, those periods would lack meaning.
Parties could file suits at any time, as long as their injuries persisted. This
is not the law”. (Vaca v. Wachovia Mortgage Corp. (2011) 198 CaI.App.4th
737, 745.)
 
First, there is the initial question of when the injuries
occurred. Plaintiffs began to notice the negative conditions in April of 2018.
Royal argues that Plaintiffs improperly amended their complaint to add the
allegation that the negative conditions were ongoing for the remaining duration
of their tenancy, thereby changing the essential facts and foregoing the FAC’s
ability to relate back to the Complaint. (Scholes v. Lambirth Trucing Co.
(2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 590, 598.) Royal argues that, as a result, Plaintiffs can
only allege that the injuries happened at the time when they first noticed the
conditions. This argument is unpersuasive. 
 
“In
determining whether the amended complaint alleges facts that are sufficiently
similar to those alleged in the original complaint, we consider whether the
defendant had adequate notice of the claim based on the original pleading. The
policy behind statutes of limitations is to put a defendant on notice of the
need to defend against a claim in time to prepare an adequate defense. This
requirement is met when recovery under an amended complaint is sought on the
same basic set of facts as the original pleading.
 
          (Id.
at p. 599.)
 
          Here,
the essential facts of Plaintiffs’ claims are the same. Plaintiffs have
not contradicted any factual assertions from the Complaint. Plaintiffs allege
the existence of the same conditions that Royal received notice of through the
Complaint. Furthermore, Royal had actual notice that the conditions were
ongoing because Plaintiffs repeatedly notified Royal by letter and in person of
the ongoing conditions to request that they be fixed. (FAC ¶ 12.) Thus, the
relation back does not subvert the purpose of the statute of limitations here.
 
The Court now evaluates when the statute of limitations
began to run under these facts. 
 
Under tort law, where a tort involves a continuing wrong,
the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the date of the last
injury or when the tortuous acts cease. (Birschtein v. New United
Manufacturing, Inc. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 994, 1003; Pugliese v.
Superior Court (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1444, 1452.)
 
          Here,
the tortious act alleged is Royal’s failure to maintain the property. This is
not a “completed act” (Vaca, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 745),
but rather an ongoing failure of a landlord to meet its duty to maintain a
property. Royal argues that each violation was a discrete act, obfuscating the
fact that each of the alleged violations formed a continuous stretch of inaction
that was necessarily non-discrete. A landlord leaves an apartment in severe
disrepair for long enough does not find his hands washed clean at the two-year
mark; rather, the extended length of time.
 
          The
Court therefore OVERRULES the demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ negligence and IIED
claims.
          
 
Breach of Contract
 
          There
is a four-year statute of limitations for breach of contract. (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 337.) 
 
          Royal
argues that the initial breach occurred in April 2018, which is more than four
years before the Complaint was filed on September 13, 2022. Plaintiff responds
that the ongoing conditions at the property triggers the continuous violation
doctrine, and that claims over all of the harm encompassed by the negative
conditions are timely as long as some of the conditions existed within the
statute of limitations.
 
“The continuing violation doctrine aggregates a series of
wrongs or injuries for purposes of the statute of limitations, treating the
limitations period as accruing for all of them upon commission or sufferance of
the last of them.” (Aryeh v. Canon Business Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55
Cal.4th 1185, 1192.) The continuing violation doctrine is intended to make
actionable a series of small harms, any one of which may not be actionable on
its own. (Id. at pp. 1197-1198.) However, where a plaintiff alleges a series
of discrete, independently actionable wrongs, the continuing violation doctrine
does not apply. (Id. at p. 1198.) Similarly, where a course of wrongful
conduct only becomes apparent through the accumulation of a series of harms,
the continuing violation doctrine will apply – but not where a plaintiff was
aware of the harm and recognized it as wrongful early on. (Ibid.)
 
Conversely, “under the theory of continuous accrual, a
series of wrongs or injuries may be viewed as each triggering its own
limitations period, such that a suit for relief may be partially time-barred as
to older events but timely as to those within the applicable limitations
period.” (Aryeh, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 1192.)
 
The Court has been unable to find clear law as to whether
the contract action should be decided under the continuing accrual or
continuous violation theory of limitations. It would be helpful to the Court to
further develop the factual record relating to the contract claim before
deciding whether the contract claim, or any portion of it, is time-barred.
Furthermore, because the Court overrules the demurrer as to the tort causes of
action, which contain the same factual nexus, there is no practical reason to
decide this issue at the pleading stage. Because the defect must “clearly and
affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint” (McMahon, supra,
59 Cal.2d at p. 874), the Court will overrule the demurrer on the contract
cause of action, leaving to a later stage in the litigation the question of
whether the earlier wrongs should be considered timely or not under the
applicable statute of limitations.
 
The Court therefore OVERRULES Royal’s demurrer as to the
contract claim.
