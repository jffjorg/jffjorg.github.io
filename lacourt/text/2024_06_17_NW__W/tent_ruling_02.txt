BACKGROUND
 
This
is a breach of fiduciary duty action. Plaintiffs Harges Family Partnership, LP
and Lorelei Harges, Trustee of the Harges Community Property Trust allege
Plaintiffs entered into multiple agreements to sell seven pieces of real
property to several buyers. Chartwell agreed to act as the escrow company for
the transactions. Plaintiffs allege per Section C of the Addendum, the escrow
holder, Chartwell, was supposed to release the deposits to the plaintiffs one
business day after their receipt. However, Plaintiffs allege Chartwell never
released any of the deposits to the plaintiffs and instead, Chartwell returned
the deposits to the buyers.

Ruling
 
Defendant Chartwells Escrow, Inc.’s Motion to
Dismiss Complaint for Plaintiffs’ Failure to Obey Court Order re Filing Amended
Complaint After Demurrer Sustained With Leave to Amend is GRANTED 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Chartwell Escrow, Inc. moves for an
order of dismissal of the complaint of Plaintiffs’ Harges Family Partnership,
LP, and Loreli Harges, Trustee of the Hargest Community Property Trust pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 581(f)(2) and California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1320(h). 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 581 provides that a court may dismiss the complaint as to
that defendant when, after a demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, the
plaintiff fails to amend the complaint within the time allowed by the court and
either party moves for dismissal. (CCP § 581(f).) While dismissal under Code of
Civil Procedure section 581(f) is discretionary, any such dismissal must be
with prejudice. (Cano v. Glover (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 326, 330.) “No
cases have held that a dismissal pursuant to section 581, subdivision (f)(2)
may be without prejudice. The right to dismiss without prejudice is expressly
permitted by other subdivisions of section 581 but section 581, subdivision
(f)(2) does not so provide.”¿(Id. at 229.) 
 
Pursuant to
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1320, following a ruling on a demurrer,
unless otherwise ordered, leave to answer or amend within 10 days is deemed
granted.
 
Defendant
Chartwell’s demurrer to all causes of action in the complaint was sustained on
March 18, 2024, with 45 days leave to amend. Accordingly, Plaintiff had until
May 2, 2024 to file their amended complaint. As of the date of this hearing,
Plaintiff has not served or filed an amended pleading nor did they seek an
extension before Defendant filed the present motion. 
 
Such failure can be
construed as a presumption that Plaintiff has no meritorious argument(s). (See Southern
California Gas Co. v. Flannery (2016), 5 Cal. App. 5th 476, 483, fn.7 (lack
of opposition waives arguments); Sexton v. Superior Court (1997), 58
Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.) Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant Chartwell’s
motion and Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
