And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff failed to amend the complaint after the demurrer was sustained with leave to amend. The defendant, Chartwell Escrow, Inc., moved to dismiss the complaint for the plaintiff's failure to obey the court order. The court found that the plaintiff's failure to amend the complaint can be construed as a presumption that they have no meritorious argument. Therefore, the court granted the defendant's motion and dismissed the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice.
