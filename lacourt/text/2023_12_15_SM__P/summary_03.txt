And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Hill v. Sundquist, et al., Case No. 23SMCV04183. The hearing is scheduled for December 15, 2023. The court has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the complaint and motion to strike, dismissing the plaintiff's claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the claim for punitive damages. The court's ruling is based on its interpretation of California Civil Code §841(b)(2) and §3294, as well as relevant case law. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff did not allege compliance with the statutory notice requirements for replacing the shared fence, and that the defendant's alleged conduct was not extreme or outrageous and did not rise to the level of wrongdoing required to support punitive damages. The court has given the plaintiff ten days to amend the complaint to allege compliance with the statutory notice requirements.
