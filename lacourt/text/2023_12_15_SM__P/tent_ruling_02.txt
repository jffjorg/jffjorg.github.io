Crestwood Hills
Association v. Broumand, Case No. 23SMCV02981
Hearing Date December
15, 2023 
Broumand Defendants’
Demurrer to Crestwood Hills Association’s Complaint 
 
The Broumands
demur, arguing lack of standing. The Broumands asserted the same argument in
opposition to the Association’s motion to compel arbitration. See 9/29/2023
opposition at pgs. 12-15, 11/21/2023 supplemental opposition at pgs. 1-4. The
court considered those arguments and rejected them, concluding the Association had
standing to enforce community CC&Rs as the successor-in-interest to the
original developer. The court set forth its reasoning regarding the
Association’s standing in its 11/30/2023 minute order on the arbitration
motion, to which both parties submitted without oral argument. See 11/30/2023
minute order at pgs. 2-3. The court declines to alter that reasoning now. The
demurrer is overruled to the extent it is based on standing. 
 
The Broumands argue
the complaint fails to allege a cause of action. They note the complaint
alleges facts and requests relief but does not name a specific cause or causes
of action. The court agrees this renders the complaint uncertain. The
Association to amend its complaint to state the cause(s) of action alleged. SUSTAINED
with ten days leave to amend.
