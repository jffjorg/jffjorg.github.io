MOTION TO PRECLUDE DR. NOURIAN FROM TESTIFYING
AT TRIAL
Hearing Date: 10/15/24¿  
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV26067 BRITHNEY
GONZALEZ vs BRENDA JIMENEZ et al. 
Moving Party: Defendant Brenda
Jimenez
Responding Party:
Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient¿¿  
Ruling: MOTION TO PRECLUDE DR. NOURIAN FROM
TESTIFYING AT TRIAL IS DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE  
 
Defendant seeks a court order precluding Plaintiff’s expert, Dr.
Nourian, from testifying at trial.
 
Defendant bases this motion on Evidence Code section 352. Section
352 provides the Court with discretion to exclude evidence if its probative
value is substantially outweighed by the risk of undue consumption of time,
undue prejudice, or potential to mislead the jury. This provision allows the
Court to exclude evidence either through evidentiary objections or via motions
in limine.
 
Given that in the Personal Injury Hub system this case will be
tried by a different judicial officer than the one ruling on this motion at
this time, the Court finds it appropriate for the trial judge to determine
whether Plaintiff’s expert should be precluded from testifying at trial.
 
The court denies this motion without prejudice;
the trial court judge is the appropriate judicial officer to address this issue
at the time of ruling on motions in limine.
