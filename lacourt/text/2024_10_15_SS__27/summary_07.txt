And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service and set aside the default filed by Defendant Melvin Quijano. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiff's failure to properly serve the summons and complaint. The judge found that the substitute service was flawed because the person served, Alfredo Perez, was not a competent member of the household and was not authorized to accept service on behalf of the defendant. As a result, the judge concluded that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant and granted the motion to quash service. Additionally, the judge granted the motion to set aside the default because the defendant did not receive proper service of the summons and complaint.
