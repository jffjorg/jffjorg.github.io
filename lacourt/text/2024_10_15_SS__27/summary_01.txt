The continuance is granted due to Sabet-Baktash's required attendance at a trial in Berlin, Germany, on November 13, 2024. The judge has denied the parties' request to continue the trial to June 2025, and instead has set the trial for December 2, 2024. The judge has also denied Sabet-Baktash's request to reopen discovery, as no justification was provided.
