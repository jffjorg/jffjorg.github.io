And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses and to compel initial responses in the case of Galina Kopelev vs. Churchill Condominium Association et al. The court appointed a discovery referee, Hon. Ann Kough (Ret.), to address issues arising from the initial discovery requests. The referee heard the parties' arguments and made recommendations to the court. The court adopts the recommendations as its own. The recommendations include ordering the defendant to further respond to certain discovery requests and ordering the plaintiff to do the same. The court also orders that all documents be produced as TIFF images with metadata intact, including a statement about any lost or destroyed documents. The court denies sanctions and gives the parties notice that they must file an objection to the tentative ruling or appear at the hearing to argue.
