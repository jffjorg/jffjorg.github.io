Judge Hon. Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant SSA Enterprises, LLC's motion to continue the trial date in the case of Alexander Kanakis vs Anschutz Entertainment Group et al. The case involves a premises liability action arising from an incident at the Coachella Music Festival, where a sound engineer was injured when a large light fixture rolled off the stage and onto his lower back. The trial was originally set for December 9, 2024, but Defendant SSA Enterprises, LLC is seeking a continuance to December 2025 due to the need for additional time to conduct discovery, including written discovery, depositions, and expert discovery, as well as the expected addition of new parties to the case. Plaintiff opposes the continuance, suggesting a trial continuance to June 2025.

The new trial date is set for October ____, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and the Final Status Conference is continued to October ____ , 2025, at 10:00 a.m.
