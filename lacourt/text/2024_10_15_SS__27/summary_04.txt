And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the motion to seal documents in the case 21STCV40558 is continued. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Ashley Oelsen, who seeks to redact certain documents in the case, including personal medical records, reproductive history, and mental health evaluations. The court notes that the plaintiff's medical condition and history are directly related to the claims and defenses in the medical malpractice action, but that the requested redactions may not be narrowly tailored.

The court also notes that the plaintiff failed to serve unredacted versions of the documents to opposing counsel, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(2). The court is willing to make the appropriate findings and seal documents that warrant it, but requires the plaintiff to provide a more narrowly tailored request and to file an exhibit containing unredacted documents that can be filed under seal.

The motion is continued to allow the plaintiff to provide the necessary information and to give the court an opportunity to make a more informed decision on the motion.
