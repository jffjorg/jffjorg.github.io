Legal Standard
 
“‘Service of process, under longstanding
tradition in our system of justice, is fundamental to any procedural imposition
on a named defendant.’ [Citation.]” (AO Alfa-Bank v. Yakovlev (2018) 21
Cal.App.5th 189, 202.) “To establish personal jurisdiction, compliance with
statutory procedures for service of process is essential.” (Kremerman v.
White (2021). 71 Cal.App.5th 358, 371.) Defendant’s knowledge of the action
does not dispense with statutory requirements for service of summons. (Kappel
v. Bartlett (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466.)
 
“When a defendant challenges the court’s
personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden
is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter
alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.)¿¿ 
 
Filing of proof of service that complies with
the applicable statutory requirements creates a rebuttable presumption of
proper service. (Am. Express Centurion Bank v. Zara, (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) The moving party may then introduce evidence to rebut
this presumption.
 
Discussion
 
On May 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed the present case against Defendant
Melvin William Martinez Quijano. On June 9, 2024, Defendant was allegedly
served by substitute service. On August 1, 2024, a default was entered against
Defendant. Defendant now moves to quash service on the basis that service was
improper.
 
The Proof of Service indicates that on June 9, 2024, at 1:58 p.m.,
Plaintiff served Defendant through substitute service by delivering the summons
and complaint to “Alfredo Perez,” a purported co-occupant at 10435 Omelveny
Ave, Pacoima, CA 91331-3712. While Plaintiff’s proof of service technically
complies with statutory requirements and creates a rebuttable presumption of
proper service (Am. Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 383, 390), Defendant has introduced sufficient evidence to rebut
this presumption.
 
Defendant Quijano declares that although he resides at 10435
Omelveny Ave, Alfredo Perez does not live at that address, has never lived
there, and is not a co-occupant. Furthermore, Perez has never been authorized
to accept service on Defendant’s behalf. This challenges the validity of the
substitute service, as CCP § 415.20(b) requires that the documents be served on
a competent member of the household.
 
Plaintiff did not file an opposition or provide any countervailing
evidence to support the validity of service. The Court finds that Defendant has
successfully demonstrated that Alfredo Perez was not a competent member of the
household, which makes the substituted service flawed. As a result, Defendant's
motion to quash service is GRANTED. 
 
Additionally, because Defendant did not receive proper service of
the summons and complaint, and the parties were engaged in communications
regarding a potential pre-litigation settlement from April to August 2024,
Defendant’s counsel was taken by surprise when Plaintiff took Defendant’s
default. Defendant acted promptly after discovering the default by moving to
quash service and set aside the default. Plaintiff did not file an opposition
contesting Defendant’s contentions. Thus, Defendant’s motion to set aside
default is also GRANTED.
