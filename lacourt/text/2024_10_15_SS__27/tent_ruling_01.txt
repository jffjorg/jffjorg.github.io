CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV07948 GABRIELA
SABET-BAKTASH vs CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff 
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED
 
On March 1, 2021,
Plaintiff filed the present trip and fall case. Trial is currently set for
November 14, 2024. Plaintiff requests a short continuance to December 2, 2024,
because she has a trial in Berlin, Germany, on November 13, 2024. The Berlin
case, titled Sabet v. Holzmuller, is set for trial on November 13, 2024,
at the Landgericht Potsdam Court in Berlin, and requires Plaintiff’s in-person
testimony. Plaintiff attempted to reschedule the Berlin trial but was informed
that the date is firm and will not be continued. After discussing this with
opposing counsel, Plaintiff proposed a December 2, 2024, trial date in Los
Angeles, but opposing counsel raised concerns about a conflict with her prepaid
vacation at the end of December and requested a continuance to June 2025.
The Court finds good
cause to grant a short continuance due to Plaintiff’s required attendance at
the trial in Germany. However, given that the trial of this slip and fall case
should not take more than a couple weeks to try, and the case has been pending
since 2021, the Court declines the parties' request to continue the trial to
June 2025, and instead sets trial for December 2, 2024.
Moreover, the only
basis for the continuance is Plaintiff’s trial in Germany. The Court thus denies
Plaintiff’s request to reopen discovery, as no justification was provided.
The new trial date is
set for December 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference is continued
to November __, 2024,
at 10:00 a.m. All other case-related deadlines will not follow the new trial
date.
