And here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Brenda Jimenez, has moved to preclude the plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. Nourian, from testifying at trial. The defendant bases this motion on Evidence Code section 352, which allows the court to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the risk of undue consumption of time, undue prejudice, or potential to mislead the jury. The court has denied this motion without prejudice, meaning that the trial judge will ultimately make the decision about whether Dr. Nourian's testimony is allowed. The court has instructed the parties to follow certain procedures if they intend to submit on this tentative ruling.
