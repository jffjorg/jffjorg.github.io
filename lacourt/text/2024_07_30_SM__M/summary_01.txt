And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel further responses and production of documents by Plaintiff Cristina Amaya against Defendant General Motors LLC. The motion is related to a lemon law action arising from Amaya's lease of a 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV, which had a defective high voltage battery pack. The Court has reviewed the motion and the objections raised by General Motors LLC and has made the following findings and orders:

* The Court concurs with General Motors' objections that the request for documents is overbroad and responding to the request would be unduly burdensome, and therefore denies the motion as to RPD nos. 28-29.
* The Court will limit the RPDs to permit discovery only as to alleged battery defect (and related systems) present in 2019 Chevy Bolts, and only those vehicles sold in California.
* The Court grants the motion as to RPD no. 77, which concerns only the subject vehicle, and grants the motion as modified as to RPD nos. 37-60, 78-86.
* The Court orders further responses to be provided within 20 days.

The Court's decision is based on its findings that the requests for documents are overbroad and that General Motors LLC has already provided sufficient information to support its defense. The Court also notes that the discovery sought by Amaya is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
