Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the fourth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is overruled. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendant, Wales, breached its fiduciary duty as an escrow agent for the sale of a yacht. Wales had an obvious conflict of interest and released the earnest deposit back to its own client, the Kim Trust, instead of holding it as instructed. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action and that the defendant's arguments rely on extrinsic evidence that cannot be considered at the pleading stage. The defendant is ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
