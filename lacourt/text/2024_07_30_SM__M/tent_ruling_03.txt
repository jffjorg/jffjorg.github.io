CASE NO.:                23SMCV04996
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   7/30/2024 (Continued
from 7/19)

 
Legal
Standard
 
 If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for
a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Where there has been no timely
response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand, the demanding party must
seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. Thus,
unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he
or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline
for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the
motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no
showing of "good cause" is required. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant Carol Garcia moves to compel Plaintiff Farshid
Nikfarjam to respond, without objections, to the Special Interrogatories, Set
No. One, Form Interrogatories, Set No. One, and Demand for Production of
Documents, Set No. One (collectively, the “Subject Discovery”), within fifteen
(15) days. This action concerns personal injuries and damage from an automobile
accident occurred on October 25, 2021. 
 
Defendant
propounded the subject discovery by mail on January 19, 2024. Plaintiff did not
serve responses within the original due date of February 21, 2024. (Saakian
Decl., Exs. A.) On April 16, 2024, Defendant informed Plaintiff of their intent
to move to compel. (See Id., Exs. B.) Defendant demonstrates that Plaintiff has
failed to respond to duly issued discovery. Accordingly, the motions to compel
are GRANTED.  Further responses are
ordered, without objection, within 20 days.
 
SANCTIONS 
 
Sanctions are
mandatory. The Court must sanction any party that unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a further response, “unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (See, e.g., CCP, § 2030.290(c).) Plaintiff has
failed to oppose, and therefore failed to justify their failure to respond to
these discovery requests.
 
Defendant
requests sanctions of $1,760.00, $760.00, and $760.00 for the respective
motions to compel. (See Saakian Decl., ¶ 5.) Using the lodestar method, and
considering the duplicative nature of the three motions, the Court finds that a
reasonable sanction for the three motions would be $2,280.00 ($760/motion),
inclusive of costs, against Plaintiff Farshid Nikfarjam and counsel of record,
Matt Koohanim, Esq., jointly and severally. 
Sanctions are payable within 30 days.
