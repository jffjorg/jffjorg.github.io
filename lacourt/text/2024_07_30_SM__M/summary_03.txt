And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's response to discovery requests. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, which were served on January 19, 2024, and the defendant informed the plaintiff of their intent to move to compel on April 16, 2024. The court found that the plaintiff's failure to respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product, and that the defendant is entitled to sanctions. The court ordered the plaintiff to respond to the discovery requests without objection within 20 days and ordered sanctions of $2,280.00 to be paid within 30 days.
