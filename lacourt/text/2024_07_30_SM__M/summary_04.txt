And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied the defendants' motions to strike the plaintiff's request for special and consequential damages. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendants breached the subject lease agreement and committed unlawful detainer, resulting in damages including rent, utilities, and other expenses totaling over $32,000. The court finds that the complaint establishes sufficient facts to show entitlement to typical unlawful detainer remedies, including special and consequential damages. Therefore, the motions are denied, and the defendants are ordered to answer the complaint within 10 days.
