```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The motion was filed due to Plaintiff's failure to comply with two court orders and violate his obligations under the Civil Discovery Act. The court found that while Plaintiff's actions were serious misuses of the discovery process, they did not warrant a terminating sanction at this time. The court noted that there was no showing of a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that had not been or could not be cured by lesser sanctions. Additionally, the court found that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for Defendant, as no lesser sanctions had been previously pursued. The court denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that Defendant can refile the motion at a later stage of the proceedings if it can show further misuse of the discovery process.
