Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiffs’
Counsel Kenneth I. Gross, Esq.
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On December 10, 2021, Shaobin Zhuo and Jin
Feng Zhuo (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Pomona Valley
Hospital Medical Center (“Pomona Valley”) Seyed Kamali, M.D., and Does 1
through 100 (“Dr. Kamali”), asserting a cause of action for wrongful death –
negligence arising out of medical treatment of decedent Ryan Zhuo in November and
December 2020.
On May 27, 2022, Pomona Valley filed an
answer.
On September 30, 2024, Kenneth I. Gross, Esq. (“Counsel”) filed this motion
to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (b).) An attorney is permitted to
withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable
to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct
3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel with the
Court.
Counsel has not,
however, filed a proof of service showing proper service on Plaintiffs and
Pomona Valley. 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
WITHOUT PREJUDICE the motion to be relieved as counsel.
Moving Counsel is
ordered to give notice.
