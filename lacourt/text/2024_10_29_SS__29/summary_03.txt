And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Defendant Yung Ja Yoon's demurrer is overruled. The plaintiff, Gisel Yanez, filed a complaint against Yoon and others alleging premises liability and negligence arising from an alleged scooter fall on October 17, 2020, near a store on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles. Yoon filed a demurrer arguing that the plaintiff failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a claim against her. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations, taken as true, stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Yoon. The judge noted that a person who exercises control over a public sidewalk may be held liable for a dangerous condition on the sidewalk. As a result, the demurrer was overruled, and Yoon is not entitled to dismissal of the complaint.
