23STCV31889
Demurrer filed by Defendant Yung Ja Yoon
Tentative
The Demurrer is overruled.
Background
On December 29, 2023, Gisel Yanez, by and
through her Guardian Ad Litem Rosa Maricela Ayala Landaverde (“Plaintiff”),
filed a complaint against Yung Ja Yoon (“Yoon”), Luis Manuel Lopez, Rinconcito
Oaxaqueno Market, Manuel Lopez dba Rinconcito Oaxaqueno Market, and Does 1
through 50, asserting causes of action for premises liability and negligence arising
out of an alleged scooter fall occurring on October 17, 2020, near a store on
Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles.
On August 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) asserting the same causes of action against the same
defendants.
On September 6, 2024, Defendants Luis Manuel
Lopez and Rincocito Oaxaqueno Market, Inc. filed an answer.
On September 17,
2024, Defendant Yoon filed this demurrer. 
No opposition
has been filed.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 provides:
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
A
general demurrer for sufficiency under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (e), tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.  We also consider matters which may
be judicially noticed.”  (Centinela
Freeman Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1
Cal.5th 994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; accord Yvanova
v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th
96, 104.)  All reasonable inferences must
be drawn in favor of the pleading.  (Schifando
v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 104.)  Even “improbable” facts alleged in the
pleading must be accepted as true.  (Marina
Pacific Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at pp. 104-105.)
Courts must “liberally construe the pleading” and “give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
context.”  (Id. at p. 105.)
A demurrer can be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
Leave to amend should be granted when “there is a
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”  (Centinela Freeman, supra, 1 Cal.5th
at p. 1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Shaeffer v. Califia
Farms (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 1125, 1145.)
Meet and Confer Requirement
A party filing a demurrer must file and serve a
declaration stating either that the parties met and conferred or that the
plaintiff failed to respond to the meet and confer request of the demurring
party.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a)(3).) 
That requirement is satisfied here. 
(Colorado Decl., ¶ 2.)
Request for Judicial Notice
Yoon requests that the Court take judicial
notice of Statement of Information filed by Rinconcito Oaxaqueno Market, Inc.
with the California Secretary of State on February 1, 2024. The Court GRANTS
Yoon’s request under Evidence Code section 452. 
The Court, however, may take judicial notice
only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of public records and other
specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of the
factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022)
87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)
Discussion
Yoon demurs to Plaintiff’s FAC, contending that Plaintiff
has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a claim against Yoon. Yoon argues
that, according to the FAC, the accident site was on the sidewalk adjacent to
the Rinconcito Oaxaqueno Market (“Market”), but Plaintiff does not allege that
Yoon owns the Market or the sidewalk on which the accident occurred.  (Mem. at pp. 9-11.) 
 
In the FAC, however, Plaintiff alleges (among other
things) that each defendant, including Yoon, exercised control over the
sidewalk on which the accident occurred. 
(FAC, ¶¶ 17, 19, 22-29, 31.)  The
FAC further alleges that each defendant, including Yoon, caused or contributed
to the creation of the dangerous condition that led to Plaintiff’s
accident.  (Id., ¶¶ 21-29, 32.)
 
On demurer, the Court must accept these allegations as
true.  Taking these facts as true,
Plaintiff has stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Yoon.  (See Lopez v. City
of Los Angeles (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 244, 255-256 [stating general rule
that a person who exercises control over a public sidewalk may be held liable
for a dangerous condition on the sidewalk].) 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court OVERRULES Defendant Yung Ja
Yoon’s demurrer.
 
Moving Party is to give notice.
