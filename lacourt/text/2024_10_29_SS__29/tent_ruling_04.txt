Background
Four related cases arise out of an automobile
accident on February 12, 2022.
In this matter (Case No. 24STCV03222), on
February 7, 2024, Cesar Segovia (“Plaintiff”) and Michael Shaffrey filed a
complaint asserting causes of action for negligence, negligence per se, and
vicarious liability against Nazila Ibragimova (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through
100.
On July 26, 2024, Defendant filed an answer.
On September 16, 2024, Defendant these four
discovery motions: (1) to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories;
(2) to compel Plaintiff to respond to Special Interrogatories; (3) to compel
Plaintiff to respond to Requests for Production; and (4) for an order deeming
Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests for
Admission.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See Id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial
responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must respond to requests for
production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents
are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move
for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial
responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
A party must respond to requests for
admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed does not
provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an order that …
the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a
motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate
statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
The court “shall” make the order that the
truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed admitted unless the
court “finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St.
Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem admitted the truth of
the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
On July 17, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff
with Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production,
and Requests for Admission. (Bakshandeh Decls., ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff did not
respond.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
Defendant need not show anything more.
The Court GRANTS the motions to compel
Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and
Requests for Production.
The Court GRANTS the motion for a
deemed-admitted order as to the Requests for Admission.
The requests for sanctions on the motions to
compel are denied.  In the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act
governing interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has
authorized sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses
“against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes”
the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) &
2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, Plaintiff has not opposed the motion.
The request for sanctions on the motion for a
deemed-admitted order is granted.  The chapter in the Civil Discovery Act
governing requests for admission provides for a “mandatory” imposition of
sanctions “on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [for a
deemed-admitted order].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
The Court finds that the failure of Plaintiff and counsel to serve a timely
response to the requests for admission necessitated this motion.
Given the relatively straightforward nature
of this motion, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $660, based on two
hours of attorney work multiplied by a reasonable billing rate for work of this
nature of $300 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. (See Bakshandeh Decls., ¶
8.)
