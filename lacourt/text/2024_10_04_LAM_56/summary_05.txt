And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to set aside the default and reinstate the complaint. The defendants did not file a responsive pleading, and default was entered, but they claim that their counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect led to the default. The judge finds that the defendants' counsel's sworn statement supports this claim and that the motion is timely filed. The judge orders the defendants to file their answer by October 7, 2024, and denies the plaintiff's application for default judgment. The judge also orders the defendants' counsel to pay $2,230 in attorneys' fees and costs to the plaintiff's counsel.
