```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for leave to amend the Answer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by the defendants. The defendants had recently discovered that the plaintiff, Hicks Media, Inc., is a forfeited entity in both California and Texas. The defendants had not previously known about this fact and therefore could not have included it in their earlier pleadings. The judge finds that the amendment is warranted in the furtherance of justice and that the plaintiff will not be prejudiced by the amendment. The amended answer must be filed and served within 15 days.
