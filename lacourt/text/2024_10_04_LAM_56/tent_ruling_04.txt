DISCUSSION
Motion to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
When a
party fails to serve a timely response to an inspection demand, the party
making the demand may move for an order compelling a response to the inspection
demand.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd. (b).)  A party who fails to provide a timely response
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (a).)  
 
Here, Defendants served Plaintiff with Requests for
Production (Set No. 1) (“RFPs”) on November 10, 2023.  (Declaration of Rosely George in Support of
RFPs Motion.)  Plaintiff did not serve responses
to the RFPs as of the date of filing of the Motions on July 25, 2024.  (Id.) 
Defendants now move for an order compelling Plaintiff to serve responses
to the RFPs.
 
Accordingly,
the RFPs Motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is
ordered to submit complete, Code-compliant and verified responses to the RFPs,
without objections, and to produce all responsive documents, within 20 days of
this Order.
 
Motions to Compel
Responses to Special/Form Interrogatories
Under Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section
2030.290, subdivision (b), when a party directs interrogatories towards a party,
and that party fails to serve a timely response, the party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.290, subd.
(b).)  A party who fails to provide a
timely response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work
product.  (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  The moving party need only show that the
interrogatories were served on the opposing party, the time has expired to
respond to the interrogatories and no responses have been served in order for the
court to compel the opposing party to respond.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 906.)  
 
Here, Defendants served Plaintiff with Special Interrogatories,
Set One (“SIs”), Form Interrogatories – Employment, Set One (“FIs –
Employment”) and Form Interrogatories – Employment, Set One (“FIs – General”)
on November 10, 2023.  (Declaration of
Rosely George in Support of RFPs Motion; Declaration of Rosely George in
Support of FIs – Employment Motion; Declaration of Rosely George in Support of
SIs – General Motion.)  Plaintiff did not serve responses
to the SIs and FIs – Employment and FIs – General as of the date of filing of
the motions on July 25, 2024 and July 26, 2024. 
(Id.)  Defendants now move
for an order compelling Plaintiff to serve responses to the SIs, FIs –
Employment and FIs - General.
 
Accordingly,
the SIs Motion, FIs – Employment Motion and FIs – General Motion are GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to submit complete,
Code-compliant and verified responses to the SIs, FIs – Employment and FIs -
General, without objections, within 20 days of this Order.
 
Monetary Sanctions
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction… against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (CCP § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
“[T]he court shall impose a
monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Here, Defendants are seeking monetary sanctions in the amount of $470 for
each of the four Motions, representing two hours of attorney time at a rate of
$205 per hour, plus $60 filing fee.  As
the Motions are unopposed, the Court finds no substantial justification for the
delay in responses, and thus sanctions are warranted.  Since the Motions are unopposed, however, the
Court exercises its discretion and reduces the monetary sanctions to $265 for
each motion, representing $205 in attorneys’ fees, plus $60 filing fees.
 
Plaintiff is thus ordered to pay $1,060 in monetary sanctions to Defendant within 30 days of the date of this Order.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
