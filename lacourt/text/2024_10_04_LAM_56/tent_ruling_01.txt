BACKGROUND
             This is a “lemon law” case arising from
Plaintiff’s purchase of a 2019 Honda Civic on November 27, 2019.  Plaintiff filed his complaint on April 5, 2021,
alleging causes of action for breach of the express and implied warranties under
the Song-Beverly Act.
 
            The case came on for trial on
February 5, 2024.  After trial, the jury
returned a verdict in Defendant’s favor. 
Judgment was entered on February 22, 2024.  
 
            On July 12, 2024, Defendant filed a
Memorandum of Costs (Summary) seeking a total of $24,280.74 in costs.
 
            On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Strike or in the Alternative Tax Costs (the “Motion”), seeking
to tax Defendant’s costs.  On September
20, 20224, Defendant filed an opposition, and Plaintiff filed a late reply on
September 30, 2024.
 
DISCUSSION
In
general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter of right to recover
costs for suit in any action or proceeding. 
(CCP § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. of
Calif. V. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  “Prevailing party” includes the party with a
net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a
defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a
defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against
that defendant.  (CCP § 1032(a)(4).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 sets forth
the costs recoverable by the prevailing party.  To recover a cost, it must be reasonably
necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount.  (Perko’s
Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.)  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear
to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
that they were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ladas
v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761,
773-74.)  On the other hand, if the items
are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on
the party claiming them as costs.  (Id.) 

 
            A verified
memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and
services therein listed were necessarily incurred.  (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) 
A party seeking to tax costs must provide evidence to rebut this prima facie
showing.  (Jones v. Dumrichob
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266.)  Mere statements unsupported by facts
are insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing that costs were necessarily
incurred.  (Id.)  
 
“[T]he mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be
a ‘proper objection’ to an item, the necessity of which appears doubtful, or
which does not appear to be proper on its face.”  (Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.)  “However, ‘[i]f the items appear to be proper
charges the verified memorandum is prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses and services therein listed were necessarily incurred by the defendant
[citations], and the burden of showing that an item is not properly chargeable
or is unreasonable is upon the [objecting party].’”  (Id.
[quoting Oak Grove School Dist. V. City
Title Ins. Co. (1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678, 699] [alterations in original].)
 
Here, Plaintiff objects to certain costs as
itemized in Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs, specifically: 1) Filing Fees; 2)
Deposition Costs; 3) Expert Witness Fees; 4) Court Reporter/Transcript Fees; 5)
Models and Enlargement Costs; 6) Interpreter Costs; and 7) “Other” Costs.
1.     Filing Fees
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(1) expressly provides recovery
for filing, motion and jury fees.  The
Court thus denies Plaintiff’s motion as to filing fees.
 
2.     Deposition and Interpreter Costs
Defendant’s counsel declares that on April 26, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel
canceled the deposition scheduled for April 27, 2022, and that on May 3, 2022,
Plaintiff served his objections to Defendant’s Deposition Notice scheduled for
May 24, 2022, but represented that he would appear.  (Declaration of Corinne Orquiloa, ¶¶ 2-3.)  Thus, notwithstanding that the depositions
did not go forward, Defendant incurred these costs for Plaintiff’s failure to
appear.  The Court therefore denies Plaintiff’s
motion to strike or tax as to deposition and interpreter costs.
 
3.     Expert Witness Fees
Pursuant to CCP
section 1033.5, expert witness fees are allowable as costs if the expert
witnesses were ordered by the court. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(8).) 
Expert witness fees are not allowable as costs when not ordered by the court.  (Id.,
§ 1033.5(b)(1).)  Pursuant to CCP section
998, however, if an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff
fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award, the court may require the
plaintiff to pay a reasonable sum to cover postoffer costs of the services of
expert witnesses actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both,
preparation for trial or arbitration, or during trial or arbitration, of the
case by the defendant.  (Id., § 998(c)(1).)  Such is the case here.  Thus the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to
strike or tax expert witness fees.
 
 
4. Court Reporter/Transcript Fees
Plaintiff seeks to strike or tax Defendant’s costs
for court reporter fees related to the trial. The Court can approve these costs
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(16), which permits other
costs incident to the prevailing in the action at trial.  Thus, Plaintiff’s motion as to court reporter
fees is denied.
 
5.     Models and Enlargement Costs
“Models, the enlargements of exhibits and
photocopies of exhibits, and the electronic presentation of exhibits, including
costs of rental equipment and electronic formatting, may be allowed if they
were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact.” (CCP § 1033.5(a)(13).) 
 
Defendant asserts that all of the materials which
were produced were used by counsel at trial to aid the trier of fact in their
verdict.  Finding that the materials were
reasonably necessary, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion as to models and
enlargement costs. 
 
6.     “Other” Costs
Plaintiff challenges Defendant’s request for “other”
costs listed in Item 16 of Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs. Specifically,
Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s requests for travel & meal expenses are
improper and not reasonably necessary to the costs of litigation. Although
travel expenses to attend depositions are expressly authorized under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(3)(C), other travel expenses do not enjoy
such authorization
