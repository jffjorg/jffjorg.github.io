And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving party's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication and has found that the defendant has met its burden to show that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court has found that the plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination, retaliation, and harassment are not supported by the evidence and that the defendant's actions were legitimate and nondiscriminatory. Specifically, the court has found that the defendant's return-to-work process was reasonable and nondiscriminatory, and that the plaintiff's refusal to participate in the process was not caused by discrimination or retaliation. The court has also found that the plaintiff's claims of harassment and retaliation are not supported by the evidence and that the defendant did not act with malice, fraud, or oppression. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the plaintiff's claims are dismissed.
