And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the parties' motions and oppositions regarding Defendant's Memorandum of Costs seeking $24,280.74 in costs. The court finds that certain costs are properly chargeable and necessary to the litigation, including filing fees, deposition and interpreter costs, expert witness fees, court reporter fees, models and enlargement costs, and travel and meal expenses. The court denies Plaintiff's motion to strike or tax these costs.

The court finds that Plaintiff's objections to certain costs are without merit. For example, Plaintiff objects to filing fees, but the court finds that these fees are recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(1). Similarly, Plaintiff objects to deposition and interpreter costs, but the court finds that these costs were reasonably necessary and incurred by Defendant as a result of Plaintiff's cancellation of the depositions.

The court also finds that expert witness fees are allowable as costs, as they were ordered by the court. Finally, the court finds that travel and meal expenses are properly chargeable, including expenses incurred for travel to attend depositions.

The court's tentative ruling is that Plaintiff's motion to strike or tax costs is denied, and Defendant is entitled to recover the costs itemized in its Memorandum of Costs.
