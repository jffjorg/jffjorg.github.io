And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer to the plaintiff's fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment and a motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim for fraudulent concealment, and therefore overrules the defendant's demurrer. The court also denies the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient grounds to support the claim.

Additionally, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to his discovery requests, finding that the plaintiff has failed to submit a code-compliant separate statement as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345.

The court's ruling is based on the following legal authorities: Beckwith v. Dahl (2012), Hoffman v. 162 North Wolfe LLC (2014), LiMandri v. Judkins (1997), Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017), Cansino v. Bank of America (2014), and Today’s IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2022).

The parties are notified that they must submit written arguments on this tentative ruling by February 1, 2024.
