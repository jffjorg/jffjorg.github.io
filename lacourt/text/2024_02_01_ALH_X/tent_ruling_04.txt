BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Strata Pasadena Shops, LLC’s
(“Plaintiff”) unlawful detainer claim against Defendant Byung Sul Joo
(“Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant agreed to a 10-year lease term
for property located at 245 E. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, California 91101.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant agreed to pay $10,600.00 per month. Plaintiff
filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) on May 26, 2023.  
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s
request for attorney’s fees is GRANTED for a total of $23,250.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            “In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides
that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract,
shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then
the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified
in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in
addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code section 1717, subd. (a).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            On August 17, 2023, Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment was granted. On October 17, 2023, judgment was
entered in favor of Defendant. Defendant was determined to be the prevailing
party. 
 
Paragraph 17.4 of the agreement at
issue in this case provides: “In the event that either Party hereto brings any
action or files any proceeding In connection with the enforcement of its
respective rights under this Lease or as a consequence of any breach by the
other Party of its obligations under this Lease, the prevailing Party in such
action or proceeding shall be entitled to have its attorneys' fees and costs
paid by the losing Party.” (FAC Exhibit A at p. 32.)
 
Defendant now moves attorney’s fees totaling $26,675.00. 
 
            “[T]he fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The reasonable hourly rate is
that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Ibid.) Once the
lodestar figure is calculated, a court may adjust the award based on factors
such as “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.) “The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value
for the particular action.” (Ibid.) 
 
            Defendant
seeks fees at a rate of $500 per hour for 45 hours worked on this case with an
additional 5 hours of work anticipated for the present motion. (Jacobs Decl. ¶ 8.) 
 
“In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice. Failure to raise specific challenges in the trial court forfeits
the claim on appeal.” (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) 
 
            Plaintiff
vehemently argues that Defendant requested fees should be denied in its
entirety because Plaintiff claims Defendant is not the prevailing party here.
Plaintiff’s arguments are rejected. The court’s order specifically provides
that Defendant is the prevailing party and is entitled to make a motion for
fees. Plaintiff also contends, without any support, that Defendant’s motion to
quash and demurrers were completely unnecessary and should be removed from the
present calculation. Plaintiff’s argument lacks evidentiary or legal support to
establish that the hours sought were excessive or improper.
 
 
            The court
finds the lodestar amount is calculate at a at a rate of $500 per hour for 45
hours worked for a total of $22,500. However, the court finds the reasonable
number of hours for the present motion to be 1.5 hours at a rate of $500 per
hour for an additional $750. Defendant’s request for attorney’s fees is granted
for a total of $23,250.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant’s
request for attorney’s fees is GRANTED for a total of $23,250.
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
