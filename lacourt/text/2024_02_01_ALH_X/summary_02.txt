And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the plaintiff, Breann Howard, on behalf of the State of California, and the defendant, Koulax Enterprises. The plaintiff moves for leave to file a first amended complaint and to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, allowing the plaintiff to file the amended complaint within 10 days of the date of the order. The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The judge finds that the defendant has not shown prejudice and that the issue of which claims would be barred by the class-action waiver is unclear. The judge also rejects the defendant's argument that the case should be stayed pending appeal.
