English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses a PAGA case where the named plaintiff seeks no independent recovery. The court concludes that an employer can enter into an arbitration agreement with an employee to arbitrate individual employment-related claims, but not PAGA claims. The court is uncertain about whether an individual plaintiff can elect to sue only for PAGA and avoid arbitration. The court allows further briefing and continues the hearing. The court also expresses concern about a clause that requires the defendant to pay arbitration costs and fees for cases with less than $300,000 at issue, but not for larger cases.
