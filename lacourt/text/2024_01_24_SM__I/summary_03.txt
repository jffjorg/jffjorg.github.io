And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel discovery responses and a contempt request. The court has granted the motion to compel discovery responses as to the requests for admission, but denied the motion as to the requests for production. The court has also granted sanctions for the filing fees relating to the RFA's in the amount of $138.60.

The court's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff served written discovery on October 3, 2023, and the deadline to respond was December 1, 2023. However, no responses were sent by the deadline, and no requests for additional time were made. The court notes that the defendant Arturo was not served with discovery requests, and that the requests for production are facially overbroad.

The court has also addressed the contempt request, suggesting that it is inclined to deny the motion unless there is a real need to do so. The court notes that if the defendants believe that any responses might tend to incriminate them with regard to the potential contempt, they may assert the privilege and refuse to answer until the contempt matter is resolved.

The court has also issued guidelines for discovery responses, including the requirement to provide a substantive response, to object specifically to each request, and to provide a privilege log if necessary. The court has also emphasized the importance of a good faith meet and confer process before filing a motion to compel.
