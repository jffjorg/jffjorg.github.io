And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions and other issues presented in this case. With respect to the fee motion, the court has tentatively ruled that Mr. Shiri may be entitled to fees related to his unique role in the case, but that fees for defending the action generally are not recoverable. The court has also expressed concerns about the lack of detail in the billing records and has continued the motion for 25 court days. The court has also granted the motion to consolidate the cases, finding that the questions of fact are sufficiently similar to justify a single trial. Finally, the court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the failure to mediate does not necessarily mean that the case should be thrown out of court.
