## English Text Summary:

In this case, Jennifer Carbine sued Nats Early Bite, Inc. claiming their website violates the UNRUH Act by being inaccessible to blind or visually impaired users. Carbine filed the lawsuit in January 2023 and a default judgment was entered against Nats Early Bite in April 2023 because they didn't respond to the complaint. 

At a hearing in August 2023, the Judge suggested this case might involve a "high frequency litigator" – someone who files many lawsuits.  The Judge then ordered both sides to submit legal arguments on this issue, which Carbine did on August 28th. 

Carbine argued that her case doesn't qualify as a "high frequency litigator" case because her claim falls outside the definition of a "construction-related accessibility claim" in Civil Code §55.3(a)(2).

The Judge disagreed with Carbine's interpretation of the statute, finding that it excludes claims based on discriminatory acts, which the Judge believes applies to this case since Carbine is alleging Nats Early Bite "constructed" their website in an inaccessible way. 

Therefore, the Judge ruled that Carbine must comply with all requirements for "high frequency litigators" as outlined in CCP §425.55.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jennifer Carbine vs. Nats Early Bite, Inc. The case concerns allegations that the defendant's website is not accessible to blind or visually impaired persons, in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The plaintiff filed a complaint and proof of service, and the defendant's default was entered. The court conducted a default judgment prove-up hearing and indicated that the case may involve a high frequency litigator, which would require the plaintiff to comply with special requirements under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.55. The plaintiff filed a brief arguing that they are not a high frequency litigator, but the court disagrees and finds that the plaintiff's claim is a "construction-related accessibility claim" that must comply with the high frequency litigator requirements. The court has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
