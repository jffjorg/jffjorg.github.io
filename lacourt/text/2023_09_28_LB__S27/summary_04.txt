And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering whether the plaintiff, Jennifer Carbine, constitutes a high frequency litigator under CCP §425.55. The plaintiff argues that her claim is not a construction-related accessibility claim, as defined in Civil Code §55.3(a)(2), because she is alleging that the defendant's website was not constructed to be accessible to her. The court disagrees with the plaintiff's interpretation of the statute and finds that the statute is intended to exclude claims that persons engaged in acts that discriminated against other persons. Therefore, the court finds that the plaintiff must comply with all high-frequency litigator requirements in connection with this and other similar lawsuits. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
