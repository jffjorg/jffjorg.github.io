The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Natalie Grohosky vs. Edward E. Simpkins, Robin Rix, Diane Rix, and Berro Management Company, Inc. The case involves a breach of implied warranty of habitability, premises liability, and negligent misrepresentation. The defendants filed a motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages, which the plaintiff opposed.

The Court previously continued the hearing on the motion to strike due to the parties' failure to meet and confer. The plaintiff filed a supplemental opposition on September 19, 2023, which the defendants did not respond to. The Court finds that the defendants failed to comply with the meet and confer requirement and denies the motion to strike.

The Court orders the defendants to give notice of this ruling and advises parties who intend to submit on the tentative to send an email to the court as directed by the instructions on the court website. If the department does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.
