Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motions to strike costs and for attorneys' fees filed by the defendants. The court finds that the plaintiff's memorandum of costs was timely filed and therefore denies the motion to strike costs. The court also finds that the plaintiff is the prevailing party and awards attorneys' fees in the amount of $473,699.18. The court reduces the fees incurred by attorney Cooper from April 2021 to the present by 40%, to $255,784.80. The court awards 75% of the fees sought by the plaintiff, or a total of $217.914.38, for the work done by attorneys Josefsberg, Menke, Ajalat, and Degani. The court sets the motion for hearing on September 28, 2023, and orders the plaintiff to give notice.
