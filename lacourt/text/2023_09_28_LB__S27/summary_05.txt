Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: a motion to strike Plaintiff's memorandum of costs and a motion for attorneys' fees. The Court finds that Plaintiff's memorandum of costs was timely filed and denies the motion to strike costs. The Court also awards a total of $473,699.18 in attorneys' fees in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant.

The Court notes that the parties' promissory notes govern the parties' relationship and support imposition of fees, and Plaintiff merely showed at trial that Defendant was wrongfully seeking to recover interest and fees outside of the scope of the parties' agreement.

The Court reduces the fees sought by Plaintiff's attorney, Cooper, by 40% to $255,784.80, and awards a total of $473,699.18 in attorneys' fees in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant. The judgment will be interlineated to add the attorneys' fees and costs at the time of the hearing.

Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative. If the department does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.
