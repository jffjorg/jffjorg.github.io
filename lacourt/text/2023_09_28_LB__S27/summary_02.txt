The judge also notes that the defendants' cross-complaint, which is set for trial on January 16, 2024, seeks partition by way of the first cause of action. Therefore, the judge denies the motion, finding that the court lacks authority to enter an interlocutory judgment by noticed motion.

And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge in the case of 22LBCV00043. The case involves Milan V. Balejka and Maria Riza Balejka (plaintiffs) against Theresa Hertzog and Kiat Chan (defendants) regarding the partition of a subject property. The plaintiffs filed an action for quiet title, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and cancellation of instruments, while the defendants filed a cross-complaint for partition, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unfair business practices, unjust enrichment, quiet title, declaratory relief, and accounting.

The defendants moved for an order of partition and sale, but the Judge denied the motion because the Code of Civil Procedure does not permit the partition determination to be made by way of noticed motion.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for an order of partition by sale in the case of Milan V. Balejka and Maria Riza Balejka vs. Theresa Hertzog, Kiat Chan, and all persons claiming right to the subject property. The plaintiffs filed the action on January 26, 2022, seeking quiet title, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and cancellation of instruments. The defendants filed a cross-complaint on February 10, 2023, seeking partition, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unfair business practices, unjust enrichment, quiet title, declaratory relief, and accounting.

The defendants have moved for an order entering an interlocutory judgment for partition and sale, citing Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 872.210, 872.720, and 872.810. However, the Judge notes that the defendants have omitted CCP section 872.710(a), which requires the court to determine the right to partition at trial. The Judge finds that there is no authority permitting the partition determination to be made by way of noticed motion, and therefore denies the motion.

The defendants are ordered to give notice, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit. If no email is received and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.
