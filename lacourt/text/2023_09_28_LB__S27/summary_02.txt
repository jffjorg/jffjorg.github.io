And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for an order of partition by sale filed by the defendants. The defendants are seeking an interlocutory judgment for partition and sale and the appointment of a referee. However, the judge finds that the defendants omitted a crucial statute, CCP §872.710(a), which states that the court shall determine whether the plaintiff has the right to partition at the trial. The judge also notes that the defendants' cross-complaint, which is set for trial on January 16, 2024, seeks partition by way of the first cause of action. Therefore, the judge denies the motion, finding that the court lacks authority to enter an interlocutory judgment by noticed motion. The parties are ordered to give notice and are advised to submit on the tentative or make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
