And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling concerns a petition to approve a compromise filed by Magdalena Santana, the appointed petitioner, on behalf of Jhene Gutierrez, a 4-year-old with special needs. The proposed trust is a special needs trust (SNT) designed to receive settlement funds without disrupting benefits eligibility.

The Judge notes that the proposed trust instrument meets the requirements for court-created or funded trusts, but requires confirmation that annuity payments will be made to the SNT, not to the plaintiff directly/individually.

The Judge also finds that the proposed trust is ready for approval, but requires 15 days' mailed notice to three state agencies. Additionally, the Judge grants the petitioner's requests for authority to invest trust assets, take fees on an interim basis, and make expenditures for a residence and vehicle.

The Judge denies the petitioner's request to spend up to $850,000 to purchase a residence, without prejudice, and suggests that the request be made in the Probate case that will be opened to provide court supervision of the trust administration.

The Judge's recommendations include approving the settlement, fees, and creation and funding of the proposed trust, making the required findings under Probate Code section 3604(b), and setting an order to show cause (OSC) in approximately 60 days to ensure funding of the settlement and submission of the trust instrument.

```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jhene Gutierrez, a minor with special needs. The plaintiff's guardian ad litem, Magdalena Santana, has filed a petition to approve a compromise and create a special needs trust to receive settlement proceeds. The settlement amount is $6.5 million, with a net settlement of $4,913,021.32. The trust will be used to preserve the plaintiff's benefits eligibility, including Medi-Cal and SSI benefits.

The court has found that the proposed trust instrument meets the requirements of California law and is ready for approval. However, the court has continued the hearing to require 15 days' mailed notice to state agencies, as the proof of service indicates that service was made only nine days prior to the hearing.

The court has also granted several requests for relief, including authority for the trustee to invest in proprietary funds, mutual funds, and bonds, and to take fees on an interim periodic basis. The court has denied a request to spend up to $850,000 to purchase a residence for the plaintiff, but has granted a request to spend up to $65,000 to purchase a vehicle.

The court has ordered that the trustee bond be waived, as the proposed trustee is a corporate fiduciary. The court has also ordered that the first trust accounting be filed in one year, and that an order to show cause be set in approximately 60 days to ensure funding of the settlement and filing of the necessary documents to open a trust supervision action in probate.

Overall, the court's tentative ruling is to approve the creation and funding of the proposed trust, subject to certain conditions and modifications.
