And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling concerns a petition to approve a compromise filed by Magdalena Santana, the appointed petitioner, on behalf of Jhene Gutierrez, a 4-year-old with special needs. The proposed trust is a special needs trust (SNT) designed to receive settlement funds without disrupting benefits eligibility.

The Judge notes that the proposed trust instrument meets the requirements for court-created or funded trusts, but requires confirmation that annuity payments will be made to the SNT, not to the plaintiff directly/individually.

The Judge also finds that the proposed trust is ready for approval, but requires 15 days' mailed notice to three state agencies. Additionally, the Judge grants the petitioner's requests for authority to invest trust assets, take fees on an interim basis, and make expenditures for a residence and vehicle.

The Judge denies the petitioner's request to spend up to $850,000 to purchase a residence, without prejudice, and suggests that the request be made in the Probate case that will be opened to provide court supervision of the trust administration.

The Judge's recommendations include approving the settlement, fees, and creation and funding of the proposed trust, making the required findings under Probate Code section 3604(b), and setting an order to show cause (OSC) in approximately 60 days to ensure funding of the settlement and submission of the trust instrument.
