 Case Number:  23NWCV00583    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  C MARTHA BENCOMO VILLAR vs WELLS FARGO, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,
A CORPORATION, et al, Case No. 23NWCV00583
This is a real estate action. Plaintiff moves ex parte for
an order advancing Plaintiff’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions against
Defendant Francisco Bencomo Jr. 
 
A party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual
showing "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis
for granting relief ex parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
 
Here, Plaintiff has a trial preference due to his age and
health conditions. Trial is set for September 23, 2024.  The Motion for
Terminating Sanctions is not set to be heard until February 25, 2025.
Therefore, the Court finds irreparable harm as Plaintiff would not be able to
be heard on her motion prior to the beginning of trial. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s ex parte application to advance
Plaintiff’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions against Defendant Francisco
Bencomo Jr. is GRANTED. The Motion is ADVANCED from Thursday, February 23, 2025
to this date and CONTINUED to Thursday, August 22, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept.
SE-C. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
