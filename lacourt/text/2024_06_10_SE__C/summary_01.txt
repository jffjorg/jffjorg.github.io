And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge denies Rialto Pacific LLC's ex parte application to continue the motion for summary judgment currently scheduled for July 3, 2024. Rialto had requested the continuance to complete the deposition of Jack Saadia, which would allow them to oppose Saadia's motion for summary judgment. The judge finds that Rialto's opposition to the motion is due on June 20, 2024, and that the ex parte application is premature. The judge also notes that Saadia has agreed to produce Joseph Saadia, but the parties are unable to complete the deposition until after the opposition deadline.
