And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's ex parte application to advance their motion for terminating sanctions against defendant Francisco Bencomo Jr. The plaintiff has a trial preference due to their age and health conditions, and the trial is set for September 23, 2024. However, the motion for terminating sanctions is not set to be heard until February 25, 2025, which would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiff. Therefore, the judge finds that the plaintiff has met the requirements for ex parte relief and grants the application. The motion is advanced from February 25, 2025 to August 22, 2024.
