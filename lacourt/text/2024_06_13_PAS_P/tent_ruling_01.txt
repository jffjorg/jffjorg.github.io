The motion was filed March 29, 2024.          For the reasons set forth below, the motion to compel the deposition of GM’s PMQ is GRANTED. II.      LEGAL STANDARD “If the deponent named is not a natural person, the deposition notice shall describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested. In that event, the deponent shall designate and produce at the deposition those of its officers, directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information known or reasonably available to the deponent. (CCP § 2025.230.)Code Civ. Proc. Section 2025.450 (a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. (b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following: (1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. (2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. . . . (g)(1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  III.    ANALYSIS          A. Meet and Confer Efforts Were Sufficient          Plaintiff offers the declaration of her attorney, Jacqueline Mandel, in support of meet and confer efforts. (Mandel Declaration.) Mandel declares that she first sent a meet and confer letter on February 15, 2024, as to GM’s served objections to the deposition notice. (Mandel Decl. ¶ 5.) She followed up on March 6, 2024. On March 11, 2024, Counsel for GM responded. (Mandel Decl. ¶ 7.) She declares she followed up on March 18, 2024, to inquire after dates for the deposition to take place. (Mandel Decl. ¶ 9.) GM has not provided dates. (Mandel Decl. ¶ 10.)The Court finds that meet and confer efforts were sufficient.B. MotionPlaintiff first served a notice of deposition on January 11, 2024, as to a February 19, 2024, deposition date. (Mandel Decl. ¶ 3, see Exh. A.) The deposition notice seeks testimony from the person most qualified about why GM did not purchase the vehicle back from Plaintiff prior to this lawsuit being filed, the nature and extent of the vehicle’s repair history, and other similar topics. On February 9, 2024, Defendant GM served objections to the deposition notice. (Mandel Decl. ¶ 4, see Exh. B.)Code Civ. Proc. Section 2017.010 permits a party to “obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter . . . if the matter is either itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (CCP § 2017.010.)Plaintiff urges that the information sought in the PMQ deposition is relevant to her lemon law claims. (Motion, p. 4: 23-28.) Plaintiff cites Civil Code Section 1793.2(d)(2) for the elements of a lemon law claim; namely, that plaintiff had a defective new car, presented it for repairs, repairs were inadequate and defendant refused to replace or buy back the car. (CC § 1793.2(d)(2).) Information as to GM’s analysis of whether Plaintiff’s car should be bought back, the repair history of the car, GM’s lemon law policies and procedures and GM’s staff training regarding lemon law is relevant to Plaintiff’s claim, as they relate to the elements of lemon law. Plaintiff also cites several cases for the relevance of the car manufacturer’s policies, prior vehicle repairs and the manufacturer’s criteria for determining if a car is a lemon. (See e.g., Krotin v. Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (1995) 38 Cal. App.4th 294, 302; Kwan v. Mercedes-Benz of North America (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 186; Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors Inc. (1995) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094; Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136; Lukather v. General Motors, LLC (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1051.)To the extent that GM is still objecting to the PMQ deposition on basis of attorney-client privilege, work product privilege, vagueness or ambiguity, these objections are not supported. (Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431; West Pico Furniture Co. of L.A. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) The motion to compel the PMQ deposition is granted.C. SanctionsPlaintiff seeks sanctions of $3,150.00 against GM for necessitating this motion. Plaintiff’s counsel, Jacqueline Mandel, declares that she spent 4 hours preparing the motion and anticipates spending 1 hour answering opposition and 2 hours preparing a reply. She also spent $61.65 on the filing fee. Her hourly rate is $525. (Mandel Decl. ¶ 11-12.)The Court finds the rate requested.  However, since Defendant did not file an opposition, the Court awards 4 hours at $525 per hour or $2,100 plus costs of $61.65 for a grand total of $2,161.65.IV.     CONCLUSION AND ORDER          The motion by Plaintiff Jaramillo for an order compelling the deposition of GM’s person most qualified is granted. Defendant’s PMQ is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days.          GM is further ordered to pay $2,161.65 in monetary sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel.Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.  Dated: June 11, 2024                                                                                                                                                                         _______________________________                                                                                  JARED D.
