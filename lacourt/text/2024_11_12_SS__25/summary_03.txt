And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ibrahim et al. v. Universal Floor Source, Inc. The petitioners, Iehab A. Ibrahim and Christina M. Ibrahim, have filed a petition for release of property from a mechanic's lien recorded by Universal Floor Source, Inc. on November 16, 2023. The petitioners served the respondent with notice of hearing on August 16, 2024, but failed to serve them with the proposed order until November 4, 2024.

The judge has determined that the petition is verified and complies with the requirements of California Civil Code sections 8484 and 8486. However, the judge has concerns about the discrepancy between the addresses listed on the claim of mechanic's lien and the proof of service.

Accordingly, the judge has ordered the petitioners to file a new proof of service or clarify the discrepancy at the next hearing, which is scheduled for January 13, 2025. If the petitioners fail to comply with this order, the petition may be placed off calendar or denied.
