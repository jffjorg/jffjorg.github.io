ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On November 22, 2022, Plaintiff State
Farm Mutual Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Viktoryia
Karobkina (“Defendant”) and Does 1-30 alleging subrogation and requesting
damages of $17,215.55. (Compl., p. 1, Prayer.) 
 
On February 27, 2023, default was
entered against Defendant.
 
On March 17, 2023, Defendant filed an
Answer and a Stipulation to Set Aside Default and for Filing of the Answer to
Complaint signed by counsel for both parties. The Court ordered the Request for
Default entered against Defendant be set aside and the Answer to the Complaint
filed. (3/17/23 Order.) 
 
On June 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Settlement
Stipulation for Dismissal with a Reservation of Jurisdiction to Vacate
Dismissal and Enter Judgment in the Event of Default” (the “Stipulation”). 
 
On June 11, 2024, the Hon. Karine
Mkrtchyan signed an order dismissing the action but retaining jurisdiction
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. (6/11/24 Order.)
 
On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment
Against Defendant (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition was filed.   
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the
party. 
(3) If an insurer is defending and
indemnifying a party to the action, an agent who is authorized in writing by
the insurer to sign on the party’s behalf. This paragraph does not apply if the
party whom the insurer is defending would be liable under the terms of the
settlement for any amount above the policy limits.” 
 
The Stipulation filed by
Plaintiff was signed by Defendant on May 2, 2024, Defendant’s counsel on May 3,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel on May 3, 2024, and Alexander Gregory House for
Plaintiff on June 6, 2024. (6/10/24 Stipulation, pp. 3-4.) 
 
The Stipulation provides
the matter settled for a total sum of $12,992.06. (6/10/24 Stipulation, ¶ 2.)
The Stipulation states Defendant is to pay the total sum of $12,992.06,
reflecting $9,992.06 paid by Defendant’s insurance carrier (or other source) and
$3,000 to be paid by Defendant at a rate of $200 per month, beginning April 1,
2024 and continuing on the same day of each month thereafter until paid in
full. (6/10/24 Stipulation, ¶ 2.) 
 
The Stipulation further
states that failure to make a timely payment constitutes a default and, in the
event of default, there is a 15-day grace period for Defendant to make payment,
Plaintiff shall give written notice to Defendant regarding the default, and
Defendant shall be allowed an additional ten days from the date of written
notice to cure the particular default. (6/10/24 Stipulation, ¶¶ 6-8.) If
Defendant fails to cure the default, the Stipulation states “plaintiff may
cause judgment to be entered for the settlement amount set forth in this
agreement, after crediting payments that have been made at that time.”  (6/10/24 Stipulation,
¶ 6.)
 
The Court finds the Stipulation
to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant made partial payment – Defendant’s
insurance carrier paid a total of $9,992.06. (Benson Decl., ¶ 5.) As of the
date this Motion was filed, however, Plaintiff had received no further payments
from Defendant since June 14, 2024. (Benson Decl., ¶ 5, 7.) Plaintiff also
presents evidence of the default payment letter sent to Defendant on July 1,
2024 advising Defendant of the default and the remaining balance then due in
the sum of $3,000. (Benson Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. 2.) 
 
Plaintiff requests that a
judgment of $3,075.00, based on the principal amount of $12,992.06, less
payments received in the amount of $9,992.06 plus filing costs of $75.00, be
entered against Defendant. (Benson Decl., ¶ 9.) However, the Court notes the
Stipulation only provides that, in the event of default, Plaintiff may “cause
judgment to be entered for the settlement amount set forth in the agreement,
after crediting payments that have been made at that time.” (6/10/24
Stipulation, ¶ 6, emphasis added.) Thus, the Stipulation provides for judgment
of $3,000 only, reflecting the settlement amount of $12,992.06 less payments
made of $9,992.06. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed
Motion is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $3,000.
