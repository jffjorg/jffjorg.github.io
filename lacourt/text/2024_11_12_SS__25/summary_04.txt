And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to reassign the judgment back to himself due to the assignee, Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC, being suspended by the California Secretary of State and refusing to reassign the judgment. The plaintiff assigned the judgment to Ex Parte Collection on May 17, 2011, and Ex Parte Collection filed an Application for and Renewal of Judgment on August 24, 2018. However, the California Secretary of State suspended Ex Parte Collection's powers and privileges on October 1, 2020, and despite the plaintiff's repeated requests, Ex Parte Collection refused to reassign the judgment. The judge finds that Ex Parte Collection failed to fulfill its fiduciary duties to the plaintiff and orders the reassignment of the judgment back to the plaintiff.
