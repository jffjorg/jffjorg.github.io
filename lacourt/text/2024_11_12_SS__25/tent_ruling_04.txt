ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On April 10, 2009, judgment was
entered in this action in favor of Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor James
Rodriquez (“Plaintiff”) and against Defendant and Judgment Debtor Bonami, Inc.
(“Defendant”) in the amount of $3,105. (Motion, p. 3; 4/10/09 Minute Order;
8/24/18 Application For and Renewal of Judgment.) 
 
Subsequently, Plaintiff assigned the
judgment to Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC (“Ex Parte Collection”). (Rodriguez
Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
On August 24, 2018, Ex Parte
Collection, claiming to be assignee of record, filed an Application For and Renewal
of Judgment in the amount of $8,215.02, reflecting the $3,105 total judgment,
$2,250 for costs after judgment, $2,830.02 interest after judgment, and a $30
filing fee. (8/24/18 Application For and Renewal of Judgment.) 
 
On September 17, 2018, the Court
approved Ex Parte Collection’s Application for and Renewal of Judgment.
(9/17/18 Notice of Renewal of Judgment.) 
 
On October 1, 2020, the California
Secretary of State suspended Ex Parte Collection’s powers and privileges for
nonpayment of taxes to the Franchise Tax Board. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 3, Exhs. 1,
2.)
 
On September 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Notice of Motion and Motion for Order Reassigning Judgment Back to
James Rodriguez (the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition has been filed. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
Plaintiff asserts that he filed an
“Acknowledgment of Assignment of Judgment” on May 17, 2011 assigning the
judgment to Ex Parte Collection and now seeks
to reassign the judgment back to Plaintiff. Plaintiff contends reassignment is necessary because Ex
Parte Collection is now a suspended entity that cannot legally collect or
enforce the judgment on Plaintiff’s behalf and refuses to reassign the judgment
back to Plaintiff despite Plaintiff’s multiple demands. (Motion, p. 3;
Rodriguez Decl., Exhs. 1, 2, 3.) 
 
            Under Code of Civil Procedure section 681.020, “An assignee
of a judgment is not entitled to enforce the judgment under this title unless
an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment to that assignee has been filed or
the assignee has otherwise become an assignee of record under Section 673.”
 
            The Court’s records indicate that Plaintiff filed an
acknowledgment of assignment of judgment to Ex Parte Collection on May 17, 2011.

 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a), “Every court shall have the
power to… compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and process, and to the
orders of a judge out of court, in an action or proceeding pending therein.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a); see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 177, 187; Yolanda’s,
Inc. v. Kahl & Goveia Comm’l Real Estate (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 509,
514.)
 
“[T]he
relationship between a collection agency and a judgment creditor is fiduciary
in nature.” (Cross v. Bonded Adjustment Bureau (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th
266, 276 (Cross).) “ ‘An assignment for collection vests legal title in
the assignee which is sufficient to enable him to maintain an action in his own
name, but the assignor retains the equitable interest in the thing assigned….
Such an assignee has been referred to as the trustee or agent of the assignor…,
and a fiduciary relationship exists between them.” (Id., at pp.
276-277.) Such a relationship necessitates an obligation for the collection
agency and judgment creditor to “ ‘act in the highest good faith by reason of
such relationship.’ ” (See id., at p. 276; Wolf v. Superior Court
(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 25, 29.)
 
            Ultimately, “ ‘[w]hether the defendant breached [a
fiduciary duty] towards the plaintiff is a question of fact.’ ” (Marzec v.
Cal. Public Employees Retirement System (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 889, 915,
citation omitted.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff
assigned the judgment to Ex Parte Collections and thus created a fiduciary
relationship between them. (See Cross, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at p.
276.) After assignment, Plaintiff still retained equitable interest in the
judgment, and Ex Parte Collections had a duty to act in the highest good faith regarding
its obligations to Plaintiff given the fiduciary nature of their relationship.
(Id., at pp. 276-277; Wolf, supra, 107 Cal.App.4th at p.
29.) 
 
However, Plaintiff’s
evidence demonstrates that Ex Parte Collections failed to fulfill its duties as
assignee through its suspension by the California Secretary of State and refusal
to respond to Plaintiff’s repeated requests for reassignment. (Rodriguez Decl. ¶¶ 3-5, 8, Exhs. 1-3;
see Marzec, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at p. 915.) Due to these failures, the Court agrees its
prior judgment has been rendered “null and void in effect” since there is now
no party with the legal right to collect the judgment. (Motion, p. 4; Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 126, 177, 187.)  
 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion and orders reassignment of the judgment
back to Plaintiff. 
 
III.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
Plaintiff James Rodriguez’s Motion for
Order Reassigning Judgment is GRANTED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
