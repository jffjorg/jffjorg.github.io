ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On November 29, 2018, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Justin Alan
Newsome (“Defendant”) and Does 1-5 alleging property damage following a vehicle
collision. (Compl., ¶ 7.) 
 
On March 8, 2019, Defendant filed an Answer.
 
On January 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation for
Entry of Judgment in the Event of Default (the “Stipulation”). 
 
On March 2, 2021, the Hon. James E. Blancarte signed an
order dismissing the action but retaining jurisdiction under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6. (3/2/21 Order.)
 
On July 16, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Vacate
Dismissal and Enter Judgment Against Defendant. 
 
On September 10, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Withdrawal informing all parties Plaintiff was withdrawing the Motion to Vacate
Dismissal and Enter Judgment Against Defendant.
 
On September 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment Against Defendant (the
“Motion”). 
 
No Opposition was filed.  

 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by
a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
(3) If an insurer is defending and indemnifying a party
to the action, an agent who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on
the party’s behalf. This paragraph does not apply if the party whom the insurer
is defending would be liable under the terms of the settlement for any amount
above the policy limits.” 
 
The Stipulation filed by Plaintiff was
signed by Plaintiff’s authorized representative Caryl A. Holthouse on January
15, 2021, by Plaintiff’s counsel on January 7, 2021, and by Defendant on an
unknown date. (1/29/21 Stipulation, p. 4.) The Court notes there are also some
discrepancies in the date markers on the Stipulation form as the “Dated” lines
end in “2020”; however, the dates on the line are complete in and of themselves
and end in “2021” or “21.”  
 
The Stipulation provides the matter
would be settled for a total sum of $13,370.15 plus costs of suit and
prejudgment interest from the date of loss. (1/29/21 Stipulation, ¶ 1.) The
Stipulation then states Defendant is to pay a total sum of $7,000, reflecting
$5,000 paid by Defendant’s insurance carrier and $2,000 to be paid by Defendant
at a rate of $50 per month, beginning March 15, 2021 and continuing on the fifteenth
day of each month thereafter until paid in full. (1/29/21 Stipulation, ¶ 2.) 
 
The Stipulation further states that
failure to make a timely payment constitutes a default and, in the event of
default, there is a 15-day grace period for Defendant to make payment,
Plaintiff shall give written notice to Defendant regarding the default, and
Defendant shall be allowed an additional ten days from the date of written
notice to cure the particular default. (1/29/21 Stipulation, ¶¶ 5, 7.) If Defendant
fails to cure the default, the Stipulation states “Plaintiff may immediately
cause Judgment to be entered pursuant to the terms set forth in this
Stipulation for the full amount of the agreed upon judgment as set forth in
Paragraph 1 less any monies paid to date of the breach; and shall also file a
partial Satisfaction of Judgment for all sums previously paid pursuant to this
Stipulation.”  (1/29/21
Stipulation, ¶ 5.)
 
The Court finds the Stipulation to be
valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. Plaintiff
provides evidence that Defendant made partial payment – Defendant’s insurance
carrier paid a total of $5,000 and Defendant made payments in the sum of
$750.25. (Benson Decl., ¶ 5.) As of the date this Motion was filed, however,
Plaintiff had received no further payments from Defendant since the Notice of
Default. (Benson Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff also presents evidence of the default
payment letter sent to Defendant on June 12, 2024 advising Defendant of the
default and the balance then due in the sum of $1,249.75. (Benson Decl., ¶ 6,
Exh. 2.) 
 
Plaintiff requests that a judgment of $8,083.40, based
on the principal amount of $13,370.15, less payments received in the amount of
$5,750.25 plus suit costs in the amount of $463.50 ($388.00 lawsuit filing fee
plus $75.50 service costs), be entered against Defendant. (Benson Decl., ¶ 9.) 
 
Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion is GRANTED.
