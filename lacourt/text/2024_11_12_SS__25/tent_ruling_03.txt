ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On July 8, 2024, Petitioners Iehab A.
Ibrahim and Christina M. Ibrahim (“Petitioners”) filed the instant verified Petition
for Release of Property from Lien (the “Petition”) against Universal Floor
Source, Inc. (“Respondent”). The Petition seeks an order releasing property
commonly known as 1921 Voorhees Avenue, Redondo Beach, California 90278 (the
“Subject Property”) from a mechanic’s lien recorded on November 16, 2023 by
Respondent. (Petn., ¶¶ 1, 2.) 
 
Petitioners filed a proof of service demonstrating
Respondent was substitute served with the Petition and notice of hearing on August
16, 2024 at 24520 Crenshaw Boulevard, Unit A, Torrance, CA 90505 (the “Crenshaw
Address”). (8/27/24 Proof of Service.) The proof of service also includes a
declaration of due diligence and a declaration of mailing demonstrating the
documents were mailed to Respondent to the Crenshaw Address on August 19, 2024.
(8/27/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
On September 4, 2024, Petitioners filed proof of service
demonstrating Respondent was served by mail with the notice of hearing on
August 20, 2024. (9/4/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
On November 4, 2024, Petitioners filed a Proposed Order
and proof of service demonstrating Respondent was served by mail with the
Proposed Order on November 4, 2024. (11/4/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
No Response has been filed. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
After a
mechanic’s lien has been recorded, “[t]he owner of property or the owner of any
interest in property subject to a claim of lien may petition the court for an
order to release the property from the claim of lien if the claimant has not
commenced an action to enforce the lien within the time provided in Section
8460.”  (Civ. Code, § 8480, subd.
(a).)  A claimant must commence an action
to enforce a lien within 90 days of recording the lien. (Civ. Code, § 8460,
subd. (a).)  Section 8460 further provides
that “[i]f the claimant does not commence an action to enforce the lien within
that time, the claim of lien expires and is unenforceable.” (Civ. Code, § 8460,
subd. (a).) Section 8460 also provides that the 90-day time limit to commence
an action to enforce a lien does not apply if there was an agreement to extend
credit and a notice of that fact was recorded within 90 days after recordation
of the claim of lien or more than 90 days after recordation of the claim of
lien but before a purchaser or encumbrancer for value and in good faith
acquires rights in the property.  (Civ.
Code, § 8460, subd. (b).)  
 
III.             
Discussion

 
Petition Requirements 
            Civil Code section 8484 requires
that the petition for release order be verified by the petitioner and allege
the following:
 
(a) The date of recordation of the claim of lien. A certified copy of
the claim of lien shall be attached to the petition.
(b) The county in which the claim of lien is recorded.
(c) The book and page or series number of the place in the official
records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The legal description of the property subject to the claim of lien.
(e) Whether an extension of credit has been granted under Section 8460,
if so to what date, and that the time for commencement of an action to enforce
the lien has expired.
(f) That the owner has given the claimant notice under Section 8482
demanding that the claimant execute and record a release of the lien and that
the claimant is unable or unwilling to do so or cannot with reasonable
diligence be found.
(g) Whether an action to enforce the lien is pending.
(h) Whether the owner of the property or interest in the property has
filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is another restraint that prevents the
claimant from commencing an action to enforce the lien. 
 
            (Civ.
Code, § 8484.) 
 
A property owner “may not petition the
court for a release order … unless at least 10 days before filing the petition
the owner gives the claimant notice demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of the claim of lien.” (Civ. Code, § 8482.)
 
The instant Petition is verified and is accompanied by a
certified copy of the Claim of Mechanic’s Lien, Document No. 20230794418, filed
with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on November 16, 2023. (Petn.,
Exh. A.) The Petition states the legal description of the subject property,
that no extension of credit has been granted, that the 90-day time period to
enforce the lien has expired, that Petitioners gave notice under Section 8482
of their demand and Respondent did not respond, that Petitioners have not filed
for bankruptcy, and that no other restraint exists preventing Respondent from
filing an action to enforce the lien. (Petn., at pp. 1-2.) 
 
Petitioners also include a copy of an April 9, 2024
letter that was mailed to Respondent at 24520 S. Crenshaw Boulevard, Suite A,
Torrance, California 90505 – the same address listed on the Claim of Mechanic’s Lien filed with the
County Recorder’s Office – demanding that the mechanic’s lien be
released. (Petn., Exh. B.) 
 
Service
Requirements 
 
“The petitioner shall serve a copy of
the petition and a notice of hearing on the claimant at least 15 days before
the hearing.  Service shall be made in
the same manner as service of summons, or by certified or registered mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the claimant as
provided in Section 8108.”  (Civ. Code, § 8486, subd. (b).) Section 8108
provides addresses at which a respondent must be served, depending on the title
of the person to be served. The petitioner bears the burden of proving he
complied with service and date for hearing requirements. (Civ. Code, § 8488,
subd. (a).)
 
Here,
Respondent was served by substitute service on August 16, 2024 at
the Crenshaw Address. While the Crenshaw Address is substantially similar to
the address that Respondent listed on the Claim of Mechanic’s Lien filed with
the County Recorder’s Office (Petn., Exh. A), the Court notes there is a
discrepancy between the two addresses – namely, the Crenshaw Address does not
contain the “South” demarcation present in the address listed on the Claim of
Mechanic’s Lien.
 
Further,
Petitioners failed to serve Respondent with the Proposed Order until November
4, 2024, just five court days before the instant hearing. 
 
Accordingly, Petitioners are
ordered to file a new proof of service or clarify the discrepancy at the next
hearing.
