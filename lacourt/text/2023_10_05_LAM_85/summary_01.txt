And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for appointment of a receiver and finds that it is warranted. The plaintiff, ATO Holdings LLC, has loaned $47,570,000 to the defendant, E.L. Lotus LLC, with a note and deed of trust. The loan has gone into default, and the borrower has abandoned the property. The court finds that the property is in peril and that the borrower has not taken any action to repay the outstanding indebtedness.

The court grants the motion for appointment of a receiver and orders the appointment of Mitch Vanneman as receiver. The receiver's duties will include managing and operating the property, completing the construction project, and collecting rents and profits. The court will discuss the details of the receiver's duties and the proposed order at the hearing.

The court notes that the proposed order is not on the Judicial Council form for a capital receiver, and that the court is unclear how much work is required to complete the construction project and how the receiver will accomplish it from Chicago. The court will address these issues with counsel at the hearing.
