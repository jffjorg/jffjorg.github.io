Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV02500

 
Motion
filed: 6/4/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Salomon Melchor  
RESPONDING PARTY: None.
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to compel Plaintiff Ramiro Hernandez to respond to Defendant
Salomon Melchor’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, and to impose monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff Remiro Hernandez and his counsel in the amount of $1,800.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged personal injuries and
damages Plaintiffs sustained as a result of an automotive collision on or about
August 22, 2021.
 
On August 18, 2023, Plaintiffs Maria De La Cruz (“Cruz”),
Luis Enrique Hernandez Correa (“Correa”), and Ramiro Hernandez (“Hernandez”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint
against Defendant Salomon Melchor (“Defendant” or “Melchor”), and Does 1
through 50, alleging a single cause of action for Negligence/Negligence Per Se.
Subsequently, Melchor filed an Answer to the Complaint on January 19, 2024.
 
On June
4, 2024, Defendant Melchor filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”). Subsequently, Melchor filed a Notice
of Non-Opposition on November 4, 2024.
 
No Opposition or Reply papers
have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a party to
whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary
sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no
time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that
needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was
properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired,
and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Additionally,
“[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response ... [t]he party to whom the
interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One
 
Defendant’s counsel, Christian
A. Abella (“Abella”), attests that on February 7, 2024, Plaintiff Hernandez was
served with the first set of Special Interrogatories by email. (Abella Decl. ¶ 3,
Ex. “A.”) This service established that responses were due on March 12, 2024. On
March 14, 2024, Defendant sent a meet and confer letter to Hernandez’s counsel
requesting responses. (Id. ¶ 4.) On March 15, 2024, Hernandez’s counsel
sent Defendant’s counsel an email requesting a two-week extension to respond.
The request was granted, establishing the deadline to respond as March 29,
2024. (Id. ¶ 5.) On April 3, 2024, Hernandez’s counsel requested an
additional two-week extension. That request was granted by Defendant’s counsel
on the condition that the responses must be served without objections, setting
the new deadline to be April 17, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6.) However, as of the
date of filing of the Motion, Hernandez has not served any responses. (Id.
¶ 7.) 
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Plaintiff Hernandez failed to serve a timely
response, thereby waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those
based on privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless,
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), “[t]he court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve
a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.”
 
Here,
Plaintiff Hernandez did not file an Opposition to the Motion. Nor did he move
separately for relief from the waiver. Additionally, there is no record
indicating any responses have been subsequently served by Hernandez prior to
the hearing. Consequently, the Court finds that relief under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision(a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the unopposed
Motion.
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust....” 
 
Additionally,
California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
The Court finds the mandatory sanction
applies in this case. Given the substantial similarity of this Motion to
several concurrently filed motions, and utilizing the lodestar approach, the
Court determines the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the Motion to be $360.00,
calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $300.00 for one hour of work
reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s request for
monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Salomon Melchor’s unopposed Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff
Ramiro Hernandez is ordered to serve verified responses, without objection, to the
Special Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days. 
 
Defendant Salomon Melchor’s
Request
for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Plaintiff
Ramiro Hernandez and his attorney of record are ordered to jointly and
severally pay $360.00 to Defendant Salomon
Melchor’s counsel within
20 days.
