And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, set one, filed by Salomon Melchor against the plaintiff, Ramiro Hernandez. The motion was unopposed, and the court found that the plaintiff failed to serve a timely response, waiving any objection to the interrogatories. The court ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses, without objection, to the special interrogatories, set one, within 20 days.

The court also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in part, ordering the plaintiff and his attorney to jointly and severally pay $360.00 to the defendant's counsel within 20 days. The court found that the mandatory sanction applies in this case, and the amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the motion was calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $300.00 for one hour of work reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.
