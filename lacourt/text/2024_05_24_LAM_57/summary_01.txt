And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Maganda Corporation and Faramarz Fred Faramarzi, dismissing Amko, LLC's claims for breach of contract, specific performance, and conversion. The court finds that Amko failed to pay the full purchase price of $1.1 million for the Subject Property, and that Merizan did not have authority to sign the Agreement on behalf of Maganda and Faramarzi. The court also rejects Amko's arguments that the doctrines of waiver, estoppel, and forfeiture apply to the evidence before the court. Finally, the court denies Amko's request to continue the hearing on the motion so that Amko can depose Merizan, as Amko failed to provide a supporting declaration from its counsel under Code of Civil Procedure Section 437c(h).
