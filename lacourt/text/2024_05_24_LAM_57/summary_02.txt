And here is the English text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling clarifies the scope of the attorney-client privilege in the case of Jacob Sperling, who is seeking clarification of the Court's previous ruling on attorney-client privilege. The Court had previously determined that communications between Jacob's agents, including his daughter Naomi and accountant Samuel Levy, were not privileged in the absence of an attorney's presence. The Court has now granted Jacob's application for clarification, but has denied his request to interpret the Privilege Ruling in a way that would allow him to withhold certain communications from production. The Court has cited California law, including Evidence Code Sections 953, 912, 952, and 954, in reaching its decision.
