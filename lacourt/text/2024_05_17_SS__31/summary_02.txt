And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court will consider the motion to seal the petition for approval of compromise. The petition was initially filed on January 10, 2024, and was revised on April 23, 2024. The Court instructed the plaintiff to tailor the proposed redactions more narrowly. The plaintiff has lodged unredacted and redacted copies of the proposed petition. The Court agrees that a confidential settlement agreement may support sealing of court records. However, the Court is unable to locate a copy of the Settlement Agreement, which is premised on the contention that the overriding interest is supported by the confidentiality provision. The motion to seal is continued to provide the plaintiff the opportunity to lodge the absent agreement. The hearing on the motion to seal is continued to ___________________."
