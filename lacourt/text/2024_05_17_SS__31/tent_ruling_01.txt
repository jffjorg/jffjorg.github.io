  Case Number:  20STCV08506    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 05/17/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 20STCV08506 RICHARD MUPENZI, et al. vs MIRACLE HOME HEALTH CARE, INC. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR RICHARD MUPENZI, Age 30 RECOMMENDATION: GRANT  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claims against Defendants for the total amount of $200,000, with $175,000 being apportioned to Richard Mupenzi (“Claimant”), an adult person with a disability. If the settlement is approved, $3,559.39 will be used for medical expenses, $60,416.66 for attorneys’ fees, and $7,905.64 will be used for costs.  The net balance of $103,122.31 will be placed into a Special Needs Trust for the benefit of Claimant.  The Court has reviewed the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable.  The Court also finds the attorneys’ fees fair and reasonable, because the Court is satisfied with the attorney declaration justifying 35% of Claimant’s settlement.      BACKGROUND  This matter was previously heard on February 22, 2024, and the Court made the following rulings:  The Court continues the hearing to require 15 days’ notice to the three state agencies. The Court will require trustee bond: $113,000 The Court will require first trust accounting in one year and set calendar due date for filing in 14 months. The Court sets OSC in civil department in approximately 60 days to ensure funding of settlement, submission of bond, purchase of annuity if relevant, and filing of LASC Form PRO 044 to open trust supervision action in probate. Proposed Order: Corrections needed. Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  On the Court's own motion, the Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement) scheduled for 02/28/2024, and Order to Show Cause Re: Petition to Approve Compromise scheduled for 02/28/2024 are advanced to this date and continued to 05/03/2024 at 08:30 AM in Department 31 at Spring Street Courthouse.  Some of the defects have been corrected while other defects in the proposed order remain as will be addressed below.    ¿ PROPOSED TRUST INSTRUMENT  NOTICE TO STATE AGENCIES WHEN PROPOSED TRUST IS AN SNT:  When seeking approval of a special needs trust (SNT), notice of the hearing and service of the petition must be made upon three state agencies including the Dept. of Mental Health, Dept. of Developmental Services, and Dept. of Health Care Services.  (Probate Code sections 3602(f), 3611(c).). A proof of service indicates that service and notice is complete.    PLAINTIFF:     Richard Mupenzi, age 30, Disabled  PETITIONER:     Monica Mbabazi, parent and GAL  GROSS AND NET SETTLEMENT (Petition, p. 6, sections 15 and 16f):     Gross $175,000, Net $103,122.31  PROPOSED RECIPIENT OF SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS (Petition, pp. 8-9, sec. 18):  Petitioner proposes to fund the entire net settlement proceeds into a SNT for plaintiff’s benefit.    An SNT is used to receive the settlement funds in these situations so that plaintiff does not lose benefits eligibility for Medi-Cal, SSI, and other benefits.  Historically, a person receiving Medi-Cal or SSI benefits could have only up to $2,000 in non-exempt assets, and any additional non-exempt assets over $2,000 would cause the loss of benefits eligibility under the relevant federal and state law.  Funds held in a valid SNT, however, are exempt assets that do not count toward the $2,000 asset limit for purposes of calculating benefits eligibility.  On January 1, 2024, the Medi-Cal asset qualification limit was eliminated and there is no longer a means test for Medi-Cal.  The asset qualification for other benefits, like SSI, did not change and therefore there might remain a reason for creation and funding of a SNT to maintain other benefits.     BRIEFING REGARDING TRUST ISSUES:  Petitioner provides briefing regarding trust issue at Attachment 18b(4), court’s pdf at p. 53.  PROPOSED TRUST INSTRUMENT:  Petitioner provides the proposed trust instrument as part of Attachment 18b(4), court’s pdf at p. 65.  The main requirements for court created or funded trusts are set forth at California Rules of Court (CRC) rule 7.903(c) and LASC rule 4.116(b).  The proposed trust instrument meets those requirements.  ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR RELIEF:  Petitioner makes the following additional requests for relief that are beyond those fundamental to the approval and funding of a settlement trust:  Petitioner requests authority to pay $5,000 fees to trust specialist counsel, Joel J. Loquvam, for tasks relating to the minor’s settlement trust including drafting of the trust instrument and related portions of this petition.  (Court’s pdf at p. 61.)  Approved.     FINDINGS WHEN THE PROPOSED TRUST IS AN SNT:  When approving the establishment or funding of a SNT from settlement proceeds, the court must make the following findings pursuant to Probate Code section 3604(b) (there are factual allegations in the Petition to Approve Compromise and its attachments supporting the settlement that generally cover the requisite findings):  The SNT beneficiary has a disability which substantially impairs the individual’s ability to provide for her own care or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap; The SNT beneficiary is likely to have special needs that will not be met without the trust;  The money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet the SNT beneficiary’s special needs.  The Court will make the above findings.  TRUSTE AND BOND:  The proposed initial trustee is petition, Monica Mbabazi.  Normally, bond must be required of a trustee unless the trustee is a corporate fiduciary.  (California Rules of Court, Rule 7.903(c)(5), Probate Code section 2320.). The proposed trustee does not meet the definition of a corporate fiduciary.  Petitioner does not calculate bond in the SNT briefing but includes a $113,000 bond statement in the proposed order at p. 3, Section 11.  That bond calculation appears to be correct based upon the assets to be funded into the trust, plus anticipated annual income from investments, plus an additional amount required for the costs of any recovery on the bond.  The Court will require $113,000 bond to be submitted by trustee to this department (which will later be resubmitted to the Probate court in any trust supervision action).        ORDERS/PROPOSED ORDER:  Proposed Order received stamp date:  2/29/24 General trust orders at Attachment 13, order pdf, p. 5. Trust terms were not included in order as required (Probate Code section 3604(a).  Complete. Required Probate Code 3604(b) findings are not clearly made in order.  Instead, other findings are set forth at pp. 5-6, para. 6.  Complete. Order requires first trust accounting in one year and sets 14 month calendar due date, but two blanks are provided at p. 7, para. d.  The order should provide that an accounting is due in one year and provide one blank for the court to enter a 14 month calendar due date.  Complete. Order requires filing of a Notice of Commencement of Proceedings for a Court Supervised Trust on LASC Form PRO 044.  Complete.   The Court grants the petition.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
