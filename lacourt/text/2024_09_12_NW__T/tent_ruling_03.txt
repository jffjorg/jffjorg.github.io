Introduction

Defendants
MICBRI Properties, LLC and High Point Real Estate, Inc. (collectively,
Defendants) moved to strike Plaintiffs Nataliia Tsepenyuk, Vadim Tsepenyuk,
Nataliia Tsepenyuk, as Guardian Ad Litem for Svitlana Kolomiichuk, an
incapacitated adult, and Avraam Tsepenyuk’s, a minor, (collectively,
Plaintiffs) request for punitive damages and attorneys’ fees alleged in the
First Amended Complaint (FAC).   The
punitive damages at issue are found at FAC, paragraph 66, and Prayer, paragraph
2.  The attorneys’ fees at issue are found
at FAC, paragraph 42 , and Prayer, paragraph 6. 
Defendants’ Notice incorrectly identified the paragraph as no. 42.  (See Notice, par. 1, pg. 2:3.)  Paragraph 42 of the FAC is found under the
first COA and not the second COA. 
Attorneys’ fees alleged in paragraph 42 under the first COA for breach
of the implied warranty of habitability were not in issue at the prior hearing
and are not in issue in the instant motion. 
The fees requested under the second COA are found at paragraph 48.  Within this ruling, the Court refers to the
fees allegation found in paragraph 48.
Procedure

Defendants
argued that the attorneys’ fees requested in the second cause of action (COA)
for nuisance is improperly re-alleged from the original Complaint.  At the prior hearing on Defendants’ motion to
strike attorneys’ fees alleged in the original Complaint, the Court granted the
motion to strike without leave to amend as to the request for attorneys’ fees
made in paragraph 29 under the second cause of action (COA) for nuisance.  (See Court Minute Order dated June 27,
2024.)  As submitted by the parties, the
allegation for attorneys’ fees under the second COA for nuisance was improperly
re-asserted in the FAC at paragraph 48. 
Because the Court previously reviewed the request for fees under the
second COA and ruled upon it, the Court need not review the matter again.  Because the fees’ request under the second
COA in the FAC is improperly re-alleged, the motion’s arguments are persuasive.
The
motion to strike the attorneys’ fees request in FAC par. 48 and under the
second COA is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 

As
to the motion to strike the request for fees in FAC Prayer, paragraph 2, the
motion is DENIED because the fees requested under the first COA is still
viable, which makes the requested in the Prayer still viable.
Discussion

At
the prior hearing, Plaintiff was granted leave to amend the request for
punitive damages.  Plaintiff was to add
specific factual allegations to plead malice, oppression, or fraud and to plead
punitive damages against a corporate employer. 
(Civ. Code, sec. 3294(b).) 
Specifically as to a corporate employer, Plaintiff was to add facts to
allege the corporate employer’s “advance knowledge of the unfitness of the
employee” or a corporate officer, director or managing agent of the corporation
ratifying the wrongful conduct.  The FAC
is still lacking in specific facts to show Defendants’ advance knowledge of the
unfitness of an employee or authorization or ratification or personal
responsibility for oppression, fraud, or malice by an officer, director, or
managing agent.  Plaintiffs argued that
the allegations identifying Property Manager Elvira as a managing agent is
sufficient to meet the pleading requirements. 
However, there are insufficient facts to show that a Property Manager
and/or Elvira exercises independent authority and judgment in their corporate
decision-making so that their decisions determine corporate policy.  (White v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th
563, 566-567.)  The argument is
persuasive.
Plaintiffs
asserted that they served discovery and presume that the employee ratifying
Elvira’s conduct will be identified. 
However, it remains that the FAC insufficiently alleges supportive facts
for punitive damages as to a corporate employer.  
The
motion to strike punitive damages is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.  To the extent that discovery responses may
reveal additional facts, the ruling on the instant motion to strike does not
prohibit Plaintiffs from filing a future motion for leave to amend the FAC.
IT
IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
