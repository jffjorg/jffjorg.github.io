And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several issues related to the upcoming court hearing. The plaintiff's motions in limine (MILs) were filed and no oppositions were filed by the defendant.

The judge denied the plaintiff's first MIL, which sought to limit the reading instructions to 5 minutes or less. The judge also granted the second MIL, which allowed the plaintiff to present mini-opening statements of less than 5 minutes.

The judge addressed several issues related to expert testimony and evidence. The judge denied the third MIL, which sought to exclude expert opinions that are not relevant to the case. The judge also denied the fourth MIL, which sought to exclude the medical chronology from evidence. However, the judge granted the fifth MIL, which allowed medical experts to rely on medical records for their opinions, but not the records themselves.

The judge denied the sixth MIL, which sought to exclude expert opinions that refer to other conditions. The judge denied the seventh MIL, which sought to exclude any mention of a fall from a horse from evidence, unless the party providing the evidence can provide supporting evidence and discuss it with the court.

The judge also addressed several other issues, including the admissibility of medical records and statements, and the relevance of certain conditions. The judge indicated that some of these issues will be discussed further at the hearing.

The defendant did not file any motions in limine, so none of those were addressed by the judge.
