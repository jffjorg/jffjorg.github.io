And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint. The judge is seeking to clarify the spelling of the plaintiff's name, Nataliia Tsepenyuk, and whether it has two "I"s or one. The judge also notes that if Svitlana Kolomiichuk is an incapacitated adult, she needs a guardian ad litem (GAL) and the application should be renewed.

The judge grants the motion to strike in part and denies it in part. The motion to strike punitive damages is granted without leave to amend, as the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient. The motion to strike attorneys' fees is also granted without leave to amend, as the fees requested under the second cause of action are improperly re-alleged. However, the judge denies the prayer for punitive damages, as the fees requested under the first cause of action are still viable.

The judge orders the defendants to file their answer to the First Amended Complaint within 20 days. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the First Amended Complaint is denied, as the plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient facts to support their allegations.
