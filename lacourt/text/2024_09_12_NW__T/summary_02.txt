And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tatia Calhoun vs. Yosi Shaya, case number 23VECV05477. The Judge has sustained the Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint without leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff's lawsuit cannot be changed or corrected. The Judge has also granted the Defendant's motion to strike certain factual allegations from the Complaint.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff's Complaint contains pleading defects, and that the Defendant's arguments were persuasive. The Plaintiff failed to file an opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike, and therefore did not show how the pleading defects could be cured.

The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to file and serve a verified answer to the Complaint within 20 days. The Judge has also ordered the Defendant to file and serve a verified answer within 20 days.

The Judge's decision means that the Plaintiff's lawsuit will likely be dismissed, and that the Defendant will not have to respond to the Complaint.
