  Case Number:  19STCV36328    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  11 19STCV36328 (Martinez)   Tentative Ruling Re: Supplemental Briefing Re: Motion for Leave to  Amend   Date:                           12/20/2024 Time:                          10:00 am Moving Party:           Bibiyan  Law Group, P.C. (“Plaintiff’s Counsel”) Opposing Party:        ACS  Staffing, Inc. (“Defendant”) Department:              11 Judge:                        David  S. Cunningham III ________________________________________________________________________   TENTATIVE RULING   Plaintiff Counsel’s motion for leave to amend is granted.   BACKGROUND   “This is a wage-and-hour  case.”  (10/14/24 Ruling Re: Motion for  Leave to Amend, p. 1.)  “Plaintiff  alleges class and representative claims under the Labor Code, Unfair Competition  Law, and [PAGA].”  (Ibid.)[1]   On October 14, 2024, Plaintiff’s  Counsel’s motion for leave to amend came on for hearing.  “The purpose of the motion is twofold – to  add a new representative named Sara Sobenes in Plaintiff’s place and to dismiss  Plaintiff without prejudice.”  (Id. at p.  2.)  The Court continued the matter “to  give Plaintiff’s Counsel a chance to decide whether Sobenes is the right person  to serve as the new representative.”   (Id. at p. 5.)   In particular, the Court offered  Plaintiff’s Counsel two options:     If they want to  continue with Sobenes, they should redraft the proposed [third amended  complaint (“TAC”)] to allege facts demonstrating relation back and PAGA  standing, and they should prepare themselves to oppose an arbitration motion in  case Defendant decides to file one.  If  they want to conduct discovery to find a different new representative, they  should set up a discovery conference.   (Ibid.)   On October 28, 2024, Plaintiff’s  Counsel filed a supplemental declaration.   On November 12, 2024, Defendant  filed a rebuttal brief.   The issue now is whether the  supplemental papers support granting or denying Plaintiff’s Counsel’s motion.   LAW   “The  court may grant leave to amend the pleadings at any stage of the action.  A party may discover the need to amend after  all pleadings are completed and new information requires a change in the  nature of the claims or defenses previously pleaded.”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:  Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update) ¶ 6:636,  emphasis in original.)  “Such changes  usually cannot be made on ex parte procedure [citation].  Rather, a formal motion to amend must be  served and filed.”  (Ibid.)     “Motions for leave to amend are  directed to the sound discretion of the judge.”   (Id. at ¶ 6:637.)  “The court may,  in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to  amend any pleading.”  (Cal. Code Civ.  Proc. § 473, subd. (a)(1).)  “However,  the court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment  of pleadings.”  (Howard v. County of  San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.)     “The policy favoring amendment is  so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be  justified.”  (Ibid.)  “Leave to amend should be denied only where  the facts are not in dispute, and the nature of the plaintiff’s claim is clear,  but under substantive law, no liability exists and no amendment would change  the result.”  (Edwards v. Superior  Court (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 172, 180.)  In fact, “[i]f the  motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not  prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and  where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert  a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error  but an abuse of discretion.”  (Morgan  v. Superior Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)   DISCUSSION    Class Claims   Plaintiff’s Counsel’s choice is  to continue with Sobenes.   Defendant contends leave to amend  should be denied because Plaintiff’s Counsel failed to submit a declaration  from Sobenes that proves her claims relate back to Plaintiff’s complaint. (See  Defendant’s Rebuttal Brief, p. 2.)   The Court’s October 14th  ruling states that the revised TAC must allege allegations that show  relation back, not that Sobenes must file a declaration.  (See 10/14/24 Ruling Re: Motion for Leave to  Amend, p. 5.)   “Under the relation-back  doctrine, an amendment relates back to the original complaint if the amendment:  (1) rests on the same general set of facts; (2) involves the same injury; and  (3) refers to the same [offending] instrumentality.”  (Pointe San Diego Residential Community,  L.P. v. Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch, LLP (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th  265, 276; see also Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 6:735.)    The revised TAC’s new, material allegations  appear in paragraphs 14, 31, and 32.   They state:   14. Plaintiff  Sara Sobenes was a non-exempt hourly employee living in the state of  California with various duties that included, but were not limited to, wrapping  pallets, loading and unloading deliveries, moving packages to and from the  warehouse, printing labels, printing invoices, and scheduling times for  shipping and receiving from November 2018 through July 2021.   * * *   31. Plaintiff has  complied with the procedures for bringing suit specified in Labor Code section  2699.3.  On or around October 10, 2019,  Silvestre Martinez, the previous named Plaintiff in the action, gave written notice  to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”) and to the Staffing  Defendants of the specified provisions of the Labor Code alleged to have been  violated by it (“Initial PAGA Notice”).   The LWDA did not provide notice of its intention to investigate the  Staffing Defendants’ alleged violations within sixty-five (65) calendar days of  the October 10, 2019 postmarked date of the herein-described notice sent by  Plaintiff to the LWDA and Defendants.     32. On October 7,  2024, Plaintiff filed an amended written notice to the LWDA (“Amended PAGA  Notice”) and to the Defendants of the specified provisions of the Labor Code  alleged to have been violated. In this amended written notice, Plaintiff was  included as a named Aggrieved Employee. The Amended PAGA Notice alleges the  exact same underlying Labor Code violations as the October 10, 2019 Initial  PAGA Notice. Additionally, under Esparza v. Safeway, Inc., (2nd. Dist.  Ct. Appl., 2019) 36 Cal. App. 5th 42, an untimely PAGA complaint relates back  to an earlier complaint if the earlier complaint was preceded by timely notice  to the LWDA. The policy behind statutes of limitations is to put defendants on  notice of the need to defend against a claim in time to prepare a fair defense  on the merits. This policy is satisfied when recovery under an amended  complaint is sought on the same basic set of facts as the original pleading. (Hutcheson  v. Superior Court, (1st Dist. Ct. App. 2022) 74 Cal. App. 5th 932, 940.)    (Yedoyan Supp. Decl., Ex. L, ¶¶  14, 31-32 [attaching revised TAC], bold in original, underlining of case names  added.)   The Court believes the new  allegations suffice to demonstrate relation back for the class claims.  Paragraph 14 alleges that Sobenes did the  same jobs that Plaintiff did.  (See id.  at Ex. K, ¶ 14 [attaching red-lined version of revised TAC].)  Additionally, the revised TAC continues to  plead the same wage-and-hour violations by the same Defendants as a result of  the same policies and practices.  (See  id. at Ex. K, ¶¶ 15-24, 34-44, 45, 55-138.)   All three relation-back elements are alleged.   Defendant’s director of  operations, Mirna Sevilla, claims Plaintiff and Sobenes did not do the same  jobs.  Sevilla declares that Plaintiff  was a general laborer who loaded and unloaded boxes in the warehouse, and Sobenes  was customer-service representative who worked exclusively in the office.  (Sevilla Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.)   Plaintiff Counsel’s motion is not  an evidentiary motion.  The question is  whether the revised TAC alleges relation back.   The answer is yes for the class claims.[2]   Sevilla also declares that  Sobenes signed an arbitration agreement.   (See id. at ¶ 8.)   If true, this could be a basis  for compelling arbitration, but it is not a basis for denying leave to amend.   Plaintiff Counsel’s motion is  granted.   PAGA Claim   Defendant argues that Sobenes  lacks standing, and the relation-back doctrine does not apply, because her  claim is time-barred.  (See Defendant’s  Rebuttal Brief, p. 5 [citing Hargrove v. Legacy Healthcare, Inc. (2022)  80 Cal.App.5th 782].)   “Relation back [can] apply to  amendments that substitute a plaintiff.”   (Hutcheson, supra, 74 Cal.App.5th at 940.)  “[I]f a plaintiff is determined to have  lacked standing, or if a plaintiff loses standing after the complaint is filed,  the plaintiff may amend the complaint to substitute a new plaintiff with  standing.”  (Ibid.)     On one hand, paragraphs 31 and 32  purport to allege compliance with the pre-suit notice requirement, and the  revised TAC states facts establishing the relation-back elements.  (See Yedoyan Supp. Decl., Ex. L, ¶¶ 14, 15-24,  31-32, 34-44, 45, 55-138; see also id. at Ex. K ¶¶ 14, 15-24, 31-32, 34-44, 45,  55-138.)  Hutcheson arguably holds  that the relation-back doctrine applies to the circumstances alleged here.  (See Hutcheson, supra, 74 Cal.App.5th  at 940-945.)   Indeed, the Rutter  Guide summarizes Hutcheson this way:   Amendment substituting as new PAGA plaintiff a former  employee who had not yet given PAGA notice when the original complaint was  filed. The substitution would be proper if the amended PAGA claims “rest on the  same general set of facts, involve the same injury, and refer to the same  instrumentality as the claims in the original complaint.”   (Banke & Segal, Cal. Practice  Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial Statutes of Limitations (The Rutter Group  February 2024 Update) ¶ 8:221; see also id. at ¶ 4:1287.20 [stating that  “relation back applied where new named plaintiff was substituted in to replace  prior named plaintiff who gave notice to [LWDA]”].)   On the other hand, Defendant  contends Hutcheson is distinguishable.   There, the second employee filed his own pre-suit notice and his own  PAGA lawsuit prior to the first employee’s substitution request.  It was undisputed that the second employee’s  pre-suit notice and lawsuit were timely.   (See Hutcheson, supra, 74 Cal.App.5th at 941  n.5.)  Moreover, the second employee  filed a motion to intervene in the first employee’s case.  (See id. at 937.)  Defendant claims Sobenes, by contrast, did  not file her own action, she submitted the amended notice in October 2024, more  than a year after her employment ended in July 2021 (see Yedoyan Supp. Decl.,  Exs. L, ¶¶ 14, 31-32, Ex. K, ¶¶ 14, 31-32), and she did not move to intervene.   Defendant’s authority for  claiming Hutcheson is distinguishable is Hargrove.  (See Defendant’s Rebuttal Brief, p. 5.)         The Court disagrees in part.  Hargrove, itself, has distinguishable  factors.  The first employee passed away  (a deceased plaintiff’s PAGA claim cannot be assigned); the second employee did  not have “standing to appeal the order dismissing the case[;]” and the proposed  substitution concerned different years, different facts, different injuries,  and different job positions.  (Hargrove,  supra, 80 Cal.App.5th at 789-793; see also Banke & Segal, supra,  at ¶ 8:221 [noting that “[a]n amendment to substitute a new PAGA plaintiff to  replace a deceased plaintiff was properly denied where the amended complaint  did not rest on the same general set of facts or involve the  same injury because the former and putative new plaintiff were never employed  during the same year, held different positions and suffered different alleged  injuries”], emphasis in original.)  Also,  filing a separate case and seeking intervention are not elements of the  relation-back doctrine.   The factor that helps Defendant,  though, is that, unlike Sobenes, the second employee in Hargrove filed  her notice with the LWDA within the one-year limitations period.  (See Hargrove, supra, 80 Cal.App.5th  at 787 [noting that the second employee worked from May 2019 to August 2019 and  filed her LWDA notice on May 13, 2020].)   Hargrove suggests that, to substitute into a PAGA action, and  benefit from relation back, the new plaintiff must “meet[] PAGA’s prerequisites  (standing, notice, & statute of limitations)[.]”  (Id. at 791.)   Sobenes did not file her notice within one year.     Hargrove is a Fourth  District decision, yet it fails to mention Johnson v. Maxim Healthcare  Services, Inc. (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 924, another Fourth  District case.  Johnson holds  that, even if an aggrieved employee’s individual PAGA claim is time-barred, he  or she still has standing to bring a representative PAGA claim.  (See Johnson, supra, 66 Cal.App.5th  at 929-930; see also Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th  1104, 1121 [discussing Johnson with approval].)  Sobenes qualified as an aggrieved employee  when Plaintiff filed the complaint.  (See  Yedoyan Supp. Decl., Exs. L, ¶ 14 [alleging that Sobenes worked from November  2018 through July 2021], K, ¶ 14 [same].)   But she and the Johnson plaintiff both filed LWDA notices more  than a year after they suffered the alleged wrongs.  (See id. at Exs. L, ¶¶ 31-32, K, ¶¶ 31-32;  see also Johnson, supra, 66 Cal.App.5th at 927 [stating that  the plaintiff signed the contested agreement in September 2016 and sent the  pre-suit notice in June 2019].)[3]    On balance, the Court finds that  the PAGA claim relates back and that Plaintiff’s Counsel’s motion should be  granted because:     * Hargrove is narrow and  distinguishable;     * Hutcheson and Johnson  are the more analogous decisions;    * Sobenes has standing because  she was an aggrieved employee at the time that Plaintiff filed the complaint;    * the LWDA and Defendant received  adequate notice from Plaintiff’s pre-suit notice (see Hutcheson, supra,  74 Cal.App.5th at 941, 944);   * Plaintiff’s pre-suit notice was  timely;   * assuming arguendo that  Sobenes’s individual PAGA claim is time-barred, Johnson allows her to  bring the representative PAGA claim;   * Sobenes’s amended notice and  the revised TAC allege the same facts, injuries, and instrumentality as  Plaintiff’s pre-suit notice and complaint; and    * Hutcheson’s view regarding  the applicability of the relation-back doctrine is broader than Hargrove’s  view.  (See id. at pp. 942-945 [citing Amaro  v. Anaheim Arena Management, LLC (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 521,  where “the Court of Appeal held that a PAGA plaintiff may release PAGA claims  outside the limitations period of her own PAGA claim[,]” and Kim v. Reins  International California, Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 736 for the  proposition that, if the first plaintiff’s pre-suit notice puts the LWDA on  notice of the claims, “bar[ring] the application of relation back would” harm  “PAGA’s goal of strengthening Labor Code enforcement”].)
