And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Plaintiff's Counsel's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a new representative, Sara Sobenes. The judge finds that the revised complaint alleges the same facts, injuries, and instrumentality as the original complaint, and that the relation-back doctrine applies. The judge also finds that Sobenes has standing to bring the representative PAGA claim, despite the fact that her individual PAGA claim may be time-barred. The judge rejects Defendant's arguments that Sobenes lacks standing and that the relation-back doctrine does not apply.
