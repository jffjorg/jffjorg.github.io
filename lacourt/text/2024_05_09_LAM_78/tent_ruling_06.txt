Case No.:  22STCV34273 Hearing Date:  May 9, 2024    [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  PLAINTIFF’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION AND SPECIAL INTERROGATORIESPlaintiff’s motions to compel Defendant’s further responses to Requests for Production, Set Two and Special Interrogatories, Set Two are DENIED.Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.Moving party to give notice.PROCEDURAL HISTORYOn October 25, 2022, Plaintiff filed his Complaint against Cate Romich.On February 9, 2023, Defendant answered and filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff.On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed these motions to compel Defendant’s further responses to discovery.On April 15, 2024, the parties participated in IDC.On April 29, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition.On May 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.DISCUSSION Plaintiff moves for Defendant to produce further responses to Requests for Production (RPDs) and Special Interrogatories (SROGs), both set two.I. Legal StandardUnder Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, the Court may order a responding party to serve a further response to a request for production when the Court finds that any of the following apply: 1. A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete; 2. A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 3. An objection in the response is without merit or too general. To prevail, the party moving for the order must first offer specific facts demonstrating “good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) This burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins. Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) If “good cause” is shown by the moving party, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 2030.300, the Court may order a responding party to serve a further response to interrogatories when the Court finds that any of the following apply: (1) the answer to a particular interrogatory is incomplete or evasive, (2) the exercise of the option to produce documents is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is improper or inadequate, or (3) that an objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2030.300(b)(1).) Unless notice of the motion to compel a further response is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or any specific later date to which the parties have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., sections 2031.310(c), 2030.300(c).) Sanctions are mandatory against “any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, requests for production, or requests for admission, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., sections 2031.310(h), 2030.300(d), 2033.290(d).) Sanctions may be imposed for misuse of discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2023.030, subd. (a).) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2023.010, subd. (d).)II. DiscussionHere, Plaintiff’s counsel testifies that he served RPDs and SROGs, set two on Defendant on December 11, 2023. (Kirschner Decl., ¶3.) Defendant served responses on February 2, 2024. (Id., ¶5.) Defendant served supplemental responses on February 9, 2024. (Id., ¶7.) Plaintiff’s deadline to file these motions was March 25, 2024. Plaintiff did not file these motions until April 2, 2024. Defendant argues that the motions are not timely because they were filed after the 45-day deadline. However, as Plaintiff points out, Defendant granted Plaintiff a three-week extension to file the motions to compel further. The new deadline under this extension is April 15, 2024. The motions were timely filed.Defendant served further supplemental responses on April 26, 2024 which Plaintiff agrees are satisfactory. Therefore, the motions to compel further are denied as moot. The parties dispute whether sanctions should be granted. Defendant’s counsel testified that she requested an extension to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests consisting of 144 interrogatories and 65 requests for production. (Husseman and Landis Declarations, ¶2.) After Plaintiff denied the requests, Defendant was unable to provide substantive responses and served objections on February 2, 2024. (Id., ¶4.) Defendant agreed to provide and did serve supplemental responses on February 9, 2024. (Id., ¶¶4-5.) On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent Defendant a meet and confer letter stating the supplemental responses were deficient but failing to describe the basis for that opinion. (Id., ¶6.) Plaintiff did not respond to further meet and confer correspondence. (Id., ¶7.) After serving more supplemental responses and receiving guidance from the Court during an IDC, Defendant served a final set of supplemental responses on April 26, 2024. (Id., ¶¶8, 9, 11.) Plaintiff’s counsel does not dispute Defendant’s counsel’s version of events. The facts show that Defendant’s counsel could not produce responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests in time and sought an extension which Plaintiff’s counsel refused. Defendant’s counsel served responses to meet the response deadline and thereafter repeatedly agreed to supplement the responses. Defendant has now served satisfactory responses. Because Defendant’s failure to provide complete responses was due to insufficient time to respond to Plaintiff’s voluminous requests, and Defendant thereafter worked to cure the deficiencies, the Court finds that Defendant did not engage in misuse of the discovery process. The Court declines to grant sanctions. DATED:  May 9, 2024______________________Hon. Jill Feeney Judge of the Superior Court
