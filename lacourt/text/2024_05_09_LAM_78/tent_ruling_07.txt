 Case Number:  23STCV03543    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  78  On April 11, 2024, the Court gave Plaintiff the opportunity to provide supplemental briefing on the issues of service and jurisdiction. Plaintiff filed the supplemental briefing on May 3, 2024. Plaintiff argues that service on Ifran Sajjad Ahmed and Fizzah Nasir was proper. Plaintiff has not provided any evidence that Ahmed resided at the Irvine address on the date of service. Thus, the evidence is insufficient to show service on Ahmed at the Irvine address was proper.Plaintiff provides the Articles of Incorporation and Statement of Information for MK Hair Professional, LLC, which shows Nasir’s address for service on the LLC is 1100 Town and Country Rd, Suite 1250 Orange, CA 92868, the address for the virtual office space. The evidence is sufficient to show that this is Nasir’s office (she is listed as Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation) and that Nasir receives mail at the virtual office space in Orange, California. Thus, service on Nasir was proper. At this time, the Court will not address the issue of jurisdiction as service has not been properly effectuated with respect to Ifran Ahmed.The default as to Defendant Ifran Sajjad Ahmed is set aside.The Court Sets an OSC Re: Sanctions in the Amount of $500 for failure to file Proof of Service with respect to Defendant Ifran Sajjad Ahmed pursuant to California Rule of Court 3.110(g) for August 23, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Plaintiff to provide notice.
