The settlement agreement was signed on April 1, 2024, and provides for the payment of a settlement payment by April 11, 2024. The Defendants failed to make the payment, and the Plaintiff publicly disclosed the settlement terms. The Defendants argued that the Plaintiff's disclosure of the settlement terms frustrated the purpose of the contract, but the Court found no evidence that the disclosure substantially destroyed the value of the settlement. The Court also ordered the sealing of certain documents related to the settlement agreement. The Judge concluded that the Defendants were not excused from performing under the settlement agreement due to frustration of purpose.
