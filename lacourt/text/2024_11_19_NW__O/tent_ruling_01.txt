ORDER
  GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR AN ORDER DEEMING THE TRUTH OF THE MATTERS
  ADMITTED IN HER RFAS



 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
This is a
Song-Beverly Act case between Plaintiff Kenya White (“Plaintiff”) and FCA US
LLC (“Defendant”).  
Plaintiff
seeks an order deeming the
truth of the matters admitted in her requests for admissions (“RFAs”).
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On February 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed
her Complaint, alleging (1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code Section
1793.2; (2) Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (3) Violation
of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of Express
Written Warranty Civil Code Section 1791.2 Subdivision (a); Section 1794; and
(5) Breach of The Implied Warranty of Merchantability Civil Code Section 1791.1,
Section 1794.
          On March 18, 2024, Defendant filed its
Answer.
          On October 2, 2024, this Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Defendant’s responses to her requests for
production, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. The Court
continued the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for an Order Deeming the Truth of
the Matters Admitted in her RFAs (“Motion”) to allow for additional briefing.  
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.            
Requests for Admission
“Any party may obtain discovery . . .
by a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness
of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.010.) [1] “Within 30 days after service of
requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve
the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the
response on all other parties who have appeared…” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.250(a).)
If a party to whom request for
admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(a).) The
requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as
well as for monetary sanctions. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) The
court shall issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made
serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)    
IV.         
ANALYSIS
A.            
Plaintiff’s Motion is Granted
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares Plaintiff served her RFAs on Defendant on May 6, 2023, and
that “Defendant has not served any responses or documents as of July 12, 2024.”
(Declaration of Ahmed Yousef filed July 12, 2024, ¶¶ 5-6.)
In
opposition, Defendant states “[i]t is factual that FCA US was belated in
serving its responses but contends that Plaintiff has suffered no prejudice.
The oversight was due to FCA US counsel’s mistake, inadvertence and excusable
neglect and FCA US is entitled to relief.” (Opposition, pg. 2.) 
Code Civil
Procedure § 2033.280(b) & (c) provide that where a responding party has
failed to serve a timely response, the Court “shall” order “the genuineness of
any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted” “unless it finds [the responding party] has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” Here, other than Defendant’s
conclusory, boilerplate argument quoted above, Defendant has not provided any
evidence from which this Court might conclude its purported untimely responses
are in substantial compliance with section 2033.220. 
          At
the hearing, however, a dispute arose about whether Defendant’s untimely
responses did in fact substantially comply with the code’s requirements. As a
result, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion to November 19, 2024, at
8:30 a.m. The Court granted Defendant leave to file a declaration with the responses
attached as well as a supplemental opposition of no more than five pages addressing
the issue of whether the responses substantially complied with the code on or
before October 16, 2024. Likewise, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to file a
supplemental reply of no more than five pages on or before October 30, 2024.
          As of
the Court’s writing of this ruling, Defendant has not filed supplemental
briefing. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED.  
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion
for an Order Deeming the Truth of the Matters Admitted in her RFAs.  
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      November 19, 2024
