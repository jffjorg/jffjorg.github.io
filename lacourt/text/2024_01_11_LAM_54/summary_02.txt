And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motions for leave to file first amended answers are granted. The defendants, Darryl Wong, 3344 Rowena Avenue LLC, and Emily Aspland, seek to add an affirmative defense of failure to join indispensable parties to their answers. They argue that they recently learned that the plaintiff's parents are also owners of the real property at issue in the action, making them indispensable parties. The plaintiff does not oppose the motions. The judge finds that the amendment is in the interest of justice and grants the motions. The judge notes that a motion to amend a pleading before trial must be accompanied by a separate declaration that specifies the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge also notes that a showing of prejudice is required to deny a motion to amend, and that delay alone is insufficient grounds for denial.
