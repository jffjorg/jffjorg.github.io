T/R:      DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS FOR LEAVE TO FILE
FIRST AMENDED ANSWERS ARE GRANTED.
 
DEFENDANTS TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may allow, in furtherance of
justice, and “upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or
proceeding in other particulars….”  (CCP
§ 473(a)(1).)  A motion to amend a
pleading before trial must be accompanied by a separate declaration that
specifies (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary
and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.  (CRC Rule 3.1324(b).)
It is not an abuse of discretion of the court
to grant the motion unless there is a “showing that actual unfairness or
obvious prejudice has resulted from the allowance of such an amendment”.  (Posz v. Burchell (1962) 209
Cal.App.2d 324, 334.)  “Counsel on the
firing line in an actual trial must be prepared for surprises, including
requests for amendments of pleading.”  (Ibid.)  Absent a showing of prejudice, delay alone is
insufficient grounds for denial.  (See
Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d 558, 564–65.)
Defendants Darryl Wong, 3344 Rowena
Avenue LLC, and Emily Aspland move for leave to file first amended answers to
add the affirmative defense of failure to join indispensable parties.
Defendants assert they recently learned that Plaintiff’s parents also are owners
of the real property at issue in this action, making them indispensable parties.
Plaintiff does not oppose these motions. The Court finds that amendment is in
the interest of justice.
 
Defendants’ motions for leave to amend
are GRANTED.
