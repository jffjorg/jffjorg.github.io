And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses to discovery requests. Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and special interrogatories are denied. Defendant's motions to compel further responses to requests for admissions and form interrogatories are granted.

The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to show good cause for the discovery requests that seek information about Sgt. Joel Flores' training and the physical address where the cell phone data is stored. These requests are deemed overbroad and unduly burdensome.

Defendant's motions to compel further responses to RFAs and FIs are granted because the discovery requests at issue seek basic information that is relevant to Defendant's defenses against Plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff has provided no reason why she should not be made to provide identifying information and information about her employment history and claim for lost income.

The Court declines to award sanctions against Plaintiff, given the confusion over the motion deadlines. The parties are cautioned to have clearer communication regarding motion deadlines in the future.
