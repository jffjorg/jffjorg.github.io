[1] The court also notes that the December 13, 2022
minute order is unsigned.  To the extent
that the court must issue a signed order awarding costs to Plaintiff in order
to meet the requirements of a money judgment, the court will include such an
order in this ruling.  (Hyundai Motor America v. Superior Court (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 418, 422, 426 [unsigned
minute order awarding attorney’s fees and costs could not serve as judgment of
dismissal and could not be viewed as a final judgment to which post-judgment
interest began to run].)
