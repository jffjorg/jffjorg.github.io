  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to enforce order of
  december 13, 2022 and/or for an order to show cause re: contempt
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Emilio Reyes            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Lorraine Ann Escobar
Motion to Enforce Order of December 13, 2022 and/or for an Order to
Show Cause re: Contempt
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants plaintiff Emilio Reyes’s requests for judicial
notice.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Emilio Reyes (“Plaintiff”) moves
the court for an order (1) enforcing the court’s December 13, 2022 order, or,
in the alternative, setting an Order to Show Cause re: why defendant Lorraine
Ann Escobar (“Defendant”) should not be held in contempt pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure sections 128, 1209, and 1212, and (2) imposing monetary
sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,500, payable to the court,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5.
“Every court shall have the power to do all
of the following: [¶¶] (4) To compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and
process, and to the orders of a judge out of court, in an action or proceeding
pending therein.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 128, subd. (a)(4).)  The court
also has the power “to impose reasonable monetary sanctions, not to exceed
fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500), notwithstanding any other provision of law,
payable to the court, for any violation of a lawful court order by a person,
done without good cause or substantial justification.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 177.5.)
On June 4, 2021, the court issued an order
granting Defendant’s special motion to strike each of the six causes of action
alleged in Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint. 
(June 4, 2021 Order, p. 2.) 
Thereafter, on August 12, 2022, the Court of Appeal (1) reversed the
court’s order granting Defendant’s special motion to strike, and (2) ordered
that Plaintiff is entitled to recover costs incurred in connection with the
appeal of Defendant’s motion.  (Aug. 12,
2022 Order, pp. 2, 33.)  The Court of
Appeal issued its remittitur on October 21, 2022.  Within 40 days after issuance of the
remittitur, on October 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed and served his Memorandum of
Costs on Appeal, claiming $582.59 in costs from Defendant.  (APP-013 filed Oct. 24, 2022, p. 1; Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 8.278, subd. (c)(1).) 
Defendant did not file a motion to tax or strike costs within 15 days
after service of the cost memorandum. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rules 8.278, subd. (c)(2), 3.1700, subd.
(b)(1).)  On December 13, 2022, the court
issued a minute order (1) stating that the parties conferred regarding the
Court of Appeal’s remittitur, (2) stating that the court informed Plaintiff to
file his memorandum of costs, (3) stating that Plaintiff informed the court
that he filed his memorandum of costs on October 24, 2022, and (4) awarding,
upon review of the document, “costs to Plaintiff Emilio Reyes against Defendant
Lorraine Ann Escobar in the amount of $582.59.” 
(Dec. 13, 2022 Minute Order, p. 2.) 
            First,
the court notes that it appears that Plaintiff has a money judgment against
Defendant in the amount of $582.29.  As
set forth above, the Court of Appeal awarded costs to Plaintiff as to his
appeal of Defendant’s special motion to strike, and Plaintiff thereafter timely
filed with the court and served on Defendant his cost memorandum.  Thus, it appears that the December 13, 2022
order awarding costs to Plaintiff in the amount of $582.29 constitutes a money
judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant.[1]  (Cal. Rules
of Ct., rule 8.278, subd. (c)(3) [“An award of costs is enforceable as a money
judgment”]; Rostack Investments, Inc. v. Sabella (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th
70, 78 [the award of costs on appeal “represents an independent judgment,
enforceable by any available means”] [internal quotations omitted] [emphasis in
original].) Plaintiff’s remedy for nonpayment of those costs, therefore, is to
enforce that money judgment pursuant to the Enforcement of Judgments Law (Code
Civ. Proc., § 680.010 et seq.).  The
court thus denies Plaintiff’s request that the court enforce the December 13,
2022 order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 128, 1209, and
1212.  
            Second,
the court denies Plaintiff’s alternative request that the court set an Order to
Show Cause against Defendant for contempt because (1) contempt proceedings are
considered quasi-criminal due to the potential punishments, including
imprisonment, but (2) the court may not order the imprisonment of a person in a
civil action for debt.  (In re M.R. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 49, 57
[contempt proceedings are considered quasi-criminal]; Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 1218, subd. (a) [court may fine or imprison person guilty of contempt],
501; Cal. Const., art. I, § 10 [“A person may not be imprisoned in a civil
action for debt or tort”].)
            Third,
the court denies Plaintiff’s request to impose sanctions in favor of the court
and against Defendant in the amount of $1,500. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 177.5.) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Emilio
Reyes’s motion to enforce the order of December 13, 2022 and/or for an order to
show cause re: contempt against defendant Lorraine Ann Escobar. 
            Pursuant to (1) the Court of
Appeal’s August 12, 2022 Opinion and October 21, 2022 remittitur, and (2) the
court’s December 13, 2022 minute order, the court orders that defendant
Lorraine Ann Escobar shall pay costs to plaintiff Emilio Reyes as to Reyes’s
appeal of Escobar’s special motion to strike in the total amount of $582.59.
The
court orders plaintiff Emilio Reyes to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
