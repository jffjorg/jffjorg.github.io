And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff Emilio Reyes to enforce a previous court order and/or to show cause why Defendant Lorraine Ann Escobar should not be held in contempt. The judge has denied the motion and instead ordered Defendant to pay costs to Plaintiff in the amount of $582.59. The judge has also denied Plaintiff's request to impose monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,500. The judge has determined that the December 13, 2022 order awarding costs to Plaintiff constitutes a money judgment, and Plaintiff's remedy for nonpayment of those costs is to enforce that judgment. The judge has also determined that the court lacks the power to impose monetary sanctions against Defendant.
