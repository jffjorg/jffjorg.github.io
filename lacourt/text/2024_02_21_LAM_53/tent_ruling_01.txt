DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Reza Safaie and Aaron Trucking, Inc. (“Plaintiffs”) filed
this action against defendants Nicholas Fuentes (“Fuentes”) and Old Earl Scheib
Paint and Body (“Old Earl”) (collectively, “Defendants”) on September 11, 2023.

On November 7, 2023, the clerk entered the defaults of Defendants. 
Now pending before court are two motions filed by Defendants to set
aside the defaults entered against them. 
First, on January 8, 2024, defendant Fuentes filed his motion to set
aside the default entered against him on November 7, 2023.  Second, on February 2, 2024, defendant Old
Earl filed its motion to set aside the default entered against it on November
7, 2023.  In the interest of efficiency,
the court discusses the two pending motions together. 
On February 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a “Notice of Non-Opposition to
Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default, and Plaintiffs’ Request for Court to Set
Aside Entry of Default as to Both Defendants [and] for Plaintiffs to File First
Amended Complaint.”  In that notice,
Plaintiffs state that they “do not oppose the Motion, and request that the
Court set aside the entry of default[s]” entered against Defendants on November
7, 2023.  (Non-Opp., p. 2:12-14.)  Plaintiffs further request that the court
grant them leave to file their First Amended Complaint (1) to cure certain
defects with the pleading, and (2) to add additional allegations and causes of
action against Defendants. 
Because Plaintiffs have expressly agreed to set aside the defaults
entered against Defendants, the court grants Defendants’ motions to set aside their
defaults. 
The court also finds that it is in furtherance of justice to permit
Plaintiffs to amend their Complaint and therefore grants Plaintiffs’ request
for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) 
ORDER
            The court grants defendant Nicholas
Fuentes’s motion to set aside default and/or default judgment. 
            The court orders that the default of
defendant Nicholas Fuentes entered on November 7, 2023 is set aside. 
            The court grants defendant Old Earl
Scheib Paint and Body’s motion to set aside default and/or default judgment. 
            The court orders that the default of
defendant Old Earl Scheib Paint and Body entered on November 7, 2023 is set
aside. 
            The court grants plaintiffs Reza
Safaie and Aaron Trucking, Inc. 15 days leave to file a First Amended
Complaint. 
            The court orders defendants Nicholas
Fuentes and Old Earl Scheib Paint and Body to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  February 21, 2024
