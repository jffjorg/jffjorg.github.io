And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Maurice Leiter in a case against Rust Movie Productions LLC and Seth Kenney. The plaintiff, Serge Svetnoy, is seeking to establish jurisdiction over Kenney, who is a non-resident defendant. Kenney has moved to quash service of summons, arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him. The court has reviewed the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and has found that it lacks either general or specific jurisdiction over Kenney. Although Kenney has had contacts with California, the claims in this case do not arise out of or have a substantial connection to those contacts. Therefore, Kenney's motion to quash is granted.
