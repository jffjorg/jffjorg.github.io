                PLAINTIFF TO
NOTICE.
 
If the parties
wish to submit on the tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers. No opposition has been received.
 
Plaintiff moves for an order granting approval of the proposed
settlement of claims brought pursuant to the Private Attorneys general Act of
2004 (“PAGA”), Cal. Lab Code § 2698, et seq.  Pursuant to the proposed settlement,
Defendants have agreed to pay $73,750.00 total, $3,000.00 of which is allocated
for the representative PAGA claims and the remaining for Plaintiff’s individual
claims. Attorney’s fees and costs are to be deducted from Plaintiff’s
individual settlement funds.
 
The Court previously denied Plaintiff’s motion to approve a PAGA
settlement in which only $750.00 was allocated to PAGA penalties. The Court
found this amount to be too low considering the releases that applied to
aggrieved employees. Plaintiff has increased the amount of PAGA penalties and has
clarified that the aggrieved employees will not release individual claims. The
amended settlement is reasonable.
 
The motion is GRANTED.
