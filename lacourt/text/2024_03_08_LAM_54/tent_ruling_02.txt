day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition and reply.
 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of
his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good
cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the
following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (CCP §
418.10(a)(1).)  “When a motion to quash is properly brought, the
burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.)
A non-resident
defendant may be subject to either general or specific jurisdiction. (See Elkman
v. National States Insurance Co. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314.)  General jurisdiction exists when a defendant
is domiciled in the forum state or his activities there are substantial,
continuous, and systematic. (F. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2005)
130 Cal.App.4th 782, 796.) Specific jurisdiction involves a 3-part test in
California. California courts adopt the same test as the test used by the court
in Boschetto v. Hansing (9th Cir. Cal. 2008) 539 F.3d 1011,1016: (1) The
nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the
forum or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the
privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits
and protections of its laws; (2) the claim must be one which arises out of or
results from the defendant's forum-related activities; and (3) exercise of
jurisdiction must be reasonable.” Panavision International, L.P. v. Toeppen
(9th Cir. 1998) 141 F.3d 1316, 1320 [applying California law].).” (Jewish
Defense Organization, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. of Los Angeles County (Rambam)
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1054.)
 
Specially
Appearing Defendant Seth Kenney moves to quash service of summons on the ground
that the Court does not have personal jurisdiction over him. The incident at
issue occurred in New Mexico. Plaintiff alleges that Kenney supplied firearms and related
props to a New Mexico film set, on which an accidental shooting occurred. Kenney declares that he is a resident
of Arizona and owns a business headquartered in Arizona. Kenney owns a vacation
property in California but represents that he has spent only seven days there
in the last four years. Kenney also rented an apartment for one year in
California after the Rust lawsuits were filed, with the intention of returning
to Arizona after the lease expired. Kenney states that he spent six
non-consecutive months in the apartment.
 
Kenney argues
that there is no general jurisdiction over him because he is a resident of
Arizona, and there is no specific jurisdiction over him because the claims in
this action do not arise from his contacts with California. In opposition,
Plaintiff asserts that Kenney has purposefully availed himself of the benefits
of California by owning property here. Plaintiff argues that his contacts with
California relate to this action because he chose to work on a production that
involved California financing, actors, crew, and
production personnel.
 
The Court lacks either general or specific jurisdiction
over Kenney. Though Kenney has had various contacts with California over the
last several years, the claims in this case do not arise out of, or have a
substantial connection to, those contacts. (See Virtualmagic Asia, Inc.
v. Fil-Cartoons, Inc.
(2002) 99 Cal. App.4th 228, 241.) 
 
Kenney’s motion to quash is GRANTED.
