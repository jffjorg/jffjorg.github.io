Roles:

Significant Statements:
  - "To prove theft, a plaintiff must establish criminal intent on the part of the defendant beyond 'mere proof of nonperformance or actual falsity.'"
  - "The particularity demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered."
  - "Plaintiff fails to show that the pleading can be successfully amended."
  - "Defendants could not know that Borrower had stolen the loan proceeds."
  - "Plaintiff must allege not only that Defendants aided in the Borrower's unspecified concealing, selling, or withholding of the loan proceeds, but also that Defendants had the requisite criminal intent."
