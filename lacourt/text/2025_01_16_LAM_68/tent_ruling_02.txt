SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Alexis Craney-Foster was an employee of defendant
SkyHop Global LLC from January 8, 2021, through September 27, 2022, as an
airport shuttle driver for airport employees. During the course of employment,
Plaintiff alleges defendant Timothy Boykin began a course of sexually
inappropriate comments and touching. On June 5, 2021, Boykin visited her home,
where he non-consensually engaged in sexual intercourse with Plaintiff while
Plaintiff was intoxicated and incapacitated in her home after normal work
hours.
 
Plaintiff complained about the conduct of Boykin, which
led, at least in part to his dismissal. New supervisor defendant Eros Surla
also allegedly engaged in sexually harassing conduct.

Plaintiff again complained, and was promised $50,000 in exchange for the
execution for a settlement agreement. Plaintiff refused. Plaintiff continued to
report the inappropriate conduct of Surla, but was told no relief was
available. Plaintiff was subsequently terminated. 
 
On May 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 17 cause of action
complaint for Disability Discrimination in Violation of the FEHA; Quid
Pro Quo – Sexual Harassment in Violation of the FEHA; Hostile Work Environment
– Sexual Harassment in Violation of the FEHA; Retaliation in Violation of the
FEHA; Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and/or Retaliation in

Assault and Battery; Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations in Violation
of the FEHA; Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process in Violation of the

226; Waiting Time Penalties Pursuant to Labor Code §§ 201 and 203; Failure to
Permit Inspection of Personnel File and Payroll Records in Violation of Labor
Code §§ 226(c), 226(f), 432, and 1198.5; and, Breach of Contract in Violation
of Civil Code Section 1549. On September 5, 2023, the court sustained the
demurrer to the seventeenth cause of action in the complaint with leave to
amend. 
 
On September 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 16 cause of action
first amended complaint for Disability Discrimination in Violation of the FEHA;
Quid Pro Quo – Sexual Harassment in Violation of the FEHA; Hostile Work
Environment – Sexual Harassment in Violation of the FEHA; Retaliation in
Violation of the FEHA; Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and/or

On December 14, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the seventh cause of
action in the first amended complaint, and granted the motion to strike
allegations in regard to the conduct of Boykin without leave to amend.
 
On
January 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint for Disability
Discrimination in Violation of the FEHA; Quid Pro Quo – Sexual Harassment in
Violation of the FEHA; Hostile Work Environment – Sexual Harassment in
Violation of the FEHA; Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA; Failure to Prevent
Discrimination, Harassment, and/or Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA;

fifteenth, and seventeenth causes of action for Failure to Provide Meal Breaks

Breach of Contract in Violation of Civil Code Section 1549, as to individual
defendants Boykin, Surla, Leviett, Murad, and Anderson. The court also granted
the motion to strike the seventeenth cause of action without leave to amend,
and denied the remainder of the motion.
 
On
April 26, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Timothy Boykin. On May 16, 2024, Plaintiff
dismissed Cody Leviett.
 
On
August 7, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff leave to file a third amended
complaint in order to add a seventeenth cause of action for breach of contract.
Plaintiff filed the third amended complaint on August 16, 2024. On September
10, 2024, SkyHop Golobal, LLC answered the third amended complaint. 
 
RULING: Sustained with
Leave to Amend.
Individual
Defendants Eros Surla, Mohammed Murad, and Emily Anderson submit a demurrer to
the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth, causes of action for
Failure to Provide Meal Breaks in Violation of Labor Code § 226.7, Failure to
Provide Rest Breaks in Violation of Labor Code § 226.7, Failure to Provide Meal
Breaks in Violation of Labor Code § 226.7, and Waiting Time Penalties Pursuant
to Labor Code §§ 201 and 203 in the third amended complaint.
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see
also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules,
where the complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently
apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for
uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]
 
Defendants challenge the basis of liability against them as
lacking sufficient factual support to establish a basis of vicarious liability
for the wage and hour violations. Plaintiff in opposition maintains all
individual defendants qualify as managing agents for purposes of liability, and
no legal bar prevents the action. Plaintiff alternatively moves for leave to
amend. Defendants in reply reiterates the lack of factual support regarding
establishing “managing agent” liability against the individuals.
 
The operative section establishing individual liability
states in relevant part: “(a) Any employer or other
person acting on behalf of an employer, who violates, or causes to be violated,
any provision regulating minimum wages or hours and days of work in any order
of the Industrial Welfare Commission, or violates, or causes to be violated, Sections 03, 226, 226.7, 1193.6, 1194, or 2802, may be held liable as the
employer for such violation. (b) For purposes of this section, the term “other
person acting on behalf of an employer” is limited to a natural person who is
an owner, director, officer, or managing agent of the employer, and the term
“managing agent” has the same meaning as in subdivision (b) of Section
3294 of the Civil Code.” (Lab. Code, § 558.1.)
 
Plaintiff cites to paragraphs 25, and 39-41. Paragraph 25
alleges unwelcome physical contact by Surla, and in no way apparently relates
to the wage and hour claims. Paragraphs 39-41, as well as paragraph 42, allege
the factual basis of the labor code violation claims, but otherwise lacks any
facts regarding the basis of the individual defendants’ position to in any way
direct said violations as part of SkyHop Global LLC company policies and
practices. [See Third Amend. Comp., ¶¶ 39-42, 197-235.] See Usher v. White (2021) 64
Cal.App.5th 883, 896-898.) The demurrer is therefore sustained.
 
While Defendants push for no leave to amend, and the court
has sustained demurrers more than twice now, this remains the first
consideration of the subject allegations. The standard for uncertainty favors
leave to amend under these circumstances. The court otherwise finds an
inability to pled sufficient facts after initial consideration at this stage. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (e)(1); Youngman v. Nevada Irr. Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.) The demurrer is therefore
sustained with 30 days leave to amend.
 
Plaintiff may
ONLY address the subject individual defendants and subject causes of action.
Plaintiff may NOT add any new causes of action. (Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) ANY new causes of actions
or additional allegations beyond the scope of the vicarious liability claim will
be subject to a motion to strike. 
 
The court will concurrently
conduct the Case Management Conference.
 
Defendants to provide notice.
