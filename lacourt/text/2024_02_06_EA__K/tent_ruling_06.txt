[1]              The motion was filed (and
mail-served to Patricia, Patricia’s counsel of record, Robert Beauchamp
(“Beauchamp”), and to “VMK Law Group,” Plaintiff’s former counsel) on October
26, 2023 and originally set for hearing on February 6, 2024 in Department O. At
some point between the March 18, 2020 filing of Plaintiff’s “Motion to Enforce
Settlement” and July 21, 2020, Plaintiff appears to have become
self-represented. No substitution appears to have ever been filed; however,
Plaintiff has advised in her declaration accompanying the instant motion that
her “former attorney, Philip Meyer. . . has since been disbarred” Also, no
substitution of counsel was filed reflecting that attorney Gilbert Gutierrez (“Gutierrez”)
is now Plaintiff’s counsel of record. Gutierrez, however, attests in Paragraph
2 of his declaration that Plaintiff retained him in 2022 to assist her in
preparing an estate plan. The court expects the parties to clarify Plaintiff’s
representation at the hearing.
On January 16, 2024, a “Notice Re: Continuance of
Hearing and Order” was filed, wherein the location of the February 6, 2024
hearing was changed to Department K. Notice was given by the court to Beauchamp
and to “Philip Issac Myer” (“Myer”) of Philip Myer, APC; Myer is listed in
prior filings as an attorney at VMK Law Group. On January 25, 2024, Plaintiff
filed (and mail served) a “Notice of Non-Opposition” to Patricia, Beauchamp and
VMK Law Group; said notice lists the February 6, 2024 hearing date and Department
K as the place of hearing.
