```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Guadalupe Payan, to appoint the court clerk or a designee as an elisor to sign a grant deed transferring title to the subject property from Patricia Garrett to the plaintiff. The court is inclined to continue the hearing to March 5, 2024, to provide further clarification on the matter. Specifically, the court is seeking clarification on whether the plaintiff's declaration should have been executed in Spanish and accompanied by an English translation, as the plaintiff's representative, Gutierrez, has represented that the plaintiff only speaks Spanish. The court also notes that the plaintiff's complaint alleges that she did not understand certain documents because they were in English and that she speaks and reads Spanish.
