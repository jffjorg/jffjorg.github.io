Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
The lease, addendum thereto, First Amendment to Lease
and Second Amendment to Lease (Exh. 4c) all identify Defendant as lessee and
Wohl/Claremont Courtyard as lessor. Sajara Garland attests that she is employed
as a property manager by Pacific West Asset Management Corp., “the retained
property manager of Plaintiff in this action.” (Garland Decl., ¶ 1). Plaintiff
identifies itself as the owner of the Premises (Complaint, ¶ 8), alleges that
Wohl/Claremont Courtyard is its predecessor-in-interest and that Wohl/Claremont
Courtyard’s interest in the lease was assigned to Plaintiff in conjunction with
Plaintiff’s purchase of the premises (Id., ¶ 10); however, the court
does not appear to be in possession of any assignment. Plaintiff is requested
to provide the court with a copy of the assignment.
2.                 
Attorney’s fees should be reduced to $1,753.38, as per
Local Rule 3.214 (i.e., $690 + [3% of $35,445.89]). Plaintiff seeks attorney’s
fees based on the $50,469.89 “[d]emand of complaint,” rather than on the
$45,445.89 balance resulting after a $5,024.00 “credit[] acknowledged.”
