2.         The hearing on Defendant Automotive
Credit Corporation’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is CONTINUED to April
4, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. [see below].
Background   
Plaintiffs Katherine Camacho and Victor Venegas (together, “Plaintiffs”) allege as
follows:
On August 7, 2021, entered into a Retail Installment Sales
Contract (“RISC”) with Sus Amigos Auto Center, Inc. (“Sus Amigos”), wherein Sus
Amigos sold Plaintiffs a 2016 Chevy Silverado, VIN #3GCPCRECXGG126689 (“subject
vehicle”). The RISC was subsequently assigned to Automotive Credit Corporation
(“ACC”). Right after purchasing the subject vehicle, Plaintiffs realized that
the subject vehicle’s transmission was defective. Plaintiffs took the subject
vehicle in for repairs and learned they would cost $5,000.00. Sus Amigos
refused to repair the subject vehicle.
On February 14, 2022,
Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Sus Amigos,
ACC, American Contractors Indemnity Insurance Company (“ACIIC”) and Does 1-50
for:
1.                 
Violation
of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (v. Sus Amigos and ACC only)
2.                 
Violation
of Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (v. Sus Amigos only)
3.                 
Claim
Against Dealer Bond (v. ACIIC only)
On September 12, 2022,
Plaintiffs dismissed Sus Amigos, with prejudice. On September 14, 2022,
Plaintiffs dismissed ACIIC, with prejudice.
Trial is set for February
6, 2024.
1.         Relieved as Counsel
Consumer Action Law Group (“Firm”) seeks
to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiffs (“Client”).
The court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398.)
California Rule of Court (“CRC”) Rule
3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion directed to the client (made
on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in
general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure §
284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the
notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and the proposed order on the
client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) a
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court.
Attorney Pauliana N. Lara (“Lara”) represents
that “[t]here is a disagreement over the potential outcome of the case and the
attorneys do not feel that they can can [sic] continue to pursuit [sic] the
matter. However the plaintiffs wish to continue with the litigation.” Lara
advises that she has served the Clients by mail at the Clients’ last known
address with copies of the motion papers served with this declaration and that
she has confirmed, within the past 30 days that the address is current, by
conversation.
The court determines
that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated above have been sufficiently met.
The court, however, notes that Firm’s
proposed order is incomplete, in that it fails to set forth any information in
Paragraphs 2, 3 and 5-9. Firm is to provide the court with a corrected
proposed order completing the aforesaid paragraphs at or before the time of the
hearing. Paragraph 7 should set forth the continued hearing date on ACC’s Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings [see below].
The motion is
granted, effective upon the filing of the
proof of service
showing service of the signed corrected proposed order upon the Clients at
the Clients’ last known address.
The court vacates the
February 6, 2024 trial date.
2.         Judgment on the Pleadings
ACC moves the court,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 438 and the common law, for judgment on
the pleadings.
On January 23, 2024,
the court adopted its posted tentative ruling as the court’s order and
continued the hearing on the above motion to February 6, 2024; the court’s
order read, in relevant part, as follows:
“The court notes
that Plaintiffs’ counsel has a motion to be relieved set for February 6, 2024,
which is the same date set for trial. Plaintiffs’ opposition filed January 9,
2024 requests that the hearing on the instant motion be continued until after
the issue of representation has been determined. The court believes this
request is reasonable under the circumstances.
There have been no
prior trial dates set in the instant action, which was filed on February 14,
2022. The court will vacate the February 6, 2024 trial date. In the event the
motion to be relieved is granted on February 6, 2024, the court will continue
the hearing on the instant motion another 45-60 days in order to enable
Plaintiffs to obtain substitute counsel, if desired.”
Inasmuch as the court has
granted the above motion to be relieved as counsel, the court will continue the
hearing on the instant motion, to April 4, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
