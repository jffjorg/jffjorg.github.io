And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in response to a motion filed by Patricia, the plaintiff, to enforce a settlement. The motion was filed on October 26, 2023, and originally set for hearing on February 6, 2024. However, Patricia appears to have become self-represented at some point between March 18, 2020, and July 21, 2020, without filing a substitution of counsel. The court notes that Patricia's former attorney, Philip Meyer, has been disbarred, and that her current counsel, Gilbert Gutierrez, was retained in 2022 to assist her in preparing an estate plan. The judge expects the parties to clarify Patricia's representation at the hearing. The hearing was previously continued to Department K, and Patricia filed a notice of non-opposition on January 25, 2024. The court will review the parties' representations and make a final ruling at the hearing.
