 Case Number:  KC070151    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  K Background[1]   
Plaintiff Guadalupe Payan (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:
Plaintiff
and her late husband, David M. Payan (“David”), owned the real property located
at 1612 Millet Avenue, El Monte, CA 91733 (“subject property”). David and
Plaintiff transferred title to the subject property into their trust via a
quitclaim deed recorded December 20, 1994. David died on November 17, 1995.
Plaintiff caused to be recorded an Affidavit—Death of Trustee on July 17, 2008.
On April 4, 2008, Plaintiff’s daughter, Patricia Garrett (“Patricia”) and
Patricia’s husband, Benjamin R. Garrett (“Benjamin”), took Plaintiff to an
office to sign a document in English. Plaintiff speaks and reads Spanish.
Plaintiff did not know that the document she signed that day transferred the
subject property from the Trust to Patricia. Patricia has listed the subject
property for sale.
On March 26, 2018,
Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Patricia,
Benjamin and Does 1-10 for:1.                 
Quiet
Title
2.                 
Financial
Elder Abuse
3.                 
Fraud
4.                 
Cancellation
of Written Instrument 
5.                 
Constructive
Trust 
On August 29, 2018,
Plaintiff dismissed Benjamin and Does 1-10, without prejudice.
On October 16, 2019,
Plaintiff and Patricia entered into a “Stipulation Re Settlement.” On September
22, 2020, an “Order on Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, Appoint Court
Clerk to Sign Document on Behalf of Defendant” was entered.

Legal Standard
“Every court shall
have the power to do all of the following: . . . To compel obedience to its
judgments, orders, and process, and to the orders of a judge out of court, in
an action or proceeding pending therein.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd.
(a)(4).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 128, for an order appointing the clerk of court, or the clerk’s
designee, as an elisor for the purpose of signing, on Patricia’s behalf, a
grant deed transferring title to the subject property to Plaintiff.
It appears to the court that Plaintiff’s declaration should
have been executed in Spanish, accompanied by an English translation certified
under oath by a qualified interpreter, based on Gutierrez’s representation that
Plaintiff “is solely Spanish speaking.” (Gutierez Decl., ¶ 3). The court
further notes that Paragraph 6 of Plaintiff’s verified complaint filed March
26, 2018 alleges that Plaintiff did not understand certain documents “because
they were in English” and that “Plaintiff speaks and reads Spanish.” The court
will request clarification in this regard from Gutierrez at the time of the
hearing.
Based on the foregoing, the court is inclined to continue
the hearing to March 5. 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
Gutierrez is instructed to bring the original grant deed
attached as Exhibit “3” to the court at the time of the continued hearing. Gutierrez
is to provide notice.
