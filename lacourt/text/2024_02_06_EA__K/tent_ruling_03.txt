 Case Number:  23PSCV03068    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  K Petitioner Mercury
Insurance Company’s Petition to Compel Underinsured Motorist Arbitration is DENIED
without prejudice. 
Background   
On October 4, 2023, Petitioner Mercury Insurance Company (“Petitioner”) filed (and electronically
served to attorney Hussein H. Saleh of
The Dominguez Firm) a “Petition to Assign Case Number for Purpose of
Compel[l]ing Arbitration and for the Court to Select a Neutral Arbitrator.”
On October 13, 2023, Petitioner filed the instant petition.
A Case Management Conference and an Order to Show Cause Re:
Failure to File Proof of Service are set for March 7, 2024.
Discussion
Petitioner
seeks an order compelling Respondent Maria Vega (“Respondent”) to submit to
arbitration.
The petition is
summarily denied without prejudice. Petitioner’s counsel David Hillier
(“Hillier”) represents that “[P]etitioner’s insurance policy with the relevant
portions highlighted” is attached as Exhibit D to his declaration (Hillier
Decl., ¶ 9); Exhibit 9, however, appears to be an incomplete copy of the
policy, inasmuch as the court is unable to locate the arbitration provision
purportedly contained therein (i.e., as set forth on page 4 of the petition).
Further, it is
unclear whether or not Respondent received service of a copy of the petition
and notice of the hearing in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure § 1290.4[1].
The proof of service accompanying the petition reflects that the petition was
only electronically served on attorney Hussein H. Saleh of The Dominguez Firm.
If Petitioner has, in fact, quoted the entirety of the arbitration policy on
page 4 of the petition correctly, then it would appear to the court that
service of the petition must be made pursuant to subdivision (b)(1), which has
not been done.
