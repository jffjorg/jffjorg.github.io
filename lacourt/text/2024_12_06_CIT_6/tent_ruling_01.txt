  Case Number:  20STCV11677    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Nobia  Joyce v. Shawn M. Millner, et al.  Defendants’ Joint  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Entire Action for Fabricating Evidence and for an  Order Imposing Monetary Sanctions TENTATIVE  RULING The Court DENIES Defendants’ joint motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s  entire action for fabricating evidence and for an order imposing monetary  sanctions.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order. BACKGROUND This is a quiet title action. On March 20, 2020, plaintiff Nobia  Joyce (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Shawn M. Millner, the  Shawn Marie Millner Revocable Trust (collectively, Millner), Laurence Todd  (Todd) (Millner and Todd may be collectively referred to as Defendants), and  Does 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for quiet title, partition,  declaratory relief, and ejectment and damages. On November 29, 2022, Defendants filed a cross-complaint against  Plaintiff, Stephen R. Golden, Stephen R. Golden & Associates, P.C., and  Does 1 through 20. On February 2, 2024, Defendants filed the operative Second  Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) against the same parties, alleging causes of  action for breach of the July 5, 2018 Settlement Agreement, breach of the  covenant of good faith of the July 5, 2018 Settlement Agreement, fraud (No. 1),  breach of the August 2018 Co-signor agreement, breach of the covenant of good  faith breach [sic] of the August 2018 Co-tenant [sic]  agreement, fraud (No. 2), assault, battery, false imprisonment, negligent  infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress,  slander of title, fraud (No. 3), invasion of privacy, unjust enrichment,  comparative indemnity, apportionment of fault, breach of the May 2023  Settlement Agreement, and breach of the covenant of good faith of the May 2023  Settlement Agreement. On August 27, 2024, the Court dismissed cross-defendants  Stephen R. Golden and Stephen R. Golden & Associates, P.C., from the SACC  without prejudice. On August 28, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the First and Second  Causes of Action for quiet title and partition as to Defendant Todd without  prejudice. On October 31, 2024, Defendants jointly moved to dismiss  Plaintiff’s entire action for fabricating evidence. On November 12, 2024,  Plaintiff opposed the motion. On November 21, 2024, Millner replied. LEGAL  STANDARD The court is  authorized, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, to impose the  following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the  discovery process: monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, terminating  sanctions, and contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2023.030, subds. (a)-(e).) A terminating  sanction may be imposed by an order dismissing the action of the party that  brought the action. (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3).)   “The  discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,  starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of  termination. [Citation.]” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009)  174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992 (Doppes); see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and  Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.) If a  lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Doppes, supra, 174  Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not  exceed what is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but  denied discovery.’ [Citation.]” (Id.) “But where a violation is willful,  preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe  sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial  court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Id., quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet  Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280;  Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702, quoting Doppes  and Mileikowsky.)   The court  should consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the  party to determine if the actions were willful, the determent to the  propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain  discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are justified where a  violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and there is evidence  that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery  rules. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Before any  sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there has  been a willful failure of the party to serve the required discovery responses.  (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246  Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations  has the burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo v.  Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy  Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252-253.)  Code of Civil  Procedure section 2023.010, subdivisions (d) and (f), provide that a misuse of  the discovery process includes, but is not limited to, “[f]ailing to respond or  to submit to an authorized method of discovery” and “[m]aking  an evasive response to discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d),  (f).) PRELIMINARY  ISSUES             The Court notes that Millner’s reply is late. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,  subd. (b).) The Court will still consider the reply, but admonishes Millner to  comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going forward. (See  Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subd. (d); Juarez v. Wash Depot Holdings,  Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1197, 1202.) DISCUSSION             Summary of  Arguments Millner moves for terminating sanctions on the grounds that  Plaintiff’s counsel submitted fabricated evidence during the bench trial on  September 11, 2024. Millner contends the changes made to Plaintiff’s deposition  testimony were improper, and that the reading of that testimony into evidence  was done to dispose of a fact harmful to Plaintiff, namely that Plaintiff  testified no agreement existed between her and Millner. Millner contends  Plaintiff’s lawyer violated ethical obligations by having Plaintiff provide  false testimony. Millner further contends Plaintiff’s counsel submitted at  trial a false subpoena duces tecum that was never issued to Plaintiff’s  employer, Parsons Corporation, in an attempt to authenticate banking records  that were never received from Parsons Corporation (Parsons). Millner contends  no one received any documents from Parsons. Millner also contends Plaintiff has  a history of participating in fraudulent schemes aimed at Defendant, such as  Stephen R. Golden suing Defendant on behalf of Plaintiff when he was disbarred.  Millner contends these actions warrant dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint and requests  monetary sanctions in the amount of $500,000.00. In opposition, Plaintiff contends that no evidence was fabricated.  Plaintiff contends that the failure to sign and send deposition corrections to  the court reporter was inadvertent and that those actions have been corrected. Plaintiff  contends the subpoena duces tecum was served on Parsons and that Plaintiff’s counsel  did not submit a false declaration for those records. Plaintiff contends  Parsons received the subpoena and that Parsons stated it complied with the  subpoena by emailing the documents to the Court. Plaintiff then contends the  check registers showing the issuance of checks received from Parsons were  ultimately not needed because copies of the checks issued by Parsons were  admitted into evidence. Plaintiff further contends the lawsuit filed by  disbarred attorney Stephen R. Golden was dismissed years ago and is not  relevant here. Analysis The Court finds Millner’s motion unavailing. The Court does not  find any nefarious intent in making the changes to Plaintiff’s deposition  transcript. The Court read the relevant portion of the deposition transcript  and accepts Plaintiff’s counsel’s statement that Plaintiff became tired and  disengaged toward the end of the deposition and the parties were supposed to  continue the deposition later but failed to do so, thus necessitating the  changes to Plaintiff’s deposition transcript. (Pallack Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) The  Court also accepts Plaintiff’s counsel’s statement that the failure to have  Plaintiff sign the changes to the deposition transcript and serve it on the  court reporter was inadvertent. (Pallack Decl., ¶ 4.) Also, the issue was raised  during the trial and the Court allowed the statement to be read into the record  following Defendant’s belated reading of portions of the deposition transcript  into the record. The Court advised the parties that the Court would give the  evidence the weight it deemed appropriate. The Court did not rely on this  portion of Plaintiff’s evidence in reaching its decision, so the focus on this  piece of evidence is ultimately a moot point. Moreover, Plaintiff presented sufficient evidence showing that  Parsons did in fact receive the subpoena duces tecum and attempted to submit  the requested documents to the Court. (Pallack Decl., Exs. 2, 15.) Furthermore,  Defendants did not present any evidence supporting their claims  that the subpoena was false and none of the  challenged documents were entered into evidence at trial. The Court also agrees with Plaintiff that the prior action filed  by Stephen R. Golden is irrelevant to the issue of whether Plaintiff and her  counsel of record have engaged in conduct warranting terminating sanctions in  this action. The Court finds that there was no willful violation of any  discovery process by Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel. Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the motion. CONCLUSION The Court DENIES Defendants’ joint motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s  entire action for fabricating evidence and for an order imposing monetary  sanctions.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Defendant/Cross-Complainant  Shawn M. Millner-Todd’s Motion for New Trial  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court summarily DENIES Defendant/Cross-Complainant Shawn M.  Millner-Todd’s motion for new trial as premature.                Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a quiet title action. On March 20, 2020, plaintiff Nobia  Joyce (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Shawn M. Millner, the  Shawn Marie Millner Revocable Trust (collectively, Millner), Laurence Todd  (Todd) (Millner and Todd may be collectively referred to as Defendants), and  Does 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for quiet title, partition,  declaratory relief, and ejectment and damages.  On November 29, 2022, Defendants filed a cross-complaint against  Plaintiff, Stephen R. Golden, Stephen R. Golden & Associates, P.C., and  Does 1 through 20. On February 2, 2024, Defendants filed the operative Second  Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) against the same parties, alleging causes of  action for breach of the July 5, 2018 Settlement Agreement, breach of the  covenant of good faith of the July 5, 2018 Settlement Agreement, fraud (No. 1),  breach of the August 2018 Co-signor agreement, breach of the covenant of good  faith breach [sic] of the August 2018 Co-tenant [sic]  agreement, fraud (No. 2), assault, battery, false imprisonment, negligent  infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress,  slander of title, fraud (No. 3), invasion of privacy, unjust enrichment,  comparative indemnity, apportionment of fault, breach of the May 2023  Settlement Agreement, and breach of the covenant of good faith of the May 2023  Settlement Agreement. On August 27, 2024, the Court dismissed cross-defendants  Stephen R. Golden and Stephen R. Golden & Associates, P.C., from the SACC  without prejudice.  On August 28, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the First and Second  Causes of Action for quiet title and partition as to Defendant Todd without  prejudice.  On October 4, 2024, Millner gave notice of intent to move for a  new trial. On October 7, 2024, the Court entered an interlocutory judgment in  favor of Plaintiff and against Millner on the First and Second Causes of Action  for quiet title and partition. On October 14, 2024, Millner moved for a new  trial. On October 24, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the motion. On November 4, 2024,  Millner replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD  The verdict may be vacated and any other decision may  be modified or vacated, in whole or in part, and a new or further trial granted  on all or part of the issues, on the application of the party aggrieved, for  any of the following causes, materially affecting the substantial rights of  such party: 1. Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury  or adverse party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which  either party was prevented from having a fair trial. 2. Misconduct of the jury; and whenever any one or  more of the jurors have been induced to assent to any general or special  verdict, or to a finding on any question submitted to them by the court, by a  resort to the determination of chance, such misconduct may be proved by the  affidavit of any one of the jurors. 3. Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence  could not have guarded against. 4. Newly discovered evidence, material for the party  making the application, which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have  discovered and produced at the trial. 5. Excessive or inadequate damages. 6. Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the  verdict or other decision, or the verdict or other decision is against law. 7. Error in law, occurring at the trial and excepted  to by the party making the application.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657.)  REQUESTS FOR  JUDICIAL NOTICE              The Court GRANTS Millner’s request  for judicial notice filed on November 14, 2024, but only as to Exhibit A. (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214  Cal.App.4th 780, 803 [court may take judicial notice of recorded deed].) But, the Court  takes judicial notice only as to the existence, content, and authenticity of  such documents; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of the factual  matters asserted therein. (Dominguez v. Bonta  (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.) The Court also admonishes Millner for not  providing these documents with the moving papers. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1300, subd. (a).) The Court DENIES the request for judicial notice filed on  November 21, 2024, as there are no documents attached to it.  DISCUSSION A notice of intention to move for new trial served  and filed before the decision has been rendered is premature and void, and the  court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion. (Ruiz v. Ruiz (1980)  104 Cal.App.3d 374, 379 (Ruiz.) When some issues are to be tried by the  court and others by the jury, a decision is not complete for purposes of a  motion for new trial until all issues in the case have been determined. (Cobb  v. University of So. California (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1140, 1143-1144 (Cobb).)  If a statement of decision has been waived or has not been requested, there is  no decision for purposes of a motion for new trial until the court signs and  files the judgment. (Marriage of Hafferkamp (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 789,  793 (Hafferkamp).)  Millner’s notice of intention to move for new trial  is premature. First, not all of the issues in this case have been determined.  The non-jury trial held on September 9, 10, and 11, 2024, only determined  Plaintiff’s quiet title and partition claims. (Minute Order (9/20/24).) A jury  trial on the remaining causes of action is currently scheduled for September 2,  2025. Thus, there is no decision for purposes of a motion for new trial from  which Millner can seek a new trial at this point in time. (Cobb, supra, 45  Cal.App.4th at pp. 1143-1144.)  Second, even if there were no remaining causes of  action to be adjudicated, Millner’s motion would still be premature because  neither of the parties requested a statement of decision and the Court did not  sign and enter the interlocutory judgment until October 7, 2024. (Hafferkamp,  supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at p. 793; Judgment (10/7/24).) Millner filed and  served the notice of intention to move for new trial on October 4, 2024, i.e., three  days before entry of the interlocutory judgment. (Notice of Intention to Move  for New Trial (10/4/24).) The Court’s September 20, 2024 minute order does not constitute  a decision for purposes of a motion for new trial either. (See Hafferkamp, supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at p. 793 [unsigned  minute order did not constitute a decision for purposes of a motion for new  trial].)  Accordingly, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider  the motion for new trial. (Ruiz, supra, 104  Cal.App.3d at p. 379.) The Court therefore summarily DENIES the motion as  premature.  However, even if the Court had jurisdiction to consider the  motion, the Court finds Millner’s arguments unavailing. First, it is not  entirely clear upon which grounds Millner is actually moving for a new trial.  While the notice of intent to move for new trial cites six of the seven grounds  available in Code of Civil Procedure section 657, nowhere in Millner’s  memorandum of points and authorities does she cite the specific statutory  grounds upon which her arguments are based. From what the Court can infer,  Millner’s arguments are based on either irregularity in the proceedings or  insufficiency of the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subds. (1), (6).)  Second, the Court does not find that the arguments regarding the  changes to the deposition transcript sufficient to support the granting of a  new trial. The Court did not give any weight to the portion of Plaintiff’s deposition  transcript read into the record or the purported corrections to the transcript  in rendering its decision.  Third, the Court did not need that evidence to support its  decision. Millner admitted under oath in open court in a prior case that  Plaintiff made the $29,000 downpayment for the subject property, and that the  parties agreed Plaintiff could live there as long as it was owned. (Plaintiff’s  Trial Exhibits, Ex. 1, 58:15-59:12.) Plaintiff also testified and introduced  documentary evidence that she made several improvements to the subject property  and paid several utility bills. The Court found that Millner was not credible  as she had no reasonable explanation in denying her prior admission and she  also denied that Plaintiff paid any money for improvements or utilities at the  subject property. This evidence is sufficient to support the Court’s decision  and satisfy the clear and convincing evidence standard to rebut the presumption  of Evidence Code section 662. (See Evid. Code, § 662.) Additionally, Plaintiff  testified as to where the funds came from to make the down payment, and properly  laid the foundation for the withdrawal checks from her retirement fund for them  to be admitted into evidence. (Bowman Decl., pp. 236-243 of pdf.)  Fourth, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that Chase  Bank and The City of Azusa Development Agency are not indispensable parties. “A  person is an indispensable party to litigation if his or her rights must  necessarily be affected by the judgment. [Citation.]” (Washington Mut. Bank v. Blechman (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th  662, 667, internal quotation marks omitted.) Owners of property are  indispensable parties. (See Ranch at the Falls LLC v.  O'Neal (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 155, 173.) Adding Plaintiff to the  title of the subject property does not affect Chase Bank’s or The City of Azusa  Development Agency’s interest as lienholders in the subject property since a  lien merely provides them the right to foreclose on the property should the  borrower, i.e., Millner, fail to repay the loans secured by their respective  deeds of trust. (All. Mortg. Co. v. Rothwell (1995)  10 Cal.4th 1226, 1236.) The Court also agrees with Plaintiff that Millner’s  reference to “other potential individuals” as indispensable parties is  unavailing given its vagueness and lack of evidentiary support. (See Motion,  17:2-4.)  Fifth and finally, Millner’s arguments regarding the  settlement from LASC Case Number KC067782 are also unavailing. The settlement  agreement in that case states that Plaintiff agreed to dismiss that action  without prejudice. (Plaintiff’s Trial Exhibits, Ex. 11.) “A dismissal ‘without  prejudice’ necessarily means without prejudice to the filing of a new action on  the same allegations, so long as it is done within the period of the  appropriate statute of limitations. [Citations.]” (Eaton Hydraulics Inc. v. Cont'l  Cas. Co. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 966, 974.) The court in LASC Case  Number KC067782 denied Millner’s and Todd’s motion to enforce settlement  agreement precisely because the parties had agreed only to dismiss the claims  without prejudice. (Plaintiff’s Trial Exhibits, Ex. 11.) Thus, the fact that  the parties may have entered into a settlement agreement in the prior action  did not prevent Plaintiff from asserting these claims again in this action  because that settlement agreement only provided for dismissal without prejudice.  (Plaintiff’s Trial Exhibits, Ex. 11; Eaton Hydraulics Inc., supra, 132  Cal.App.4th at p. 974.)  Based on the foregoing, the Court would DENY the motion for new  trial on substantive grounds.  CONCLUSION  The Court summarily DENIES Defendant/Cross-Complainant Shawn M.  Millner-Todd’s motion for new trial as premature.                Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
