And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer to the amended complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The Judge agrees with the defendants that the first cause of action, alleging breach of contract, is uncertain and fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The Judge also agrees that the second cause of action, alleging stolen property, is unclear and fails to allege facts sufficient to support a claim for conversion. The Judge also agrees that the third cause of action, alleging malicious sabotage, is unclear and fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The Judge grants the defendants' request for judicial notice of a previous judgment and return on attachment/execution. The Judge orders the defendants to amend their demurrer and the plaintiff to re-file the complaint.
