Plaintiff Faustino
Pacheco Morales and Defendants
Ravit and Sharon Ohana entered into an agreement whereby Plaintiff was to transport
dirt from one of Defendants’ properties to another. Plaintiff submitted
invoices for payments; however, Defendants have failed to pay. 
 
On August 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendants asserting causes of action for breach of contract, common counts,
and quantum meruit.  
 
Request for entry of default was entered February 14, 2023. The
court then denied Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment. 
 
On April 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint. Request for entry of default was again entered June 12, 2023 for
Ravit Ohana and June 15, 2023 for Sharon Ohana. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:  GRANT BUT IN REDUCED AMOUNT
 
Plaintiff again fails to provide
the basis for attorney fees. Plaintiff cites CCP §1021, which refers to
attorney fees based on statute or contract. However, there are no attorney fees
referenced in the invoice. Additionally, unsigned invoices are not deemed
contracts. (C9 Ventures v. SVC-West, L.P. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1483, 1501.) Plaintiff claims CCP §1032 provides a basis for attorney fees.
However, that generally says the prevailing attorney fee is entitled to costs.
Plaintiff has not shown that the attorney fees sought here are qualified as
costs. The court denies the request for attorney fees.  
 
Plaintiff provides interest
calculations totaling $28,034.50 (CCP §585 Declaration ¶9). However, the
interest sought on the JUD-100 and CIV-100 Forms total $31,234.50.  None of the calculations are accurate.  The court has recalculated the interest to be
$21,111 on the first failed payment; $5180 on the second missed payment; and
$844.40 on the final missed payment.  The
total interest owed is $27,135.40 .  If
plaintiff’s counsel agrees, the court will enter judgment in the total amount
of $99,380.40.
