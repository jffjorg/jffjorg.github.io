And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' motion for trial preference and preliminary injunction. The motion for trial preference is denied unless the plaintiff can provide additional evidence, specifically the plaintiff's age and an affidavit regarding the plaintiff's medical diagnosis. The judge notes that the provisions of Section 36 are mandatory, and the motion will be granted once the plaintiff submits the required evidence. The motion for preliminary injunction is denied because the plaintiffs have not set forth a reasonable probability that they will prevail on the merits, and the defendants have presented evidence that they lawfully removed and disposed of all abandoned property after giving the plaintiffs proper notice.
