BACKGROUND
 
This action arises out of a landlord-tenant dispute as between Plaintiffs/Tenants
Robin La Due and Sabine La Due (“Plaintiffs” or “La Dues”) and Defendant/Landlord
Shahe Boyadjian (“Defendant”). Sabine La Due is Robin La Due’s elderly mother.
Plaintiffs have sued Boyadjian for alleged issues that arose out of their
tenancy. 
 
The parties have a history of litigation between them that began
prior to Plaintiffs filing the instant action. In January 2022, Boyadjian filed
a small claims action against Robin La Due to recover unpaid rent. Judgment was
ultimately entered in favor of Boyadjian, against La Due. (Request for Judicial
Notice, Exhibit “A”.) On June 21, 2022, Boyadjian filed an unlawful detainer
action against Robin La Due stemming from his longstanding unjustified failure
to pay rent at the subject property, in direct violation of the lease
agreement. That matter was also fully litigated and resulted in another
judgment in favor of Boyadjian, against La Due. (Request for Judicial Notice,
Exhibit “B”.) Following those two actions by Boyadjian, the La Dues
subsequently brought the instant civil action on August 15, 2022
 
On November 16, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed a first amended
complaint. On January 13, 2023, they filed a second amended complaint. A third
amended complaint was filed August 17, 2023.

ANALYSIS 
 
I.                   
 PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION
FOR TRIAL PREFERENCE
 
Plaintiffs move this court for an order granting a
trial preference pursuant to California Rules of Court 3.1335 and Code of Civil
Procedure section 36(a). Plaintiff moved ex parte and the court denied
the motion. (See October 2, 2023 Minute Order.) 
 
Pursuant¿to Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a), a
party to a civil action who is over the age of 70 must be given preference if
the party has a substantial interest in the¿action¿as a whole, and¿the health
of the party is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the
party’s interest in the litigation.¿ To make the findings required by Section 36(a),
evidence must be provided with the motion for preference establishing
Plaintiff’s age and the relevant conditions of her health warranting a
preference.¿ Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure¿section 36.5, an attorney
affidavit¿offered in support of a motion for preference may be based
on¿“information and belief as to the medical diagnosis and prognosis of a
party.”¿¿¿ 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 36(e), in
its discretion, the court may grant a motion for preference that is supported
by a showing that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be
served by granting preference.¿¿¿If a motion for preference based on a party’s
age is granted, the matter must be set for trial not more than 120 days from
the date the motion is granted.¿ (CCP §36(f).)¿¿ 
 
“The trial court has no power to balance the differing
interests of opposing litigants in applying¿[CCP¿§ 36]. The express legislative
mandate for trial preference is a substantive public policy concern which
supersedes such considerations.”¿ (Swaithes¿v. Superior Court¿(1989) 212
Cal.App.3d 1082, 1085-86.¿¿See¿also¿Vinokur¿v. Superior Court¿(1988)
198 Cal.App.3d 500, 503 (“[T]here can be no inroads into the mandate of section
36.”)¿¿¿ 
 
The ex parte motion is not supported by any
evidence of Plaintiff Sabine’s age or an affidavit regarding Plaintiff Sabine’s
dementia diagnosis. The provisions of Section 36 are mandatory. The motion will
be granted once Plaintiff Sabine submits evidence of her age and an affidavit
regarding Plaintiff Sabine’s medical diagnosis. The court will require the
additional evidence at the hearing to support Plaintiff’s request.
 
II.                 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
 
Plaintiff applies for a preliminary injunction to
enjoin Defendants from selling or giving way property which belongs to the
Plaintiff.[1]
 
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve
the status quo pending a decision on the merits.  (Major v. Miraverde
Homeowners Ass’n. (1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 618, 623.)  In deciding
whether or not to grant a preliminary injunction, the court looks to two
factors, including “(1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the
merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms that is likely to result from the
granting or denial of interim injunctive relief.”  (White v. Davis
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 553-54.) The factors are interrelated, with a greater
showing on one permitting a lesser showing on the other.  (Dodge,
Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th
1414, 1420.)  However, the party seeking an injunction must demonstrate at
least a reasonable probability of success on the merits.  (IT Corp. v.
County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 73-74.)  The party seeking the
injunction bears the burden of demonstrating both a likelihood of success on
the merits and the occurrence of irreparable harm.  (Savage v. Trammell
Crow Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571.) Irreparable harm may exist if
the plaintiff can show an inadequate remedy at law.  (CCP §
526(a).)   
 
The court finds Plaintiffs have not set forth
reasonable probability that they will prevail on the merits as Plaintiffs fail
to present evidence that their belongings are still actually there. As noted
above, a preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of potential
entitlement to relief. (Doe v. Wilson (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 304.) Moreover,
Defendants present declarations, under oath, that they lawfully removed and
disposed of all abandoned property after giving Plaintiffs proper notice.
(Shahe Boyadjian Decl. ¶¶6-11; Maral Boyadjian Decl. ¶¶6-11.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, the court denies Plaintiffs’
motion for preliminary injunction.
