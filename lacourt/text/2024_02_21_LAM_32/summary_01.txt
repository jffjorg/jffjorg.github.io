And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses and the motion for protective order in the employment discrimination action brought by Kristina Turpin against Learning with a Difference, Inc. The judge has granted in part Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses, ordering Defendant to provide further responses to certain discovery requests. The judge has denied Defendant's motion for protective order, finding that the majority of the discovery requests implicated in the motion have already been addressed in the ruling. The judge has also ordered that document production shall be subject to a protective order.

The judge has found that the information sought by Plaintiff is directly relevant to the issues in the case, including whether Defendant treated Plaintiff differently than similarly situated employees and whether Defendant replaced Plaintiff with someone who was not disabled. The judge has also found that the discovery requests are not unduly burdensome and that Defendant must make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information sought.

The judge has denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the parties acted with substantial justification.
