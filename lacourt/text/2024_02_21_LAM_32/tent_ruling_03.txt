BACKGROUND
            On December 3, 2021, Plaintiffs Gregory
Kingston, Paul Kingston, Gail Kingston, and Victoria Kingston-Allen filed this
action against Defendants The Estate of Robert Blaisch, The Estate of Kenneth
Eldon, and State Farm Insurance Company. The operative First Amended Complaint,
filed July 25, 2022, alleges (1) personal injury and property damage, (2)
breach of contract, (3) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, and (4) bad faith denial of insurance coverage. 
            Plaintiffs owned a duplex in Los
Angeles, in which Robert Blaisch and Kenneth Eldon were tenants. The duplex
burned down in a fire due to the alleged negligence of Blaisch and Eldon, who
perished in the fire. Plaintiffs bring the first cause of action for personal
and property damage against the estates of Blaisch and Eldon. Plaintiffs bring
the second through fourth causes of action against State Farm for denying insurance
coverage after the fire. State Farm was subsequently dismissed on summary
judgment. 
            On December 22, 2023, Defendant
Estate of Kenneth Eldon filed the instant eight motions to compel Plaintiffs to
respond to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production. Plaintiffs have
not filed any opposition. Initially, four of the motions were scheduled for February
21, 2024, and the other four were scheduled for February 23, 2024. Because the
motions are substantively identical, all of the motions are advanced to February
21, 2024. This ruling concerns all eight motions. 
LEGAL STANDARD
            Discovery responses are due 30 days
after service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a responding
party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)
DISCUSSION
            The subject discovery was served on July
31, 2023, making the response deadline September 5, 2023. (Hawkins Decl. ¶ 4.) However,
Defendant granted an extension to September 20, 2023. (Id., ¶ 6.) After Plaintiffs
missed the September 20, 2023 deadline, Defendant granted a second extension to
October 11, 2023 on the condition that Plaintiffs provide verified responses
without objection. (Id., ¶¶ 8-10.) After Plaintiffs missed the October
11, 2023 deadline, Defendant offered yet another extension to October 27, 2023.
(Id., ¶¶ 11-13.) Plaintiffs did not provide responses by October 27,
2023 and have not provided any responses to date. (Id., ¶¶ 14, 16.) 
            The record indicates that Plaintiffs
were duly served with discovery and failed to respond within the deadline
imposed by statute or the voluntary extensions granted by Defendant. Thus, a
court order is needed to compel the responses. No substantial justification has
been provided for Plaintiffs’ failure to respond to discovery. As such, monetary
sanctions are warranted. 
Defense counsel’s hourly rate is $205.
(Hawkins Decl. ¶ 18.) Given the overlapping nature of the motions, their
simplicity, and the lack of opposition, the reasonable number of hours for all
motions collectively is 5 hours. Defendant also paid $480 in filing fees. (Id.,
¶ 23.) Therefore, sanctions are awarded in the total amount of $1,505.  
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Estate of Kenneth Eldon’s
motions to compel are GRANTED. Plaintiffs shall produce verified responses to
the subject discovery within 15 days of this order. Objections are waived except
as to privacy and privilege. The Court sanctions Plaintiffs and their counsel
in the total amount of $1,505, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
