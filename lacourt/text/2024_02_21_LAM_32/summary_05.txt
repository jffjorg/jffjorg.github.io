And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a Pitchess motion filed by the defendant, City of Azusa, to disclose personnel records of plaintiff Bertha Parra from the Riverside County District Attorney's Office. The defendant is seeking information about Parra's prior employment at the Azusa Police Department, including her reasons for leaving and any allegations of harassment or discrimination. The judge finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the disclosure of this information, as it is relevant to Parra's claims of intolerable working conditions and constructive termination. The judge grants the Pitchess motion to the extent of information regarding Parra's prior employment and salary. The court will conduct an in-camera hearing to review the pertinent documents and disclose only the relevant information.
