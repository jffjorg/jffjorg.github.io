```

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendants' motion for summary judgment or adjudication is DENIED. The Judge finds that there are triable issues of fact pertaining to Plaintiff's prima facie case and Defendants' proffered reason, which precludes summary adjudication on the discrimination claim. Additionally, the Judge finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the harassment and retaliation claims. The Judge also notes that Plaintiff has sufficiently raised triable issues as to his prima facie case, and that a reasonable trier of fact may find the incidents of harassment to be race-related and sufficiently pervasive to constitute harassment.
