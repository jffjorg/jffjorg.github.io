```

Summary: The judge granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that they had been in possession of the premises for more than one year, which is a defense under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 1172. The judge also found that the defendant's possession of the property, standing alone, is sufficient to invoke the CCP § 1172 defense. The plaintiff failed to establish a triable issue of material fact and did not present any evidence disputing that the defendants had been in possession of the property for more than one year.
