And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the plaintiffs' motion to compel the defendant, University of Southern California (USC), to provide further responses to their third set of form interrogatories. USC's responses were found to be evasive and incomplete, and the court orders USC to provide code-compliant responses within 20 days.

The court also grants the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions against USC in the amount of $2,460.00. This amount represents the reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs as a result of USC's failure to comply with discovery requests. The sanctions are to be paid to the plaintiffs' counsel within 20 days of the date of this order.

The court finds that USC's failure to comply with discovery requests was without substantial justification and that the imposition of sanctions is warranted.
