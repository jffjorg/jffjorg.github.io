DISCUSSION 
 
CRC Rule 9.40(d)
provides that an application to be admitted pro hac vice must state the
following: (1) applicant attorney’s residence and office addresses; (2) the
courts to which the applicant attorney has been admitted and dates of
admission; (3) a representation that the attorney applicant is a member in good
standing in the courts of admission and is not currently suspended or disbarred
in any court; (4) the title of each court and action in which the applicant
attorney has appeared pro hac vice in this State in the preceding two years, if
any; and (5) the name, address, and telephone number of the active California
State Bar member who is counsel of record in the local action. (CRC Rule
9.40(d).) 
 
C.R.C., Rule 9.40(e) provides as follows, “[a]n applicant for
permission to appear as counsel pro hac vice under this rule must pay a
reasonable fee not exceeding $50 to the State Bar of California with the copy
of the application and the notice of hearing that is served on the State Bar.” 
 
Plaintiff’s applications on behalf of Steven L.
Caponi and Falco A. Muscante II provide the information required by
C.R.C., Rule 9.40(d).  The declarations supplied sufficient information to satisfy the
requirements. (Glassman Decl., ¶¶ 1-7; Caponi Decl., ¶¶ 1-9; Muscante Decl., ¶¶
1-8.)  Plaintiff submitted proof that the $50.00 fees
were paid to the State Bar of California.  (C.R.C., Rule 9.40(e).) Plaintiff
also submitted proofs of service on the State Bar of California.  (C.R.C.,
Rule 9.40(c)(1).) Plaintiff’s applications
satisfy rule 9.40. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
unopposed motions for an order admitting Steven L.
Caponi and Falco A. Muscante II to appear pro hac vice is GRANTED. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 

Plaintiff’s Pro Hac Vice Application of Steven L.
Caponi is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff’s Pro Hac Vice Application of Falco A.
Muscante II is GRANTED.
