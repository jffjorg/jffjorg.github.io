Here, Plaintiff
submitted the declaration of Sarin Mgrdigian, the property
manager for the subject real property located at 6200 Hollywood Blvd. #3621 Los
Angeles, CA 90028.  (Mgrdigian Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
Mgrdigian
provides a statement of the case, stating that on or about
November 10, 2022, Defendants entered into a written agreement to rent the premises
for $3320.00 per month due and payable on the first day of each month. (Mgrdigian Decl., ¶ 4.) Thereafter,
Defendants breached the Lease by failing to pay rent when due. (Mgrdigian Decl., ¶ 5.) On August 10, 2023, Defendants were served
with a written three day notice to pay rent or quit (hereafter, the
"Notice"). The Notice demanded past due rent in the amount of
$3320.00 for the rental period beginning on August 1, 2023 and ending on August
31, 2023. (Mgrdigian Decl., ¶ 6.) Defendants
failed to pay any rent within three days after service of the Notice. No money
has been received or accepted since service of the Notice. (Mgrdigian Decl., ¶ 7.) Defendants
vacated the premises on December 29, 2023. (Mgrdigian
Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff attached the lease, the
Notice and the Move Out Statement. (Mgrdigian Decl.,
Exs. 1-3.)
 
However,
Plaintiff does not provide any basis for how the costs or attorneys fees were
calculated. In her declaration, Mgrdigian states “Paragraph 31
of the Lease entitles plaintiff to recover reasonable attorney fees, and
reasonable attorneys fees for plaintiff's attorneys are $884.66” and “Court
costs in this case, including the filing fee, are $659.00.” (Mgrdigian Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.)
The Court does not find that these statements provide sufficient support as to
Plaintiff’s request for attorneys fees or costs. 
 
Since
Plaintiff has not sufficiently complied with all the requirements, Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment is DENIED.
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is DENIED.
