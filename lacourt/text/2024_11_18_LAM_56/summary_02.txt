Summary:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which seeks to correct the name of the perpetrator in her original complaint. The plaintiff alleges childhood sexual abuse by Mark Henry Brendt, but has now discovered that the perpetrator was actually Gerald Shaia. The defendant argues that the relation-back doctrine does not apply and that the proposed second amended complaint is untimely. The court finds that the relation-back doctrine does not apply because the new claim involving Gerald Shaia as the perpetrator is a completely different set of facts from the original claim, and that the proposed second amended complaint is untimely because it was filed more than two years after the alleged abuse. The court also finds that the defendant would be prejudiced by the filing of the proposed second amended complaint, which would require the defendant to investigate and defend against a new claim.
