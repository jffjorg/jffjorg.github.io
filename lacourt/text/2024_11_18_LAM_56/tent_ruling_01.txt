BACKGROUND
This
is an action arising from a lease and option to purchase agreement between Defendant
and Plaintiffs Richard and Paige Galvan (jointly, “Plaintiffs”).  On June 9, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a complaint
against Defendant, alleging causes of action for (1) Violation of California
Civil Code § 1942.4; (2) Tortious Breach of the Warranty of Habitability; (3)
Private Nuisance; (4) Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq; (5)
Negligence; (6) Breach of Covenant of quiet Enjoyment; (7) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (8) Fraud and Deceit; (9) Negligence Per Se;
and (10) Violation of Retaliatory Eviction and Anti-Harassment Ordinance. 
 
On
October 23, 2023, Defendant filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiffs alleging
causes of action for (1) Breach of Written Agreement; (2) Negligent Destruction
of Property; and (3) Intentional Destruction of Property. 
             
            On or about August 5, 2024,
Defendant filed motions for terminating sanctions against each of the two plaintiffs,
with requests for monetary sanctions, and a motion to continue trial.  All the motions are unopposed.
 
DISCUSSION
Terminating Sanctions
            Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have
discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010(g); 2030.290(c); 2031.300(c). Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030(d), the court may impose a terminating sanction by
one of the following orders:
 
(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any
party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
(2) An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for
discovery is obeyed.
(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party.
(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.
 
“Dismissal is a proper sanction to punish the
failure to comply with a rule or an order only if the court's authority cannot
be vindicated through the imposition of a less severe alternative.” (Rail Services of America v. State Comp. Ins.
Fund (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 323, 331. See
also Mileikowsky v. Tenet
Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-80 [“A decision to order
terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.”]; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 496 [“The power to impose discovery sanctions is a
broad discretion subject to reversal only for arbitrary, capricious, or
whimsical action.  Only two facts are
absolutely prerequisite to imposition of the sanction: (1) there must be a
failure to comply ... and (2) the failure must be willful.”].) “Discovery
sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that
which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.” (Vallbona v. Springer (1996)
43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545) “A discovery sanction may not place the party
seeking discovery in a better position than it would have been in if the
desired discovery had been provided and had been favorable.”  (Rail
Services, supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at 332.)
 
Here, Defendant had
previously made motions to compel Plaintiffs’ deposition in this matter.  On April 2, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s
motions to compel Plaintiffs’ depositions| and imposed sanctions against both
Plaintiffs and their counsel.  (Declaration of Marshall C. Sanders [“Sanders
Decl.”].)  The sanctions have yet to be
paid as of the date of filing the present motions.  (Id.)  After the April 2, 2024 Order, and on May 7,
2024, Defendant’s counsel sent an e-mail to Plaintiffs’ counsel requesting
dates for his client to be deposed, but he did not receive any response.  (Id.)  On June 27, 2024, Defendant’s counsel sent a
Notice of Deposition to Plaintiffs’ counsel setting the deposition.  (Id.) No objections were made
in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure §2025.410 but rather an untimely request
from Plaintiffs’ counsel that the deposition be done virtually, a condition to
which Defendant’s counsel did not agree. 
(Id.)  On
July 18, 2024, the date of the duly noticed deposition, again, Plaintiffs did
not appear.  (Id.)
 
Accordingly, there is sufficient evidence before the
Court to establish Defendant’s willful failure to comply with the Court’s April
2, 2024 Order as well as its obligations under the Discovery Act.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010 [“Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following . . . (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. . . . (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.”].)  
 
Plaintiffs failed to oppose the instant motions for
terminating sanctions and has “show[n] no interest in taking part in the case
or in following orders of the court.”  (Del
Junco v. Hufnagel (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 789, 799–800.)  Imposition of a lesser sanction against Plaintiffs
would permit them to “benefit from their stalling tactics.”  (Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Adm'rs,
Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1106 [“LcL persisted in its
pattern of failure or refusal to give meaningful responses to discovery. The
trial court was not required to allow LcL to continue its stalling
tactics indefinitely.”].)  The Court thus
finds that terminating sanctions are warranted under the circumstances.  The
Court, however, shall not impose additional monetary sanctions considering the
imposition of terminating sanctions.  
 
RULING 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motions for Terminating Sanctions against Plaintiffs are GRANTED in
part, and the matter is terminated.  Defendant is to prepare a form of Proposed
Judgment and lodge and serve the same within twenty (20) days of the date of
this order. 
 
In light of this ruling, Defendant’s
Motion to Continue Trial is MOOT.
 
 Moving party is ordered
to give notice of this ruling.           
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
