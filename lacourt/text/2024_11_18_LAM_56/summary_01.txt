Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the motions for terminating sanctions filed by the defendant against the two plaintiffs, Richard Galvan and Paige Galvan. The defendant had previously made motions to compel the plaintiffs' depositions, but they failed to comply with the court's orders. The plaintiffs also failed to pay the sanctions imposed against them. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the court's orders was willful and that imposing terminating sanctions is warranted. The court grants the defendant's motions for terminating sanctions and terminates the matter. The defendant is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment and lodge and serve it within 20 days. The motion to continue trial is moot.
