  vs.
 
INTERLACED SOCIAL LLC, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  24STCV19026 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 3, 2024



 
 
Defendant’s
special motion to strike is GRANTED.
 
On 7/30/2024,
in properia persona Plaintiff Aladdin Dinaali filed suit against
Interlaced Social, LLC, Augustin Pulido, and Kenneth Barlow. On 9/3/2024,
Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC), alleging unfair business
practices. 
 
Now,
Defendant Interlaced Social, LLC moves to specially strike Plaintiff’s FAC. 
 
The motion is
unopposed. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
On a
special motion to strike pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section
425.16, also known as an anti-SLAPP motion, moving parties have the initial
burden to demonstrate that a cause of action is subject to a special motion to
strike. (Martinez v. Metabolife Inter.
Ins. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 181, 186; Fox
Searchlight Pictures Inc. v. Paladino (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 294, 304.)
First, the court must determine whether moving parties have
made a prima facie showing that the attacked claims arise from a
protected activity, including defendants’ right of petition, or free speech,
under a constitution, in connection with issues of public interest. (Healy
v. Tuscany Hills Landscape & Recreation Corp., (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th
1, 5; Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006)
39 Cal.4th 260, 278; Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(e).) Moving parties can satisfy this burden by showing (1) statements made
before legislative, executive or judicial proceedings, or made in
connection with matters being considered in such proceedings, or (2) statements
made in a public forum, or other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the
constitutional rights of petition or free speech, in connection with issues of
public interest. (Code Civ. Proc.,­ § 425.16, subd. (e); Equilon Ent.,
LLC v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 66.) 
 
If the
court finds this showing has been made, it must dismiss the cause of action
unless the plaintiff meets its burden to demonstrate a probability of
prevailing on the claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(b)(1); Balzaga v.
Fox News Network, LLC (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1325, 1336.)
This means that the plaintiff must state a legally sufficient claim and
must then present evidence that substantiates or sustains the claim. (Equilon Enterprises
v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 61; see also Wilson
v. Parker, Covert & Chidester (2002)
28 Cal.4th 811, 821 [plaintiff “must demonstrate that the complaint is both
legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts
to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited”].) 
 
Factual Background 
 
          This
action stems from the termination of Plaintiff’s account on Interlaced Social’s
dating website. Plaintiff now has seven pending lawsuits in California and
Nevada. This specific action concerns Defendant’s litigation practices in two
of these actions, the Cochran Action and the Kim Action.  
 
Discussion  
 
          Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s single cause of action is subject to anti-SLAPP
because: (1) it arises out of statements, writings and pleadings in connection
with civil litigation and thus constitutes protected activity; and (2)
Plaintiff cannot show a probability of prevailing on the merits because the
conduct is protected by the litigation privilege. 
 
          After
review, the Court agrees. 
 
          As
for the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis, Plaintiff’s claim concerns
Defendants litigation positions related to service and motion practice in
earlier actions. For example, Plaintiff’s FAC alleges:
 
-       
Plaintiff cannot effectuate service on
Interlaced Social unless she initially serves the summons its agent for service
of process (First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 83, 90);
 
-       
Plaintiff cannot serve Pulido, an
individual, through Interlaced Social’s agent for service of process (id. ¶¶
91, 94);
 
-       
Pulido’s declarations explaining
Interlaced Social’s practice of permitting its customer service staff to use of
the “Kenneth Barlow” to protect them from harassing customers, like Plaintiff
(id. ¶¶ 83, 85, 86);
 
-       
Pulido’s declarations explaining
Interlaced Social’s decision to terminate Plaintiff’s account in January 2024
and the factual basis for Interlaced Social’s legal position regarding service
(id. ¶ 85); and
 
-       
Defendants’ counsel prior agreement to
accept service on behalf of Pulido in the Cochran and Kim Actions, and Pulido’
voluntary appearance in this case, but Plaintiff’s decision not to authorize
his counsel to accept service in a few other cases in the face of Plaintiff’s
harassment and vexatious conduct (id. ¶¶ 94-100)
 
These
allegations clearly arise out of communications made in connection with an
issue under consideration or review by a judicial body, and thus constitute
protected activity. (CCP § 425.16(e)).
 
Accordingly,
the Court turns to the second prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis. To prevail at
prong two, the plaintiff “must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally
sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to
sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited.” (Wilson v. Parker, Covert & Chidester (2002) 28 Cal. 4th
811, 821.) The plaintiff must also overcome any substantive defenses that
exist, including a defense of privilege. (Rohde v. Wolf (2007) 154 Cal.
App. 4th 28, 38.) 
 
California’s
litigation privilege (Civil Code § 47(b)(2)) applies to any communication (i)
made in judicial proceedings; (ii) by litigants or other participants
authorized by law; (iii) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (iv)
that has some connection or logical relation to the action. (Silberg v.
Anderson (1990) 50 Cal. 3d 205, 212.) 
 
“The
principal purpose of [the litigation privilege] is to afford litigants and
witnesses the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being
harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.” (Silberg, supra,
50 Cal. 3d at p. 213.) Thus, “communications with ‘some relation’ to judicial
proceedings” are “absolutely immune” from liability under the litigation
privilege. (Rubin v. Green (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1187, 1193.  “This includes prelitigation communications
involving the subject matter of the ultimate litigation.” (Sylmar Air
Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Servs., Inc. (2004) 122 Cal. App. 4th
1049, 1058.) 
 
Here, the
basis of Plaintiff’s only cause of action are based on Defendants’ litigation-related
communications and filings, particularly Defendants’motion to quash service and
Pulido’s declaration filed in the Cochran and Kim Actions. As communications
with a relation to judicial proceedings, they are absolutely protected by the
litigation privilege.
 
The Court
takes Plaintiff’s non-opposition to be a concession to Defendant’s motion on
the merits. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s special motion to strike is granted. Defendant is
entitled to subsequently seek attorney fees and costs incurred in connection
with this motion.  
 
 
It is so ordered.
