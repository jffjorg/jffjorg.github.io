Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's special motion to strike the plaintiff's claims as unopposed. The defendant, Interlaced Social LLC, filed a motion to strike the plaintiff's first amended complaint (FAC) alleging unfair business practices. The plaintiff, Aladdin Dinaali, filed a lawsuit against Interlaced Social LLC, Augustin Pulido, and Kenneth Barlow. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims arise from protected activity, specifically statements, writings, and pleadings made in connection with civil litigation. The court agrees with the defendant, finding that the plaintiff's claims are subject to the anti-SLAPP motion. The court also finds that the plaintiff cannot show a probability of prevailing on the merits because the conduct is protected by the litigation privilege. As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion to strike and orders that the defendant is entitled to seek attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with this motion.
