Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending the completion of arbitration. The Plaintiff, Sharon Davidson, filed a representative action against Defendant, DG Premium Brands, LLC, alleging civil penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). The Defendant moved to compel the Plaintiff to arbitrate her Complaint, and the Judge has determined that the arbitration agreement exists and is enforceable.

The Judge found that the Defendant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that an arbitration agreement exists, and that the Plaintiff's claims are covered by that agreement. The Plaintiff argued that the arbitration agreement is procedurally and substantively unconscionable, but the Judge found that the agreement is enforceable.

The Judge noted that the arbitration agreement requires individual arbitration and prohibits class or representative actions, which is permissible under California law. The Judge also found that the agreement does not limit the ability to recover attorney fees or any type of relief otherwise available in court.
