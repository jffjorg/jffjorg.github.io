And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's Custodian of Records, Cathleen Pugh, attested that the claim was assigned to the Plaintiff, but failed to provide a copy of the assignment. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's attorney, Jennifer Thomas, submitted a purported assignment with a missing Exhibit A, and that the Plaintiff's subsequent submission, a "Declaration by Plaintiff in Support of Default Judgment", made reference to Evidence Code ยง 1271, but did not provide sufficient authentication of the attached "Confirmation of Assignment of Loan". The Judge has set an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment for June 4, 2024.
