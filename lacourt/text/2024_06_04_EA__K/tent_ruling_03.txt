1.         Motion to
Compel Furthers Re: Request for Admission (i.e., as to FCA)
Legal Standard
“[T]he
party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response
if that party deems that . . . (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive
or incomplete [and/or that] (2) An objection to a particular request is without
merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a).)
The moving party
must demonstrate a “reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal
resolution of each issue presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2033.290,
subd. (b)(1).) “In lieu of a separate statement required under the
California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b)(2).)
Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or any specific later date to
which the requesting party and the responding party have agreed in writing . .
.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).) The responding party has the
burden of justifying the objections to the requests. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the
court for an order compelling FCA to provide further, verified Code-compliant
responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Admissions, Set No One (i.e., Nos. 3-4, 20-21
and 24-26) within 10 days from the date of the hearing on this motion.
Plaintiffs’ counsel
Michael Saeedian (“Saeedian”) represents as follows:
On
November 22, 2023, the subject discovery was served. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 5, Exh.
1.) On February 26, 2024, FCA served its unverified responses. (Id., ¶
6, Exh. 2). On April 17, 2024, FCA served its verifications. (Id., ¶ 7).
On March 12, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel Adina Ostoia (“Ostoia”) sent a meet and
confer letter to FCA’s counsel Erin E. Hanson (“Hanson”), requesting
supplemental responses within 10 days from the date of the letter. (Id.,
¶ 8, Exh. 3.) During an April 15, 2024 Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) it
was agreed that FCA “would supplement Request for Admission and complete
document production by April 19, 2024;” to date (i.e., as of April 26, 2024),
however, FCA has not provided any such responses. (Id., ¶¶ 9 and 10). 
Again, the requests
in issue are Nos. 3-4, 20-21 and 24-26.
Request No. 3 asks
FCA to admit that the subject vehicle is a “consumer good” under Civil Code §
1791(a). Request No. 4 asks FCA to admit that Plaintiff is a “buyer” under
Civil Code § 1791(b). Requests Nos. 24-26 asks FCA to admit that it does not
possess any specific facts reflecting that the problems Plaintiff encountered
with respect to the subject vehicle were caused by misuse, abuse or lack of
maintenance, respectively.
The court has
reviewed FCA’s responses thereto. FCA, by failing to oppose the motion, has not
met its burden of justifying its objections to the requests. With that said,
the court determines that FCA’s substantive response is compliant with Code of
Civil Procedure § 2033.220,
subdivision (c) (i.e., “[i]f a responding party
gives lack of information or knowledge as a reason for a failure to admit all
or part of a request for admission, that party shall state in the answer that a
reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been
made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to
enable that party to admit the matter”). No further responses are warranted.
Request No. 20 asks
FCA to admit that it tracks the number of its vehicles repurchased or replaced
in California. Request No. 21 asks FCA to admit that it trains its employees to
request additional opportunities to repair a vehicle after a repurchase has
been requested by a customer.
The court has reviewed FCA’s response
thereto, which is comprised entirely of objections. Again, FCA has not met its
burden of justifying its objections to the requests. A further response, then,
is warranted.
The motion is
granted in part (i.e., as to Request Nos. 20-21) and otherwise denied (i.e., as
to Requests Nos. 3-4 and 24-26). FCA is to provide a further, Code-compliant
response to Request No. 20 within 20 days from the date of the notice of
ruling.
2.         Motion
to Compel Furthers Re: Form Interrogatory (i.e., as to FCA)
Legal Standard
“[T]he propounding party may move for
an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that . .
. (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete[,] (2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate[,
and/or that] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
The moving
party must demonstrate a “reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal
resolution of each issue presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1).) “In lieu of a separate statement required under the California
Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a concise
outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(2).)
Notice of the motion must be provided “within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (c).) The responding party has the burden of justifying the
objections to the requests. (Coy, supra, 58 Cal.2d at 220-221.)
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction. . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the court for an order compelling FCA to
provide further, verified Code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’ Form
Interrogatories, Set No One (i.e., Nos. 1.1, 12.1, 15.1 and 17.1) within 10
days from the date of the hearing on this motion.
See synopsis of Motion #1. Saeedian represents in his
declaration accompanying the instant motion that it was agreed during the April
15, 2024 IDC that FCA “would supplement Form Interrogatory 12.1 and complete
document production by April 19, 2024,” but that no supplemental responses have
been provided as of the April 26, 2024 motion filing date. (Id., ¶¶ 9
and 10).
Again, the interrogatories at issue are Nos. 1.1, 12.1, 15.1
and 17.1. The court has reviewed FCA’s responses thereto. FCA, by failing to
oppose the motion, has not met its burden of justifying its objections to the
requests. A further response to Interrogatory No. 1.1 is warranted, because the
substantive response provided fails to identify any person(s) who prepared or
assisted in the preparation of the responses. FCA explicitly stated that it has
“no percipient knowledge of the identity of these individuals” (i.e.,
previously defined as “service managers and other dealership personnel who may
have been involved in the repair of Plaintiffs vehicle from Envision”). As to Interrogatory
No. 12.1, FCA has not responded to each subpart. A further response to Interrogatory
No. 12.1 is warranted.
The court believes a further response to Interrogatory No.
15.1, which addresses subparts (a)-(c) for each denial of a material allegation
and each special of affirmative defense in its answer, and a further response
to Interrogatory No. 17.1, which addresses subparts (a)-(d) for each response
that is not an unqualified admission, is also warranted.
The motion is granted. FCA is to provide further,
Code-compliant responses to Interrogatories Nos. 1.1, 12.1, 15.1 and 17.1
within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.
3.         Motion to
Compel Furthers Re: Special Interrogatory (i.e., as to FCA)
Legal Standard
See Motion #2.
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the court for an order compelling FCA to
provide further, verified Code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’ Special
Interrogatories, Set No One (i.e., Nos. 1-10, 12-18, 27, 34, 39-41, 43 and 44)
within 10 days from the date of the hearing on this motion.
See synopsis of Motion #1. Saeedian represents in his
declaration accompanying the instant motion that it was agreed during the April
15, 2024 IDC that FCA “would supplement Request for Admission and complete
document production by April 19, 2024,” and FCA “has not provided any
supplemental responses to the identified SI” as of the motion filing date. (Id.,
¶¶ 9 and 10).
Again, the interrogatories in issue are Nos. 1-10, 12-18,
27, 34, 39-41, 43 and 44.
Interrogatory No. 1 asks for the terms of coverage, time and
mile limitations and exclusions of each of FCA’s written warranties for the
subject vehicle. Interrogatory No. 2 asks FCA to identify each inspection it
conducted of the subject vehicle from the date it left the factory to the
present. Interrogatory No. 3 asks for all contacts FCA had with any employees
of any dealership or any repair facility regarding the subject vehicle.
Interrogatory No. 4 asks for the average cost to FCA of a repurchase of a vehicle of the same year, make,
and model as the subject vehicle it manufactured in the State of California.
Interrogatory No. 5 asks FCA to state the conditions per
vehicles sold (C/1000) for vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the
subject vehicle. Interrogatories Nos. 6 and 7 ask FCA to list each database,
system, or software used to store, query, or analyze [actual or anticipated
failure or replacement rates]/[condition, issue, problem, or defect occurrence
rates], respectively. Interrogatory No. 8 asks FCA to state the number of 2022
Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles it manufactured which were repurchased in the last five
years in the state of California. Interrogatory No. 9 asks FCA to identify the
number of vehicle repurchases and replacements that it has made in California
in response to consumers’ personal requests (i.e. a request directly from the
consumer) from 2017 to present. Interrogatory No. 10 asks FCA to state its
definition of “reasonable number of repairs” when it considers repurchasing a
vehicle in the state of California.
Interrogatory No. 12 asks FCA if it provided training,
policies, procedures, or guidance to its authorized dealerships regarding the
sale of 2022 Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles. Interrogatories No. 13-15 ask FCA to
identify all training, policies, procedures, or guidance that it provided its
authorized dealerships regarding the [sale or lease]/[service]/[repair] of 2022
Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles, respectively.
Interrogatory No. 16 asks FCA to identify its policies and
procedures for determining eligibility for a vehicle replacement or repurchase
in California prior to a customer demand. Interrogatory No. 17 asks FCA to
identify its representative(s) most knowledgeable regarding its handling of
Plaintiff’s request(s) for a refund of the purchase price of the subject
vehicle. Interrogatory No. 18 asks for the content of all policies FCA had in
effect from 2017 to the present under which a consumer in California could
obtain a refund of the purchase price or a replacement of a motor vehicle it
manufactured or distributed.
Interrogatory No. 27 asks FCA to list each date (not just
the date the subject vehicle was dropped off) the subject vehicle was at its
authorized repair facilities for warranty repairs. Interrogatory No. 34 asks
FCA to identify all contacts it had with any employees of any dealership or any
repair facility regarding any request to repurchase or replace the subject
vehicle. Interrogatory No. 39 asks FCA if it is FAC’s contention that it or its
authorized repair facilities were not given a reasonable number of attempts to
repair the subject vehicle, to state facts that support YOUR contention. Interrogatory
No. 40 asks FCA to identify the person it employed that it most knowledgeable
of the facts supporting the contention set forth in Interrogatory No. 39. Interrogatory
No. 41 asks for documents supporting the contention set forth in Interrogatory
No. 39.
Interrogatories Nos. 43 and 44 ask FCA to identify [all
persons it employed]/[all persons not employed by it] who supplied information
utilized in answering these interrogatories, respectively.
The court has reviewed FCA’s responses thereto. FCA provided
objection-only responses to Interrogatories Nos. 4-10, 12-16 and 39-41. FCA, by
failing to oppose the motion, has not met its burden of justifying its
objections to the requests; as such, further responses are warranted as to
these interrogatories.
FCA’s responses to Interrogatory Nos. 1, 27 and 34, however,
are sufficient and comply with Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.230. Its
responses to Interrogatories No. 2 and 18 are likewise adequately responsive.
No further responses need be made.
A further response to Interrogatory No. 3 is warranted,
inasmuch as FCA’s substantive response does not respond to the interrogatory. A
further response to No. 17 is warranted, as FCA has failed to identify any
representative.
Further responses to Interrogatories Nos. 43 and 44 are
warranted, because the substantive responses provided fail to identify any
person(s) who prepared or assisted in the preparation of the responses.
The motion is granted in part (i.e.,
as to Interrogatories Nos. 3-10, 12-17, 39-41, 43 and 44) and otherwise denied
(i.e., as to Interrogatories No. 1, 2, 18, 27 and 34). FCA is to provide
further, Code-compliant responses to Interrogatories Nos. 3-10, 12-17, 39-41,
43 and 44 within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.

4.         Motion to
Compel Furthers Re: Requests for Production (i.e., as to FCA)
Legal Standard
“[T]he
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that. . . (1) A statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete[,] (2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive [and/or that] (3) An objection in the
response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a).)
The moving party must demonstrate a
“reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal resolution of each issue
presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “In lieu of
a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).)
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for
inspection or production of documents must “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) If the moving party has shown good cause for the
production of documents, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the
objections. (Kirkland v. Superior Court
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) 
Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.310, subd. (c).)
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction. . . against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (h).)
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the court for an order compelling FCA to
provide further, verified Code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for
Production of Documents, Set No One (i.e., Nos. 18-46, 49-51, 59, 61, 63, 67,
68, 73 and 75-78) within 10 days from the date of the hearing on this motion.
See synopsis of Motion #1. Saeedian represents in his
declaration accompanying the instant motion that it was agreed during the April
15, 2024 IDC that FCA “would supplement Request for Production and complete
document production by April 19, 2024” and that FCA “has not provided any
supplemental responses to the identified RFP” as of the motion filing date. (Id.,
¶¶ 9 and 10).
Again, the requests in issue are Requests Nos. 18-46, 49-51,
59, 61, 63, 67, 68, 73 and 75-78. Request No. 18 seeks FCA’s warranty claims
policy and procedure manual(s) from 2017 to the present. Request No. 19 seeks
documents evidencing FCA’s policies and procedures since 2017 concerning the
issuance of refunds or provision of replacement vehicles to buyers in the State

documents evidencing procedures it used for the handling of complaints by
consumers regarding vehicles it manufactured or distributed. Request No. 21
seeks documents evidencing the policies, procedures, and/or instructions which
FCA’s employees and authorized agents should follow after it has made a
decision to authorize either a refund of the purchase price, or a replacement
vehicle, to its customer.
Request No. 22 seeks documents evidencing policies,
procedures, and/or instructions since 2017 that FCA’s employees and agents
should follow when evaluating a customer request for their money back or a
replacement of a motor vehicle it manufactured or distributed. Request No. 23
seeks documents evidencing FCA’s training materials related to its policy
regarding how to calculate a repurchase. Request No. 24 seeks documents
evidencing FCA’s policies, procedures, or guidelines for determining whether a
vehicle is eligible for a vehicle repurchase.
Request No. 25 seeks documents evidencing FCA’s training
material related to its policy to encourage customers to give it another
opportunity to repair their vehicles. Request No. 26 seeks documents evidencing
FCA’s policy defining what constitutes a repair to determine eligibility for
repurchase or replacement in California. Request No. 27 seeks documents FCA
issued which evidence policies, procedures and/or instructions since 2017 which
its authorized repair facilities should follow regarding customer requests for
a refund of the price paid for a vehicle or a replacement vehicle.
Requests Nos. 28 and 29 seek documents evidencing FCA’s [Lemon
Law Escalation Process]/[call center escalation process], respectively. Request
No. 30 seeks documents evidencing any predictive model used to determine if one
of Defendant’s vehicles is a candidate for escalation. Request No. 31 seeks
documents any consultant provided FCA from 2017 to present that are related in
any way to Song Beverly. Request No. 32 seeks documents evidencing any
policies, procedures, or guidelines provided by FCA to any agency regarding
what constitutes a substantial nonconformity under Song Beverly from 2017 to
present. Request No. 33 seeks documents evidencing statistics for the number of
repurchases and replacements FCA has made in California in response to
consumers’ personal requests (i.e. a consumer request without an attorney) from
2017 to present.
Requests Nos. 34, 37, 40 and 43 seek documents evidencing
complaints by owners of 2022 Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles regarding [Infotainment
System]/[Speaker System]/[Air Conditioning System]/[Emergency Braking System]
concerns evidenced by the repair orders for the subject vehicle, respectively. Requests
Nos. 35, 38, 41 and 44 seek surveys, reports and summaries in which owners of
2022 Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles had complaints regarding [Infotainment
System]/[Speaker System]/[Air Conditioning System]/[Emergency Braking System]
concerns evidenced by the repair orders for the subject vehicle, respectively. Requests
Nos. 36, 39, 42 and 45 seek documents evidencing vehicle repurchases made by
FCA of 2022 Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles and allegedly containing conditions,
defects, or nonconformity regarding [Infotainment System]/[Speaker System]/[Air
Conditioning System]/[Emergency Braking System]  concerns evidenced by the repair orders for
the subject vehicle, respectively. Request NO. 46 seeks documents evidencing
the numbers of owners 2022 Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles who have complained of any
of the conditions, defects, or nonconformity for which Plaintiff presented the
subject vehicle to FCA or its authorized repair facility for repair.
Request No. 49 seeks documents which
discuss above-average repair rates to 2022 Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles. Request No. 50 seeks documents which describe sales

1500 vehicles.
Request No. 61 seeks a computer printout or similar summary

certification. Request No. 73 seeks documents relating to the Customer Call
Center, including but not limited to, all flow charts, processes, and/or

to efforts by FCA to reduce the number of [repeat repair attempts for a
customer]/[reacquired vehicles], respectively. Request No. 78 seeks documents
related to repeat repair procedures for remedying customer concerns.
The court has reviewed FCA’s responses thereto. FCA provided
objection-only responses to Requests Nos. 18-46, 49-51, 59, 63, 67, 68, 73 and
75-78. FCA, by failing to oppose the motion, has not met its burden of
justifying its objections to the requests; as such, further responses are
warranted as to these requests.
FCA’s substantive response to Request No. 61, however,
sufficiently complies with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.220. No further
response is warranted.
The motion is granted in part (i.e., as to Requests Nos.
18-46, 49-51, 59, 63, 67, 68, 73 and 75-78) and otherwise denied (i.e., as to Request
No. 61). FCA is to provide further, Code-compliant responses to Requests Nos.
18-46, 49-51, 59, 63, 67, 68, 73 and 75-78 within 20 days from the date of the
notice of ruling.
5.         Motion to
Compel Furthers Re: Request for Admission (i.e., as to Envision)
Legal Standard
See Motion #1.
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the court for an order compelling Envision
to provide further, verified Code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’ Request
for Admissions, Set No One (i.e., Nos. 3, 4, 7 and 17) within 10 days from the
date of the hearing on this motion.
Saeedian represents as follows: On November 30, 2023, the
subject discovery was served. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. 1.) On February 26,
2024, FCA served its unverified responses. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. 2). On March
11, 2024, Ostoia sent a meet and confer letter to Envision’s counsel Hanson,
requesting supplemental responses within 10 days from the date of the letter. (Id.,
¶ 7, Exh. 3.) During an April 15, 2024 Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) it
was agreed that Envision would supplement the RFAs in question by April 19, 2024;
however, FCA has not provided any such responses, as of the April 26, 2024
filing date of the motion. (Id., ¶¶ 8 and 9.
Again, the requests in issue are Nos. 3, 4, 7 and 17.
Request No. 3 asks Envision to admit that the subject
vehicle is a “consumer good” under Civil Code § 1791(a). Request No. 4 asks
Envision to admit that Plaintiff is a “buyer” under Civil Code § 1791(b).
Request No. 7 asks Envision to admit that FCA uses a pre-determined rate
schedule to pay Envision for repair work. Request No. 17 asks Envision to admit
that FCA provides FCA factory training to Envision’s dealership employees.
The court has reviewed Envision’s responses thereto.
Envision, by failing to oppose the motion, has not met its burden of justifying
its objections to the requests. However, the court determines that Envision’s
substantive responses are compliant with Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.220, subdivision (c).
The motion is denied.
6.         Motion
to Compel Furthers Re: Form Interrogatory (i.e., as to Envision)
Legal Standard
See Motion #2.
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the court for an order compelling Envision
to provide further, verified Code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’ Form
Interrogatories, Set No One (i.e., Nos. 1.1, 12.1, 15.1, 17.1 and 50.1) within
10 days from the date of the hearing on this motion.
See synopsis of Motion #5. Saeedian represents in his
declaration accompanying the instant motion that it was agreed during the April
15, 2024 IDC that Envision “would supplement Form Interrogatory 12.1 and
complete document production by April 19, 2024,” but that no supplemental
responses have been provided as of the April 26, 2024 motion filing date. (Id.,
¶¶ 8 and 9).
Again, the interrogatories in issue are Nos. 1.1, 12.1, 15.1,
17.1 and 50.1. The court has reviewed Envision’s responses thereto. Envision,
by failing to oppose the motion, has not met its burden of justifying its
objections to the interrogatories. A further response to Interrogatory
No. 1.1 is warranted, because the substantive response provided fails to
identify any person(s) who prepared or assisted in the preparation of the
responses. As to Interrogatory No. 12.1, Envision stated that it “identifies
its dealership personnel who may have been involved in the sale of the Subject
Vehicle” and that “[p]ursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230, [it]
refers to the Sales files that have been produced, which should reference the
names of the individuals involved,” which the court believes is responsive;
however, Envision has not responded to each subpart. A further response to
Interrogatory No. 12.1 is warranted. The court believes a further response to
Interrogatory No. 15.1, which addresses subparts (a)-(c) for each denial of a
material allegation and each special of affirmative defense in its answer, and
a further response to Interrogatory No. 17.1, which addresses subparts (a)-(d)
for each response that is not an unqualified admission, is also warranted.
Envision has likewise failed to respond to each subpart of Interrogatory No.
50.1; as such, a further response is warranted.
The motion is granted. Envision is to provide further,
Code-compliant responses to Interrogatories Nos. 1.1, 12.1, 15.1, 17.1 and 50.1
within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.
7.         Motion
to Compel Furthers Re: Special Interrogatory (i.e., as to Envision)
Legal Standard
See Motion #2.
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the court for an order compelling Envision
to provide further, verified Code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’ Special
Interrogatories, Set No One (i.e., Nos. 1, 8-10, 12, 27, 28, 31, 34 and 35)
within 10 days from the date of the hearing on this motion.
See synopsis of Motion #1. Saeedian represents in his
declaration accompanying the instant motion that it was agreed during the April
15, 2024 IDC that FCA “would supplement Special Interrogatory No. 12.1 and
complete document production by April 19, 2024,” and FCA “has not provided any
supplemental responses to the identified SI” as of the motion filing date. (Id.,
¶¶ 8 and 9).
Again, the interrogatories in issue are Nos. 1, 8-10, 12,
27, 28, 31, 34 and 35. Interrogatory No. 1 asks for the terms of coverage, time
and mile limitations and exclusions of each of Envision’s written warranties
for the subject vehicle. Interrogatory No. 8 asks Envision for the names, dates
and contact information of each FCA non-attorney employee it contacted in
regard to reported defects in the subject vehicle. Interrogatory No. 9 asks
Envision to identify all Technical Service Bulletins (“TSBs”) by reference
number and date that relate in any way to any of the reported defects made to
it by Plaintiffs. Interrogatory No. 10 asks Envision to state FCA’s policy for
Envision to determine what a reasonable number of repair attempts is.
Interrogatory No. 12 asks Envision to state FCA’s policies
and procedures for Envision in regard to employee training. Interrogatory No.
27 asks Envision to identify its policies and procedures for contacting clients
about the diagnosis and repair of FCA vehicles. Interrogatory No. 28 asks
Envision to identify its policies and procedures for customer complaints made
to it about the repair history of their vehicle. Interrogatory
No. 31 asks Envision to identify all FCA policies and procedures for
Envision that describe what a reasonable number of attempts to repair a vehicle
is. Interrogatory No. 34 asks Envision to identify all FCA policies and
procedures for Envision that describe what a substantial impairment to use,
value, and safety of a customer vehicle is. Interrogatory No. 35 asks Envision
to identify all FCA policies and procedures for Envision in regard to reporting
to FCA the amount of time a customer vehicle is at the dealership for warranty
repairs.
The court has reviewed Envision’s responses thereto. Envision
provided objection-only responses to Interrogatories Nos. 10, 12, 27, 28, 31,
34 and 35. Envision, by failing to oppose the motion, has not met its burden of
justifying its objections to the requests; as such, further responses are
warranted as to these interrogatories.
Envision’s responses to Interrogatory Nos. 1, 8 and 9,
however, are sufficient and comply with Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.230. No
further responses need be made.
The motion is granted in part (i.e., as to Interrogatories
Nos. 10, 12, 27, 28, 31, 34 and 35) and otherwise denied (i.e., as to
Interrogatories No. 1, 8 and 9). Envision is to provide further, Code-compliant
responses to Interrogatories Nos. 10, 12, 27, 28, 31, 34 and 35 within 20 days
from the date of the notice of ruling.
8.         Motion

Legal Standard
See Motion #4.
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the court for an order compelling Envision
to provide further, verified Code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests
for Production of Documents, Set No One (i.e., Nos. 1-35) within 10 days from the date of the hearing on this
motion.
See synopsis of Motion #1. Saeedian represents in his
declaration accompanying the instant motion that it was agreed during the April
15, 2024 IDC that FCA “would supplement Form Interrogatory 12.1 and complete
document production by April 19, 2024” and that FCA “has not provided any
supplemental responses to the identified RFP” as of the motion filing date. (Id.,
¶¶ 8 and 9).
Again, the requests in issue are Requests Nos. 1-35. Request
No. 1 seeks documents which relate to any maintenance performed by Envision on
the subject vehicle. Request No. 2 seeks documents of any communications

Request No. 11 seeks documents evidencing contact between

any non-attorney and relating or referring to Plaintiff or the subject vehicle.
Request No. 13 seeks documents evidencing the number of repairs performed by
Envision in 2020, 2021, and 2022 on 2022 Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles for complaints
about Infotainment System, Speaker System, Air Conditioning System, and
Emergency Braking System. Request No. 14 seeks documents evidencing written or
recorded statements from any person concerning the subject vehicle or
Plaintiff’s complaints concerning the subject vehicle.
Request No. 15 seeks the warranty information provided by
FCA Envision about the warranty coverage on the subject vehicle. Request No. 16
seeks documents related to Envision’s policies and procedures for determining
whether a particular repair on 2022 Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles are covered by FCA
warranty. Request No. 17 seeks Envision’s warranty claims policy and procedure
manual(s) provided to it by FCA from 2017 to the present. Request No. 18 seeks
documents evidencing Envision’s franchise agreement with FCA. Request No. 19
seeks documents evidencing policies and procedures provided to it by FCA in
regard to repeat repairs on customer vehicles. Request No. 20 seeks documents
demonstrating FCA’s policies and procedures for Envision to handle customer
complaints that the vehicle is a lemon. Requests Nos. 21 and 22 seek documents
evidencing FCA’s policies and procedures provided to Envision to [identify a
substantially impairing defect]/[report warranty repairs to FCA], respectively.
Request No. 23 seeks documents evidencing Envision’s
policies, procedures, or guidelines for determining whether a vehicle is
eligible for a vehicle repurchase under California law. Request No. 24 seeks
documents evidencing Envision’s training of its technicians, service advisors,
and/or service managers to categorize a particular repair as “warranty” or
“internal” on a repair order. Request No. 25 seeks documents evidencing all
warranty repair payments by FCA to Envision for the repairs on the subject vehicle.
Request No. 26 seeks documents evidencing any FCA employee
sent to Envision’s dealership to assist with repairs on the subject vehicle. Request
No. 27 seeks documents evidencing all TSBs which have been issued for 2022
Dodge RAM 1500 vehicles. Request No. 28 seeks documents evidencing all recalls which have been issued for 2022 Dodge
RAM 1500 vehicles that involve any part, component, sub-component, system,
assembly, or sub-assembly for which the subject vehicle was subject to one or
more repair attempts as reflected in Envision’s Warranty Claim Records or in
the repair orders produced during discovery in this case.
Request No. 29 seeks documents provided to Envision by FCA
to identify a substantial impairment of use, value, or safety in a customer
vehicle based upon the repairs performed by Envision. Request No. 30 seeks
documents regarding FCA’s repair procedures consulted and followed by
Envision’s technicians during the completion of repairs for the subject
vehicle. Request No. 31 seeks documents about parts delays for vehicles of the
same make, model, and year as the subject vehicle. Request
No. 32 seeks documents regarding handling warranty repairs on the subject
vehicle. Request No. 33 seeks documents relating to

documents related to Envision’s contacts with FCA Customer Contact Line and/or

repair policies and procedures for Envision’s dealership.
The court has reviewed Envision’s responses thereto. Again,
Envision, by failing to oppose the motion, has not met its burden of justifying
its objections to the requests.
Envision’s substantive response to Requests Nos. 1-35 fail
to comply with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.220; as such, further responses
are warranted.
The motion is granted. Envision is to provide further,
Code-compliant responses to Requests Nos. 1-35 within 20 days from the date of
the notice of ruling.
