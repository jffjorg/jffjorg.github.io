And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court rules on Amir Shamloo's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, which seeks judgment in his favor and against Gordes and LVGEM on the Second Amended Complaint. The court finds that Shamloo's motion is denied. The court grants Shamloo's Request for Judicial Notice in part and denies it in part. The court rules on the evidentiary objections of Gordes and LVGEM as moot. The court finds that the defendants' statements in their answers were not sham denials and that there was no perjury committed. The court determines that Huang's statements were not inconsistent with the allegations of the pleading, and that the court would not take judicial notice of the content of the October 25, 2023 letter and Qian's deposition testimony. The court denies Shamloo's motion for judgment on the pleadings.
