Evidentiary Objections  
 
The court declines to rule on the parties’ objections as
they are not relevant or material to the disposition of this motion on the
merits. All objections not ruled upon are
preserved for appeal. (CCP § 437c(q).)
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
CCP § 437c(f)(2)
states in the relevant part: 
 
A party shall not
move for summary judgment based on issues asserted in a prior motion for
summary adjudication and denied by the court unless that party establishes,
to the satisfaction of the court, newly discovered facts or circumstances
or a change of law supporting the issues reasserted in the summary judgment
motion.
 
(Ibid. [italics added].)
 
“Under both Code of Civil Procedure sections 1008, subdivision (b), and
437c, subdivision (f)(2), the motion made more than 10 days after an original
motion is a new motion. Both sections authorize the new motion
under prescribed circumstances but Code of Civil Procedure section 1008,
subdivision (b) does not purport to authorize a new summary
judgment motion that does not comply with the requirements for such
motions set out in Code of Civil Procedure section 437c.” (UAS Management, Inc. v. Mater Misericordiae Hospital
(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 357, 368.) 
 
II.        Renewed Motion for Summary Adjudication
 
Plaintiff has filed a
renewed motion for summary adjudication as to Plaintiff’s 12th cause of action
for Declaratory Relief in the Fourth Amended Complaint (“4AC”). Defendants
oppose the Motion on two grounds: (1) the Motion is improper because it fails
to allege new facts, circumstances, or law that warrant renewal of the motion
for summary adjudication; and (2) triable issues of fact exist. 
 
A.        Plaintiffs’ Fail to Allege New Discovered Facts, Circumstance,
or Change of Law Warrant Renewal 
 
“To determine whether a second summary judgment motion is
proper, courts consider whether it involves ‘newly discovered facts or
circumstances or a change of law.’ ” (Patterson v. Sacramento City
Unified School Dist. (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 821, 827 citing Schachter v. Citigroup, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th
726, 739.) When a renewed motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication fails to state new facts, circumstances, or law supporting
the issues reasserted in renewed motion, “[i]t follows ineluctably that the second motion was prohibited
by subdivision (f)(2) of section 437c and should have been denied on that
ground.” (Bagley v. TRW, Inc. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1092, 1097.)
 
Plaintiff’s renewed Motion fails to identify what new
facts, circumstances, or law warrant renewal of the motion for summary
judgment. The court has reviewed Plaintiff’s original separate statement filed on
April 21, 2023 (the “2023 separate statement”), with the separate statement for
the renewed motion filed on March 1, 2024 (the “2024 separate statement”). 
 
The Motion seeks adjudication on the same cause of action
and issue: the Recording of the “Substitution of Trustee and Full Reconveyance”
signed by  Plaintiff was ineffective to
terminate Power’s interest under the 2013 Deed of Trust because there was no
delivery of the Asia Top City Note. 
 
The Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”) in 2023 separate statement
are the same as the UMF in the 2024 separate statement except that the 2024
separate statement includes an additional UMF, UMF No. 9: 
 
The Asia
Top City Note states, “in the event that the Reconveyance is determined to be ineffective
to terminate the Terminated Agreements, then this Note and the obligations of
MAKER hereunder shall be deemed void and of no further force or effect.”
 
(UMF No. 9.) 
The fact cited in UMF No. 9 is not new and the evidence
cited in support of said fact is also not new because it is based on
Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Complaint and this court’s August 2023 Order denying
the first motion for summary adjudication.  Accordingly, UMF No. 9 cites no new facts or
evidence. 
 
The only new evidence cited in the 2024 separate
statement is Exhibit D, which is a portion of the transcript of the deposition
of Michael Kiely (“Kiely”) taken on December 22, 2023. (Aalaei Decl. Ex. D.)
Plaintiff states that after the denial of the first motion for summary
adjudication, Plaintiff deposed Kiely on December 22, 2023. (Aalaei Decl. ¶ 5,
Ex. D.) Plaintiff fails to provide any explanation as to why Kiely was not
deposed earlier. Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to explain to the satisfaction of
the court that Kiely’s deposition constitutes new facts or circumstances that warrant
renewal of the motion for summary adjudication. (CCP, § 437c(f)(2).) This alone
warrants the denial of Plaintiff’s Motion. 
 
B.        Plaintiff Fails to Show No Triable
Issues of Material Fact Exist
 
Kiely’s deposition shows
that Kiely had no specific recollection of having the Asia Top City Note (the
“Note”) in his possession when he met with Plaintiff on July 28, 2016. (Alaei
Decl. Ex. D [Kiely Depo. at p. 43:14-15].) The fact that Kiely does not recall
having the Note on July 28, 2016, does not establish that Kiely did not have the
Note and did not deliver the Note when he met with Powers on July 28, 2016. Furthermore,
the purported email from Vivian Marcos to Kiely purportedly dated August 1,
2016, containing a copy of the Note has not been produced by Plaintiff nor
cited in the separate statement. If the evidence is not set forth in the
separate statement it does not exist. (City of Pasadena v. Superior Court
(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.) Hence, Plaintiff fails to rebut Kiely’s
assertion that the email at most shows that Kiely possessed the Note on August
1, 2016, not that the Note was not delivered on July 28, 2016. 
 
Kiely’s deposition reflects
that he recalls meeting with Powers on July 28, 2016, and asserts that: 
 
If I had it on the day that I met with him in
person, I believe, but I don't recall, but I believe I would have handed it to
him. If I didn't have it, then I wouldn't have handed it to him, and the
conditions referenced in the agreement regarding delivery of reconveyance
documents would have to have been satisfied thereafter.
 
[ . . . ]
 
I think what I'm trying to say is I don't
have specific recollection about the exchange of papers in connection with that
agreement. I read the agreement and thought I would have exchanged -- whatever
papers I had at closing, I would have exchanged. I wouldn't have tried to hold back
the note.
 
If I didn't have the note at the closing,
then I would have held back the reconveyance until we satisfied the two
conditions to its legal delivery under this agreement.
 
(Kiely Decl. Ex. 4 [Keiley
Depo. at pp. 36:22-37:4; 37:12-22.) 
Whether Kiely did in fact
physically deliver a copy of the Note to Powers on July 28, 2016, remains a
disputed issue of material fact and Keily’s declaration does not establish as a
fact that the Note was not delivered to Powers. “The trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of
a factfinder to determine whose version is more likely true. Nor may the trial
court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.” (Binder
v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 840.) Here, the trier of
fact will weigh the credibility of the witnesses and decide whether the
delivery did in fact take place. 
 
Based on the above, Plaintiff’s renewed motion for summary
judgment is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s Renewed Motion
for Summary Adjudication is denied. 
Plaintiff to give notice.
