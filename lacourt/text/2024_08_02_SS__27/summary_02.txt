And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel initial responses to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production. The plaintiff failed to provide discovery responses by the statutory deadline, and the defendant has sought sanctions for this failure. The court orders the plaintiff to provide complete and verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 30 days. The court also orders the plaintiff and her counsel to pay sanctions of $1500 to the defendant within 30 days. The court finds that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification and that the defendant's sanctions request was excessive.
