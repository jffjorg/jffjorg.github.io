Ruling: MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS
CONTINUED
 
The present hearing
concerns a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant RPL Investment
against Plaintiff. Plaintiff did not file an opposition and, on July 30, 2024,
filed a request to dismiss his complaint against Defendant RPL Investment,
pending the court’s approval. Should the court grant Plaintiff’s dismissal of
the present action against Defendant RPL, the motion for summary judgment would
be moot. Thus, the court continues the present motion to August 8, 2024, after
the court rendered its decision on Plaintiff’s 7/30/24 request for dismissal.
