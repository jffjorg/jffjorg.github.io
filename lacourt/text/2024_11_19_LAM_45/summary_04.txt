Roles:
  - Judge: Mel Red Recana
Significant Statements:
  - "A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed."
  - "The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action."
  - "Two principles underlie a cause of action for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. First, the employee must request an accommodation. Second, the parties must engage in an interactive process regarding the requested accommodation and, if the process fails, responsibility for the failure rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith."

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer with motion to strike filed by the defendants, Seizmic Inc., Jeremy McGookin, and Danny Medina, and has ruled as follows:

1. The demurrer to the third cause of action for failure to engage in the interactive process is overruled. The Court finds that the plaintiff, Mario Sobalvarro, has sufficiently pled that the defendants failed to engage in a timely, good-faith interactive process following his request for an accommodation.
2. The demurrer to the eighth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is overruled. The Court finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, including allegations of extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendants.
3. The motion to strike portions of the complaint is denied. The Court finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support his claim for punitive damages against a corporate employer, and that the defendants' attempts to strike certain paragraphs of the complaint are without merit.

In conclusion, the Court has overruled the demurrer to the complaint and denied the motion to strike, and has ordered that the case proceed to the next stage.
