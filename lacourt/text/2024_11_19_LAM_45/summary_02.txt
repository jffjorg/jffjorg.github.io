Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Defendant/Cross-Defendant Evaristo Cardenas dba Varo Sheet Metal. The motion seeks a determination that the settlement between Varo Sheet Metal and Plaintiff Carin Meyer is in good faith and that any claims for equitable comparative contribution, partial or comparative indemnity based on comparative negligence or comparative fault against Varo Sheet Metal are barred.

The settlement was reached with the help of a mediator and resulted in Varo Sheet Metal agreeing to pay $50,000 to Plaintiff in exchange for a release of all claims and a dismissal with prejudice from Plaintiff's complaint. No non-settling party has served or filed a motion to contest Varo Sheet Metal's Motion.

The judge relied on the Tech-Bilt factors in determining whether the settlement was made in good faith. The factors include a rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery and Varo Sheet Metal's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among Plaintiffs, recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial, the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants.

The judge noted that the overwhelming majority of motions for good faith determination are unopposed and granted summarily by the trial court, and that only when the good faith nature of a settlement is disputed does it become necessary for the trial court to consider and weigh the Tech-Bilt factors.
