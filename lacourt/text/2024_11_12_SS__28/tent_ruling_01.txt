  Case Number:  20STCV14497    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 15, 2020, Plaintiff Mark Rufin (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Abraham Dominguez (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence. 
On
September 28, 2021, the clerk entered Defendant's default. 
On
January 27, 2023, the Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice. On May
30, 2023, the Court vacated the dismissal. 
On November
30, 2023, the Court vacated the September 28, 2021 default because Plaintiff
did not properly serve a statement of damages on Defendant before the clerk
entered Defendant’s default. 
On
January 25, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants with prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
April 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of substituted service of the summons,
complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on Defendant on April 28,
2024. 
On
July 29, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
Also
on July 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application
for entry of default judgment against Defendant. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant and award
Plaintiff $313,281.20, consisting of $111,586.85 in special damages,
$200,000.00 in general damages, and $1,694.00 in costs.LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has provided evidence that he incurred medical expenses of $1,528.00 for an ambulance and $5,670.00 for treatment at
LAC/USC. 
          Plaintiff also requests $104,388.85 in special damages
based on treatment provided by the Veterans Administration (“VA”).  Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that “the VA has
established their right to reimbursement for medical treatment billed in
treating Plaintiff.”  (Yadidi dec. ¶ 61,
citing Exh. N.)  Documentation from the VA attached to counsel’s declaration
states: “VA’s right of recovery from the tortfeasor . . . for reasonable
charges for medical care provided or paid for by VA is independent of that of
the VA beneficiary.  Payment to VA beneficiary and a VA beneficiary-signed
release do not impact liability of a tortfeasor . . . for payment to VA.  Payment for VA medical treatment must be made
directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs.”  (Exh. N.) 
          Plaintiff, however, asks the Court to order Defendant to
pay the amount owed to the VA ($104,388.85) not to the VA but to Plaintiff.  The request appears to be inconsistent with
the VA’s directive.  At a minimum,
Plaintiff has not explained how including $104,388.85 in Plaintiff’s special
damages award is consistent with the VA’s right to reimbursement of this amount. 
          The Court grants in part Plaintiff’s application for
default judgment and awards Plaintiff special damages of $7,198.00 (consisting
of $1,528.00 for an ambulance and $5,670.00 for treatment at LAC/USC), $200,000.00
in general damages, and $1,694.35 in costs, for a total award of $208,892.35.  The Court denies Plaintiff’s request for an
additional $104,388.85 in special damages.          
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff Mark Rufin’s
application for default judgment against Defendant Abraham Dominguez filed on
July 29, 2024.  The Court awards
Plaintiff Mark Rufin $208,892.35.  In all
other respects, the Court DENIES the application. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
