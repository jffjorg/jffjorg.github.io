And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The State has moved for leave to file a cross-complaint against the City and Roes 1-20 for breach of contract and declaratory relief. The State's proposed cross-complaint is based on the same facts as the plaintiff's complaint and alleges that the City is contractually obligated to indemnify the State for any damages the State is required to pay the plaintiff. The Court grants the motion and orders the State to file and serve the cross-complaint within 30 days of the hearing on this motion.
