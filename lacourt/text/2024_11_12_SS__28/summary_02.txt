And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel plaintiff's experts to produce documents and attend depositions. The defendants had requested that plaintiff's experts, Lester Zackler, M.D., and Brendan Bourdage, Ph.D., produce documents and attend depositions as part of the discovery process. Plaintiff had refused to comply with the discovery requests, and the defendants had filed a motion to compel compliance. The judge finds that plaintiff's experts must produce documents and attend depositions as requested by the defendants. The judge also imposes sanctions on plaintiff for failing to comply with the discovery requests.
