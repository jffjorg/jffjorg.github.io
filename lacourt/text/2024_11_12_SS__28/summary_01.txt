And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default judgment and has ruled as follows. The plaintiff, Mark Rufin, seeks default judgment against the defendant, Abraham Dominguez, and is asking for damages of $313,281.20. The judge has granted in part the plaintiff's application for default judgment and has awarded the plaintiff special damages of $7,198.00, general damages of $200,000.00, and costs of $1,694.35, for a total award of $208,892.35. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for additional special damages of $104,388.85. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's request for damages is inconsistent with the Veteran's Administration's right to reimbursement for medical treatment.
