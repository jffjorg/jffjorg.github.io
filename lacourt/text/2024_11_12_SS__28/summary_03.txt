And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is as follows:

The Plaintiffs, Doris Ayala and Marcos Ocegueda, filed this action against the Defendants, Alexis Margarito Navarrete Cruz, Santiago de Jesus Navarrete, and Does 1-100, on January 14, 2021. The Defendants filed an answer on May 5, 2023. On September 20, 2024, the Defendants filed motions to compel discovery responses from Ocegueda, including requests for identification and production of writings and things, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. Ocegueda did not serve timely responses and had not served responses by the time the motions were filed.

The Judge grants the motions to compel Ocegueda's responses to the requests, including identification and production of writings and things, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The Judge orders Ocegueda to serve code-compliant verified responses to the requests without objections by November 26, 2024, and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by November 26, 2024.

The Judge also denies the requests for sanctions. The Judge finds that the Court's authority to impose sanctions is limited by Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, and that the Court cannot invoke its independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030. The Judge concludes that the Court has granted the motions to compel discovery responses and denied the requests for sanctions.
