And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jennifer Rivas v. Dynamic Nursing Services, Inc. (BC699897). The case involves a petition to confirm an arbitration award and a petition to vacate the same award. The Judge has ruled that the petition to confirm the arbitration award is GRANTED, and the petition to vacate the arbitration award is DENIED. The Judge found that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1286.2(a)(4) and that the petition to confirm the arbitration award was properly filed. The Judge has rejected the defendant's challenge to the arbitration award, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, which holds that errors in the arbitrator's application of California law do not provide a basis for vacating the award.
