And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint alleging punitive damages. The plaintiff, Rebecca Kadel, filed a wage and hour action against Operational Technical Services, LLC and Operational Technical Services, Inc. alleging that she was misclassified as an exempt employee and paid a salary rather than hourly wages, and that she was terminated in retaliation for complaining about this treatment.

The defendants argued that the complaint lacks sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages, and the court agrees. The complaint consists entirely of conclusory allegations devoid of specific facts showing malicious, fraudulent, or oppressive conduct, or that any officer of the defendants ratified such conduct. The court finds that the allegations are insufficiently pled and must be stricken.

The court notes that the plaintiff's complaint alleges retaliation under two different legal theories, but even construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the court finds that these allegations are not sufficient because the complaint is entirely devoid of factual allegations showing ratification of any malicious conduct. The court concludes that the allegations pertaining to punitive damages are insufficiently pled and must be stricken.
