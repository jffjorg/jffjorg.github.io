And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Alexander Marmureaneau, M.D., moves for summary judgment in this medical malpractice case. The plaintiff, Kimberly Clayborn, alleges that the defendant breached the standard of care during a cardiac surgery performed on October 11, 2018. The defendant's expert testimony suggests that the surgery was performed within the standard of care and that the plaintiff's injuries were not caused by the defendant's alleged malpractice.

The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue of fact as to the defendant's medical negligence or a causal connection to the plaintiff's injury. The plaintiff's separate statement does not set forth the specific pieces of evidence on which the claimed disputed material facts are based, and the plaintiff's expert testimony is not admissible due to lack of foundation and authentication issues.

Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish a cause of action for medical malpractice.
