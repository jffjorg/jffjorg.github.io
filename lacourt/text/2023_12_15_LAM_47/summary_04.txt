And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to strike portions of the complaint pertaining to punitive damages. The defendants argue that the complaint lacks specific facts showing malicious, fraudulent, or oppressive conduct, and the judge agrees. The judge finds that the complaint's allegations of retaliation are conclusory and do not provide sufficient evidence to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge notes that the complaint is entirely devoid of factual allegations showing ratification of any malicious conduct. As a result, the judge grants the motion to strike the punitive damages allegations.
