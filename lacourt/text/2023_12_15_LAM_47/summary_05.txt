Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a wage and hour action filed by Myranda McCurdy against Operational Technical Services, LLC and Operational Technical Services, Inc. The Defendants move to strike portions of the Complaint pertaining to punitive damages, arguing that the allegations are insufficiently pled. The Judge agrees, finding that the Complaint lacks specific facts showing malicious, fraudulent, or oppressive conduct, and grants the motion to strike. The Judge notes that the Complaint must set forth facts supporting a claim for punitive damages, and that conclusory allegations of malice may be sufficient to support punitive damages when retaliation is alleged. However, even construed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the Court finds that the allegations are not sufficient to withstand a motion to strike.
