And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling in this case is that the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to their requests for production is continued to September 3, 2024. The plaintiffs, Phala Kieng and Ben Kieng, are suing Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC for allegedly violating the California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act by failing to repair their 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque during the warranty period. The defendants responded to the plaintiffs' requests with boilerplate objections and failed to produce most of the requested documents. The judge is not persuaded that the parties have exhausted their meet and confer obligations and is ordering them to make further efforts to resolve the issues. If the parties are unable to informally resolve their disputes, they may appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date.
