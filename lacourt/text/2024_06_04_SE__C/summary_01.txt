And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the Representative Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint. The Second Amended Complaint adds an additional defendant, Erika De La Teja, and includes additional paragraphs to describe how the acts of Defendant Erika De La Teja gave rise to the causes of action. The Judge has considered the representation of the Representative Plaintiff and the proposed Second Amended Complaint meets the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. The Judge exercises its discretion liberally in favor of amendments, as judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit. The Judge will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave, but will consider the grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike at a later time.
