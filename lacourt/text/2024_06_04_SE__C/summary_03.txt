And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by Sandra Green against Rose Marie Leary. The court has sustained the demurrer as to the first cause of action for partition, allowing the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The demurrer as to the second and third causes of action for constructive and resulting trust has been sustained without leave to amend. The court has ruled that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the plaintiff has failed to allege the ownership interest of the defendant in the subject property. The court has also noted that the grant deed attached to the complaint as exhibit 1 indicates that the parties are joint tenants, not tenants in common.
