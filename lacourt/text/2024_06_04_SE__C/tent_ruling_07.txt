Tentative Ruling 
Defendants Daniel Lopez and Nidelvia Yah’s
Demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendants are
ordered to answer within 5 days. 
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Defendants Daniel Lopez and Nidelvia Yah (“Defendants”) demur
to the Complaint on the grounds that: (1) the person who filed the pleading
does not have capacity to sue, (2) the pleading does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action, (3) the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, and
or unintelligible.
Background 
This is an unlawful detainer predicated on Defendants'
failure to comply with Plaintiff's 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit
("Notice") the premises at 9716 GREENLEAF AVENUE, WHITTIER, CA 90605
("Premises"). Defendants owe past due rent of $33,000.00 and relevant
holdover damages of $100.00 per day, which are ongoing. Plaintiff filed suit on
March 28, 2024. 
On April 11, 2024, Defendants filed Demurrer to Plaintiff's
Complaint.
Legal Standard 
The party against whom a
complaint has been filed may object to the pleading, by demurrer, on several
grounds, including the ground that the pleading does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A party may demur to an
entire complaint, or to any causes of action stated therein. (CCP § 430.50(a).)
Discussion 
“[T]he basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment
of rent contained in CCP §1161(2) are: (1) the tenant is in possession of the
premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in
default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a
written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day
notice period has elapsed.”  (Kruger
v. Reyes (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 16.) 
Defendants demur to the Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff
does not have capacity to sue, the Complaint does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, and the Complaint is uncertain, ambiguous, and or
unintelligible.
Defendants have filed a boilerplate pleading. While
Defendants cite laws, they fail to explain how these laws apply to the Complaint
filed in the present action. 
The Court determines that the Complaint adequately alleges
that Plaintiff is the landlord/owner of the premises (¶ 4), Defendants are in
possession of the premises (¶ 3), possession is without permission (¶ 9), Defendants
are in default for nonpayment of rent (¶¶ 12-13), the tenant has been properly
served with a written three-day notice and the default continues after the three-day
notice period has elapsed (¶¶ 9-10).  
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer is OVERRULED.
