#1 
Tentative Ruling 
Representative Plaintiff Samantha Trujilo’s
Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background 
This is a Private Attorney General Action (“PAGA”) action
filed by Representative Plaintiff Samantha Trujillo (“Representative
Plaintiff”) against Defendants Tempo Cantina Downey LLC and Chingon Restaurant
Group LLC (collectively “Defendants”) on June 2, 2023. 
Representative Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on
October 3, 2023, and now moves for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).  The SAC names Erika De La Teja as an
additional Defendant and includes additional paragraphs to describe how the
acts of Defendant Erika De La Teja gave rise to the causes of action in the
SAC. The SAC lists a single cause of action for violation of Labor Code § 2698,
et seq. 
As of May 28, 2024, no opposition has been filed. 
Legal Standard 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a) provides: “The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any
party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer.¿ The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (a)(1); see Code Civ. Proc., § 576.)¿ 
¿ 
The
court has broad discretion to permit amendments to pleadings, and “the court’s
discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of the
pleadings.”¿ (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.)¿ “The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it is a rare case in
which denial of leave to amend can be justified.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ “If the
motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not
prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend . . . .”¿¿
(Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)¿ Prejudice
includes “delay in trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of
preparation.”¿ (Solit
v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th
1435, 1448.)¿ 
¿ 
California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, subdivision (a) provides, “[a] motion to amend a
pleading before trial must: (1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or
amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from
previous pleadings or amendments; (2) State what allegations in the previous
pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and
line number, the deleted allegations are located; and (3) State what
allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations
are located.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, subd. (a)). Further,
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, subdivision (b) provides, “[a] separate
declaration must accompany the motion and must specify: (1) The effect
of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) When the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) The
reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.”¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1324, subd. (a)).
 
Discussion 
As a preliminary matter, Representative Plaintiff has
attached both clean copies and strikethrough copies of the proposed SAC.
(Tapanian Decl., ¶ 2.) Additionally, a declaration is attached stating the
reasons for the amendment. (See Tapanian Decl.) Accordingly, Representative Plaintiff’s
declaration in support of the motion satisfies the requirements under CRC Rule
3.1324
The proposed SAC is based on the same factual allegations,
and alleges violations of the same labor code provisions at issue in the FAC.
The only substantive difference between the allegations is the fact that an
additional Defendant has been added. 
The
Court’s discretion to grant leave “should be exercised liberally in favor of
amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in
the same lawsuit.”¿ (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court¿(1989) 213
Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)¿ Ordinarily, the Court will not consider the validity
of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since grounds
for a demurrer or motion to strike are premature. (See¿California Casualty
General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281
(overruled on other grounds by¿Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins.
Co.¿(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390).)¿¿
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Representative
Plaintiff’s Motion for leave to file the Second Amended Complaint.
