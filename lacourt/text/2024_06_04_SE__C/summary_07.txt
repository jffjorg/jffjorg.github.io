And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Daniel Lopez and Nidelvia Yah, have filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff, C Keith Hernandez, does not have the capacity to sue, the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and the complaint is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible. However, the court finds that the complaint adequately alleges that the plaintiff is the landlord/owner of the premises, the defendants are in possession of the premises, possession is without permission, the defendants are in default for nonpayment of rent, and the tenant has been properly served with a written three-day notice and the default continues after the three-day notice period has elapsed. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled and the defendants are ordered to answer within 5 days.
