And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the Defendants' demurrer is deemed MOOT and taken off calendar. The case arises from a home loan and a denial of a loan modification request. The Plaintiff, Antonio Banda, filed suit against the Defendants, PHH Mortgage Corporation and Federal National Mortgage Corporation, on October 16, 2023. The Defendants filed a demurrer on November 2, 2023, and the Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on May 14, 2024. Since the Plaintiff's amended complaint supersedes the original complaint, the demurrer is deemed MOOT and the hearing is taken off calendar.
