The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Littler Mendelson, P.C. and attorneys James E. Hart and Susan T. Ye to be relieved as counsel for the defendants Marko Kosta and Sk8 Gym Corporation. The motion is based on a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the breakdown is demonstrated by the fact that the plaintiff was served by mail at the client's last known address. The judge finds that this constitutes good cause for withdrawal under Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 3-700(C). The ruling does not stay the matter.
