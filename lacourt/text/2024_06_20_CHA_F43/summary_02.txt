Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for attorney fees in the amount of $20,070.00, which is the base lodestar amount. No costs will be awarded at this time. The judge found that the attorney's hourly rate of $450 is reasonable, based on her experience in Lemon Law and the recent approval of her hourly rate in another case. The judge also found that the time spent on the tasks was reasonable, despite some objections from the defendant. However, the judge denied the request for a lodestar enhancement of 1.5, finding that the case was not particularly novel, difficult, or risky. The judge orders the parties to address costs with a memorandum of costs.
