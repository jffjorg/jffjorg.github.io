SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiffs Karim
T. Sazi and Jaleh J. Ferdowsian (Plaintiffs) had sued Defendant BMW of North
America, LLC (Defendant) for causes of action related to the Song-Beverly Act. On
April 22, 2024, the parties settled the case. Plaintiffs filed this motion on
the basis that they are entitled to attorney fees as the prevailing parties in
a Song-Beverly action.
 
Plaintiffs are
requesting $20,070.00 in attorney fees from Defendant, plus a lodestar modifier
of 1.5 for a total requested fee award of $30,105.00. Plaintiffs argue in their
motion that the attorney fees and hourly rates are reasonable. Plaintiffs’
evidence in support of their request for attorney fees are a declaration from
their attorney, Diba Alemi, and billing statements that show each task that Ms.
Alemi worked on, what the task was, how much time was spent on the task, her
hourly rate, and the amount of money for the task. (Alemi Decl., Ex. A.) 
 
Ms. Alemi’s
hourly rate was $450 for 44.6 hours for a total lodestar of $20,070.00. (Alemi
Decl., ¶¶ 5, 10, and 19.)
 
The total
lodestar was calculated by multiplying Ms. Alemi’s hourly rate by her hours
worked. Multiplying the lodestar by the 1.5 multiplier gets the total requested
amount of $30,105.
 
Plaintiffs have
also requested costs in the amount of $536.40. However, costs are awarded
pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700. Costs should be requested
via a memorandum of costs.
 
ANALYSIS
A prevailing
party is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract,
statute, or law. (See CCP § 1033.5(a)(10); Cal. Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “A
successful party means a prevailing party, and [a party] may be considered
prevailing parties for attorney’s fees purposes if they succeed on any
significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties
sought in bringing suit.” (Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 173, 178.) If a buyer prevails in a Song-Beverly action, then the
buyer is allowed to recover attorney fees. (Civ. Code § 1794(d).) Plaintiffs
are authorized by statute to recover attorney fees.
 
Plaintiffs are
the prevailing party by virtue of the fact that the parties settled in
Plaintiffs’ favor via the Settlement Agreement. Plaintiffs have requested a
total of $30,105.00 in attorney fees.
 
Defendant
opposes Plaintiffs’ motion on the basis that Plaintiffs have not shown that
their attorney’s hourly rate is reasonable. Next, Defendant argues that several
of Plaintiffs’ billing entries are excessive. Finally, Defendant argues that
the claimed lodestar enhancement should be rejected.
 
Plaintiffs
argue in their reply that Plaintiffs’ attorney’s hourly rate of $450 is
reasonable. Next, they argue that their billing entries are reasonable.
Finally, Plaintiffs argue that their lodestar enhancement is justified.
 
            Hourly Rate    
Defendant argues
in its opposition that Plaintiffs’ attorney’s hourly rate of $450 is
unreasonable based on the Wolster Kluwer “2021 Real Rate Report: The Industry’s
Leading Analysis of Law Firm Rates, Trends and Practices.” (Horn Decl., ¶ 7,
Ex. B.) Defendant argues that this publication shows that the average rate for
partners in this area of law in Los Angeles is $278.50 and $259 for associates.
Defendant argues that the Court should use an average hourly rate of $270 for Plaintiffs’
attorney’s work. Defendant also cites a few hours of work that Defendant claims
is work that would not be expected to be performed by attorneys with partner
level experience.
 
Plaintiffs’
attorney argues in reply that her experience in the area of Lemon Law justifies
her hourly rate. She also argues that just recently on May 23, 2024, her hourly
rate was approved in Ventura County, case number 2023CUBC017634. (Alemi Reply
Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
Based on
Plaintiffs’ attorney’s experience in Lemon Law and the recent approval of her
hourly rate, the Court finds that her hourly rate of $450 an hour is
reasonable.
 
            Billing Entires
The Song-Beverly
Act only entitles Plaintiffs to attorney fees for “actual time expended.” (Civ.
Code § 1794(d).) This means that analysis as to whether the fees and costs
sought are reasonable under the circumstances is required. (Levy v. Toyota
Motor Sales, USA, Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.) Once objection to
the fees has been raised, then Plaintiffs’ counsel bears the burden of showing
that the fees were reasonably necessary, and the Court has the discretion to
reduce fees awarded. (En Palm, LLC v Teitler Family Trust (2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 770, 775.)
 
In determining
the reasonableness of fees, courts look to the factors from Church of
Scientology v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, disapproved on other
grounds by Equilon Enters. v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53,
68 n.5. The factors from Wollersheim are (1) the amount of money
involved in the litigation; (2) the nature of the litigation and its difficulty
and the intricacies and importance of the litigation; (3) the skill required
and employed in handling the litigation, the necessity for skilled legal
training and ability in trying the case, and counsel’s education and experience
in the particular type of work involved; (4) the attention given to the case; (5)
the success of the attorneys efforts; and (6) the time consumed by the
litigation. (Id.)
 
Defendant
argues in its opposition that Plaintiffs’ billing entries show an excessive
number of hours for the work performed. Specifically, Defendant points to the
3.1 hours to draft the “boilerplate” complaint, 3.7 hours to draft written
discovery requests, 7.7 hours to prepare for Defendant’s PMK deposition that
did not go forward, and nearly 6 hours for this attorney fees motion. Defendant
had also cited 2.4 hours to create a repair order summary, 0.8 hours to draft a
PMK deposition notice, 0.3 hours to reserve a court reporter, 0.4 hours to
draft an amended PMK deposition notice, 0.8 hours to prepare and file a notice
of settlement, 1 hour to review/audit billing entries, and 0.2 hours to file
motion for attorney fees. Defendant argues that the latter tasks were all
administrative tasks unlikely to be handled by a partner.
 
Plaintiffs’
attorney argues in the reply that for several of the tasks, she is the sole
attorney handling her Lemon Law cases so she prepares all the documents. For
the other tasks, she gives reasons why the time for each task was reasonable. (Reply,
pp. 4-6.) The Court finds that the time given for the tasks was reasonable and
that no adjustment is necessary, given the nature of the work and the fact that
Plaintiffs’ attorney was doing most of the work herself.
 
            Lodestar Enhancement
The lodestar
amount, once determined, can be increased by a “multiplier enhancement” that is
based on several factors, including: (1) the risks presented by the litigation;
(2) the novelty and difficulty of the legal and factual issues involved; (3)
the results obtained on behalf of the plaintiff; and (4) the skill exhibited by
counsel. (See In re Vitamin Cases (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1052.)
 
Defendant
argues in its opposition that Plaintiffs should not get the 1.5 multiplier that
they seek because they did not make a showing of novelty or difficulty of the
questions involved or make a showing of particular skill displayed in
presenting the case. Defendant also argues that this was not a risky case,
given the generous nature of the consumer protection in the Song-Beverly Act.
(See Weeks v. Baker & McKenzie (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1174-1175
[multiplier not warranted for contingency risk on claim with a mandatory
fee-shifting provision, because “the possibility of receiving full compensation
for litigating the case was greater than that inherent in most contingency fee
actions”].)
 
Plaintiffs’
attorney argues in her reply that she faced the risk of dismissal because the
car in this case was repaired within a reasonable number of attempts under the
Song-Beverly Act. She requests the 1.5 multiplier, given the risky nature of
the case.
 
The Court does
not find that Plaintiffs have made a showing that this case was particularly
novel, difficult, or risky. It appears to be a fairly standard Lemon Law case.
Therefore, the 1.5 multiplier enhancement is not justified. The Court denies
Plaintiffs’ request for the multiplier enhancement.
 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs’
motion for attorney fees is granted in the amount of $20,070.00. No lodestar
enhancement will be added. Costs should be addressed with a memorandum of
costs.
