And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Michael A. Foster's motion for an order to deposit stock certificates with the Clerk of the Court. The court grants the motion and orders Foster to deposit the stock certificates with the court. The court also awards Foster $13,570.17 in attorney fees and costs from claimants, jointly and severally. The court finds that Xie is not the prevailing party in this matter, as he brought a subsequent action (Case No. 23STCV12560) seeking the same relief as the original action. The court also rejects Xie's argument that only Claimant Grewal should be liable for costs and fees, as Foster's interpleader action was necessary to resolve the dispute over ownership of the stock certificates.
