  vs.
 
DOE #1, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  22STCV35324 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: March 7, 2024



 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to her Form Interrogatories is GRANTED.  Amended responses are due within 10 days.  The Court declines to award sanctions as part
of this motion.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to her RFPs is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN
PART, consistent with the ruling set forth below. Accordingly, the Court
declines to award sanctions as part of this motion. 
 
On 11/4/2022,
Plaintiff Jane Doe C.J. filed suit against Doe #1 (a public entity) and Doe #2
alleging personal injuries and damages from childhood sexual abuse. 
 
            On
10/10/2023, Plaintiff moves to compel further responses From Defendant to her
Form Interrogatories and her Requests for Production (RFPs). For ease, the
Court has consolidated its analysis into a single ruling. 
 
Discussion 
 
I.                  
Form Interrogatories 
 
Plaintiff
argues that good cause exists to compel Defendant to submit further responses
to Form Interrogatory No. 4.1.
 
Form Interrogatory
No. 4.1 requests:
 
At the time
of the INCIDENT, was there in effect any policy of insurance through which you
were or might be insured in any manner (for example, primary, pro-rata, or
excess liability coverage or medical expense coverage) for the damages, claims,
or actions that have arisen out of the INCIDENT? If so, for each policy state:
(a)
the kind of coverage; 
(b)
the name and ADDRESS of the insurance company; 
(c)
the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of each named insured; 
(d)
the policy number; 
(e)
the limits of coverage for each type of coverage contained in the policy;
(f)
whether any reservation of rights or controversy or coverage dispute exists
between you and the insurance company; and
(g)
the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the custodian of the policy.
 
                        Defendant
provided the following response:
            
Responding
Party, a municipality, runs a self-insured risk management program which has
excess coverage pursuant to Government Code Section 990.
 
            The
Court agrees that Defendant’s response is clearly incomplete, and the
information is discoverable. (See CCP § 2017.210.)
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response from Defendant
to her Form Interrogatories is granted.  The Court declines to award sanctions.
 
II.              
RFPs
 
Plaintiff
argues that good cause exists to compel Defendant to submit further responses
to RFP Nos. 11-11, 15-28, 31, 33-45, 47, 50, and 51.
 
After review,
the Court agrees in part.
 
RFP Nos. 1-11,15-25,
31, 33-36, 47, 50 and 51 pertain to Defendant Chester William’s employment and
personnel records. More specifically:
 
RFP No. 1
requests Williams’s personnel file. Plaintiff requested other documents related
to Williams’s employment, which may or may not be contained in a personnel
file: No. 2 (employment docs); No. 3 (informal / confidential personnel files);
No. 4 (background screenings); No. 5 (complaints during employment); No. 6
(complaints regardless of date); No. 7 (responses to complaints re: Williams);
No. 8 (investigations of misconduct); No. 9 (employment status); No. 10 (docs
to/from CCTC); No. 11 (CCTC investigations); No. 15 (Williams’s statements);
No. 16 (criminal investigative reports); No. 17 (performance reviews); No. 18
(student complaints); No. 19 (complaints by students’ parents); No. 20
(mandated reporter training); No. 21 (training harassment / misconduct); No. 22
(warnings); No. 23 (board meetings); No. 24 (disciplinary action); No. 25
(student teacher evaluations); No. 31 (investigative reports by agencies); No.
33 (docs to law enforcement); No. 35 (statements by admin / teachers); No. 36
(statements by students); No. 47 (correspondence w/ Williams re: sexual
misconduct); No. 50 (meetings re: complaints); and No. 51 (meetings with
Plaintiff’s parents re: Williams).
 
            In
opposition, Defendant objects to these requests, citing Defendant’s privacy
rights. Public employees have a legally protected right of privacy in their
personnel files and the information contained therein. (Teamsters Local 856
v. Priceless, LLC (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1512.) 
 
            However,
“a civil litigant’s right to discovery is broad” and statutes governing
discovery “must be construed liberally in favor of disclosure . . . .” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541; quoting Greyhound
Corporation v. Superior Court (1961) 58 Cal.2d 355, 377.) Moreover, a
public employee’s right to privacy is not inviolable, and may be intruded upon
where a compelling need and appropriate tailoring has been shown. (Teamsters,
supra, 112 Cal.App.4th at p. 1514.) 
 
Here,
William’s personnel file is central to Plaintiff’s sexual abuse case which
alleges that the District “knew or should have known of the dangerous
propensities of the employee who injured plaintiff” or that the District did
not take “reasonable measures to guard pupils against harassment and abuse from
foreseeable sources.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High Sch. Dist.
(2012) 53 Cal. 4th 861, 871, 878.) Indeed, as noted by Plaintiff, “[t]here is
no better evidence than Williams’s personnel file, including but not limited to
information pertaining to background checks performed on him, complaints made
against him, or the District’s investigations into him, for Plaintiff to prove
that the District was negligent in this regard.” (Motion, 5: 18-21.) As such,
Plaintiff’s interest in the file outweighs the privacy interest at stake here.
The Court finds William’s personnel file is discoverable, though the Court does
grant Defendant’s request that it be produced subject to a Protective Order. 
 
Moreover, in
opposition, Defendant agreed to provide further responses to RFP Nos. 39 and 43,
as for the years 1987 and 1988. The Court agrees this production reflects an
appropriate temporal scope. This leaves only Defendant’s arguments as to: (1)
RFP Nos. 26, 27,28,37, 38; (2) RFP Nos. 40-42; (3) RFP No. 44; and (4) RFP Nos.
45-46. 
 
As to RFP
Nos. 26, 27, 28, 37, 38, Defendant argues that “[t]he District has conducted a
diligent search and reasonable inquiry in an effort to comply, but have been
unable to locate Plaintiff C.J.’s records. This is what the responses set
forth. Accordingly, it is unclear what more Plaintiff wants. Plaintiff may not
like Defendant’s response, but Defendant submits that its response is proper
and code-compliant.” (Opp., 5: 2-5.)  The
Court agrees that Defendant’s response is sufficient. 
 
As to RFP
Nos. 40-42, Defendant argues that these requests are overbroad:
 
-        
Request No. 40 seeks, “Any and all
employee rosters or similar WRITINGS which contain, set forth, list, or
identify the names of administrators, teachers, coaches, employees, and/or
staff assigned to the SCHOOL 1982 through 1993.”
-        
Request No. 41 seeks “Any and all
DOCUMENTS showing the identity of YOUR superintendents during the TIME PERIOD.”
The TIME PERIOD is defined as January 1, 1982 through December 31, 1993.
-        
Request No. 42 seeks “All DOCUMENTS
identifying CHESTER WILLIAM’s supervisors and/or superiors between 1982 through
1993, inclusive.”
 
The Court
agrees. As for Request No. 40, this seeks each and every document, without
limitation, for 11 years (which actually encompasses 13 school years [1981-1982
through 1993-1994] that contains the name of a teacher, administrator, coach,
employee or staff member. Not only is such a request overly burdensome, but it is
also overly broad given that the alleged conduct took place in either 1987 or
1988. 
 
As for
Request No. 41, the scope of this request is so broad that “thousands (possibly
millions) of potential documents come within the purview of the request.”
(Opp., 5: 21-23.) For example, any correspondence District-wide identifying the
superintendent from 1982 and 1993 would fall within this request. The Court
limits the scope to the years of 1987 and 1988 and directs the party to meet
and confer as to an appropriate scope of documents narrower than “all”
documents. 
 
As for
Request No.42, the scope of this request is so broad that it would require
production of all documents for an 11-year period which named any
individual who was higher in LAUSD’s chain of command above a teacher level.
The Court accepts Defendant’s proposed scope of this request which limits it to
Principals and/or Assistant Principals (i.e., administrators) for the years of
1987 and 1988. 
 
As for
Request No.44, this seeks “[a] copy of each school yearbook for the SCHOOL from
1982 through 1993.” In response, Defendant indicated that they do not have
school yearbooks from 1982 to 1993. Plaintiff contends that this response is
silent as to whether the yearbooks were “destroyed, lost, etc.” Defendant is to
supplement its response to make it as complete as possible.
 
Finally, as
for Request Nos. 45-46, Request No. 45 requires reporting misconduct and No. 46
concerns employee handbooks. Defendant produced bate-stamped documentation in
response. The Court finds the responses to be code-compliant.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to her RFPs is
granted in part, denied in part, consistent with the ruling set forth above.
Accordingly, the Court declines to award sanctions at this time. 
 
 
 
It is so ordered.
