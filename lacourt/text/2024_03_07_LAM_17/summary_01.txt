And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to her Form Interrogatories is granted. The amended responses are due within 10 days. The judge also granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to her Requests for Production (RFPs) in part, denying it in part. The judge found that the defendant's responses to certain RFPs were incomplete and ordered the defendant to provide further responses. The judge also ordered the defendant to produce William's personnel file, subject to a protective order. The judge declined to award sanctions at this time. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing.
