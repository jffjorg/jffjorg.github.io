 Case Number:  23STCV02033    Hearing Date:   July 16, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
January 31, 2023, Plaintiff Jake Luker (“Plaintiff), a minor,
by and through his guardian ad litem Richard Stenlund, filed this action
against Defendants Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”), Austyn Chade
(“Chade”), Veronica Guinez (“Guinez”), and Does 1-50 for negligence, negligent
supervision of students, negligent hiring, training, supervision, and retention
of employees, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and assault and battery. 
On February
21, 2023, the Court appointed Richard Stenlund to serve as Plaintiff’s guardian
ad litem. 
On
March 27, 2023, LAUSD filed an answer. 
On
April 5, 2023, Guinez filed an answer on her own behalf and purportedly as
guardian ad litem for Chade. 
On December
26, 2023, the Court granted LAUSD’s motion for judgment on the pleadings on
Plaintiff’s claims for negligence, negligent supervision, and negligent hiring,
training, retention, and supervision with 30 days leave to amend. 
On January
23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against LAUSD, Chade,
Guinez, and Does 1-50 for negligence, negligent supervision of students,
negligent hiring, supervision, or retention of employees, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, and assault and battery. 
On
March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of partial settlement. 
On
June 27, 2024, Petitioner Richard
Stenlund (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for expedited approval of a minor’s
compromise.  On July 8, 2024, Petitioner
submitted another petition, which differs in several respects from the June 27,
2024 petition. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court for expedited approval of the compromise of the action of minor
Plaintiff Jake Luker. 
DISCUSSION 
Petitioner
has not withdrawn the petition filed on June 27, 2024 but instead submitted
another petition on July 8, 2024 which contains different information from the
petition filed on June 27, 2024.  Petitioner
has not stated which petition the Court should review and has not explained the
differences between the two petitions. 
In
particular, the June 27, 2024 petition lists the following treatment for
Plaintiff’s injuries: “LA-USC Medical Center, Psychiatrist, Psychotherapy.”  (Section 8.) 
 It also lists medical expenses of
$56,710 and states that Medi-Cal paid some or all of the medical expenses.  (Section 13.)  
The
July 8, 2024 petition, by contrast, lists no treatment (Section 8) and no
medical expenses.  (Section 13.)  It states that Medi-Cal paid no medical
expenses. 
The
Court cannot grant either petition without knowing which petition, if either,
is accurate. 
In
addition, a petition for expedited approval of a minor’s compromise does not
appear to be appropriate here.  California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5(a)(7), provides that when (as here) an action has
been filed on a claim, a petition for expedited approval is available only when
“(A) All defendants that have appeared in the action are participating in the
compromise; or (B) The court has finally determined that the settling parties
entered into the settlement in good faith.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5(a)(7).)  The proposed settlement involves only LAUSD
and Plaintiff, even though Guinez has also appeared in the action.  And the Court has made no good faith
settlement determination. 
The
Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Jake Luker’s action filed by Petitioner Richard Stenlund on June 27,
2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
