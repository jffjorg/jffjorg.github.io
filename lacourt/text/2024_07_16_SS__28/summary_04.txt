And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying a petition for expedited approval of a compromise of a minor's action. The petition was filed by Richard Stenlund, the guardian ad litem for the minor plaintiff, Jake Luker. The petition seeks to approve a settlement between the minor plaintiff and the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). However, the judge is denying the petition because the court cannot approve a petition without knowing which information is accurate. The two petitions filed by Stenlund contain different information about the minor plaintiff's injuries and medical expenses. Additionally, the judge notes that the settlement does not involve all defendants who have appeared in the action, and the court has not made a good faith settlement determination.
