PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Moving
Defendant asks the Court to compel Duet to appear for his deposition and to
impose sanctions on Duet. 
Duet
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. 
*
* *
 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
Moving
Defendant contends that Duet has repeatedly failed to attend his deposition,
requiring the Court’s intervention. 
In
his opposition, Duet admits that he did not attend depositions scheduled for
February 21, 2024 and March 12, 2024 because his medical and personal situation
deteriorated, he lost his housing, and he could not communicate with his
counsel.  The opposition states, “it is
believed that [Duet] is no longer capable physically or mentally/emotionally to
handle his personal and legal affairs.” 
(Opposition p. 6.)  Invoking the
doctrine of equitable tolling, Plaintiff asks the Court to deny the motion, to
give Plaintiff “time to regain the ability to prosecute his action,” and to
deny the request for sanctions. 
In a
supplemental declaration dated May 20, 2024, Duet’s counsel stated that
co-counsel located Duet at a hospital and the City has approved Duet for
housing.  Counsel anticipated that by “mid
to late June, [Duet] will be ready, willing and able to proceed with a
deposition and cooperate in the prosecution of the above-referenced matter.”  (Cheren dec. ¶ 9.)  The parties have not informed the Court if
Duet’s deposition took place in June. 
The
Court grants the motion and orders Duet to attend his deposition by August 15,
2024.  The Court denies Moving Defendant’s
request for sanctions, finding that imposition of sanctions against Duet would be
unjust. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant 1029 F&F Washington Property LLC’s
motion to compel Plaintiff David Duet to
attend his deposition.  The Court orders Plaintiff David Duet to
attend his deposition on a mutually agreeable date no later than August 15, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant 1029 F&F
Washington Property LLC’s request for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
