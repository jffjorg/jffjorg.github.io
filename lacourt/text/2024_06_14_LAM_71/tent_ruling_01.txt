 Case No.: 
  22STCV15931
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  June 14, 2024



 
Defendant
Moath Naser’s motion for an order dismissing this action on the grounds of
forum non conveniens is denied.
Defendant
Moath Naser’s motion in the alternative for an order staying this action is
denied.  
 
Defendant Moath Naser (“Naser”) (“Defendant”)
moves for an order dismissing this action on the grounds of forum non
conveniens.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2;
C.C.P. §410.30.)  Defendant moves in the
alternative for an order staying this action on the grounds that it is in the
interest of substantial justice that the action be heard in Illinois.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Background
Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc.
(“NCR”) (“Plaintiff”) filed its operative Complaint on May 12, 2022, alleging four
causes of action against Defendant: (1) common counts- open book account; (2) common
counts- goods sold and delivered; (3) account stated; and (4) violation of
Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (“PACA”).  Defendant filed his Answer in pro per
on December 27, 2022. 
Defendant filed the instant motion on May 1,
2024.  Plaintiff filed its opposition on
June 3, 2024.  Defendant filed its reply
on June 7, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
Even if the court has subject matter and
personal jurisdiction, it may stay or dismiss the action on the ground of
inconvenient forum.  (C.C.P. §418.10(a).)
If the
court finds that “in the interest of substantial justice” an action filed in
California should be adjudicated elsewhere, it may stay or dismiss the action
on such conditions as may be just.  (C.C.P.
§410.30(a).)
The
statute codifies the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens. This is not a
jurisdictional doctrine. Rather, it is “an equitable doctrine invoking the
discretionary power of a court to decline to exercise the jurisdiction [to stay
or dismiss] it has over a transitory cause of action when it believes that the
action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere.”  (Stangvik v. Shiley Inc. (1991) 54 Cal.3d
744, 751; In re Christopher B. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 551, 559.)
Defendant
bears the burden of proof, meaning defendant must provide the trial court with
sufficient evidence to enable it to carry out its weighing and balancing
analysis.  (National Football League
v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 902, 926-927, 933 n.15.)
Plaintiff’s
choice of forum will not be disturbed unless the court is convinced: (1) a
“suitable” alternative forum exists; and (2) the balance of private and public
interest factors makes it “just” that the litigation proceed in the alternative
forum.  (Stangvik, 54 Cal.3d 744,
751; Morris v. AGFA Corp. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1463.)
Where
plaintiff is a California resident for purposes of forum non conveniens, there
is a “strong presumption” in favor of plaintiff’s choice of forum. (See id.;
Stangvik, 54 Cal.3d 744, 754 [noting that factors underlying “strong
presumption” test apply only to residents of forum state].)
The
fact the defendant may have consented or submitted to California jurisdiction
does not prevent it from moving to stay or dismiss the action on forum non
conveniens grounds.  (Appalachian
Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 427, 440.)
 
Discussion
Defendant’s motion is denied.
Defendant
met his burden to demonstrate a suitable alternative forum exists.  Defendant sufficiently alleges Illinois has a
ten-year statute of limitations and has personal jurisdiction over Defendant
based on the fact that Plaintiff alleges Defendant is a resident of Illinois.  (Complaint ¶3.)
Nevertheless,
here, it is alleged the transactions between the parties were made and were to
be performed in California, since controlling law provides that where a
defendant’s breach is failure to pay for goods sold and delivered, the “place
of performance” is the place where payment was due, rather than where the goods
were delivered.  (Anaheim Extrusion
Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1201, 1203; Complaint ¶3.)
Plaintiff
alleges Defendant initiated the transactions at issue by ordering goods from a Los
Angeles-based supplier, Best Fresh Produce, for delivery to Illinois; the
purchases were all for business purposes rather than consumer consumption; the purchases
were regular and recurrent; title to the goods was taken in California; and the
value of the purchases was substantial. 
Under such facts the purchaser should have anticipated the possibility
of having to defend a suit in California.
          While Defendant met his burden on the
first prong of a motion for forum non conveniens, Defendants fails to meet his
burden on the second prong.  It would be
manifestly unjust to force Plaintiff’s assignor to file suit in Illinois to
recover payment from Defendant in this case, since Defendant is alleged to have
reached out to the California supplier and ordered the goods.  Best Fresh Produce is located in the downtown
Los Angeles produce market and sells to companies all over the United States.  It would be unfair to make Best Fresh Produce
and its witnesses travel to Illinois in this case and sue for payment there
simply because Defendant will be inconvenienced by having to appear for trial
in Los Angeles.  This is especially true
since the case has already been pending for over two years in California and is
scheduled for trial in July. 
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion and motion in the
alternative are denied. 
Moving Party to give notice.
