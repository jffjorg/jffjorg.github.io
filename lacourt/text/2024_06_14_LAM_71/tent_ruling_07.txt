 Hearing Date:  June 14, 2024



 
Plaintiff Itria Ventures, LLC’s
unopposed motion to strike pro per Defendant Forty General
Building Inc.’s answer to Plaintiff’s complaint
is denied.  
The
Court, sua sponte, strikes Defendant Forty General Building Inc.’s
answer to Plaintiff’s complaint, and enters default against Defendant Forty
General Building Inc.
 
Plaintiff Itria
Ventures, LLC (“Itria”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed to strike pro
per Defendant Forty General Building Inc.’s (“Forty General”) (“Defendant”)
answer to Plaintiff’s complaint on the ground that a corporation may not appear
in pro per.  (Notice of Motion, pgs.
1-2.)  Plaintiff also moves this Court
for an entry of Default against Defendant. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 1.)
 
          Background
Plaintiff filed its
operative Complaint on November 22, 2023, against Forty General, Jose Cuarenta
Jimenez (“Jimenez”), and Jesus Edgar Cuarenta (“Cuarenta”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
alleging four causes of action: (1) appointment of receiver; (2) preliminary
injunction; (3) breach of written contract; and (4) breach of written
guaranties.  On December 20, 2023,
Defendants filed their answer in pro per.  To date, no attorneys purport to represent
Defendants.  (See Decl. of King
Richards ¶8.)
On February 15,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. 
As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Motion to Strike
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §436 provides that the Court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to C.C.P. §435, or at any time within its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper, “[s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed
in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.”  (C.C.P. §436(b).)
 
Summary of Motion
Plaintiff moves to strike Forty General’s answer on the basis that
a corporation may not appear in pro per. 
(Motion Memo, pg. 4; see Merco Construction Engineers, Inc. v.
Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724.)
 
Motion to Strike
Plaintiff
argues a corporation cannot represent itself in a California court in pro per.
 (See Merco Construction Engineers,
Inc., 21 Cal.3d at pg. 730.)  However,
a motion to strike an answer must be filed within 10 days after the answer is
served.  (C.C.P. §§430.40(b),
435(b)(1).)  Plaintiff’s motion is
therefore untimely pursuant to C.C.P. §§430.40(b), 435(b)(1).
However,
pursuant to C.C.P. §436(b), this Court may “[s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed
in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.”
Here, Forty General is not currently represented by counsel. A
corporation cannot represent itself in a California court, either in pro per
or through an agent who is not an attorney.  (Bus. & Prof. Code §§6125 et seq.; see
Merco Construction Engineers, Inc., 21 Cal.3d at pg. 729.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to strike is denied.  This Court, sua sponte, strikes Forty
General’s answer as not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state.
 
Entry of Default
If a defendant fails to answer after a motion to strike its answer
is granted, it is as if the defendant failed to answer.  (C.C.P. §586(a)(7).)  If a defendant fails to answer the complaint,
a court shall enter the default of the defendant.  (C.C.P. §585(a).)
A court has the discretion to enter a corporation’s default for
nonappearance if that corporation is without representation of a licensed
attorney.  (See Van Gundy v. Camelot
Resorts, Inc. (1983) 152 Cal.App.3d Supp 29, 32.)
Here, Forty General is unable to take any action in this matter,
including responding to the complaint, because they are not represented by a
licensed attorney admitted to practice before this Court.
Accordingly, this Court enters default against Forty General.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to strike is denied.
The Court, sua sponte, Strikes Forty General’s Answer and
enters default against Forty General.
Moving Party to give notice.
