Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied defendant Moath Naser's motion to dismiss the action on the grounds of forum non conveniens. The judge found that defendant met his burden to demonstrate a suitable alternative forum exists, but failed to meet his burden on the second prong of the motion. The judge concluded that it would be manifestly unjust to force plaintiff's assignor to file suit in Illinois to recover payment from defendant in this case, since defendant initiated the transactions at issue by ordering goods from a Los Angeles-based supplier for delivery to Illinois.
