Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.)   To be enforceable under Code Civ Proc., section 664.6, any written settlement agreement outside of court must be signed by the parties and their counsel. Although the Court may adjudicate disputes over the terms of the settlement agreement, the Court may not modify terms from what was agreed to by the parties. (Machado v. Myers (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 779, 797.)DiscussionPlaintiff moves to enforce settlement under Code Civ. Proc., section 664.6.Plaintiff provides the parties’ settlement agreement, which provides that Defendant agreed to pay $15,000 in two payments in April and May 2024. (Motion, Exh. A.) In exchange, Plaintiff and Defendants would release one another from all claims, obligations, or liabilities arising from this suit. (Id.) The agreement contains a clause stating the Court will maintain jurisdiction over this case pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., section 664.6. (Id.) Emails between Defendant and Plaintiff’s counsel show Defendant failed to make payment and thereafter failed to respond to Plaintiff’s counsel’s communications. (Motion, Exh. B; Chow Decl., ¶5.)Plaintiff’s motion to enforce settlement and enter judgment against Defendant is granted because Defendant failed to perform under the settlement agreement. Additionally, the motion is unopposed. That lack of an opposition amounts to a concession that the motion is meritorious. (See California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1320(f); Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20 (the party who fails to argue an issue abandons that issue).)The Court will enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’ settlement agreement.ConclusionThe motion to enforce settlement filed by Plaintiff RNN National, LLC is GRANTED.
