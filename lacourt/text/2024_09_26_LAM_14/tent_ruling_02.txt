 Case Number:  21STCV24699    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  14 #8Case Background
This is an action for breach of the implied warranty of
habitability, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, negligence, breach of
contract, and nuisance. Plaintiffs allege that they leased an apartment from
Defendant which was untenantable.
On July 1, 2021, Plaintiffs Dolores Guerrero, Lidia
Cruz Guerrero, Dolores Guerrero, and Shecid Cruz filed their Complaint against
Pauline Yip.
On April 28, 2023, the Court signed the parties’
stipulation consolidating this case with 21STCV10950 and 22STCV09284.
On July 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this petition to
confirm minor’s compromise.
On August 13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of
settlement.
Instant Pleading
Petitioner Dolores Guerrero petitions to confirm the
minor’s compromise of Lidia Guerrero.
Decision
The petition to confirm the minor’s compromise of Lidia
Guerrero filed by Petitioner Dolores Guerrero is DENIED without prejudice.
Discussion
This petition was not filed in the lead case. Because
these cases are consolidated, any new filings must be filed in the lead case,
21STCV01950.
The petition for minor’s compromise contains the
following deficiencies:
1.     Form
MC-350 states Lidia Guerrero is an adult with a disability. However, form
MC-351 states Lidia is a minor. Petitioner must check boxes 3b and 3b1 on form
MC-351 to indicate that Lidia is an adult with a disability.
2.     Petitioner
selected box 18b5 on form MC-350. However, Lidia Guerrero is not a minor.
Probate Code, sections 3401-3402 only governs money belonging to minors.
Petitioner must select one of the other available options under Item 18b and
revise form MC-351 to reflect the change.
3.     Item
11b3 of form MC-350 is incorrect. Petitioner does not have a claim against
claimant’s recovery. Petitioner must check the “does not have” box.
The court also notes that Plaintiff Shecid Cruz is a
minor who is receiving money under the settlement agreement and there is no
petition to confirm minor’s compromise pending as to Shecid Cruz. Plaintiffs
must file a petition for Shecid Cruz in the lead case before this case can be
dismissed.
Conclusion
The petition to confirm the minor’s compromise of Lidia
Guerrero filed by Petitioner Dolores Guerrero is DENIED without prejudice.
