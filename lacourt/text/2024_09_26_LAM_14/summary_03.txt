And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and enter judgment against the defendant. The agreement, signed by both parties, requires the defendant to pay $15,000 in two installments in April and May 2024. The defendant failed to make the payments and failed to respond to the plaintiff's counsel's communications. As the settlement agreement is unopposed and the defendant has failed to perform under its terms, the court will enter judgment in accordance with the settlement agreement. The plaintiff is required to file a proposed judgment within 15 days of this order.
