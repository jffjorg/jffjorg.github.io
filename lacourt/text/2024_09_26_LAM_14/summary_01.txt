And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, sustaining the defendant's demurrer. The plaintiff, Jerome Eady, filed a lawsuit against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, alleging negligence, loss of consortium, personal injury, emotional distress, and vicarious liability. However, the judge ruled that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred under California Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1, which requires that actions for injury or death caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another be brought within two years. Since the collision occurred on April 5, 2022, and the plaintiff did not file his complaint until May 22, 2024, more than two years later, the judge declined to reach the defendant's remaining arguments and instead gave the plaintiff 15 days to amend his complaint.
