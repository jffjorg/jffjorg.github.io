And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to confirm the minor's compromise of Lidia Guerrero filed by Petitioner Dolores Guerrero. The petition contains several deficiencies, including incorrect form, incorrect options, and failure to file in the lead case. Specifically, the petition incorrectly indicates that Lidia Guerrero is a minor when she is actually an adult with a disability, and it does not select the correct options on the form. Additionally, the petition does not indicate that Dolores Guerrero does not have a claim against the claimant's recovery. The court notes that the petition was not filed in the lead case, and that a separate petition must be filed for Shecid Cruz, who is also a minor receiving money under the settlement agreement. The petition is denied without prejudice, and the parties are given an opportunity to revise and refile the petition.
