  Case Number:  21STCV12906    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  14 #12Case Background
This is an action for negligence, loss of consortium,
personal injury, emotional distress, and vicarious liability. Plaintiff alleges
that in April 2022, Plaintiff suffered severe injuries after a vehicle driven
by an employee of Defendant collided with his vehicle.
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff Jerome Eady filed his
Complaint against Defendant the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
On July 29, 2024, Defendant filed this demurrer.
Instant Pleading
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s Complaint.
Decision
Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED. Plaintiff has 15
days’ leave to amend.
Discussion
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claims are
time-barred under Code Civ. Proc., section 335.1, which provides that actions
for assault, batter, injury, or death of an individual caused by the wrongful
act or neglect of another must be brought within two years. Here, the Complaint
alleges that the subjection collision took place on April 5, 2022. (Compl.,
¶5.) Plaintiff did not file his Complaint until May 22, 2024, more than two
years after he sustained his injuries. Therefore, Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant
are time-barred. The demurrer is sustained. The Court declines to reach
Defendant’s remaining arguments for uncertainty.
Conclusion
Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED. Plaintiff has 15
days’ leave to amend.
