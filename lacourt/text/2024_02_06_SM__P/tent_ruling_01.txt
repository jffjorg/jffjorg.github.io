  Case Number:  19SMCV01908    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling 
Gary Stiffelman v.
Stuart Rubin, et al., Case No. 19SMCV01908
Hearing date February
6, 2024
Counsel for Defendant
Stuart Rubin’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (Atty. Handfinger)
 
Adam P. Handfinger,
counsel for defendant Stuart Rubin, brings a motion to be relieved as counsel.
The motion is unopposed.
 
The court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.
 
Counsel Handfinger
seeks withdrawal based on irreconcilable differences. Counsel filed the
mandatory forms and served Stuart Rubin at his last known address confirmed by
mail, return receipt requested. There is no opposition. Trial is scheduled on
9/9/24, so Rubin has ample time to find new counsel, should he choose to do so.
GRANTED.
