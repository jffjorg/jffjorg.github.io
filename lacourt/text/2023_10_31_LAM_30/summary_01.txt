And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment against the defendant, Dong Hwan Lee, in an action for unlawful detainer. The plaintiffs, William P. Wolfe, Maureen F. Binder, and Therese Holz, claim that the defendant has failed to pay rent for a commercial property located at 222 N. Western Ave., Los Angeles, CA. The defendant has asserted an affirmative defense under the COVID-19 Relief Act, claiming that the plaintiffs intimidated and pressured him for rent during the moratorium period. However, the court finds that the COVID rental payment and eviction protections do not apply in this case since the unpaid rent was accrued in February 2023. The court has granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, concluding that there is no triable issue of material fact and that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
