Wolfe, et. al. vs. Lee, et. al., Case No. 23STUD03108
 
Tentative Ruling re:  Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment
 
Plaintiffs William P. Wolfe, Maureen F. Binder, and Therese
Holz (collectively, Plaintiffs) move for summary judgment against Defendant
Dong Hwan Lee (Defendant). The motion is granted.
 
In an action for
unlawful detainer, “[a] motion for summary judgment may be made at any time
after the answer is filed upon giving five days notice. Summary judgment shall
be granted or denied on the same basis as a motion under Section 437c.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1170.7.)
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party can
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and if not to enable an order
of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 (Atlantic
Richfield).) Code of Civil Procedure Section 437c, subdivision (c)
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor
Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the
moving party must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to
negate an essential element, or to establish a defense. (Code Civ. Proc, §
437c, subd. (p)(2).) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.”  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) Once the moving party has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Plaintiffs filed this action for
unlawful detainer against Defendant on March 24, 2023, based on Defendants’
nonpayment of rent for the commercial property located at 222 N. Western Ave.,
Los Angeles, CA. (Comp. ¶ 3.) Defendant agreed to lease the premises from
Plaintiffs beginning on September 1, 2019, for 10 years at $9,500 monthly rent
(later changed to $10,381 per month). (Comp. ¶ 6.) The 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent
or Quit was served on February 15, 2023, and asserts that Defendant owed rent
in the amount of $10,381. (Comp. ¶¶ 9-10, Ex. 2 [15].)
 
Anne Angelico, Plaintiffs’
Property Manager, states that Defendant has still failed to tender payment as
of October 24, 2023. (Angelico Decl. ¶ 10.) Defendant continues to occupy the property.
(Angelico Decl. ¶ 11.)
Defendant has asserted an
affirmative defense under the COVID-19 Relief Act (“The COVID-19 Relief Act was
violated as the Plaintiff intimidated and pressured for rent during moratorium
which violates county regulations.”). (Comp. ¶ 3(w).) Section 49.99.3 of the
Los Angeles Municipal Code prohibited eviction of commercial tenants during the
COVID-19 Local Emergency Period and three months thereafter. (RJN, Ex. 1 [7].)
Ordinance No. 187736, passed January 20, 2023, repealed Section 49.99.3. (RJN,
Ex. 2 [12].) Plaintiffs argue that the COVID rental payment and eviction
protections do not apply here because the unpaid rent was accrued in February
2023. The Court agrees.  Accordingly,
summary judgment is granted.
