  - The Court concurs that the facts failed to allege "outrageous" conduct as a matter of law.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) and has reached the following conclusions:

1. The first cause of action, which alleges sexual harassment under Civil Code § 51.9, is sustained without leave to amend. The Court finds that the pled facts do not show an inherent power imbalance where Vardi is uniquely situated to exercise coercion or leverage over Beischl.
2. The second cause of action, which alleges a violation of CCP § 527.6, is overruled. The Court finds that the FACC alleges a claim of assault and that Beischl reasonably believed she was about to be touched in a harmful or offensive manner.
3. The third cause of action, which alleges assault, is overruled. The Court finds that the FACC alleges each element of assault as a matter of fact and that Vardi acted with intent to cause harmful or offensive contact.
4. The fourth cause of action, which alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress, is sustained. The Court finds that the FACC fails to allege "outrageous" conduct as a matter of law and that the alleged facts do not demonstrate a reasonable probability of successful amendment.

The Court has ordered the parties to file a revised answer within 20 days.
