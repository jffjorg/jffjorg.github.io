And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash deposition subpoenas issued by the defendant to obtain confidential medical and psychological records from the plaintiff, John Doe. The records sought include information about Doe's prior families and their personal history, his biological parents and their personal history, potential criminal information of third parties, and medical and psychological information of Doe and third parties. The plaintiff argues that the subpoenas are overly broad and threaten his privacy, while the defendant argues that the records are directly relevant to the case and necessary for its defense.

The judge finds that Doe has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his medical and psychological records and that the defendant has the burden to establish that the records are directly relevant and cannot be discovered by less intrusive means. The judge also finds that the records are relevant to Doe's claims of psychological and emotional damages and necessary for the defendant's defense.

The judge grants the motion in part and modifies the subpoenas to limit production to records from August 2019 to the present. The judge also requires the parties to enter into a standard stipulated protective order to cover the disclosure and handling of confidential information during discovery.
