Summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The Court finds that the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the defendants is valid and that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the agreement. The Court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable, despite the plaintiff's arguments that it is an adhesion contract and lacks mutuality. The Court concludes that the plaintiff has failed to meet her burden in establishing that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable.
