I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Sammetra
Daniels initiated this action on March 19, 2024 against Defendants California Institute of Arts &
Technology (CIAT) and Flavio De Oliveira (collectively Defendants) alleging the
following claims: (1) Discrimination on the Basis of Sex/Gender, Including
Pregnancy, in Violation of FEHA; (2) Harassment on the Basis of Sex/Gender,
Including Pregnancy, in Violation of FEHA; (3) Retaliation for Complaining of
Discrimination and/or Harassment on the Basis of Sex/Gender, Including
Pregnancy, in Violation of FEHA; (4) Failure to Provide Reasonable
Accommodations in Violation of FEHA; (5) Failure to Engage in the Interactive
Process; (6) Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation in
Violation of FEHA; (7) Failure to Grant Pregnancy Disability Leave in Violation
of Pregnancy Disability Leave Law; (8) Failure to Provide Reasonable
Accommodations in Violation of the Pregnancy Disability Leave Law; (9)
Interference with Restraint, and Denial of Pregnancy Disability Leave in
Violation of the Pregnancy Disability Leave Law; (10) Retaliation in Violation
of the Pregnancy Disability Leave Law; (11) Violation of Labor Code § 1102.5;
(12) Wrongful Termination of Employment in Violation of Public Policy (Labor
Code § 1102.5, FEHA); (13) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff was employed by CIAT on July 10,
2023 as an Admissions Advisor where she worked remotely. Prior to starting her
employment, Plaintiff learned that she was pregnant in January 2023 and would
be due in September 2023. Plaintiff disclosed that she was pregnant on July 17,
2023 with her direct supervisor during a one-on-one meeting. Because there was
uncertainty surrounding her leave, Plaintiff was allegedly stressed during the
process. During her maternity leave, Plaintiff’s doctor completed the Certification
of Health Care Provider for Employee Return to Work indicating that Plaintiff
was unable to work from September 6, 2023 to January 3, 2023. However, this
certificate had yet to be approved by the hospital’s disability office.
Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, the certificate was completed by November 20, 2023
but had yet to be uploaded. Plaintiff discovered this on December 4, 2024 and
instructed the hospital to fax the certificate to CIAT. Thereafter, Defendants
demanded Plaintiff to return to work by December 11, 2023 based on the claim
that Plaintiff was no longer disabled. Ultimately, Plaintiff was terminated on
December 14, 2023.
B. Motion Before the
Court
On June 24, 2024, Defendants filed their notice of motion to
compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims and to stay this action pending the
outcome of arbitration. Thereafter, on July 2, 2024, Defendants filed their
moving papers. Defendants bring their motion pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA) or to the California Arbitration Act (CAA), and pursuant
to an alleged agreement between Plaintiff and CIAT, allowing Defendants to
invoke the purported arbitration clause.
On July 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the instant motion.
On July 12, 2024, Defendants filed a reply to Plaintiffs’ opposition.
Defendants’ motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Compel Arbitration:
GRANTED.
A.
Legal Standard
The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), while a federal
statute, applies in California courts and requires state courts to enforce
arbitration agreements as required by the federal common law developed under
the FAA. (See Southland Corp. v. Keating (1984) 465 U.S. 1, 15-16 (Southland
Corp.); Broughton v. Cigna Healthplans (1999) 21 Cal.4th 1066,
1074-78, superseded by statute on another ground as stated in Ferguson v.
Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (9th Cir. 2013) 733 F.3d 928, 937.).) The FAA
preempts and invalidates state law and state judicial decisions that disfavor
arbitration or require arbitration provisions to pass higher scrutiny. (Southland
Corp., supra, at p. 12; Perry v. Thomas (1987) 482 U.S. 483,
490.) If the parties designate the FAA applies, then California arbitration law
is preempted. (See, e.g., Rodriguez v. American Techs., Inc. (2006) 136
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1121-1122.) However, courts have found that where the
FAA is found not to apply, the California Arbitration Act (Code Civ. Proc. §
1280 et seq.) applies. (See Valencia v. Smyth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th
153, 178 (Valencia).)
 A court’s inquiry is limited to a
determination of (1) whether a valid arbitration agreement exists and (2)
whether the arbitration agreement covers the dispute. (9 U.S.C. § 4; Chiron
Corp. v. Ortho Diagnostics Systems, Inc. (9th Cir. 2000) 207 F.3d 1126,
1130; Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (2002) 537 U.S. 79, 84; see Simula,
Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc. (9th Cir. 1999) 175 F.3d 716, 720 [if the finding is
affirmative on both counts the FAA requires the Court to enforce the
arbitration agreement in accordance with its terms]; see Omar v. Ralphs
Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961 [In determining the
enforceability of an arbitration agreement, the court first considers “two
‘gateway issues’ of arbitrability: (1) whether there was an agreement to
arbitrate between the parties, and (2) whether the agreement covered the
dispute at issue”] Lacayo v. Cataline Restaurant Group Inc. (2019) 38
Cal.App.5th 244, 257 (Lacayo) [Where moving party meets initial burden,
“the party opposing arbitration must prove by a preponderance of the evidence
any defense to the petition”].)
“An order to arbitrate the particular
grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance
that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers
the asserted dispute.” (United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf
Navigation Co. (1960) 363 U.S. 574, 582-583.) 
 Moreover, the general rule is that the
FAA governs all agreements to arbitrate in contracts “involving interstate
commerce.” (Higgins v. Superior Court (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1238,
1247.) The term “involving” commerce “is broad and is indeed the functional
equivalent of “affecting’ commerce.” (Allied-Bruce Terminix Companies, Inc.
v. Dobson (1995) 513 U.S. 265, 273-274.) The U.S. Supreme Court has held
that this broad interpretation includes employment contracts. (See Circuit
City Stores v. Adams (2001) 532 U.S. 105, 106.) The defendant bears the
burden of proving applicability of the FAA by showing that its activities
constitute interstate commerce. (Hoover v. Am. Income Life Ins. Co.
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1207.) Failure to demonstrate that the employment
agreement affects interstate commerce renders the FAA inapplicable. (See Lane
v. Francis Capital Management LLC (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 676, 687-688 (Lane);
Woolls v. Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 197, 212.)
Even where the FAA governs the
interpretation of arbitration clauses, California law governs whether an
arbitration agreement has been formed in the first instance. (Baker v.
Osborne Development Corp. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 884, 893.) 
 

B.
Analysis
1. Whether There is An Agreement to
Arbitrate Between the Parties
a. Relevant Law
“Parties
are not required to arbitrate their disagreements unless they have agreed to do
so. [Citation.] A contract to arbitrate will not be inferred absent a ‘clear
agreement.’ [Citation.] When determining whether a valid contract to arbitrate
exists, we apply ordinary state law principles that govern contract formation.
[Citation] In California, a ‘clear agreement’ to arbitrate may be either
express or implied in fact. [Citation.]” (Davis v. Nordstrom, Inc. (9th
Cir. 2014) 755 F.3d 1089, 1092-93 [applying California law].) The court is only
required to make a finding of the agreement’s existence, not an evidentiary
determination of its validity. (Condee v. Longwood Management Corp.
(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 219.)
b. Court’s Determination
Here,
the Court finds in Defendants’ favor on this issue because sufficient evidence
has been submitted to show that agreement to arbitrate exists between the
parties.
The
burden of persuasion is always on the moving party to prove the existence of an
arbitration agreement with the opposing party by a preponderance of the
evidence. (Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th
158, 164-165 (Gamboa), citations omitted.) However, the burden of
production may shift in a three-step process. (Id. at p. 165.) First,
the moving party bears the burden of producing prima facie evidence of a
written agreement to arbitrate the controversy, which can be met by the moving
party by attaching a copy of the arbitration agreement purporting to bear the
opposing party’s signature. (Ibid., citations omitted.) If this burden
is met, the burden shifts to the opposing party to produce evidence to
challenge the authenticity of the agreement, which can be met by “testify[ing]
under oath or declar[ing] under penalty of perjury that the party never saw or
does not remember seeing the agreement, or that the party never signed or does
not remember signing the agreement.” (Ibid., citations omitted.) If the
opposing party meets its burden of producing evidence, then in the third step,
the moving party must establish with admissible evidence a valid arbitration
agreement between the parties. (Ibid.) The burden of proving the
agreement by a preponderance of the evidence remains with the moving party. (Id.
at pp. 165-166, citations omitted.) 
Here,
Defendants have met their initial burden of production by producing a copy of
the arbitration agreement, as purportedly electronically signed by Plaintiff
via DropBox Sign on June 26, 2023. (Mot., de Oliveira Decl. ¶¶ 2-3, Exh. 1.) 
In
turn, Plaintiff meets her responsive burden of production by proving a sworn
declaration indicating that she does not recall signing the June 26, 2023
arbitration agreement during her onboarding process. (Oppn, Daniels Decl. ¶¶
3-4.)
Thus, Defendants
must show by a preponderance of the evidence that a valid arbitration agreement
exists between the parties. (Gamboa, supra, 72 Cal.App.5th at pp.
165-166.) 
The
primary dispute between the parties is whether the electronic signature
attributed to Plaintiff on the June 26, 2023 arbitration agreement is properly
verified. California case law has held that an electronic signature was
properly authenticated when a declarant “detailed [the company’s] security
precautions regarding transmission and use of an applicant’s unique username
and password, as well as the steps an applicant would have to take to place his
or her name on the signature line of the employment agreement …,” such that,
“[b]ased on this procedure, [the declarant] concluded that the ‘name [of the
employee] could have only been placed on the signature pages of the employment
agreement … by someone using [the employee’s] unique user name and password,’”
and that “ [g]iven this process for signing documents and protecting the
privacy of the information with unique and private user names and passwords,
the electronic signature was made by [the employee] on the employment agreement
… at the date, time, and IP address listed on the documents.” (Espejo v.
Southern California Permanente Medical Group (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1047,
1062 (Espejo).)
Here,
Defendant’s security precautions for signatures on CIAT’s arbitration agreement
are set out in Defendant Flavio De Oliveira’s supplemental declaration. It is
stated that CIAT securely transmits new employee onboarding documents, which
includes the arbitration agreement, to the prospective employee’s personal
email address, and no other individual would have received this email. (Reply,
Suppl. De Oliveira Decl. at ¶¶ 2-3.) In this case, Plaintiff’s onboarding
documents were sent to her personal email at sd3844@nyu.edu on June 26, 2024 at
a.m. PDT. (Ibid., Exhs. A-B.) De Oliveira further states that Plaintiff
used the aforementioned email to correspond with CIAT employees prior to her
employment with CIAT. (Id. at ¶ 7, Exh. E.) In addition to the
arbitration agreement, Plaintiff had been sent nine other onboarding documents
via DropBox Sign, and according to DropBox Sign’s Audit Trail, it indicates
that Plaintiff viewed the onboarding documents at 10:13 a.m. PDT before
executing all the documents at 3:37 p.m. PDT. (Id. at ¶¶ 5-6, Exhs.
5-6.) While Plaintiff contends that she does not recall signing the June 26,
2024, she does not repudiate going through the onboarding process via DropBox
Sign. Therefore, the Court finds that these circumstances are different from
those in Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc. because Defendants have
provided sufficient evidence to authenticate Plaintiff’s electronic signature.
Moreover, Plaintiff’s contention that anyone could have accessed her email is
unsupported by the evidence, as Plaintiff’s declaration is silent on this
issue. 

Accordingly, the Court finds that
an arbitration agreement exists between the parties.
 
2. FAA Applies
            The Court
notes that the applicable legal standards are those related to the Federal
Arbitration Act, as provided by the June 26, 2024, arbitration agreement.
(Mot., De Oliveira Decl., Exh. 1.) Plaintiff challenge the interstate commerce
arguments in the moving papers on the ground that she completed work for CIAT
only in California. (Oppn. at 10; Daniels Decl. ¶¶ 2, 5.) However, this
argument is not persuasive. As indicated by Defendants’ moving papers, CIAT’s
business affects interstate commerce because (1) it has students throughout the
United States; (2) faculty, employees, and students use U.S. Mail, the internet
and other modes of interstate commerce to correspond with CIAT; and (3)
students pay fees with checks in the mail and through electronic payments.
(Mot. at pp. 3-4; Park Decl. ¶ 2.) Regardless, even if the FAA did not apply,
California law has a strong policy towards arbitration. (Pac. Invest. Co. v.
Townsend (1976) 58 Cal. App. 3d 1, 9.) The California Arbitration Act would
still apply.
 
                        3.
Whether the Arbitration Agreement is Unconscionable 
                        a.
Relevant Law
In Armendariz,
the California Supreme Court stated that when determining whether an
arbitration agreement was unconscionable, there is both a procedural and a
substantive element. (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Service, Inc.
(2000) 24 Cal.4th 82, 114 (Armendariz)).¿¿ “The party resisting arbitration bears the
burden of proving unconscionability.”   (Pinnacle
Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Dev. (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223,
247.)
“Procedural unconscionability pertains to the
making of the agreement; it focuses on the oppression that arises from unequal
bargaining power and the surprise to the weaker party that results from hidden
terms or the lack of informed choice.”  (Ajamian v. CantorCO2e,
L.P. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 771, 795.) Oppression is an “inequality of bargaining power, when one
party has no real power to negotiate or a meaningful choice. Surprise occurs
when the allegedly unconscionable provision is hidden.” (Carmona v. Lincoln
Millennium Car Wash, Inc.¿(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 74, 84 (Carmona).) Arbitration clauses are often found in
adhesion contracts (standardized contracts drafted by a party of superior
bargaining power and presented to the weaker party on a take-it-or-leave-it
basis).  (See, e.g., Armendariz, supra, 24 Cal.4th at
113-114.)
“Substantive unconscionability pertains to the
fairness of an agreement's actual terms and to assessments of whether they are
overly harsh or one-sided.” (Carmona, supra, at p. 85). There are five
minimum substantive requirements to an enforceable arbitration agreement: (1)
neutral arbitrators, (2) more than minimal discovery, (3) written award
sufficient for judicial review, (4) all types of relief otherwise available in
court, and (5) no unreasonable costs or fees as a condition of access. (Armendariz,
supra, at p.102.) When there is little procedural unconscionability, a
party opposing arbitration must show substantial substantive unconscionability.
(Id. at 114.) 
                        b.
Court’s Determination
            Here, the
Court finds in Defendants’ favor on this issue because the arbitration
agreement is not unconscionable.
            Plaintiff
first argues that the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable
because it is an adhesion contract. (Oppn. at pg. 8.) However, the fact an adhesion contract is involved does
not per se render the arbitration provision unenforceable because
such contracts are “an inevitable fact of life for all
citizens—businessman and consumer alike.” (Graham v. Scissor-Tail, Inc.¿(1981)
28 Cal.3d 807, 817.) Therefore, the agreement is minimally procedurally
unconscionable as an adhesion contract.
            Second, Plaintiff argues that the
arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable because it lacks
mutuality as it does not include what claims are covered by the employer
against the employee. (Oppn. at pp. 8-9.) However, this argument is not persuasive
because the arbitration agreement expressly states that “[t]he Company and I
each specifically waive and relinquish our respective rights to bring a claim
against the other in court, and this waiver will be equally binding on any
person who represents or seeks to represent me or the Company in a lawsuit
against the other in court. (See Mot., De Oliveira Decl., Ex. 1.) Also, the
scope of the arbitration agreement covers any claims or disputes either party
has against the other that arises from or related to Plaintiff’s employment. (Ibid.)
The contract does not, for example, exclude from arbitration the kinds of
claims that would likely be brought by an employer, while including claims that
would likely be brought by an employee. (Cf. Mercuro v. Superior Court
(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 167, 176.) As such, the arbitration clause here does not lack
mutuality.
            No other arguments for substantive
unconscionability have been made.
            Therefore, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden in establishing that the arbitration
agreement is unconscionable.
III. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Defendants California Institute Of Arts &
Technology, Inc. and Flavio De Oliveira’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay
Proceedings is GRANTED.
