  CASE NO.: 21STCV33381
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO STIKE PORTIONS OF CARING HEART
  IN-HOME CARE SERVICES, INC.’S SECOND AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT
 
Date: May 16, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Cross-Defendant,
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London (“Underwriters”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Cross-Complainant
Caring Heart In-Home Care Services (“Caring Heart”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from alleged
misconduct by Plaintiff’s home-care providers. Plaintiff’s
complaint (the
“Complaint”) alleges: (1) breach of contract; (2) negligence; (3) elder abuse –
financial abuse;
and (4) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
On
January 5, 2024, Underwriters filed a demurrer to Caring Heart’s First Amended
Cross-Complaint (“FAXC”). The Court sustained the demurrer as to the third
cause of action of the FAXC without leave to amend on the ground that it failed
to allege the existence of a fiduciary relationship. 
 
The
currently operative second amended cross-complaint of Caring Heart (the “SAXC”)
alleges: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing; (3) declaratory relief; and (4) fraud.
 
On
March 27, 2024, Underwriters filed the instant motion to strike portions of the
SAXC (the “Motion”).
  
DISCUSSION
Underwriters
moves to strike portions of the SAXC that it claims exceed the scope of the
Court’s February 9, 2024 Order on Underwriters’ Demurrer and Motion to Strike
Caring Heart’s FXCC. 
 
However,
on May 8, 2024, the Court stayed the action on the SAXC pending the outcome of
the underlying action after granting Underwriters’ motion to sever. 
 
Accordingly,
the action on the SAXC is stayed and the Motion SAXC cannot be heard at this
time. As such, the motion is taken OFF-CALENDAR pursuant to the stay.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 16th day of May 2024
