JUDICIAL NOTICE 
Plaintiffs request
judicial notice of 16 orders approving awards of attorneys’ fees in other,
unrelated lemon law cases in both California and federal court. These orders
are not relevant to the question of whether the award of fees and costs sought
in this case is proper. Accordingly, plaintiffs’ requests for judicial notice
are DENIED.  (Gbur v. Cohen (1979) 93
Cal.App.3d 296, 301 [[J]udicial notice … is always confined to those matters
which are relevant to the issue at hand.”].) 
DISCUSSION
Attorneys’
fees are allowed as costs when authorized by contract, statute or law. (Code
Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B).) 
 
In a lemon law action, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, may
be recovered by a prevailing buyer under the Song-Beverly Act.  Civ. Code, § 1794 provides:
 
If the buyer prevails in an action under this
section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.
 
The attorney claiming fees bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).) This
burden requires competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services
rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986)
182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) “Testimony of an attorney as to the number of hours
worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of
attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” (Id.) 

 
In
determining a reasonable attorneys’ fee, the trial court begins with the
lodestar, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.  (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.
(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36.)  The
lodestar may then be adjusted based on factors specific to the case in order to
fix the fee at the fair market value of the legal services provided.  (Ibid.)  These facts include (1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.  (Ibid.)
Here, Plaintiffs move for an award
of attorneys’ fees in the amount of $185,990.67, consisting of (1) $123,048 in
attorneys’ fees for Strategic Legal Practices, APC (“SLP”), (2) a 1.35
multiplier enhancement on the attorneys’ fees ($43,066.80), (3) $16,375.87 in
costs and expenses for SLP; and (4) an additional $3,500 in fees for reviewing
the opposition, drafting a reply, and attending the hearing on this
motion.  
            A. Entitlement to Attorneys’ Fees
Plaintiffs
contend that they are the prevailing party in this action because of a signed
998 offer in which Defendant ultimately agreed to settle this case.  The Court agrees and Defendant does not
dispute this.  Plaintiffs are the
prevailing party in this action entitled to a reasonable amount of attorneys’
fees.
 
B. Reasonableness of Fees
i.              
Reasonable Hourly Rate
“The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for
similar work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [“The
experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services
rendered in [her] court.”].) 
 
Plaintiffs seeks to recover attorneys’ fees for 15 different attorneys
who worked on the case. Their hourly rates are as follows:
(1)
Neal Butala: 2021 rate of $460/hr; (2) Sean Crandall: 2020 rate of $410/hr; (3)
Kris Coombs: 2021 rate of $325/hr; (4) James Doddy: 2021 rate of $595/hr; (5)
Tionna Dolin: 2021 rate of $450/hr and 2023 partner rate of $570/hr; (6) Evan
Greene: 2019 rate of $395/hr; (7) Christine Haw: 2021 rate of $465/hr, 2022
rate of $490/hr, and 2023 rate of $500/hr; (8) Breita Linnell: 2023 rate of
$525/hr; (9) Matthew Pardo: 2019 rate of $335/hr, 2021 rate of $390/hr, 2022
rate of $410/hr, and 2023 rate of $435/hr; (10) Debora Rabieian: 2021 rate of
$395/hr; (11) Gregory Sogoyan: 2021 rate of $395/hr; (12) Rabiya Tirmizi: 2023
rate of $375/hr; (13) Oliver Tomas: 2021 rate of $595/hr; (14) Kyle Tracy: 2019
rate of $445/hr and 2020 rate of $450/hr; and (15) Greg Yu: 2023 rate of
$625/hr. 
For each of the attorneys, attorney Payam Shahian attests to their legal
experience and the reasonableness of their rates. (Shahian Decl. ¶ ¶ 41-72.)
The Court finds, based on the
submitted evidence of the declaration of Shahian and the Court’s own
experience, that Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ requested hourly rates are reasonable
for attorneys with their experience and in this area of the law.  The range of rates charged in this matter by
SLP is reasonable for attorneys of similar experience, in the same area,
dealing with the same subject matter. (See Goglin v BMW of North America
(2016) LLC 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 473-74 [approving $575 per hour fee on lemon law
action for attorneys in Los Angeles].)
Defendant also contends that
Plaintiffs over-litigated the case by staffing 14 attorneys for a matter that
presented typical lemon law issues and did not go to trial. This Court agrees from
its own experience in practice that 14 attorneys working on a case will
necessarily result in unnecessary duplication in work, and that even the six
attorneys and one law clerk which Plaintiffs state accounted for a vast
majority of the work appears to this Court to be excessive for this type of
case.  The Court has discretion to reduce
fees that result from inefficient or duplicative use of time.  (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359,
395.)  The Court will consider this issue
in determining whether the total number of hours was reasonable.
ii.             
Reasonable Hours Incurred
“A trial court
assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on
the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation
of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the case.”  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is
within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration
of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues,
the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The
court may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary
or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.)
 
Plaintiffs’
fee recovery is based on 268.20 hours spent by their attorneys at SLP
litigating this case through this motion for which Plaintiffs have submitted
billing records. (Shahian Decl., ¶ 74; Ex. 17.) At the rates identified above,
Plaintiffs represent that they are seeking a lodestar of $123,048.
 
First,
the Court addresses the issue of block billing. Defendant contends that there
are numerous time entries that are block billed. The use of block billing is
not per se objectionable. Block billing is only problematic “when the practice
prevents them from discerning which tasks are compensable and which are not.” (Heritage
Pac. Fin. LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1010.)  Because of block billing, however, the Court
finds it difficult to assess the reasonableness of the time spent on individual
tasks, such that the Court must make a determination without the information
that would result from non-block billed entries.    
 
Although
Defendant does not identify any specific tasks that were the result of
overstaffing or request a specific reduction of in fees relating to time spent
for claimed overstaffing, except for one specific task, the Court will exercise
its discretion based upon its own experience to determine the reasonableness of
the claimed lodestar. 
 
Defendant
objects to an attorney working on the opposition to the MSJ as duplicative
because this was not the attorney who signed the opposition. The Court notes
that one attorney drafted the opposition, while the other revised and finalized
it, and another prepared for the hearing. The Court agrees with Defendant that
there appear to be some duplicative and excessive hours spent on this
motion.  As a result, the Court reduces 3
hours of attorney time spent on the motion, for a reduction of $1,500.
 
Next,
Defendant objects to tasks that Defendant argues are billed at excessive
amounts of time. Defendant provides the following examples:
·       5.8
hours ($2,291) for drafting the Complaint. 
·       16.7
hours ($7,322.50) for drafting and revising responses to Defendant’s first set
of written discovery. 
·       12.7
hours ($6,667.50) to draft this motion and supporting documents 
·       $3,500
to Draft a reply to this motion.
·       2.9
hours ($942.50) to summarize Carmen Herrera’s deposition transcript. The
deposition was 24 minutes. (Tsai Decl., ¶ 23.)
The Court agrees in part. The Court agrees that the standard-format,
8 page complaint in this matter should not have taken 5.8 hours to draft, and
at most should reasonably have taken 3 hours. Thus, the Court reduces the fee
by $1,106. 
Next, the Court does not find that the reasonable amount
of hours necessary to draft the discovery responses was 16.7 hours. Rather, it
appears Plaintiffs spent around 10 hours to draft both Plaintiffs’ responses to
Form Interrogatories, 34 Special Interrogatories, 15 Requests for Admission and
37 Requests for Production of Documents, which appear reasonable.  The remainder of the time spent was for amended
responses, which should not have been necessary.  The Court therefore reduces this item by 6.7
hours or $2,981.50.
Next, the Court agrees that it should not have taken 12.7
hours to draft this fee motion as this appears to be substantially a template
motion regularly used by plaintiffs. While the billing and supporting evidence
may have taken some time to gather, the Court finds that the reasonable amount
of time would be five hours for a reduction of $4,042.50.
Moreover, the Court finds that $3,500 in anticipated fees
for reviewing the reply should be reduced, as this amount appears excessive to
the Court.  Instead, the Court awards two
hours of time at $525, so the amount claimed for this item is reduced by
$2,450.
Further, the Court agrees that it should not have taken
2.9 hours to summarize a deposition that was only 24 minutes long. The Court
finds that the reasonable amount of time for this work is a maximum of .5
hours, for reduction of $455.
The Court finds other entries that it does not find to be
reasonable based upon its knowledge and experience:
     The .7 hours
billed for “Draft and finalize P’s CMC” and “notice of CMC” is excessive for a
very simple form.  The maximum amount
which the Court will allow for this task is the initial .3 hours billed, thus
reducing this item by $178.
     The 2.2 hours
billed to “Draft and finalize P’s IDC statement” is excessive.  A reasonable amount of time for this task
would be .5 hours; therefore, the Court will reduce this item by $697.
The time to “Prepare for and attend Status Conference;
draft hearing outcome memo” is excessive at 2.0 hours; the Court finds that 1
hour to prepare for and attend this Status Conference and to prepare a memo on
it is reasonable.  The Court therefore
reduces this item by $595.  
The Court finds that the time relating to the preparation
for and oppositions to the Motions in Limine to be excessive – the motions
filed by both sides could have been avoided by the parties stipulating to these
very standard motions.  Because both
sides are likely responsible for the filing of and opposition to these
unnecessary motions, however, the Court will not reduce fees incurred, but
reminds counsel of this Court’s departmental rules which require the parties to
meet and confer and to agree to motions in limine that are clearly likely to
be granted.
The Court does not find that the
other tasks completed in connection with this case to be excessive or otherwise
unreasonable. 
Having
analyzed the motions and pleadings filed, and having reviewed the billing
statements provided, the Court determines that a reasonable lodestar in this case,
to limit any duplicative and excessive fees, is $109,043.
 
C. Multiplier 
While the lodestar reflects the basic fee for comparable legal services
in the community, it may be adjusted based on various factors, including “(1)
the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill displayed
in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent nature of the
fee award” and (4) the success achieved. (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)
 
Nonetheless, the court must not consider extraordinary skill and the
other Serrano factors to the extent
these are already included with the lodestar. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th 1122, 1138-1139.) “[A] trial
court should award a multiplier for exceptional representation only when the
quality of representation far exceeds the quality of representation that would
have been provided by an attorney of comparable skill and experience billing at
the hourly rate used in the lodestar calculation. Otherwise, the fee award will
result in unfair double counting and be unreasonable.” (Id. at 1139.)
Plaintiff requests a lodestar
multiplier enhancement of 1.35 in the additional amount of $43,066.80 on the
ground that the settlement results were excellent, and because SLP undertook
representation of Plaintiff on a contingency basis—if the action failed and
Plaintiff did not recover, neither would her counsel. (Shahian Decl. ¶ 73.) SLP
faced a genuine risk of not being paid for its services for years (if at all)
while advancing thousands in costs and expenses to prosecute Plaintiff’s claims
against HMA, a large corporate defendant with the proven track record to engage
in prolonged litigation (while its attorneys get paid regardless of outcome). Lastly,
Defendant argues there was also a delay in payment.
The Court finds that under the circumstances of this case, a lodestar
multiplier is not appropriate. This is a straightforward lemon law
case.  Nothing before the Court indicates that the case presented novel issues
or that the quality of representation far exceeded the quality of
representation that would have been provided by attorneys of comparable skill
and experience billing at the same rates. While Plaintiff argues that counsel
accepted the case only on a contingency basis and there was a delay in payment the
Court finds that such consideration and risk is already included within the
lodestar amount. That is because the substantial hourly rates allowed for by
the court are hourly rates for lemon law cases done on a contingency basis.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court declines to award a lodestar
multiplier.
 
D. Entitlement and Reasonableness of Costs
Allowable costs “shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).) Any items not specifically mentioned
by statute “may be allowed or denied in the court's discretion.” (Id.,
subd. (c)(4).)
 
Song-Beverly allows a successful plaintiff to recover both “costs” and
“expenses.” (See Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) Courts have held that “it is
clear the Legislature intended the word ‘expenses' to cover items not included
in the detailed statutory definition of ‘costs.”’ (Jensen v. BMW of North
America, Inc. (“Jensen”) (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.) The
court in Jensen held that “[t]he legislative history indicates
the Legislature exercised its power to permit the recovery of expert witness
fees by prevailing buyers under the Act … ,” noting that the legislature
included “expenses” in the lemon law act because '“[t]he addition of awards of
“costs and expenses” by the court to the consumer to cover such out-of-pocket
expenses as filing fees, expert witness fees, marshall’s fees, etc., should
open the litigation process to everyone.’ [Citation.]”
Plaintiffs request a total of $16,375.87
in costs and expenses.  Defendant
contends that Plaintiffs’ costs should be taxed. 
First, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs
seek recovery of $3,466.00 for “expenses paid to Olson-EcoLogic for Emission
Testing and Transport” on June 29, 2021. There is no description for this item,
much less an invoice or other evidence to support this amount. These costs are
uncertain and likely excessive. Further, Plaintiffs’ expert Darrell Blasjo
testified there was no emission
concerns reported during the emission warranty of the vehicle, no
failed smog check was ever produced, and that he was not
offering any opinions regarding emission concerns.
(Tsai Decl., Ex. I [Blasjo Trans. 15:8-17, 23:11] and Ex. J.) 
Plaintiff
responds that Plaintiff’s expert testified in deposition that he was not
offering any opinions regarding emission concerns on July 2, 2021, three days after the emission testing took place.
(Shahian Decl., Exh. 17, pg. 3.) As such, this item does not appears to be
reasonably necessary.
Next,
Defendant contends that Plaintiff purportedly paid $520.00 on November 29, 2021
for “Cancellation of Reporting Services – Vincent Petrangelo.” Defendant argues
its expert was deposed on July 2, 2021 and the court reporter fees for the
deposition and transcript were billed on the same day ($1,890.00). Defendant
argues that Plaintiff appears to be seeking duplicate costs and/or costs
prohibited under California law. 
Plaintiff
respond that she served a notice of deposition on November 7, 2021 to which Kia
failed to timely object. Hence, the cancellation fee. Plaintiff has not,
however, responded to Defendant’s contention that Petrangelo was already
deposed in July of 2021. Thus, the Court taxes $520.
Lastly, Defendant argues that Plaintiff
also seek recovery of $3,637.90 “for Deposition and Transcript Services –Gavin
LaBeet” on June 29, 2021. Without any evidence to support this amount, this
expense is uncertain and possibly excessive. 
            Plaintiffs
respond that the deposition
commenced at 11:09 a.m. and concluded at 5:25 p.m. and amounted to 254 pages,
with 34 Exhibits. (Baker Decl., ¶ 5.) By comparison, the deposition of
Plaintiff’s witness, Darrell W. Blasjo commenced at 11:00 a.m. concluded at
1:42 p.m., amounted to 102 pages with 11 Exhibits. (Baker Decl. ¶ 6.) The Court
can see the July 2, 2021 charge for that deposition was $1,890.00,
significantly less for a shorter deposition with few Exhibits. The Court will not tax this amount.
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion
for attorney fees is GRANTED in part. 
The Court awards $109,043 in attorney fees and $15,855.87 in costs to
SLP.
