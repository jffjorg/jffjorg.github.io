  CASE NO.: 23STCV08629
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT
 
8:30 a.m.
May 16, 2024
Dept. 56



 
            Jeff J. Astarabadi and MUCH SHELIST,
P.C. seek to be relieved as counsel for Defendant CA Senior Woodland Hills CA
Property Owner, LLC (“Defendant”).  All
requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 have been met, as counsel has
demonstrated that there has been a substantial and irreconcilable breakdown of
the attorney-client relationship. 
Moreover, the trial date, September 23, 2024, is far enough in advance
for Defendant to obtain new counsel and prepare for trial.  As Defendant is a limited liability company,
it cannot appear in propria persona. The Court therefore sets a Status
Conference re Representation for June 6, 2024 at 8:30 am, by which time Defendant
will be expected to have filed a Substitution of Counsel form and new counsel
will be present to discuss with the Court the status of the case.
 
Subject
to this condition, the Motion is GRANTED.
 
Jeff
J. Astarabadi and MUCH SHELIST, P.C. are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
 
          
Dated this 16th day of May 2024
 




 


 




 


Hon. Holly J.

  Superior Court
