  CASE NO.: 21STCV04375
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION FOR
  APPROVAL OF PAGA SETTLEMENT, ATTORNEYS’ FEES, AND ENHANCEMENTS
 
8:30 a.m.
May 16, 2024
Dept. 56



 
            The parties have agreed to settle this action
for $365,000. This amount is to be allocated as follows: (1) $121,654.50 for
attorneys’ fees, (2) $16,202.44 for costs, (3) $6,750 for estimated
administration costs, (4) $162,446.62 (75% of the net settlement amount) to the
Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”), and (6) $54,148.87 (25% of the
net settlement amount) in civil penalties distributed to aggrieved employees on
a pro rata basis. Named Plaintiff will also receive a general release payment
to be paid separate and apart from the settlement amount and is not
characterized as an incentive payment. (Moon Decl., ¶14.) Plaintiff now seeks
approval of the parties’ settlement.
 
The PAGA is
“a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil
penalties—for Labor Code violations—that otherwise would be sought by state
labor law enforcement agencies.”  (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756,
AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993, 1003.)  The statute provides a mechanism for private
enforcement of Labor Code violations for the public benefit.  (See Arias
v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 986; Ochoa-Hernandez v. Cjaders Foods, Inc. (N.D.Cal. 2010) 2010 WL
1340777, at p. *4.)  To incentivize
employees to bring PAGA actions, the statute provides aggrieved employees 25
percent of the recovered civil penalties. 
(Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).) 
The remaining 75 percent is distributed to the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency “for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers
and employees about their rights and responsibilities under [the Labor
Code].”  (Ibid.)
 
In
reviewing the terms of a settlement agreement, the court determines whether the
settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate to all concerned, and not the
product of fraud, collusion or overreaching. 
(Reed v. United Teachers Los
Angeles (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 322, 337; Nordstrom Commission Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 581.)  In the context of a class action settlement,
the court considers various factors including whether: (1) the settlement is
the result of arm’s length bargaining, (2) investigation and discovery are
sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently, (3) counsel is
experienced in similar litigation, and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.  (Nordstrom,
at p. 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer,
Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 245.) 
In considering the amount of settlement, the court is mindful that
compromise is inherent and necessary in the settlement process.  (Wershba,
at p. 250.)[1]
 
After review and consideration of the
moving papers and the remaining papers and pleadings currently on file in this
action, the Court finds that there is good cause to approve the settlement as
fair, just and equitable. Further, the LWDA has been served with the settlement
and moving papers and has not objected. (Moon Decl., ¶11, Exh. 2; POS 3/26/24.)
Therefore, the Motion is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiffs
are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
