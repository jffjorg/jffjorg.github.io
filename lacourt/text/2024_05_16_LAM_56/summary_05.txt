* Department: 56
* Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central District

**Parties**

* Plaintiffs: Humberto Nunez, et al.
* Defendants: Kia America, Inc., et al.

**Summary of the Ruling**

The tentative ruling addresses two issues: Breach of Express Warranty and Breach of Implied Warranty.

**Issue No. 1: Breach of Express Warranty**

The court finds in favor of the defendant, Kia America, Inc. The court concludes that the defendant's offer of restitution, which included a repurchase of the vehicle, was valid and satisfied the defendant's obligations under the Song-Beverly Act.

**Issue No. 2: Breach of Implied Warranty**

The court finds in favor of the defendant, Kia America, Inc. The court concludes that the plaintiff's continued use of the vehicle and the defendant's offer of restitution negate the breach of implied warranty claim.

**Key Points**

* The defendant's offer of restitution was valid and satisfied the defendant's obligations under the Song-Beverly Act.
* The plaintiff's continued use of the vehicle and the defendant's offer of restitution negate the breach of implied warranty claim.
* The court distinguishes between express and implied warranties, with Section 1793.2 specific to express warranties and irrelevant to implied warranties.
* The court finds that the plaintiff's revocation of acceptance was not timely and did not meet the requirements for a full refund recovery under an alleged breach of the implied warranty.
