The motion was filed on April 5, 2023, which was timely according to Code of Civil Procedure section 1710.40. The Judge grants Steaphan Weir's request for judicial notice of 23 court records from the Circuit Court of Barbour County, West Virginia, and the full case docket from the same action. Steaphan Weir argues that the West Virginia court acted in excess of its jurisdiction when striking his answer and entering a default judgment against him. However, the Judge finds that Steaphan Weir has not met his burden of showing by the preponderance of the evidence why he is entitled to relief. The Judge concludes that Steaphan Weir's motion is one seeking a second bite at the proverbial apple because he disagrees with the West Virginia court's decision, and this is not a basis to vacate the entry of judgment here.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Steaphan Weir's motion to vacate a default judgment entered by a West Virginia court. Weir claims that the West Virginia court acted in excess of its jurisdiction and failed to follow recognized procedures in striking his answer and entering default judgment. However, the judge finds that Weir has not met his burden of showing by the preponderance of the evidence why he is entitled to relief. The judge notes that Weir failed to appear in person at a hearing, was advised of the hearing date on five separate occasions, and did not seek to set aside the default judgment. The judge also finds that the West Virginia court did not act improperly in striking Weir's answer and entering default judgment. Finally, the judge notes that Weir's claims of error are not based on a valid defense to the judgment, but rather a disagreement with the West Virginia court's decision.

---

In this tentative ruling, the Judge denies Defendant/Judgment Debtor Steaphan Weir’s motion to vacate a sister state judgment. The Judge grants Defendant’s request for judicial notice of 23 court records from the Circuit Court of Barbour County, West Virginia, Civil Action No. 14-C-32 (Lawrence v. General Stability, Inc.), and the full case docket from the same action. The Judge analyzes the statute and case law regarding the basis for vacating the entry of judgment on a sister state judgment, including common defenses such as the judgment being rendered in excess of jurisdiction, the judgment not being enforceable in the state of rendition, and suit on the judgment being barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge finds that Defendant has not met his burden of showing by the preponderance of the evidence why he is entitled to relief, and therefore denies Defendant’s motion. Defendant is ordered to give notice.
