And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Steaphan Weir's motion to vacate the judgment on a sister state judgment. The motion was filed on April 5, 2023, which was timely according to Code of Civil Procedure section 1710.40. The Judge grants Steaphan Weir's request for judicial notice of 23 court records from the Circuit Court of Barbour County, West Virginia, and the full case docket from the same action. Steaphan Weir argues that the West Virginia court acted in excess of its jurisdiction when striking his answer and entering a default judgment against him. However, the Judge finds that Steaphan Weir has not met his burden of showing by the preponderance of the evidence why he is entitled to relief. The Judge concludes that Steaphan Weir's motion is one seeking a second bite at the proverbial apple because he disagrees with the West Virginia court's decision, and this is not a basis to vacate the entry of judgment here.
