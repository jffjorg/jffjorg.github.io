And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to dismiss the action, which claims that the matter was settled on July 24, 2023. The defendants point to a stipulated judgment in a separate case, Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23SMUD01004, which they claim settles the present action. However, the court finds that the stipulated judgment does not indicate that it relates to the same time period at issue in the present action. The present action seeks unpaid rent for different time periods than the stipulated judgment. The court also notes that an unlawful detainer judgment does not preclude a separate civil action for unpaid rent that is not recoverable in an unlawful detainer proceeding. Therefore, the present action is not barred by the separate unlawful detainer action by res judicata principles, and the defendants' motion to dismiss is denied.
