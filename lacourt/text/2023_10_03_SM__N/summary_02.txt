And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to dismiss the action, which claims that the matter was settled on July 24, 2023. The defendants point to a stipulated judgment in a separate case, Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23SMUD01004, which they claim settles the present action. However, the court finds that the stipulated judgment does not indicate that it relates to the same time period at issue in the present action. The present action seeks unpaid rent for different time periods than the stipulated judgment. The court also notes that an unlawful detainer judgment does not preclude a separate civil action for unpaid rent that is not recoverable in an unlawful detainer proceeding. Therefore, the present action is not barred by the separate unlawful detainer action by res judicata principles, and the defendants' motion to dismiss is denied.

## English Summary

The judge has denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss this case. The Defendants argued that the case should be dismissed because it was settled on July 24, 2023, referencing a stipulated judgment in a related unlawful detainer case. However, the judge found that the stipulated judgment did not explicitly mention settling the current case and that the timelines of the unpaid rent claims in each case differ. The judge also noted that an unlawful detainer judgment does not automatically bar a separate lawsuit for unpaid rent that accrued more than a year before the unlawful detainer action. Therefore, the judge ruled that the current lawsuit can proceed.

The Judge notes that Case No. 23SMUD01004 is neither related to nor consolidated with the present action, and that the stipulated judgment in Case No. 23SMUD01004 does not indicate settlement of the present action.

The Judge finds that Plaintiff’s action here is not barred by the separate unlawful detainer action by res judicata principles.
