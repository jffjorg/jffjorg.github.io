And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has decided to continue the hearing to gather more information before making a decision on the motion for a preliminary injunction. The Judge is seeking evidence from both parties, including proof of an easement allowing plaintiffs to use the Northern route, information on what plaintiffs have been doing since the gate was locked, and a statement on the actual hardship caused by the gate being locked. The Judge also wants to know whether plaintiffs have an agreement or understanding allowing them to use the Northern route and whether the use of the road is likely to cause hardship. The Judge notes that the defendants' prior bad conduct in terms of service of process and discovery is not helpful to them in this case. The Judge intends to discuss mediation or a mandatory settlement conference with the parties and will consider ordering the gates to be opened in the interim if plaintiffs truly cannot access their property. The Judge emphasizes the importance of the parties reaching an accord and becoming good neighbors.
