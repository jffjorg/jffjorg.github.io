 Case Number:  23SMCV05401    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2024    Dept:  I The court believes that this matter was moved to October 24,
2024.  The court will therefore not hold
a hearing today other than to find out whether the IDC was helpful in leading
to a resolution of the discovery issues. 
The court certainly hopes so.
