  Case Number:  22SMCV01282    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2024    Dept:  I The court will GRANT the application.  The court will discuss with the parties a
good hearing date.  10/22/24 will not
work, as the court will not have sufficient time to work up the motion before
then.  Because the court will be dark for
a while after that, the motion will likely not be heard until late November or
(more likely) mid-December.  But the
court will discuss the matter with the parties.
