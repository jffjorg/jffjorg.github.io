And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of George T. Sanchez, et al. v. Charles Patrik Leonard, et al. (Case Number: 20STCV10556). The case involves a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action of a minor, Chloe L. Sanchez, who is 11 years old. The judge has ruled that the petition should be denied because there is no guardian ad litem appointed for the minor claimant and because the petition does not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court (CRC) rule 7.950. Specifically, the rule requires that a petition for minor's compromise be for a pending action or proceeding in which the minor is a party. Since Chloe L. Sanchez is not a party to this case, the court is unclear as to the basis for bringing the petition. The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling and has declined to review the petition unless a legal basis for bringing the petition on behalf of a non-party to the action can be provided.
