The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Alicia Rivera, granting her unopposed motions to compel Plaintiff Araceli Sanchez to respond to discovery requests. The Judge found that Plaintiff was properly served with the discovery requests, but failed to respond. As a result, the Judge ordered Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the special interrogatories and request for production of documents without objections, within 20 days.

The Judge also awarded sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's attorney in the amount of $840, which includes $720 in attorney fees and $120 in costs. The Judge noted that Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, but sanctions may still be awarded under California Rules of Court 3.1348(a).

The Judge encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement before the hearing, and noted that if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
