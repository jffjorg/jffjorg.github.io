And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Beautiful Smile Dental Group (BSDG) in its motion for summary judgment in a medical negligence case filed by Tiffany Quynh Nhi Vu against BSDG and Helena Minye DDS. The case alleges dental malpractice, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

BSDG argued that Dr. Minye was an independent contractor and not an employee, and therefore BSDG cannot be held liable for Dr. Minye's actions. The judge agreed, stating that BSDG has met its prima facie burden to show that Dr. Minye was an independent contractor.

The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, so the judge granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of BSDG. The judge ordered the moving party to give notice, and encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If the parties do not agree, they will need to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
