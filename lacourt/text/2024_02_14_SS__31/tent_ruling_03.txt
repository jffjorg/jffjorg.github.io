 Case Number:  20STCV10556    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 02/14/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 20STCV10556 GEORGE T. SANCHEZ, et al. vs CHARLES PATRIK LEONARD, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR CHLOE L. SANCHEZ, Age 11 RECOMMENDATION: Deny.  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ First, there is no guardian ad litem appointed for minor claimant Chloe L. Sanchez (“Claimant”).  Second, and more importantly, CRC, rule 7.950 provides that a petition for minor’s compromise is for a pending action or proceeding to which a minor is a party. Here, Claimant is not a party to this case, and the Court is unclear as to the basis for bringing the petition.   Unless Petitioner can provide a legal basis for the petition brought on behalf of a non-party to the action, the Court declines to review the petition.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.
