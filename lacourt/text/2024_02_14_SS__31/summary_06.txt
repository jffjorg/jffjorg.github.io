Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties. The plaintiffs, Floyd Chester Butler and Eartha Carol Butler, reached a conditional settlement with the defendants, Revolution Foods, Inc., Carlos Villa Gomez, and Keith Melchor, on July 12, 2023, for $2,500,000. However, the defendant's insurance company withheld $1,000,000 of the settlement, citing an outstanding Medicare lien. The judge found that the statutory requirements for enforcing the settlement agreement under CCP ยง 664.6 have not been met, as there is no evidence of a writing signed by both parties. The judge also did not reach the issue of the Medicare lien, as the parties had already agreed that it was paid in full. The judge therefore denied the motion to enforce the settlement and ordered the moving party to give notice.
