Hyun was the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, and Managing Member of FS Partners. Hyun signed the RSA in her individual capacity as guarantor of FS Partners’ performance under the contract. After entering into the RSA and receiving the funds from Plaintiff, FS Partners made just two Weekly Remittance Payments, on May 29, 2024, and June 5, 2024. When Plaintiff attempted to conduct the next ACH debits on June 12, 2024, and June 19, 2024, these attempted debits were rejected and returned on June 14, 2024, and June 21, 2024, due to insufficient funds in the FS Partners’ Approved Accounts. As of the date of this Complaint, FS Partners has not cured the default or otherwise made any additional Weekly Remittance Payments to Plaintiff. The amount of FS Partners’ accounts receivable that remain uncollected pursuant to the RSA is $192,050.00.  On default judgment, Plaintiff seeks solely damages consisting of the following: $192,550.00 in principal damages, $5,116.75 in interest, $1,083.58 in costs, and $3,815.50 in attorney fees.  Principal Damages  Plaintiff seeks $192,550.00 in principal damages as pled in the Complaint.
