Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel further responses and sanctions. The plaintiff, GEVORG GYOZALYAN, filed three motions to compel the defendant, L.A. SECURITY & PATROL, INC., to provide further responses to discovery requests and pay monetary sanctions. The parties participated in several informal discovery conferences (IDCs), during which the defendant failed to produce documents and code-complaint responses in a timely manner. The judge has awarded the plaintiff $1,875.00 in attorney fees for time spent at the IDCs and has ordered the defendant to provide a Bates-stamped version of the 636 pages of record that were previously produced to the plaintiff. The judge has also imposed sanctions against the defendant and/or its counsel, ordering them to pay $1,875.00 to the plaintiff within 15 days. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if no agreement is reached, they should appear at the scheduled hearing on October 24, 2024.
