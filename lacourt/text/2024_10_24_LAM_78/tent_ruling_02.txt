 Case Number:  23STCV11253    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ SAEED MASJEDI, Plaintiff(s), vs. ELIZABETH VALDEZ, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 23STCV11253 Hearing Date: October 24, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR ANTI-SLAPP FEES  I. BACKGROUND On January 16, 2024, pro se plaintiff Saeed Masjedi filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against defendant Elizabeth Valdez and Does 1 through 300 alleging retaliation for complaints about a leaking kitchen sink. The FAC sets forth two causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and unlawful retaliation. On February 2, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Elizabeth Valdez (“Cross-Complainant”) filed a Cross-Complaint against Saeed Masjedi (“Cross-Defendant”) and Roes 1 to 10 alleging Cross-Defendant for elder abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. On June 18, 2024, the Hon. Jill Feeney denied Cross-Defendant’s “motion to dismiss” the Cross-Complaint against him. Cross-Defendant had moved on the grounds that (1) Cross-Complainant’s claims are barred by litigation privilege, and (2) the claims are subject to dismissal under the Anti-SLAPP statute pursuant to CCP §425.16. Although styled as a “motion to dismiss,” Judge Feeney noted that the motion was a demurrer and a special motion to strike (“anti-SLAPP”). Cross-Defendant failed to satisfy the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute, because the allegations that Cross-Defendant made harassing phone calls to Cross-Complainant and sent a threatening email to prevent a witness from participating in litigation did not constitute protected activity. The anti-SLAPP statute does not protect activity which is illegal as a matter of law. (Min. Order, June 18, 2024.) On July 26, 2024, Cross-Complainant filed the instant motion for attorney fees and costs in the amount of $4,666.50 pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(c) as the prevailing parties on Cross-Defendant’s anti-SLAPP. Any opposition was due on or before October 11, 2024. None has been filed to date.  II. DISCUSSION “If the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion, pursuant to Section 128.5.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.16, subd. (c)(1).) “Frivolous in this context means that any reasonable attorney would agree the motion was totally devoid of merit.” (Gerbosi v. Gaims, Weil, West & Epstein, LLP (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 435, 450.) “Appellate challenges concerning the motion to strike are also subject to an award of fees and costs, which are determined by the trial court after the appeal is resolved.”¿(Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320.) Cross-Complainant argues that Cross-Defendant’s special motion to strike was frivolous and/or intended to cause delay because there was no valid basis for the motion. Cross-Complainant asserts that the motion was devoid of merit because Cross-Defendant’s tortious speech and conduct did not constitute protected activity, and that a self-represented litigant is held to the same standard as an attorney. The Court has reviewed the prior court’s ruling on this matter. There appears to be no reasonable basis for the special motion to strike over Cross-Defendant’s alleged harassing and threatening conduct. A pro-per litigant is treated like any other party and is entitled to the same, but no greater consideration than other litigants and attorneys. (See, e.g., Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1246-47.) Further, Cross-Defendant did not oppose the motion contending otherwise. A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. (CRC, Rule 8.54(c).) The Court finds that Cross-Complainant has demonstrated that the Cross-Defendant’s special motion to strike was frivolous and is therefore entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Section 128.5. In determining what fees are reasonable, California courts apply the “lodestar” approach. (See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.) This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)¿“The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) Here, Cross-Complainant seeks attorney fees in the amount of $4,666.50 for collectively 10 hours and 37 minutes of time to prepare an opposition to the special motion to strike and to draft the instant motion for attorney fees at the rate of $450/hour. The Court has reviewed Cross-Complainant’s counsel’s declaration itemizing the specific work performed and time spent (Garber Decl. ¶¶2-3), and finds the hourly rate and time spent to be reasonable. The Court therefore will grant Cross-Complainant’s motion for attorney fees in the amount sought of $4,666.50.  III. CONCLUSION Cross-Complainant’s motion for attorney fees pursuant to Section 128.5 is GRANTED in the amount of $4,666.50.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: October 23, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
