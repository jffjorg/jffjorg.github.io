And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the cross-complainant, Elizabeth Valdez, is entitled to attorney fees in the amount of $4,666.50 for prevailing on the cross-defendant's frivolous anti-SLAPP motion. The motion was filed by Saeed Masjedi, the cross-defendant, but was denied by the court because it was based on a false claim of protected activity. The court found that the cross-defendant's conduct, including harassing phone calls and a threatening email, did not constitute protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. The court also found that the cross-defendant's failure to oppose the motion demonstrated consent to the granting of the motion. The court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Court.
