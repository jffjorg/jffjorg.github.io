And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement with the defendant. The settlement agreement was entered into on May 24, 2024, and provides for the defendant to pay the plaintiff $110,000.00 in four equal installments. The defendant has failed to comply with the agreement by failing to make the first two installments on time. The plaintiff has filed a motion to enforce the agreement under CCP § 664.6, which requires the court to enter judgment according to the terms of the settlement if the parties stipulate to the settlement in writing.

The judge finds that the statutory requirements of Section 664.6 have been met and grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The judge also awards the plaintiff attorney fees in the amount of $1,800.00 and costs in the amount of $60.00. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for prejudgment interest on the overdue payments.

The judge notes that the defendant's untimely opposition will not be considered and encourages the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. The hearing is set for October 24, 2024.
