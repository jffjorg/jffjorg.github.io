TENTATIVE
RULING
The hearing on Plaintiff’s Ex Parte
Application for Entry of Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation and Written
Settlement Agreement is CONTINUED to January 3, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. in
Department G, to allow Plaintiff to provide further information and documentation
in support of Plaintiff’s request for $3,000 in attorneys’ fees.

Background
On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff A & S
Produce, Inc. dba Greenland Foods Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendants Gangnam Street DB, Inc. and Soyoung Lee (together,
“Defendants”), alleging the following causes of action: (1) common count (open
book account) and (2) common count (account stated).
On October 29, 2024, Plaintiff and
Defendants entered into a written settlement and mutual release agreement (the
“Settlement Agreement”), whereby Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff a total sum
of $40,666.61 with the first payment of $5,000 to be received by Plaintiff by
no later than December 15, 2024. Thereafter, the remaining sum would be paid in
twelve consecutive monthly installments at $3,000 per month on the fifteenth
day of each calendar month, with the last payment of $2,666.61 due on December 15,
2025.
On October 30, 2024, the parties filed a
Notice of Settlement. An Order to Show Cause (OSC) Re: Dismissal (Settlement)
is set for January 15, 2025.
On December 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Ex
Parte Application for Entry of Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation. A hearing on
the application is set for December 31, 2024.[FN] 
Defendants have not filed an opposition. For the reasons stated herein,
the Court is inclined to continue the hearing on the ex parte application to
January 3, 2025 (or a date thereafter that is convenient to the parties) in
Department G, so Plaintiff can provide additional information regarding the request
for $3,000 in attorneys’ fees. 
 
Discussion
Plaintiff moves for the entry of judgment
pursuant to stipulation on the grounds that Defendants failed to make timely
payments under the Settlement Agreement.
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement,
Defendants’ first payment of $5,000 was due December 15, 2024. (Jang Decl., Ex.
A, ¶ 1.) Defendants failed to make this initial payment. (Jang Decl., ¶ 4
[noting that as of the date of the declaration (December 23, 2024), “no payment
has yet been received.”].)
The Settlement Agreement provides that “from
the fourth day from the date any payment is due but not paid, Defendants shall
be deemed to be in default of [the Settlement Agreement] . . . giving Plaintiff
an automatic and unfettered right to apply for an entry of the Stipulated
Judgment.” (Jang Decl., Ex. B, ¶ 1.) The Stipulation for Entry of Judgment
expressly permits Plaintiff to pursue entry of judgment through the filing of
an ex parte application and states that “email notice to Defendants or their counsel
shall be sufficient for ex parte notice.” (Jang Decl., Ex. B, ¶ 2(1).) On
December 27, 2024, Plaintiff provided notice via email of the instant ex parte
application to Defendants’ counsel of record, Jamie Kim. (Park Decl., ¶ 8 &
Ex. 1.)
The Settlement Agreement and the Stipulation
for Settlement Agreement also provide that Plaintiff is entitled to attorneys’
fees and costs to enforce the settlement. (Jang Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 9(f), Ex. B, ¶
1(2).) Plaintiff represents that it has spent $3,000 in attorneys’ fees and a
$60 filing fee to enforce the settlement. (Jang Decl., ¶ 8; Park Decl. ¶5.)
Because Defendants failed to make a timely
first payment under the Settlement Agreement, the Court finds that Defendants
are in default such that Plaintiff is entitled to entry of judgment in the
amount of $40,666.61 (i.e., “40,666.61, less any payments Plaintiff has
received”), as Plaintiff has not received any payments to date.
Plaintiff requests that the judgment also
include $3,000 in attorneys’ fees and $60 in costs. While the Settlement
Agreement entitles Plaintiff to attorneys’ fees and costs associated with
enforcing the settlement (including the $60 filing fee), the Court would like
further explanation and documentation underlying the request for $3,000 in
attorneys’ fees to enforce the settlement. The legal and factual issues
underlying the ex parte application are not complex, and the application itself
is only a single page. Accordingly, the Court continues the hearing on
Plaintiff’s ex parte application to January 3, 2025, at 9:00 a.m., before the
assigned judge (Judge Sirna) in Department G, to provide Plaintiff an
opportunity to further explain the requested attorneys’ fees.-------------------------------------FN: The instant application is being heard in Department H because Department G is dark on December 31, 2024.
