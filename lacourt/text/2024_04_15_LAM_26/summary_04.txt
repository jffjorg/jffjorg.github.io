And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants are entitled to a judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiff, Edward Newman, claims that the defendants intentionally and negligently caused him emotional distress, created a hostile work environment, and wrongfully terminated his employment. The defendants argue that their actions were reasonable and did not cause emotional distress. The court has found that the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendants' conduct was intended to cause distress or done with reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress. The court has also found that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support his claims of hostile work environment and retaliation in violation of public policy. The court has granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings and given the plaintiff 30 days to amend his claims.
