  order RE:
APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER PERMITTING ALANA
  F. GENDERSON AS COUNSEL PRO HAC VICE 
 



 
Alana
F. Genderson (“Genderson”) applies as counsel pro hac vice for Defendants U.S.
Telepacific Corp. dba TPX Communications; U.S. Telepacific Holdings Corp.;
Siris Capital Group, LLC.; Covad Communications Group; and Orange County
Internet Xchange, Inc.  The application
is unopposed. 
Under CRC Rule 9.40, attorneys licensed and in good standing in other
states may, upon the California court’s approval, appear as counsel pro hac vice in a pending case if an
active member of the state bar is associated as attorney of record.  (CRC 9.40(a).)  Genderson is an active
member, in good standing, of the U.S. District Court for the District of
Maryland, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, U.S. District Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia, District of Columbia Superior Court, Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals, U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington (at Seattle), Hawaii District Court, and the State of Michigan.  (Genderson
Decl. ¶¶3-4.) 
In addition, Genderson states that she is not a resident of California
or regularly engaged in business in California and is a resident of Washington with
an office in Washington, DC.  (Id. at ¶¶2, 6.)  Genderson
states that she has not filed any application to appear as counsel pro hac vice
in any state court matter in California in the preceding two years.
(Id. at ¶5.) Thus, counsel satisfies the eligibility requirements of CRC
9.40(a).
Genderson’s application also addresses all six content
requirements outlined in CRC 9.40(d). (Id. at ¶¶2-8.)
Further, Genderson demonstrates that he has meet the requirement of CRC 9.40(c)(1) and (e) by
providing notice to the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office and
paying the $50 fee. (Mills Decl., ¶3, Exh. A.)

Corp. dba TPX Communications; U.S. Telepacific Holdings Corp.; Siris Capital
Group, LLC.; Covad Communications Group; and Orange County Internet Xchange,
Inc. is GRANTED.
The Moving Parties
are ordered to provide notice of this order and file a proof of service of
