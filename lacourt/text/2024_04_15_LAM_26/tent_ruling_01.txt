[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
DEFENDANT 5505
  ACKERFIELD APT, LLC’S MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF COMPLAINT
 
 



 
Background 
 
On July 27, 2023,
Plaintiffs Edana Jones, Tykisha Bain, and Raydell Latrent Patterson
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a breach of habitability action against
Defendants 5505 Ackerfield Apts LLC (“Ackerfield”), AJJ2020 LLC (“AJJ20202”),
Masuda Investments LLC (“Masuda”), asserting four causes of action for (1)
Failure to Provide Habitable Dwelling, (2) Breach of the Covenant and Right to
Quiet Enjoyment and Possession of the Property, (3) Nuisance, and (4)
Negligence. 
On November 8, 2023, Defendant Ackerfield filed
the instant motion to strike portions of the Complaint. 
On November 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their
opposition. 
No reply has been filed by Defendant Ackerfield
as of April 11, 2024. 
 
Allegations of the Complaint 
The Complaint alleges the following. 
505 Ackerfield Avenue, Long Beach, CA 90805 (“Subject Property”) “is a
multiple family dwelling, which is occupied by tenants and their families,
including low-income tenants, minorities and families with children.”  (Complaint ¶ 14.)  
Ackerfield is the current owner of the Subject Property since 2021 and
were Plaintiffs’ landlord.  (Id.
¶¶ 5-6.)  AJJ2020 owned the Subject
Property from October 2020 to October 2021 and were landlords of the Subject
Property.  (Id. ¶¶ 7-8.)  Masuda owned the Subject Property
from December 2012 to October 2020 and were landlords of the Subject
Property.  (Id. ¶¶ 9-10.)   
Plaintiffs are current and former tenants of Subject Property.  (Id.
¶ 1.)  Plaintiff Edana Jones resided in unit 103 from October 2021 to
February 2023.  (Id. ¶ 2, Exh. A.)  Plaintiffs Tykisha Bain
and Raydell Latrent Patterson have lived in unit 104 from July 2019 to
present.  (Id. ¶ 3, Exh. A.)  
Plaintiffs made numerous complaints about substandard conditions at the
Subject Property, which Defendants Ackerfield, AJJ2020, and Masuda refused to
repair. (Id. ¶ 18.)   Rather,
Defendants Ackerfield, AJJ2020, and Masuda threatened, harassed, and
intimidated the Jones Plaintiffs when they continued to complain about the
Subject Property’s condition.  (Id.
¶ 18.)    
Legal Standard 
 
The court may, upon a
motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading;
or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)  For the purposes of a motion to strike
pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the term
“pleading” means a demurrer, answer, complaint, or cross-complaint, and an
immaterial allegation or irrelevant matter in a pleading entails (1) an
allegation that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense, (2) an
allegation that is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise
sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 435, subd. (a)), 431.10,
subds. (b)(1)-(3).)   
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant Ackerfield
moves to strike the following portions of the Complaint: 
 
1.    
Paragraph
18, page 6, lines 24-26: "Defendants refused to repair the Property as
requested, and threatened, harassed and intimidated the Plaintiffs when they
continued to complain about Property conditions."
 
2.    
Paragraph
21, page 7, lines 7-8: "Defendants acted with callous and intentional
disregard for the Plaintiffs' health, safety, and well-being."
 
3.    
Paragraph
28, page 8, lines 10-11: "Defendants also harassed the Plaintiffs such
that the Plaintiffs were deprived of the quiet enjoyment of their home."
 
4.    
Paragraph
29, page 8, lines 12-13: "Defendants conscious disregard of the
consequences of their actions and failures to act was intentional, malicious,
and outrageous."
 
5.    
Paragraph
54, page 11, lines 5-7: "Defendants' actions and failures to act as
alleged above were knowing, intentional, and malicious. Plaintiffs are
therefore entitled to exemplary and punitive damages in an amount to be
determined at trial."
 
6.    
Paragraph
64, page 12, lines 17-19: "Defendants' actions and failures to act as
alleged above were knowing, intentional, and malicious. Plaintiffs are
therefore each entitled to exemplary and punitive damages in an amount to be
determined at trial."
 
7.    
Paragraph
75, page 13, lines 26-28: "Defendants' failures to abate the public and/or
private nuisances at the Property were knowing, intentional, and malicious.
Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to exemplary and punitive damages in an
amount to be determined at trial."
 
8.    
Paragraph
3 on the First Cause of Action in the Prayer for Relief, page 15, line 11:
"For exemplary and punitive damages in an amount to be determined at
trial."
 
9.    
Paragraph
2 on the Second Cause of Action in the Prayer for Relief, page 15, line 14:
"For exemplary and punitive damages in an amount to be determined at
trial."
 
10. 
Paragraph
2 on the Third Cause of Action in the Prayer for Relief, page 15, line 17:
"For exemplary and punitive damages in an amount to be determined at
trial."
 
Defendant Ackerfield argues that the Complaint’s punitive
damages allegations/prayers are not supported by pleadings beyond conclusory
statements devoid of the specificity required for oppression, fraud, or malice.  
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the Complaint sufficiently pleads
grounds for punitive damages.
Defendant Ackerfield has not filed a reply as of April 11, 2024. 
Corporate Defendant
“When the defendant is a corporation, ‘[a]n award of punitive damages …
must rest on the malice of the corporation’s employees’” specifically, “the
oppression, fraud, or malice perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by
an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation,” where a managing
agent “include[s] only those corporate employees who exercise substantial
independent authority and judgment in their corporate decision making so that
their decisions ultimately determine corporate policy.’” (Wilson v. Southern
California Edison Co. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164, citations omitted.)
Here, the pleaded conduct does not specifically identify who, as an
agent of Defendant Ackerfield, engaged in the alleged conduct in the Complaint.  Nevertheless, the Complaint alleges that “each
agent, employee and representative of any entity Defendant that performed the
actions for such entity Defendant, was acting within the course and scope of
such agency, service and representation, and that such entity Defendant
directed, aided and abetted, authorized or ratified each and every act and
conduct hereinafter alleged” and  “Defendants
and the agents were present at or inspected the Property and the complaints
made by the Plaintiffs.”  (Complaint, ¶¶ 13, 23.)  The Court is therefore satisfied that the
Complaint sufficiently alleges, at the pleadings stage, that some director,
officer, or managing agent of Defendant Ackerfield ratified the conduct of its
unnamed agents pleaded in the Complaint.
 
Specificity 
 
“In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation of punitive
damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief must be pled
by a plaintiff.”¿ (Clauson v. Superior Court¿(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253,
1255; accord Cyrus v. Haveson (1976) 65 Cal.App.3d
306, 316-17.)  Conclusory allegations, devoid of any factual assertions,
are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted with oppression,
fraud, or malice. (Smith v. Superior Court¿(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033,
1042.) 
“The mere allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient
to warrant an award of punitive damages.  Not only must there be
circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the
pleading to support such a claim.”  (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166 (citations omitted).) 
Conclusory characterizations of defendant’s conduct as willful,
intentional or fraudulent is a patently insufficient statement of the necessary
factual grounds for punitive damages.  (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977)
73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.)     
To establish “malice”, a
plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the defendant intended to cause injury to
plaintiff or (2) despicable conduct with a willful and conscious disregard of
the rights or safety of others.  (Civ. Code §3294(c)(1).).  “[A]bsent an intent to injure the
plaintiff, malice requires more than a willful and conscious disregard of the
plaintiffs’ interest.  The additional component of ‘despicable conduct’
must be found.”  (College Hosp. Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8
Cal.4th 704, 725.)  To establish “oppression,” Plaintiff must
allege “despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship
in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”  (Id.)  To
establish “fraud,” Plaintiffs must allege “an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the
intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of
property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”  (Id.)   
The Court finds that the Complaint fails to plead sufficient ultimate
facts of oppression, fraud, or malice as to support its prayer for punitive
damages.  The Court agrees with Defendant
Ackerfield that Plaintiffs’ allegations that Defendant Ackerfield threatened
and harassed Plaintiffs do not contain specific facts to support such claims
and that Plaintiffs merely plead statutory phrases.  Plaintiffs argue in opposition that when
Defendant Ackerfield owned and managed the Subject Property, the Property was
uninhabitable as a result of Defendant Archerfield’s and its agents’ actions
and failures to act.  Upon review,
however, the Court finds these allegations are insufficient to rise to the
level of malice, oppression, or fraud. 
Mere negligence, if any, is insufficient to justify an award for
punitive damages.  Further, Plaintiffs
argue that the Complaint alleges wrongful intent and cites Cyrus v. Haveson (1976) 65
Cal.App.3d 30.  In that forcible entry case,
the Court noted that no wrongful motive or purpose was stated in the complaint.  In this case, the Complaint also does not
contain allegations of wrongful motive or purpose.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
Defendant Ackerfield’s Motion to Strike is GRANTED with 30 days leave to
amend. 
Moving Party to give notice and file proof of same.
