that the court stay, rather than dismiss, the action.


[2] “(1) If an action
is commenced within the period allowed by this article and is terminated
because of lack of jurisdiction or improper venue, the plaintiff or, if he dies
and the cause of action survives, the personal representative may commence a
new action upon the same cause of action within ninety days after the
termination of the original action or within the period otherwise allowed by
this article, whichever is later, and the defendant may interpose any defense,
counterclaim, or setoff which might have been interposed in the original
action.  (2) This section shall be
applicable to all actions which are first commenced in a federal court as well
as those first commenced in the courts of Colorado or of any other state.”
