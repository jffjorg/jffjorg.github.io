Judge's Tentative Ruling:

After reviewing the case, I, the Judge, have decided to consider staying the action rather than dismissing it. The case was originally commenced, but was terminated due to lack of jurisdiction or improper venue. According to Colorado state law, the plaintiff, AHM, has the right to commence a new action within 90 days of the termination of the original action. The defendant may also interpose defenses, counterclaims, or setoffs that could have been raised in the original action. I will consider this option further and issue a final ruling at the upcoming Court Hearing.
