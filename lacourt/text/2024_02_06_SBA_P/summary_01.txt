  - "The burden now shifts to Plaintiffs to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts do exist as to whether Defendant Pacific Maritime Association had a duty to train Plaintiff Pedro Chavarin."
  - "Plaintiffs have shown beyond mere speculation that genuine issues of material facts exist as to whether Defendant Pacific Maritime Association owed a duty to train Plaintiff Pedro Chavarin as to the safe handling of split rim wheel and tire assemblies."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment filed by the Defendant Pacific Maritime Association. The motion was filed against the Plaintiffs Pedro and Maria Chavarin, who had alleged that the Defendant Pacific Maritime Association had a duty to train them on the safe handling of split rim wheel and tire assemblies, and that the Defendant's breach of that duty proximately caused the Plaintiffs' injuries.

The judge found that the Defendant Pacific Maritime Association had met its initial burden of proof that a genuine issue of material fact did not exist as to whether it had a duty to train the Plaintiffs. However, the judge also found that the Plaintiffs had shown beyond mere speculation that genuine issues of material facts existed as to whether the Defendant Pacific Maritime Association had a duty to train the Plaintiffs.

The judge also denied the Defendant Pacific Maritime Association's motion as to the Plaintiffs' cause of action for loss of consortium, which was based on the Plaintiffs' claim that the Defendant's breach of its duty to train them proximately caused the loss of their marital relationship.

The judge's ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to change after further review and consideration.
