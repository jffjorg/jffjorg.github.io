 Additionally, the Plaintiff’s
80-year-old mother requires assistance in caring for the Plaintiff’s father.  At the time of the hearing, the Plaintiff will
be out of state.  The Plaintiff is
currently seeking legal representation for the upcoming trial.”  (Motion to Continue, p. 2; Declaration of Jay
