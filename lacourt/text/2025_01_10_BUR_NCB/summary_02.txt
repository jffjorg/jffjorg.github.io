And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a demurrer filed by AAA Management Group LLC (Cross-Defendant) to the cross-complaint filed by Carson Paulina Goring (Cross-Complainant). The cross-complaint seeks to apportion fault for damages allegedly caused by Cross-Defendant's intentional negligence and faulty repairs. The judge has sustained the demurrer and dismissed the cross-complaint with prejudice, finding that the cross-complaint fails to state a valid cause of action and seeks a remedy that is not legally available. The judge has also determined that the cross-complaint does not include any factual basis for the claim of apportionment of fault and that Cross-Complainant's assertions are incorrect.
