  No.: 22BBCV01196 
 
Hearing

 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE: motion to compel
  further responses TO FORM INTERROGATORIES
 



 
BACKGROUND

A.    Allegations

Plaintiff Maryam
Moghadam commenced this action against Defendants Grocery Outlet, Inc., Grocery
Outlet Inc. dba Grocery Outlet Bargain Mall, Robert H Schwab TR Schawb family
trust and John S Schwab TR Schwab Trust. Plaintiff alleges causes of action for
general negligence and premises liability. 
Plaintiff
alleges that while shopping, she tripped and fell on an unknown dangerous
condition that Defendants negligently failed to repair or provide warnings
about. The condition was on property owned, operated, maintained, or controlled
by Defendants. It is further alleged that Defendants had a duty to inspect,
maintain, warn, and repair the property to ensure no dangerous condition
existed that could harm customers, but they failed to fulfill this duty.
Plaintiff believes that the dangerous condition was caused by the negligent or
wrongful acts or omissions of Defendants’ agents or employees. Additionally,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants knew or should have known about the dangerous
condition and had sufficient time to remedy it but failed to do so or to
provide adequate warnings to pedestrians, including Plaintiff. This dangerous
condition allegedly created a foreseeable risk of harm, which directly and
proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries. As a result, Plaintiff claims to have
suffered economic and non-economic damages, including medical expenses, loss of
income, physical pain, mental suffering, loss of enjoyment of life,
disfigurement, anxiety, and emotional distress.
B.     Motion
on Calendar 
On November 14,
2024, Defendants filed the instant motion to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One. An IDC request was filed on November 19, 2024, with
the deadline for the Court to hold the IDC by December 9, 2024. Defendant
provides as follows: 


Discovery
was served on Plaintiff’s counsel on June 26, 2024. After multiple extensions,
responses were served on Sunday, September 30, 2024. A further response to Form
Interrogatory 11.2 is required regarding Plaintiff’s worker’s compensation
claim related to the incident. Despite being the claimant and self-employed at
the time, Plaintiff claims to have no details about the claim. These records
are directly relevant to the damages and cannot be independently obtained by
Defendants through a subpoena without additional information that Plaintiff
should know or have readily available.


To date, no opposition has been filed. 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES The propounding party may file motions to compel
further responses to interrogatories or requests for production if it believes
the responses received are (1) evasive, (2) incomplete, or (3) if the
objections raised are meritless or overly general. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300(a), 2031.310(a).) In response to a motion to compel further responses,
the respondent bears the burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont Ins.
Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
The
request at issue is FORM INTERROGATORY 11.2, which states: In the past
10 years have you made a written claim or demand for workers’ compensation
benefits? If so, for each claim or demand state:
(a) the date, time, and place of the INCIDENT giving
rise to the claim;
(b) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of your
employer at the time of the injury; and
(c) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the
workers’ compensation insurer and the claim number;
(d) the period of time during which you received
workers’ compensation benefits;
(e) a description of the injury;
(f) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of any
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER who provided services; and
(g) the case number at the Workers’ Compensation
Appeals Board.
PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO FORM INTERROGATORY 11.2:
a. December 2020 this accident
b-g. The plaintiff does not have this information in
his possession. However, the discovery is ongoing, and this responding party
reserves the right to amend his response once such a document becomes
available.
Defendants
point out that the deficiency of Plaintiff’s responses arises from her failure
to provide detailed information regarding a Workers’ Compensation claim related
to the December 28, 2020, incident, despite acknowledging its existence in her
response. Defendant states that Plaintiff, being both claimant and employer, is
in a unique position to access or obtain the requested details with minimal
effort, yet failed to do so in the nearly three months since receiving the
discovery request. This information is essential for Defendants to evaluate
Plaintiff's claims of lost income, pre-existing conditions, and liability
theories. Defendants claim they cannot independently obtain the necessary
details without Plaintiff’s cooperation, which prejudices their ability to
issue subpoenas, prepare for trial, and access relevant records. 
Under
California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2016.040 and 2030.300(a) and (b)(1), a
party may move to compel further responses to interrogatories if they find the
initial responses deficient. Such a motion must include a meet-and-confer
declaration as required by § 2016.040. In this case, Defendants state that
Defense counsel made repeated attempts to meet and confer with Plaintiff's
counsel about the deficient responses but received no response, necessitating
court intervention.
The
Court finds that Defendants have sufficiently shown that Plaintiff’s responses
are deficient, regarding the requested details of the Workers’ Compensation
claim related to the December 28, 2020. The requested information is relevant
to Defendants’ evaluation of Plaintiff’s claims, including lost income,
pre-existing conditions, and liability theories. The Court finds that
Defendants are entitled to further responses. Additionally, Defendants have
shown that they attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff regarding these
issues, but Plaintiff’s counsel failed to respond to the meet and confer
correspondence. (Ward Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5.) 
Thus,
the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to compel further responses to FROG No.
11.2.
MONETARY
SANCTIONS
            If a party fails to serve timely
responses to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling responses and seek a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subds. (b), (c).) Failure to respond timely waives all objections,
including those based on privilege and work product, unless the party has (1)
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance and (2) the
failure to timely respond was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)(1), (a)(2).)
            The Court also finds that Defendants
are entitled to sanctions. Defendants’ counsel claims 4 hours for this motion
at a rate of $175 per hour. The Court reduces the number of hours to 2 and
awards the $60 filing fee, for a total of $410 to be awarded to Defendants.
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
The
Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One.
The
Court also GRANTS Defendants’ request for sanctions in the amount of $410.
Defendants
shall
provide notice of this order.
