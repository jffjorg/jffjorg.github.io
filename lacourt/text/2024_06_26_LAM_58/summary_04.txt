And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings for the plaintiff's claim for partition, and orders the appointment of a partition referee. The judge finds that partition is proper and that a referee is necessary to assist in determining the manner of partition. The judge notes that the appointment of a referee can provide substantial benefits to the court and the parties, including the ability to make recommendations on the manner, terms, and conditions of sale. The judge also notes that the referee will be needed to examine the facts relating to how the properties can best be divided to lead to the highest and best value of the divided properties. The judge orders the appointment of one of the three potential referees nominated by the plaintiff, but the name of the appointed referee is left blank.
