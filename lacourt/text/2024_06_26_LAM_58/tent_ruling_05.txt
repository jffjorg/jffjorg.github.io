also cite Taggares v. Superior Court (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 94 and DeBlase
v. Superior Court (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1279 to argue that the Court must
take into account the financial burden imposed by a referee; however, neither
cited case involves a partition referee. (Taggares v. Superior Court
(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 94, 95 [discovery referee under Code of Civil Procedure
section 639]; DeBlase v. Superior Court (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1282
[same].) Thus, while Richmond v. Dofflemyer (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 745
does reference the “expense” as a consideration for appointment of a partition
referee, it is only one consideration and not statutorily codified as it is
in Code of Civil Procedure section 639, subdivision (d)(6) for the appointment
of a discovery referee.


[2]           The
referee must, however, provide notice of the sale in the same manner required
for notice of sale by execution. (Code Civ. Proc., § 873.640.) The referee also
must provide a detailed report to the court after the sale and prior to the
court’s confirmation of the sale. (Code Civ. Proc., § 873.710.) At the hearing
to confirm the sale, the court may either confirm the sale or vacate the sale
if certain findings are made, or the court may vacate the sale and accept an
increased offer by a responsible bidder at the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., §
873.730, 873.740.) Although the report and recommendation of the referee are
advisory, the referee “clearly serves as the initial examiner of the facts, and
perhaps the law, in a partition action, under the aegis of the appointing
court. The referee's determinations are either accepted by the court, modified,
or set aside. (§ 873.290, subd. (b).)” (Gray v. Superior Court (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 165, 171.) Confirmation of the referee's report and recommendation
constitutes an adoption of the facts found by the referee. (Worcester v.
Worcester (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 56, 61.)


[3]           Lastly,
in appointing a referee: “The court may: (1) Determine whether a referee’s bond
is necessary and fix the amount of the bond. (2) Instruct the referee. (3) Fix
the reasonable compensation for the services of the referee and provide for
payment of the referee's reasonable expenses. (4) Provide for the date of
commencement of the lien of the referee allowed by law….” (Code. Civ. Proc. §
873.010(b).) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff requests that the referee shall file his or her oath and file a bond
in the amount of $5,000 to secure the faithful performance of his or her duties
within four (4) court days of the interlocutory judgment ordering partition and
appointing a referee.
