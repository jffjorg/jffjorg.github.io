  Case Number:  23CHCV01248    Hearing Date:   March 28, 2024    Dept:  F51  MARCH 27,  2024    MOTION FOR SUMMARY  JUDGMENT  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV01248    Motion Filed: 10/31/23                                                                                  Jury  Trial: 10/28/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants United Construction  & Landscape Inc.; and Indika Jayaratna (collectively, “Defendants”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants.   TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is granted.   BACKGROUND    This is a  collections action in which Plaintiff alleges that on 10/28/19, Defendant United Construction & Landscape Inc. (“UCLI”) “entered  into a borrowing relationship with Chase by executing a Line of Credit Note in  the amount of $200,000.00 and a Credit Agreement.” (Compl. ¶ 6.) The loan was  personally guaranteed by Defendant Jayaratna. (Id. at ¶ 7.) Plaintiff  alleges that “UCLI has defaulted under the terms of the Contract and there is  now due, owing, and unpaid to Chase, the principal sum of $196,126.80, plus  late fees and costs pursuant to the terms of the Contract.” (Id. at ¶  8.)   On 4/27/23,  Plaintiff filed its complaint against Defendants, alleging the following causes  of action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Money Lent; and (3) Account Stated. On  8/3/23, Defendants filed their answer. On 10/31/23, Plaintiff dismissed its  second and third causes of action without prejudice.   On 10/31/23,  Plaintiff filed the instant motion for summary judgment. No opposition has been  filed to date.  // // // // ANALYSIS   The function of a motion for  summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an  opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to  enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v.  Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure  section 437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary  judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably  deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or  evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.  Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of  the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the  issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether  there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”  (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 65, citing FPI  Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381–382.)    As to each claim as framed  by the complaint, a plaintiff moving for summary judgment has met its “burden  of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has  proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on  the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the  plaintiff has met that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant “to show that  a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action  or a defense thereto.” (Id.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in  support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning  the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)  39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)    A.     Breach of  Contract   Plaintiff’s sole remaining  cause of action against Defendants Breach of Contract. To state this  cause of action, a plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of  the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)  defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis  West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)   Here, Plaintiff proffers evidence of each agreement  Defendants entered into with Plaintiff on 10/28/19. (Exs. A–B to Decl. of  Barbra J. Lopez.) Plaintiff asserts that it has performed its obligations under  the agreements by extending UCLI the loan, and Defendants each respectively  breached their agreements by failing to pay under the terms of the loan  agreement and failing to cure the default under the guaranty agreement. (Ex. C  to Lopez Decl.; Lopez Decl. ¶ 7.) “As a direct and proximate result of UCLI  breach of the Contract and Jayaratna’s breach of Guaranty, Chase has suffered  damages” in “the principal balance of $196,126.80, plus late fees and costs of  $1,105.12 for a total of $197,231.92.” (MSJ 4:12–15, citing Lopez Decl. 6.)   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff  has met its initial burden of proving each element of its cause of action for  Breach of Contract against Defendants. As Defendants have failed to oppose the  instant motion, they have equally failed to meet their responsive burden to  show that a triable issue of material fact exists as to this cause of action.  Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for summary  judgment.   CONCLUSION   The unopposed motion is granted. Plaintiff is to file a  proposed judgment in the amount of $200,821.92. within ten (10) days.
