This tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for June 10, 2024. The Defendant sought a five-month continuance to allow for the conclusion of discovery, citing the need to complete Plaintiff's deposition and expert discovery. However, the Judge found that the Defendant did not demonstrate good cause for the continuance, failing to show diligent efforts to secure outstanding essential discovery and failing to explain the need for expert discovery. The Judge also noted that the Defendant did not demonstrate reasonable efforts to depose Plaintiff in a timely manner. As a result, the motion is DENIED.
