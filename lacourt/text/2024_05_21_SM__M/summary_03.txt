The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to appear was unjustified and orders the plaintiff to attend the deposition at a mutually agreeable time and date within 14 days. Additionally, the judge imposes sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,700.00, inclusive of costs, to be paid to the defendant's counsel within 30 days.
