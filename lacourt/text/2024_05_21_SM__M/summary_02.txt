And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Jorie Esposito. The motion is granted, and Counsel Harry Nalbandyan Esq. will be relieved as counsel of record. The judge concludes that an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship has occurred due to the Plaintiff's refusal to appear at an Independent Medical Examination (IME) despite the counsel's instructions. The judge further notes that the counsel failed to update the MC-053 order to reflect the new dates, including the continued final status conference and trial dates. Once the counsel updates the order, the judge will grant the motion and relieve the counsel.
