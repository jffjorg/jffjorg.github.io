 Case Number:  23SMCV02236    Hearing Date:   May 21, 2024    Dept:  M CASE NAME:           Kinder v. Albertsons Co. Inc.
CASE NO.:                23SMCV02236
MOTION:                  Motion to Compel Second Deposition
HEARING DATE:   5/21/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
Service of a proper deposition
notice obligates a party or “party-affiliated” witness (officer, director,
managing agent or employee of party) to attend and testify, as well as produce
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for
inspection and copying. (CCP § 2025.280(a).) If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party deponent fails to appear, testify, or produce documents or
tangible things for inspection without having served a valid objection under
CCP § 2025.410, the deposing party may move for an order compelling attendance,
testimony, and production. (CCP § 2025.450(a).) The motion must be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration, or, when a party deponent fails to attend the
deposition, the motion must also be accompanied by a declaration stating that
the moving party has contacted the party deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).) If the deposition notice included a
request for production of documents, the motion to compel attendance must also
show good cause to justify the production. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(1).)  As such, the moving party must provide
declarations containing specific facts justifying inspection of the documents
described in the notice. Courts liberally construe good cause in favor of
discovery where facts show the documents are necessary for trial preparation.
 
The motion to compel must be “made
no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition.”
(CCP § 2025.480(b).) This time limit also applies to motions based on a
deposition subpoena for production of documents or a business records subpoena.
The 60-day time limit runs from the date objections are served because the
deposition record is then complete. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1192.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant the Vons Companies Inc.
move for an order compelling the second session of the deposition of plaintiff
Catherine Kinder.  Defendant explains
that plaintiff agreed to appear for deposition on December 28, 2023, and her
deposition was commenced on that date. (Lewis Decl., Ex. A.) After
approximately 2 hours of testimony, plaintiff stated that she could not
continue, the deposition was discontinued, and plaintiff was requested to
provide a date for the continued deposition. (Id.) Following meet and confer
efforts as well as several notices of deposition (Lewis Decl., Exs. B-F), on
March 26, 2024, Vons served a Notice of Taking Second Session of Plaintiff's
Deposition for April 17, 2024. (Lewis Decl., Ex. G.) Plaintiff failed to object
or appear for the timely and properly noticed deposition on April 17, 2024, and
counsel took a certificate of non-appearance. (Lewis Decl., Ex. H.) With this
record, Defendant demonstrates the service of a proper deposition notice for
the continued session of plaintiff’s deposition. Plaintiff was therefore
obligated to appear at the April 17, 2024, deposition. 
 
Plaintiff filed an untimely
opposition to this motion. Plaintiff does not give any persuasive reason as to
why she failed to appear at her noticed deposition. Plaintiff merely states
that she initially believed that she might be able to appear, but then realized
on April 15, 2024, that she could not and advised defense counsel of such. This
does not justify plaintiff’s failure to appear.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
Plaintiff is ordered to attend her deposition at 21052 Oxnard Street, Woodland
Hills, California 91367 at a mutually agreeable time and date, within 14 days.
Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,700.00, inclusive
of costs. Sanctions are to be paid to Defendant’s counsel within 30 days.
