1987.1 provides in part:
 
If a subpoena requires the
attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically
stored information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue
therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably
made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court's own motion

Analysis
 
Judgment Debtor Triwest Homes II LP
moves to quash a subpoena for production of business records as to Palm West
Escrow Inc. Triwest explains that Judgment Creditor Sam Ostayan served dozens
of deposition subpoenas on Palm West seeking the production of documents on
January 3, 2024. (Friedman Decl., ¶¶3-4, Ex. A.) Triwest argues that the
subpoenas are improper because Ostayan failed to seek a third-party debtor examination.
Triwest contends that the deposition subpoenas issued cannot be used to conduct
post-judgment discovery in this manner. 
As set forth below, Triwest is incorrect.
 
Discovery in connection with
enforcement of a judgment is generally set forth in the Enforcement of
Judgments Law (CCP § 680.010 et seq.). The Civil Discovery Act also applies to
discovery in aid enforcement of a money judgment, but “only to the extent
provided in Article 1 (commencing with Section 708.010) of Chapter 6 of Title 9
of Part 2.” (CCP § 2016.070.) As such, the CDA only permits written
interrogatories to the judgment debtor and inspection demands to the judgment
debtor. (CCP 708.010-708.030.) 
 
Triwest cites no authority that
subpoenas are unavailable in post-judgment proceedings. To the contrary, in the
context of post-judgment enforcement proceedings, “the use of a subpoena duces
tecum to discover and inspect relevant documents is an accepted practice.” (People
v. Pereira, (1989) 207 Cal. App. 3d 1057, 1066.) To summarize, a subpoena
duces tecum may be served on a third party to compel production of documents when
tethered to an underlying debtor examination under Code of Civil Procedure sections
708.110 or 708.120. (Shrewsbury Mgmt., Inc. v. Superior Ct., (2019) 32
Cal. App. 5th 1213, 1224-1225.) Under section 708.130(a), “[w]itnesses may be
required to appear and testify before the court or referee in an examination
proceeding under this article in the same manner as upon the trial of an
issue.” A subpoena duces tecum may be served on a party to compel production of
documents at trial. (CCP §§ 1985 et seq., 1986.) Since the examination of the
judgment debtor or third party under such sections is tantamount to a trial on
an issue (Pereira, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 1066), a subpoena would be a
proper vehicle to obtain the production of documents in advance of a debtor’s
exam. Otherwise, Triwest’s proposed construction “would prevent a judgment
creditor from obtaining relevant information about a judgment debtor's property
and business affairs from a third party who may not satisfy the requirements of
section 708.120, subdivision (a), such as the debtor's accountant, bookkeeper,
and others who do not possess or control the debtor's property or owe the
debtor money.” (Shrewsbury, supra, at 1225.)
 
Here, Ostayan seeks documents from
a third party in connection with the currently pending first party examinations
under section 708.110. The Court notes that there is even a pending bench
warrant in connection with an outstanding ORAP. Further, counsel used the
standard Judicial Council form for civil subpoenas, which referenced section
1985 et seq. (See Friedman Decl., Exs. A1-A24.) Thus, the subpoenas were
properly tethered with an ORAP under section 708.110.
 
Triwest also objects to the
substance of the subpoenas, as they purportedly seek the personal financial
records of non-parties. Triwest cites the following third parties: (1) 229 8th
St, LP, (2) TWD 19th Street, LP, (3) 204 N. Poinsettia Manhattan LP, (4) 1002 10th
St, LP, (5) 1120 Angelo Drive, LP, (6) 1501 8th, LP, (7) 3400 Manhattan, LP,
(8) 3405 Bayview Manhattan, LP, (9) 926 10th, LP, (10) 1501 8th, LP, and (11)
TWD Cypress HoldCo VII, LP. Triwest has not met its burden of proving their
privacy objections. The party asserting a privacy right generally must
establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion
that is serious. (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7
Cal.4th 1, 35-37.) The party seeking information may raise in response whatever
legitimate and important countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the
party seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same
interests or protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. (Id.
at 37–40.)  Courts must carefully balance
a right of privacy against the interest in having just litigation. (Pioneer
Electronics (USA), Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360, 371.) If
there is a serious invasion of a constitutional right to privacy, the party
seeking the evidence must establish that the information sought is not only
essential and directly relevant, but also that this information could not be
discovered through less intrusive means. (Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552.)
 
Here, there is no important right
to privacy implicated by the subpoenas. Triwest and the cited partnerships enjoy
no right to financial privacy under the United States Constitution. (See United
States v. Morton Salt Co. (1950) 338 U.S. 632, 652  [“[C]orporations can claim no equality with
individuals in the enjoyment of a right to privacy”]; see also First
National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978) 435 U.S. 765, 778-79 n.14  [“Corporate identity has been determinative
in several decisions denying corporations certain constitutional rights, such
as . . . equality with individuals in the enjoyment of a right to
privacy[.]”].) Likewise, they enjoy no right to financial privacy under the
California Constitution: “The [California] constitutional provision [concerning
the right to privacy] simply does not apply to corporations. The provision
protects the privacy rights of people.” (Roberts v. Gulf Oil Corp.
(1983) 147 Cal. App. 3d 770, 791.) The corporate right to privacy is a lesser
right than that held by human beings and is not considered a fundamental
right. (Ameri-Medical Corp. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Board (1996) 42
Cal.App.4th 1260, 1287-1288.) 
 
Because the corporate right to
financial privacy is not constitutionally protected, the issue presented in
determining whether the requests for production infringe that right is resolved
by a balancing test. (Hecht, Solberg, Robinson, Goldberg & Bagley v.
Superior Court (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 579, 594-595.) The discovery's
relevance to the subject matter of the pending dispute and whether the
discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence is balanced against the corporate right of privacy. (Ibid.)
Doubts about relevance generally are resolved in favor of permitting discovery.
(Ibid.) 


Here, Ostayan sets forth good cause
for the production of documents. Ostayan explains that Triwest continues to operate
its real estate business as a continuation of Triwest under various other
entities controlled by the same people and entities. (See Mase Decl., Ex. 1.) Ostayan
seeks the companies’ respective escrow files to reveal where disbursements went
and to whom in connection with Triwest. As such, the subpoenas will aid in the collection
of the money judgment against Triwest. Further, the subpoenas may reveal
information supporting a contemplated motion to amend the judgment to add these
alleged alter ego entities. On balance, these needs outweigh any financial
privacy interest in the escrow filings. 
 
Furthermore, Triwest failed to
supply the required separate statement for moving to quash a deposition
subpoena. (See CRC Rule 3.1345(a)(5).)
 
Accordingly, the motion to quash is
DENIED. Sanctions are imposed against Triwest and Triwest’s counsel of record,
Jashua P. Friedman Esq., in the total amount of $2,415.00. (CCP §1987.2(a).)
Sanctions are to be paid to Ostayan’s counsel within 30 days.
