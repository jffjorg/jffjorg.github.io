And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Triwest's motion to quash deposition subpoenas issued by Ostayan, Sam. The judge ruled that the subpoenas were properly tethered to an underlying debtor examination under Code of Civil Procedure section 708.110. The judge also found that Triwest failed to meet its burden of proving privacy objections and that the corporate right to financial privacy is not constitutionally protected. The judge ordered Triwest to pay sanctions to Ostayan's counsel in the amount of $2,415.00.
