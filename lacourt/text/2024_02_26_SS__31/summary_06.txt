And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Susan Hill's motion to compel further responses from Defendant City of Compton. The motion was filed on December 21, 2023, and the responses were served on September 28, 2022. The Judge finds that the 45-day period for objection-only responses ran from the date the responses were served, making the motion untimely. The Judge also finds that the 45-day period is triggered by the service of the responses, not by the service of verifications. The Judge orders the motion to compel further responses to be denied and awards no sanctions. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and the Judge will consider submissions by email.
