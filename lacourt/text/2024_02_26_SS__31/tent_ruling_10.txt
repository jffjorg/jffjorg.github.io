Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“LACMTA”) propounded requests for admissions (“RFAs”), set one, on plaintiff Elio Vallecillo Rivera (“Plaintiff”) on August 30, 2023. (Mot. Decl. Yehoshua ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Responses were due on or before September 29, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 3.) Plaintiff has not served responses to date. (Id. at ¶ 7.) LACMTA therefore seeks an order deeming the RFAs admitted against Plaintiff.  Any opposition was due on or before February 9, 2024; the motion is unopposed. Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission under CCP § 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Here, Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the motion, nor has Plaintiff otherwise demonstrated that responses to the RFAs were served in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.  Accordingly, LACMTA ‘s RFAs, set one, is deemed admitted against Plaintiff. (CCP §2033.280(b).)     II. Sanctions Where a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) LACMTA requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,000 for the instant motion. A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)  LACMTA is awarded 1 hour to prepare the motion and one hour to appear at the hearing, all at the requested rate of $250 per hour, for a total of $500 in attorney fees.  Sanctions are sought and imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney of record, jointly and severally. Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to LACMTA, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $500, within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 23rd day of February 2024      Hon.
