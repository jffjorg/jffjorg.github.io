And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests from The Hertz Corporation (Hertz) and Romaine Kirlew (Kirlew). The plaintiff, Glendis Beker, seeks an order compelling Hertz to provide further responses to Requests for Production Nos. 5 and 7, without objections. The Court finds that Hertz has failed to meet its burden of establishing the existence of the attorney-client privilege as to the Vehicle Incident Report prepared by Kirlew. Therefore, the Court grants the motion to compel further responses and orders Hertz to provide further responses to the above requests within ten days. The Court also imposes sanctions on Hertz and its counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $1,560.
