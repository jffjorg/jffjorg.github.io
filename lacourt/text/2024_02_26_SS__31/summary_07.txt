Summary in English text:
The judge has denied the Vacas' motion for summary judgment, which argued that they had no duty to protect Plaintiffs from the intentional act of Trinidad. The judge found that the Vacas had not met their burden of showing that they had no duty to protect Plaintiffs, and that the issue of whether the Vacas had a duty to protect Plaintiffs is a question for a trier of fact to determine. The judge also noted that the Vacas had not shown that there was no prior history of similar incidents or that the property was designed in such a way that made it difficult for pedestrians to avoid being hit by cars.
