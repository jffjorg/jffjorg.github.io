Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion for leave to submit tardy expert witness information and to re-open expert discovery. The plaintiff failed to submit the expert witness information on time, but has now moved to late designation and to re-open expert discovery. The judge finds that the conditions for granting the motion have been met, including that the failure to submit the information was due to mistake, surprise, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. The judge orders that the plaintiff make her expert available immediately for a deposition and that the expert discovery be re-opened. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
