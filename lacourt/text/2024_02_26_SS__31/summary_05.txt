And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant, Melvin Gomez. The case arises from a motor vehicle incident in which the plaintiff, Farmers Insurance Exchange, paid for property damages on behalf of its insured, Vahakin Nazerian. The parties entered into a stipulation for entry of judgment, which outlined the terms of the settlement, including the payment of $15,813.04 plus costs and prejudgment interest.

However, the defendant breached the terms of the stipulation by failing to make payments, despite receiving a default payment letter and notice of default. The plaintiff's counsel declared that the defendant's insurance carrier, Kemper, paid a total of $9,813.04 on the defendant's behalf, leaving a balance of $6,000.

The court finds that the defendant's breach of the stipulation warrants setting aside the dismissal and entering judgment in the amount of $6,000.00 plus costs of $72.00, in the total amount of $6,072.00, in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of the judgment.
