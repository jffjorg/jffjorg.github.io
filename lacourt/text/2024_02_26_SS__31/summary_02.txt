And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motion to quash the service of summons and complaint filed by defendant Pocrass & De Los Reyes, LLP. The motion was filed on July 28, 2023, and no opposition was filed by the plaintiff. The defendant contends that the service was not proper because the process server did not actually deliver the papers to James Pocrass, the authorized agent for service of process. The defendant has provided a declaration from James Pocrass stating that he never received the summons and complaint, and that no such documents were ever delivered or personally served to him. The judge finds that the defendant has rebutted the presumption that service was proper, and the burden is therefore on the plaintiff to establish that service was proper. Since the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, the judge concludes that the plaintiff has not met its burden and grants the motion to quash the service of summons and complaint.
