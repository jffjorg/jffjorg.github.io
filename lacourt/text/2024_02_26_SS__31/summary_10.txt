Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the unopposed motion to deem the requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted against Plaintiff Elio Vallecillo Rivera. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) propounded the RFAs on August 30, 2023, but Plaintiff failed to serve responses. As a result, LACMTA seeks an order deeming the RFAs admitted and requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,000. The court finds that Plaintiff waived any objections to the RFAs and orders Plaintiff to pay sanctions to LACMTA in the amount of $500. The court also awards LACMTA attorney fees in the amount of $500. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
