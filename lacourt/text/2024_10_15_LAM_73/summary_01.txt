And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Cross-Defendants' Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Production of Documents, Set One, propounded on Cross-Complainant DM Cosmetics. The Court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.

The Court orders DM Cosmetics to provide further responses to Requests Nos. 19-24 and 28-37, but denies the request for further responses to Requests Nos. 1-10, 12, 14, 15-18, 25-27, and 38.

The Court also denies the request for sanctions. The motion was brought by Cross-Defendants to compel DM Cosmetics to provide further discovery responses, and the Court finds that some of the requests are justified, while others are not.

The case involves a breach of loyalty and unfair business practices action brought by Yedam, Inc. and Eun Kyung Choi against Daniel Lee and Jin Sook Lee, and a cross-complaint by the Lees against Yedam, Choi, Olive House LLC, and Lamis Tania, LLC. The parties dispute the ownership interests in DM Cosmetics, and the Court has ordered DM Cosmetics to provide further responses to certain requests for discovery.
