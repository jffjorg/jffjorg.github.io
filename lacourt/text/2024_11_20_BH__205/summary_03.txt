The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default. The defendant's counsel was retained on September 18, 2024, and delayed filing an answer, but filed one two days later. Counsel's delay was excusable, and the judge finds that mandatory relief is warranted based on counsel's affidavit of fault. The judge notes that the law favors a trial on the merits and that only slight evidence is required to justify relief from default. The judge sets a Case Management Conference on January 23, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.
