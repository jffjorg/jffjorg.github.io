And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by GeoMat Testing Laboratories, Inc. to the cross-complaint filed by Christie Carr. GeoMat argues that Carr failed to allege the existence of a contract between GeoMat and Carr, failed to allege any defects relating to GeoMat, and failed to attach a Code Civ. Proc. § 411.35 certificate. The court agrees with GeoMat's arguments and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend. The court finds that Carr has not adequately pled a cause of action for breach of contract or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court also finds that Carr failed to attach the required certificate and did not demonstrate a reasonable possibility of a successful amendment. Therefore, the court will not grant Carr leave to amend her cross-complaint against GeoMat.
