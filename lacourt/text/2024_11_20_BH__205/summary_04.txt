```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Anthony Ranieri. The demurrer argues that the complaint is time-barred and fails to state a cause of action. The judge has granted the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff will not be allowed to fix the defects in the complaint. The judge has also sustained the demurrer on the grounds that the complaint is untimely, as it was filed more than six years after the transaction that is the basis for the case. The judge has declined to consider other arguments raised by the defendant, including whether the plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
