  [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
  defendant samajo properties, 
  llc’s motion to set aside default
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
This case arises from a landlord
tenant dispute.  Plaintiff Shlomo Asoulin
sued Defendant Samajo Properties, LLC for supposed uninhabitable living
conditions.  Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant then filed an unlawful detainer action claiming rent in excess of the
parties’ agreement, in retaliation for Plaintiff’s suit.  
The operative complaint alleges
claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent
misrepresentation and violation of Civil Code Section 1942.5.
The complaint was personally served
on July 12, 2024.  Defendant did not
respond within 30 days.  Accordingly, a
default was entered on September 19, 2024. 

This hearing is on Defendant’s motion
to set aside default.  Defendant argues
that his client mistakenly believed that no response was necessary because he
erroneously believed the action to be either stayed and/or legally moot due to
the judgment for possession and termination of the tenancy previously obtained
by Defendant against Plaintiff in Los Angeles Superior Court Case No.
23SMUD0156 and the stay issued in connection with Los Angeles Superior Court
Case No. 23SMCV0554, which stay arose from Asoulin’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Case
No. 2:24-bk-10036-NB.  By the time
Defendant retained counsel, the time to respond had already expired. 
And when counsel filed an answer, default had already
been entered, although counsel mistakenly believed the answer had been filed
before default because it was accepted by the clerk of the court and he
received a conformed copy of the answer from the court.  Upon checking the court docket, however,
counsel discovered that the request for entry of default had been entered on
September 19, 2024, followed by the filed answer on September 20, 2024.  There was no opposition filed as of the
posting of the tentative ruling.  
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code Civ. Proc. §473, subd. (b) provides for two
distinct types of relief from a default -- commonly differentiated as
“discretionary” and “mandatory.”  “Under
the discretionary relief provision, on a showing of ‘mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect,” the court has discretion to
allow relief from default.  Under the
mandatory relief provision, on the other hand, upon a showing by attorney
declaration of ‘mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,’ the court must
vacate any ‘resulting default judgment or dismissal entered.’”  (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 615-616.)  
Applications seeking
relief under the mandatory provision of §473 must be “accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit
attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §473, subd. (b).)  The
mandatory provision further adds that “whenever relief is granted based on an
attorney’s affidavit of fault [the court shall] direct the attorney to pay
reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.” (Id.)  
The application for
relief must be made no more than six months after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.  (Id.) 
And the application must be “accompanied by a copy of the answer or
other pleading proposed to be filed therein”. 
(Id.)
“It is settled that the law favors a trial on
the merits. . . and therefore liberally construes section 473.”  (Bonzer
v. City of Huntington Park (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1477.)  “Doubts in applying section
473 are resolved in favor of the
party seeking relief from default. . . and if that party has moved
promptly for default relief, only slight evidence will justify an
order granting such relief.”  (Id.
at 1477-78.) 
DISCUSSION
Defendant’s
motion to set aside default is timely. 
Default was entered on September 19, 2024, and Defendant filed its motion
on October 23, 2024, within six months of the entry of default.  
Further, mandatory
relief is warranted based on counsel’s affidavit of fault.  Counsel was retained on September 18,
2024.  At the time he was retained, the
time to respond to the Complaint had already expired.  He should have filed an answer
immediately.  He waited to try to secure
an agreement from Plaintiff to extend the time to respond.  But Plaintiff provided no contact information
beyond a P.O. Box.  By the time counsel filed
the answer two days later, on September 20, 2024, the default had already been
entered.  While his delay appears
excusable, mandatory relief is available even for inexcusable neglect.  (Martin Potts & Associates, Inc. v.
Corsair, LLC (2016) 244 al.App.4th 432, 438.)  
Accordingly, given the
strong policy favoring resolution of cases on their merits and that only very
slight evidence is required to justify relief from default, the Court grants
the motion to set aside default.  
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons,
the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to set aside default. The Court sets
a Case Management Conference on January 23, 2025 at 9:00 a.m.
