entire complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Gilbert
Ortegon’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendants improperly terminated his rental
of a storage unit located at 421 S. Raymond Avenue in Pasadena. Plaintiff filed
this complaint alleging nine causes of action for (1) wrongful eviction, (2)
unfair business practice, (3) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, (4) physical, psychological, and financial abuse of a disabled elder
person, (5) unfair fraudulent business practice, (6) intentional infliction of
emotional distress, (7) declaratory relief, and (8) injunctive relief. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. 
 
            Defendants’
motion to strike is DENIED as moot.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Demurrer 
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.
Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Additionally, a
special demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of
San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based
on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the
pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
 
Motion to Strike
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike a pleading or any part
thereof.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).)  The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms
it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).)  The court may
also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
California law, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 436, subd. (b).)  An immaterial or irrelevant allegation is one that is
not essential to the statement of a claim or defense; is neither pertinent to
nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense; or a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the
complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., 431.10, subd. (b).)  The grounds for
moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)   
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendants
demurrer to each cause of action listed in the caption of Plaintiff’s
complaint. Plaintiff’s complaint alleges one set of facts that purportedly
establishes the basis for each cause of action. Plaintiff alleges that he
rented storage units on January 2, 2021, and June 4, 2021. Plaintiff alleges
that he paid his bills on time, but Defendants terminated the agreement on
April 26, 2023. 
 
            As
a preliminary note, California Rules of Court, Rule 2.112 requires that each
cause of action separate state its number, nature, the parties asserting it,
and the party to whom it is directed to. Plaintiff’s complaint does not comply
with California Rules of Court Rule 2.112.
 
            Civil Code
section 1940.2 prohibits landlords from taking certain actions to influence a
tenant to vacate a dwelling. Civil Code section 1940, subdivision (c), defines “dwelling
unit”. Here, Plaintiff does not allege that the storage unit was a dwelling
unit or that Defendants acted to remove him from a dwelling unit. There is no
basis for Plaintiff’s first cause of action for wrongful eviction. Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s first cause of action is sustained.
 
            “ ‘By
proscribing “any unlawful” business practice, “[Business and Professions Code]
section 17200 ‘borrows’ violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful
practices” that the [UCL] makes independently actionable.’ [Citation.] ‘An
unlawful business practice under [Business and Professions Code] section 17200
is “ ‘an act or practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is at
the same time forbidden by law. [Citation.]’ ” ’ ” (Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1361.) Here, Plaintiff only alleges
that he called Defendants’ corporate office and told them that their actions
were unfair, abusive, fraudulent, and unjustified. Plaintiff fails to allege facts
sufficient to allege a cause of action for unfair business practice. Further,
Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action for “unfair fraudulent business practices”
also fails. Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s second and fifth causes of
action is sustained.
 
            Plaintiff’s third cause
of action is for a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair
dealing. “Under California law, every contract includes an implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing.” (Prager University v. Google LLC (2022) 85
Cal.App.5th 1022, 1039.) The covenant “exists merely to prevent one contracting
party from unfairly frustrating the other party’s right to receive the benefits
of the agreement actually made.” (Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 317, 349.) Plaintiff does not allege that Defendants breached the
contract or frustrated his rights to receive the benefits of the agreement.
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s third cause of action is sustained. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
claim for elder abuse also fails. “The Elder Abuse Act's heightened remedies
are available only in limited circumstances. A plaintiff must prove, by clear
and convincing evidence, that a defendant is liable for either physical abuse
under section 15610.63 or neglect under section 15610.57, and
that the defendant committed the abuse with ‘recklessness, oppression, fraud,
or malice.’ ” (Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group, Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th
148, 156.) “To recover the enhanced remedies available under the Elder Abuse
Act from a health care provider, a plaintiff must prove more than simple or
even gross negligence in the provider's care or custody of the elder.” (Carter
v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 405 (“Carter”.)
“In order to obtain the Act's heightened remedies, a plaintiff must allege
conduct essentially equivalent to conduct that would support recovery of
punitive damages.” (Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32
Cal.4th 771, 789.) Here,
Plaintiff alleges no facts to allege a claim that he was the victim of elder
abuse. Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action for elder
abuse is sustained.
            
            “ ‘ “[T]o state a cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress a plaintiff must show: (1)
outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2) the defendant's intention of causing
or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress; (3) the
plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (4) actual and
proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous
conduct.” ’ ” (Vasquez v. Franklin Management Real Estate Fund, Inc. (2013)
222 Cal.App.4th 819, 832.) Plaintiff’s complaint does not allege any of the
elements to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s sixth cause of action is sustained.
 
            Plaintiff’s seventh and eighth causes of
action fail. “To qualify for declaratory relief under section
1060, plaintiffs were required to show their action (as refined on appeal)
presented two essential elements: ‘(1) a proper subject of declaratory
relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating
to the rights or obligations of a party.’ ” (Lee v. Silveira (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 527, 546.) “A trial court may
grant a preliminary injunction upon a showing that (1) the party seeking the
injunction is likely to prevail on the merits at trial, and (2) the ‘interim
harm’ to that party if an injunction is denied is greater than ‘the [interim]
harm the [opposing party] is likely to suffer if the ... injunction is issued.’
[citation.]” (Integrated Dynamic Solutions, Inc. v. VitaVet Labs, Inc.
(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 1178, 1183.) Here, Plaintiff does not state the basis for
declaratory or injunctive relief. Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s seventh
and eighth causes of action is sustained.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is SUSTAINED with leave 20 days to amend. 
 
            Defendants’
motion to strike is DENIED as moot.
