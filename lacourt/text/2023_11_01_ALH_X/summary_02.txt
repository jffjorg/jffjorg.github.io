And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Joel L. Lofton, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jose G. Sanchez v. Albertsons Companies, Inc., Albertson's LLC, and Does 1 to 50. The case involves a claim by the plaintiff, Jose G. Sanchez, that he suffered injuries from a defective plastic bag dispenser while shopping at a store owned by the defendants. The plaintiff filed a complaint on February 1, 2023.

Counsel Yosi Yahoudai, who represents the plaintiff, moves to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court grants the motion, but delays the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of the signed order on the clients and proof that the clients have been properly served with notice of the next trial date have been filed with the court.

The court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure ยง284(1) and California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362, which provide for the substitution of attorneys. The court also cites Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915, which states that a lawyer violates their ethical mandate by abandoning a client or withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing the client's case.
