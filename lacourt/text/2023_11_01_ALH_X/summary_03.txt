And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendants Roger Capital Management and Ryan Martinentz. The court has sustained the demurrer to Plaintiff Gilbert Ortegon's complaint with leave to amend, meaning that the court has found that the complaint does not state a valid claim and has given Plaintiff 20 days to refile a new complaint.

The court has also denied the motion to strike as moot, meaning that the motion is no longer necessary since the demurrer has been sustained.

The court's ruling is based on several legal principles, including the requirement that a complaint must state a valid claim, the prohibition against unlawful business practices, and the need to show actual controversy in order to obtain declaratory or injunctive relief.

Specifically, the court found that Plaintiff's claims for wrongful eviction, unfair business practice, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, physical, psychological, and financial abuse of a disabled elder person, and other claims were insufficient to state a valid claim.

The court also found that Plaintiff failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for elder abuse and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The court's ruling is subject to change after the parties have had an opportunity to file written objections and the court has had a chance to reconsider its decision.
