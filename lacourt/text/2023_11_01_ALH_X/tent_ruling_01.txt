MOTION
TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Rebecca Valdez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:      Defendant
Kia America, Inc. 
 
SERVICE:                              Filed September 18, 2023
 
OPPOSITION:                       Filed October 19, 2023
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order
compelling compliance with this court’s order from May 9, 2023.  
 
BACKGROUND
 
            This case arises from Plaintiff
Rebecca Valdez’s Song Beverly claim for the purchase of a 2021 Kia Sorento,
Vehicle Identification Number 5XYRL4LC3MG009433 (“Subject Vehicle”). Plaintiff
filed this complaint on January 12, 2022, alleging four causes of action for:
(1) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (d), (2) violation of
Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (b), (3) violation of Civil Code section
1793.2, subdivision (a)(3), and (4) breach of express written warranty.        
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel compliance and request for
sanctions are DENIED.    
 
DISCUSSION
 
            On May 9, 2023, this court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses. Plaintiff provides that Defendant has failed to provide responses to
those discovery requests. (Cohen Decl. ¶ 6.) Defendant provides that it served a further production of
documents on October 19, 2023. (Yong Decl. ¶¶ 5-8.) Plaintiff’s request is
mooted by Defendant’s supplemental responses.
 
            Further, the court notes that Plaintiff’s motion to
compel compliance lacks a statutory basis. Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.210, subdivision (a)(1) provides that a party may respond to a discovery
request by stating it will comply with the demand. Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.320, subdivision (a), provides that a party may move to compel
compliance if a party fails to respond in accordance “with that party’s
statement of compliance.”  Thus, the code
sections cited by Plaintiff do not provide a basis for her to move for an order
compelling compliance with a previous court order. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel compliance and request for
sanctions are DENIED.
 
 
            Moving
party to provide notice.
