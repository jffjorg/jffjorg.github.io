CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV32259
ANNETTE ARTEAGA vs AVEON JAMES et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel
Arin Khodaverdian
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: THE
COURT WILL HEAR FROM COUNSEL ON THE MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 
Background 
 
Attorney Arin Khodaverdian
represents Plaintiff. Khodaverdian moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion¿ 
¿ 
Khodaverdian has
filed Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). Khodaverdian seeks to be relieved
as counsel for Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for
withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the
attorney to withdraw).)  It appears Khodaverdian
deems his inability to reach his client as the basis for claiming that breakdown.  The Court is unclear what efforts
Khodaverdian has made to reach his client and will thus hear from
Khodaverdian.
