Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the joint motion to continue the trial, which was filed by the plaintiff and unopposed by the defendant. The plaintiff had requested a continuance due to recent surgeries and pending authorization for additional lumbar surgery, citing the need for more time for medical treatment and expert analysis. However, the judge found that ongoing injuries and surgeries are typical in personal injury cases and do not independently justify a continuance. The judge also rejected the plaintiff's argument that substitution of counsel on November 7, 2023, required more time for preparation. Additionally, the judge found that the defendant has ample time to resolve a potential conflict of interest between the defendant City of Long Beach and defendant Laranjo. The judge noted that the parties have had ample pre-trial time to complete all necessary discovery and preparations, and that the current trial date already extends beyond the two-year guideline set by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.714.
