And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the contents of the defendant's first set of Requests for Admission (RFAs) are deemed admitted. This is because the plaintiff failed to respond to the RFAs within the statutory deadline. The judge has also ordered sanctions against the plaintiff and his attorney in the amount of $1,268.91, payable to the defendant within 20 days. The judge notes that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the RFAs waived any objections, including those based on privilege or the work product doctrine. The judge has granted the defendant's motion to deem the contents of the RFA, Set One, admitted.
