And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge will hear from Counsel, Arin Khodaverdian, on a motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, Annette Arteaga. Khodaverdian represents the Plaintiff and has cited an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship as the reason for seeking to withdraw. The Judge notes that the Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but only if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The Judge will consider the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and the relevant case law, including Ramirez v. Sturdevant, People v. Prince, and Estate of Falco. The Judge will also consider whether Khodaverdian has made sufficient efforts to reach his client and will hear from Khodaverdian to clarify his claims.
