And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion by the defendant, Jack Vista, to set aside a default judgment entered against him on March 3, 2024. The defendant had claimed that he had no actual notice of the action, but the judge found that the motion was defective on several grounds. Specifically, the motion lacked an affidavit or declaration from the defendant demonstrating his lack of actual notice, and it did not include a copy of the proposed pleading as required by law. Additionally, the motion was filed more than six months after the notice of entry of judgment was served, which made it untimely. As a result, the judge has denied the motion to set aside the default judgment.
