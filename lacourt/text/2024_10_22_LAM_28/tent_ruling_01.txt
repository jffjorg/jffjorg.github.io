BACKGROUND
 
On May 16, 2024, Plaintiff Dongguan Qiaoli
Clothing Co., LTD. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Blum & Sonder
Corp., Feel In, Feel In Apparel, Jung Soo Kim, Jung Tae Kim, and Allen Kim
(collectively “Defendants”), as well as against Does 1 through 10. Plaintiff
alleged causes of action for (1) breach of written agreement, (2) goods sold
and delivered, (3) account stated, (4) open book account, and (5) false
promises. 
 
Plaintiff alleges that Plaintiff entered into
a series of transactions with Defendant Feel In whereby Plaintiff would
manufacture and ship clothing products to Feel In. Plaintiff claims Feel In would
either not pay for these shipments or pay late. Despite Feel In’s promise to
get current on its account, Feel In allegedly owes an outstanding balance of $208,647.90.
Plaintiff claims Feel In has not paid this amount through repeated requests for
payment. Plaintiff alleges that to ensure continued shipments of clothing
products, the other named Defendants guaranteed the remaining balance on the
loans, yet the outstanding balance remains.
 
Plaintiff substitute served all Defendants on
June 5, 2024. The Clerk entered default against all Defendants on July 18,
2024. This is Plaintiff’s first request for entry of default judgment.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) Section 585
permits entry of a judgment after a defendant’s default has been entered.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of
the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the
judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of
costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought; (7) a dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
under CCP Section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8)
exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties. 
CRC 3.1800. 
 
JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court
judgment.  Item number 2 must be
completed.  Item number 8 must be
completed if the Defendant is an individual. 
Plaintiff must submit a proposed form of judgment.  
 
Here, Plaintiff has submitted a proposed form
of judgment, filed CIV-100 Forms for each Defendant, completed Item 8 for all
individual Defendants, and dismissed all Doe defendants. However, Item 2 on
each CIV-100 form is blank, so no CIV-100 form indicates the demand of the
complaint, the costs, the interest, or the amount of attorney fees. 
 
Also, Plaintiff’s proposed form of judgment
inaccurately calculates the amount of attorney fees it is entitled to. Plaintiff
seeks attorney fees under Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.214(a). This
rule states that in cases where a statute provides for attorney fees, if the
Defendant is in default, and the total damages sought are over $100,000.00, the plaintiff can recover $2,890 plus 1% of
the excess over $100,000.00 in attorney fees. The applicable statute, Civil
Code Section 1717.5, entitles Plaintiff to recover attorney fees because
Plaintiff brings a contract action based on a book account. Moreover, Plaintiff
seeks to recover $208,647.90, and Defendants have defaulted as to this amount. Therefore,
Plaintiff may recover $2,890.00 plus 1% of $108,647.90, which is the excess
over $100,000.00. This total amount is $3,976.48 ($2,890.00 + $1,086.48).
However, Plaintiff seeks attorney fees for $4,976.48 which would be the total
of $2,890.00 + 1% of all of the $208,647.90 due on the book account. 
 
The
Court cannot sign the current proposed form of judgment as the attorney fee
award is inaccurate. Plaintiff must correct and refile the proposed form of
judgment, the accompanying attorney declaration, and the CIV-100 forms with items
2 and 7 completed.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment in its favor and against
Defendants Blum & Sonder
Corp., Feel In, Feel In Apparel, Jung Soo Kim, Jung Tae Kim, and Allen Kim is
DENIED.
