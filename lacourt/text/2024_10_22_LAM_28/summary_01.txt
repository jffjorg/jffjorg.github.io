The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendants. The plaintiff, Dongguan Qiaoli Clothing Co., LTD., filed a complaint against the defendants, alleging breach of written agreement, goods sold and delivered, account stated, open book account, and false promises. The plaintiff claims that the defendant, Feel In, owes an outstanding balance of $208,647.90 and has not paid this amount through repeated requests for payment. The judge finds that the plaintiff's proposed form of judgment is inaccurate and therefore denies the request for entry of default judgment. The judge orders the plaintiff to correct and refile the proposed form of judgment and accompanying documents before the court can consider the request again.
