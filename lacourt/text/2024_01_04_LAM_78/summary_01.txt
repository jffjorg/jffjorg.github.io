Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has granted Cross-Defendant Kouroush Yaghoobian's motion to compel Cross-Complainant Del Sol Property Management's further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One. Del Sol must serve further verified responses within 20 days after the date of this order. Sanctions are granted in the reduced amount of $800, payable within 30 days of this order. The Court finds that Del Sol's responses to certain Special Interrogatories were nonresponsive and failed to provide the required information. The motion was granted because Del Sol unsuccessfully opposed Yaghoobian's motions to compel further responses, and the Court does not find that Del Sol acted with substantial justification in opposing the motions.
