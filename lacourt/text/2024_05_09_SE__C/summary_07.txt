```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the Demurrer by the Defendant, BELLFLOWER UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, to the Plaintiff's Complaint is OVERRULED. The Plaintiff, JANE MH DOE, alleges that she was sexually abused by her teacher, BARRETT, while she was in the 8th grade. The Defendant argued that the retroactive elimination of the claim presentation requirement for childhood sexual abuse claims that arose before 2009 in AB 218 is unconstitutional under the Anti-Gift Provision of the California Constitution. However, the court finds that the effect of AB 218 does not constitute a "gift of public money or thing of value" within the meaning of the Anti-Gift Provision. Therefore, the court has overruled the Defendant's Demurrer and the Plaintiff's Complaint will proceed.
