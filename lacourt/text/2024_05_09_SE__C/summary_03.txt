And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion for an order seeking discovery concerning plaintiff's sexual conduct with individuals other than the alleged perpetrator. The court has determined that the defendants have shown a need for the evidence to assess the extent of the plaintiff's injuries, and that the plaintiff's constitutional right to privacy is not an absolute right. The court has allowed the defendants to discover specific information about the plaintiff's sexual conduct, but not the entire scope of the plaintiff's sexual conduct. The parties have agreed to a narrower scope of discovery, and the motion is rendered moot as to the issues resolved between the parties.
