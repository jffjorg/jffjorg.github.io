HOPKINSON
CASE NO.:  24NWCV00750
HEARING:  05/09/24
 
#5
 
Defendant MARILYN HOPKINSON’s Motion to Set the Judgment is DENIED. 
The request to Quash any Writ of Possession/Execution is MOOT. 
 
Opposing Party to give Notice. 
 
No Reply filed as of May 6, 2024.  
 
This action for unlawful detainer was filed on March 11,
2024. Judgment after Court trial was entered against Defendants MARILYN
HOPKINSON (“Defendant Hopkinson”) and TIUPITA LEIATUAUA on April 16, 2024. 
 
Defendant Hopkinson moves to set aside the judgment under
CCP §473(b) and/or on the basis that the judgment entered against her is void
because it is based, in whole or in part, on external fraud or mistake. 
 
CCP §473(d)
 
At any time, “[t]he court…may on motion of either party
after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.” (CCP
§473(d).) 
 
To the extent Defendant Hopkinson argues that the judgment
entered on April 16, 2024 is void, that argument is rejected. Defendant Hopkinson
offers no argument or evidence to suggest that the judgment is void on its
face. 
 
CCP §473(b) 
 
Defendant Hopkinson states she received notice that trial
was scheduled for April 16, 2024, but she was confused and went to Court to
inquire.  She was told that trial was
scheduled for August 5, 2024, and she need not appear on April 16, 2024.  However, Defendant Hopkinson submits nothing
to document what she was told by the Court. 
Her request for relief under CCP §473(b) is DENIED.
 
Equitable Relief
 
Where statutory relief is unavailable, a trial court has
inherent, equitable power to set aside a judgment on the ground of extrinsic
fraud or mistake. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981.)  No evidence of fraud or mistake is proffered,
which would support a basis for equitable relief.
