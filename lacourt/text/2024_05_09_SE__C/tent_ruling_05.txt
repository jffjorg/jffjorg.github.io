Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Oppositions filed as of May 6, 2024. 
 
Motions to
Compel  
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed fails to respond at
all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers
thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the
discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond
has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party
is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the
matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial
discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely
filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all
objections. 
 
Here,
Defendant has shown that Form Interrogatories (set one), Special
Interrogatories (set one), and Request for Production of Documents (set one)
were properly served onto Defendant Bencomo on June 12, 2023. The deadlines to
respond have expired, and no responses of any kind have been provided.  These Motions were filed February 22, 2024— about
eight months after service of the discovery. As of May 6, 2024, no Oppositions
have been filed to the subject Motions. 
 
Therefore,
the Motions to Compel are GRANTED,
and Defendant FRANCISCO BENCOMO JR. is ORDERED
to provide verified responses and documents, without objection by no later
than 15 days from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may
be extended by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it
will be tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this
Court’s order. 
 
Motion to
Deem Admitted 
 
The
unopposed Motion to Deem Matters Admitted as to Defendant FRANCISCO BENCOMO JR.
is GRANTED. 
 
“If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests…. The Court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210,
2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) the party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect…. (c) The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7…on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (CCP §2033.280.)  Unverified
responses “are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) No prior attempt to resolve the
matter informally is required. 
 
Here,
RFAs were propounded on or about June 12, 2023. 
 
To
the Court’s knowledge, Defendant has failed to provide any responses.
Therefore, the unopposed Motion is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
are mandatory pursuant to the terms of CCP §2033.280(c).  Given that simplicity of the motion and the
lack of opposition, Defendant ALLEN JOSEPH CHARBONNET, SR. and his counsel of
record are jointly and severally ORDERED
to pay Plaintiff and their counsel of record sanctions in the reasonable sum of
$761.25.00 (two hours at the standard rate of $350/hour plus costs) no later
than 30 days from the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be
extended by agreement of the parties.
