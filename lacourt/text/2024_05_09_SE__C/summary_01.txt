And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to tax costs, which was filed on January 31, 2024. The motion seeks to tax three items of costs incurred by the plaintiff, including a filing fee for the notice of appeal and costs for printing and copying of briefs. The defendant's counsel claims that the failure to timely file the motion was due to excusable neglect, as they were not aware that the Memorandum of Costs had been filed until January 16, 2024. The court grants the defendant's request for an extension to file the motion. The court denies the motion as to Cost Item Number 1, which includes a filing fee for the notice of appeal, and grants the motion as to Cost Item Number 4, which includes costs for printing and copying of briefs. The court denies the motion as to Cost Item Number 6, which includes costs for transmitting, filing, and service of record, briefs, and other papers.
