CENTERCAL, LLC v. WOKCANO CERRITOS, LLC 
CASE NO.:  24NWCV00981
HEARING:  05/09/24
 
#6
 
Defendant WOKCANO CERRITOS, LLC’s motion to quash service of
summons and complaint is CONTINUED to Thursday, May 16, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in
Dept. SE-C. 
 
Moving Party to give Notice.
 
Defendant WOKCANO CERRITOS, LLC (“Defendant”) moves to quash
service of summons on the ground that the Summons and Complaint were not served
upon an individual authorized to accept service on behalf of Defendant.  
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant fails to
rebut the presumption of proper service.  
 
On May 8, 2024, Defendant filed an untimely Reply, without
leave of Court. Defendant’s Reply was supposed to be filed and served by no
later than May 6, 2024. (See 05/01/24 M.O.) Defendant’s untimely Reply
contained new evidence, not submitted in conjunction with the Moving Papers
(the Declaration of Rose Cardonez).  The
general rule is that evidence supporting a motion should normally be submitted
with the Moving Papers. (See Id.) However, the Court has discretion to consider
evidence submitted for the first time with the moving party’s reply papers, as
long as the opposing party is given an opportunity to object and to respond to
the reply evidence. (See, e.g., California Retail Portfolio Fund GMBH &
Co. KG v. Hopkins Real Estate Group (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 849, 861.) 
 
In the interests of justice, and in favor of adjudicating
this matter on the merits, the Court exercises its discretion to consider the
untimely Reply and the new evidence contained therein. In order to ensure that
there is no prejudice to the Opposing party, this matter is CONTINUED to next
Thursday (this is unlawful detainer action entitled to priority), as indicated
above. Plaintiff/Opposing Party is granted leave to file and serve a
Supplemental Opposition by no later than 3:00 p.m. on May 13, 2024. Defendant/Moving
Party is granted to leave to file and serve a Supplemental Reply by no later
than 9:00 a.m. on May 14, 2024. Untimely filed supplemental briefs will not be
considered.
