And here is the English text summary:

The court has denied, without prejudice, the ex parte application by Gutierrez Family Investment Partnership, LP to shorten the time for hearing on its motion to set aside default and judgment. The reason for the denial is that the applicant failed to comply with the notice requirements set forth by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1204(b)(1), which requires that a declaration regarding notice must accompany an ex parte application. The declaration must state the notice given, including the date, time, manner, and name of the party informed. Additionally, if notice was provided later than 10:00 a.m. the court day before the ex parte appearance, the declaration must explain why. Since no such declaration was attached to or lodged with the ex parte application, the application is procedurally defective and must be denied without prejudice.
