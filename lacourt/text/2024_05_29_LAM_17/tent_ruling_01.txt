 Case
  No.:  22STCV39704
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 29, 2024



 
Plaintiffs’
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. 
 
On
12/21/2022, Plaintiffs You Li and Jane Wenjun Sha (collectively, Defendants)
filed suit against Travis Bayles, Alan Quach, Sanborn Collective, LLC, and
Urban Asset Group, LLC, alleging: (1) promissory fraud; (2) fraudulent
concealment; (3) violation of Penal Code section 496; (4) breach of promissory
note; (5) intentional interference with contract; (6) breach of guaranty; and
(7) breach of guaranty. 
 
            On
2/2/2024, Plaintiffs moved for summary adjudication of the first, fourth, fifth,
and sixth causes of action. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiffs
argue they have established their first, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of
action.
 
I.                  
Promissory Fraud 
 
“The elements of promissory fraud . . .
are: (1) a promise made regarding a material fact without any intention of
performing it; (2) the existence of the intent not to perform at the time the
promise was made; (3) intent to deceive or induce the promise to enter into a
transaction; (4) reasonable reliance by the promisee; (5) nonperformance by the
party making the promise; and (6) resulting damage to the promise.” (Rossberg
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1498.) Promissory
fraud must be alleged with particularity. (Id.) “The particularity
demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and
by what means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of
America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)  
 
To establish
their claim of promissory fraud, Plaintiff submitted evidence that:
 
-        
In November 2018, Plaintiffs met with
Defendants Bayles and Quach at Bayles’ office in Pasadena, California to
discuss the acquisition and development of the real property located at 1119
Sanborn Avenue, Los Angeles, California (“Sanborn Property”), by a company that
Bayles controlled, Defendant Sanborn Collective, LLC (“Sanborn”). (SS 1.) 
 
-        
At that meeting, Defendants Bayles and
Quach verbally promised that if Plaintiffs lent Sanborn the sum of $800,000
that: (i) that sum would be used by Sanborn solely to acquire and develop the
Sanborn Property for resale; (ii) that Defendants would record a
second-priority deed of trust against the Sanborn Property to secure the
$800,000 loan; and (iii) that Defendant Quach would personally guarantee the
repayment of the loan. (SS 2.)
 
-        
On or about December 12, 2018, in
reliance on Defendants’ promises, Plaintiffs and Liqun Li agreed to make a loan
in the original principal amount of $800,000 to Defendant Sanborn (“Sanborn
Loan”). Liqun Li is the father of Plaintiff You Li and he has assigned his
interest in the Sanborn Loan, as well as any related claims, to Plaintiff You
Li. (SS 3.) 
 
-        
Plaintiffs fully funded the Sanborn
Loan. (SS 4.)  
 
-        
The Sanborn Loan is evidenced by that
certain Secured Promissory Note (the “Sanborn Note”) for the principal sum of
$800,000 (the “Principal Sum”) with a maturity date of 16 months, or April 12,
2020. (SS 14.) 
 
-        
The Sanborn Note specifically states
that “The Borrower covenants and agrees that the entire proceeds of the Loan
evidenced by this Promissory Note is being used by the Borrower in connection
with the acquisition costs of that certain real property and improvements
thereupon … commonly referred to as 1119 Sanborn Avenue, Los Angeles,
California.” (SS 15.) 
 
-        
Subsequently, in 2022, Plaintiffs
learned through a title search that Defendant Bayles never used the funds to
acquire the Sanborn Property and never recorded a second deed of trust to
secure Plaintiffs’ interest in the Sanborn Property. (SS 5.)
 
-        
 In response to Plaintiffs’ numerous requests
for updated on the Sanborn Property, Defendants Bayles and Quach provided
Plaintiffs with false information. For example:
 
o  
Bayles and Quach did not admit that
Sanborn did not acquire the Sanborn Property until 2022, when Plaintiffs
confronted him with the title report.
o  
Bayles and Quach did not inform
Plaintiffs that the second deed of trust securing the Sanborn Loan had not been
recorded until April 2019.
o  
In early June of 2022, Bayles and Quach
did not inform Plaintiffs that the Sanborn Property had been under foreclosure
proceedings initiated by the senior lien holder for several month.
o  
In August of 2022, when Plaintiffs
inquired about the status of the Sanborn project, Bayles and Quach did not
inform Plaintiffs of the foreclosure had already occurred in late June of 2022
and instead represented that they were still working on a sale of the Sanborn
Property.
 
(SS 6.) 
 
-        
Plaintiffs recently reviewed the bank
statements for Sanborn, produced by Defendants in response to discovery
requests and learned, for the first time, that immediately after taking
Plaintiffs’ money, Defendant Bayles utilized the funds to purchase other properties
and to pay for other projects unbeknownst to Plaintiffs and without Plaintiffs’
consent. (SS 7.) 
 
-        
By May 31, 2019, the Sanborn account
had a balance of $2,235.04; almost all of our funds (the sum of $800,000.00)
had been depleted from Defendant Sanborn’s account and transferred to Defendant
Bayles’ personal and other business account. (SS 8.) 
 
-        
Defendant Bayles made six (6) payments
totaling over $150,000 for another project located on Citrus Avenue; a payment
of $100,000 for a projected located on Queensbury Avenue; a payment of $29,310
for a projected located on Brunswick Avenue; and, a payment of $70,000 for a
project located on Sumner Avenue. (SS 9.) 
 
-        
Defendant Bayles also caused Sanborn to
transfer over $175,000 to his company TBayles, Inc. and Alan Quach received
over $125,000, there was also $75,000 in cash withdrawals; all by May 31, 2019.
(SS 10.) 
 
-        
Based on the false information provided
by Bayles and the rapid depletion of funds from Sanborn’s bank account, Bayles
and Quach never had the intent to perform their promise to use the $800,000
solely for the Sanborn project. (SS 11.) 
 
-        
Had Plaintiffs known that Bayles and
Quach were going to use the Sanborn Loan to fund other projects, Plaintiffs
would have never made the Sanborn Loan. (SS 12.) 
 
-        
Plaintiffs are entitled to damages on
the First Cause of Action for Promissory Fraud for damages of $800,000.00, plus
interest of $220,464.54 at the statutory rate of seven percent (7%) for a tort
claim, after the date that repayment was due, April 12, 2020, to March 19,
2024, the date of the hearing, or a total of $1,020,464.54. (SS 13.) 
 
Taken
together, Plaintiffs’ evidence supports a reasonable inference that:
 
(1)
Plaintiffs agreed to lend $800,000 money for the express purpose of acquiring
and developing the Sanborn Property for resale; 
 
(2)
Defendants promised to (i) that sum would be used by Sanborn solely to acquire
and develop the Sanborn Property for resale; (ii) that Defendants would record
a second-priority deed of trust against the Sanborn Property to secure the
$800,000 loan; and, (iii) that Defendant Quach would personally guarantee the
repayment of the loan;
 
(3)
Defendants never intended to comply with their promises, and intended to
deceive Plaintiffs in order to procure the loan money;
 
(4)
Defendants used $725,000 of the $800,000 for non-Sanborn purposes, causing
Plaintiffs damage. 
 
            Accordingly,
the burden shifts to Defendants to disclose a triable fact as to this issue.
 
            Defendants
did not oppose this motion, and thus have failed to meet their burden. 
 
II.              
Breach of Promissory Note

 
The elements
of this cause of action are: (1) the execution and delivery of a promissory
note; (2) the plaintiffs’ performance under the promissory note; (3) default of
the promissory note; and (4) the plaintiffs have been damaged by reason of the
failure to pay. (4 Witkin, California Procedure Pleading, §476 (4th ed. 1997); Thompson
v. Koeller (1920) 183 Cal. 47.)
 
In support of
this cause of action, Plaintiffs submitted evidence that:
 
-        
A representative of Sanborn executed
and delivered the Note to Plaintiffs and that Plaintiffs funded the Sanborn
Loan. (SS Nos. 4, 14.)
 
-        
The Sanborn Note specifically states
that “The Borrower covenants and agrees that the entire proceeds of the Loan
evidenced by this Promissory Note is being used by the Borrower in connection
with the acquisition costs of that certain real property and improvements
thereupon … commonly referred to as 1119 Sanborn Avenue, Los Angeles,
California.” (SS No. 15.) 
 
-        
Plaintiffs fulfilled all of their
obligations under the Sanborn Note. (SS 18.)
 
-        
Sanborn defaulted on its payment
obligations under the Sanborn by failing to pay the outstanding balances due on
the maturity date and thereafter. (SS 19.) 
 
-        
Starting in July of 2020, Defendants
demanded repayment of the Sanborn Loan. (SS 20.) 
 
-        
Despite Plaintiffs’ demands for
Defendants Sanborn and Quach to immediately pay in full all of the indebtedness
and obligations, the Defendants have failed do so. (SS 22.) 
 
-        
Plaintiffs are entitled to damages for
the principal balance of $800,000.00, plus interest of $315,958.90 at the
statutory rate of ten percent (10%) for contract claims from the date of
default, April 12, 2020, to March 19, 2024, the date of the hearing of this
Motion, or a total of $1,115,958.90. (SS 23.)
 
Taken
together, this evidence supports a reasonable inference that: (1)
representatives of Sanborn executed and delivered the Note to Plaintiffs and
that Plaintiffs funded the Sanborn Loan. (SS Nos. 4, 14.); (2) that Sanborn
defaulted on its payment obligations under its Note by failing to pay the
outstanding balances due on the maturity date and thereafter (SS Nos. 18, 19.);
and (3) that Plaintiffs were damaged as a result of Sanborn’s failure to
satisfy its payment obligations under the Sanborn Note. (SS Nos. 22, 23.)
 
Accordingly,
the burden shifts to Defendants to disclose a triable issue of material fact. 
 
Defendants
did not oppose this motion, and thus have failed to meet their burden. 
 
III.           
Intentional Interference
with Contract
 
“The tort of
intentional interference with contract requires allegations of the following
elements: “(1) a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party; (2)
defendant’s knowledge of this contract; (3) defendant’s intentional acts
designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; (4)
actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; and (5) resulting
damage.” (CRST Van Expedited, Inc. v. Werner Enterprises, Inc. (9th Cir.
2007) 479 F.3d 1099, 1105, quoting Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co.
(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 55.) 
 
To establish
this claim, Plaintiffs submitted evidence that:
 
-        
Defendant Sanborn and Plaintiffs have a
valid contract, the Sanborn Note, whereby Plaintiffs’ lent Defendant Sanborn
$800,000. (SS 24.) 
 
-        
Defendant Bayles was aware of the
Sanborn Note because he signed the Note on behalf of Sanborn. Defendant Quach
was aware of the Sanborn Note because he signed the Sanborn Guaranty, which
expressly referred to the Sanborn Note.
 
-        
Defendants
Bayles and Quach caused significant sums of money from Sanborn’s bank account
to be used for other projects, payments to TBayles, Inc., payments to Quach,
and large cash withdrawals. (SS 26.) 
 
-        
Defendant
Sanborn breached the Sanborn Note by failing to repay the principal and
interest on the maturity date. (SS 27.) 
 
Ownership and control of an entity do
not by themselves relieve a defendant from tort liability for interfering with
the entity's contracts. Rather, the tort liability of an owner, director, or
manager depends on whether he or she was acting to protect the interests of the
entity. Thus, the owner of an entity enjoys a
qualified privilege to terminate a contract to which the entity is a party,
provided that the owner's predominant purpose in inducing the breach is to
further the entity's interests. And a manager likewise enjoys a qualified
privilege to induce the entity to breach a contract that he or she reasonably
believes to be harmful to the entity's best interests. A manager need not be
acting solely in his or her employer's interests in order to claim the
privilege; all that is required is proof that the employer's interest was one
of the factors motivating his or her conduct or advice. (Wanland v.
Los Gatos Lodge, Inc. (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1507, 1522.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ evidence supports a reasonable
inference that there was a contractual relationship between Plaintiffs and
Defendant Sanborn, that Defendants Quach and Bayles knew of the existence of
the Sanborn Note, and that they took acts substantially certain to induce a
breach or disruption of the contractual relational, and that those actions were
not to protect the interests of Sanborn but were to further their own personal
aims at the expense of the contract between Sanborn and Plaintiff. As a result
of Defendants Bayles and Quach’s actions, Defendant Sanborn was unable to repay
the Sanborn Loan on the maturity date of April 12, 2020, resulting in the
breach of the Sanborn Note and subsequent damages to Plaintiffs.
 
Accordingly, the burden shifts to Defendants to disclose
a triable issue of material fact. 
 
Defendants
did not oppose this motion, and thus have failed to meet their burden. 
 
IV.           
Breach of Guaranty
 
To prevail
its claim for breach of the Guaranty, Plaintiffs must establish: (1) there is a
valid Guaranty agreement, (2) the borrowers have defaulted, (3) the Defendant
Quach failed to perform under his Guaranty agreement, and (4) Plaintiffs have
been damaged as a result. (Torrey Pines Bank v. Superior Court (1989)
216 Cal.App.3d 813, 819; Reichert v. General Ins. Co. (1968) 68 Cal.2d
822, 830.) 
 
Plaintiffs
submitted evidence that Defendant Quach personally guaranteed the Sanborn Loan.
(SS 16,17.) Plaintiff submitted evidence that Sanborn defaulted on the Sanborn
Note by failing to pay the principal and interest upon maturity. (UMF No. 31.) 
 
Plaintiffs’
evidence supports a reasonable inference that Defendant Quach has breached the
Sanborn Guaranty. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Defendants to disclose a
triable issue of material fact. 
 
Defendants
did not oppose this motion, and thus have failed to meet their burden. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
