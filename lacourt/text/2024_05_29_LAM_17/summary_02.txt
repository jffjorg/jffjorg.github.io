And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has identified several deficiencies in the Plaintiff's default judgment packet. Specifically, the Plaintiff's claim of $66,000 as the value of the vehicle is based on an auction of a similar vehicle, but no evidence was provided to support this claim. Additionally, the Plaintiff did not submit title documentation to establish ownership of the vehicle. The Court is requiring the Plaintiff to submit evidence of the auction value and title documentation to establish ownership of the vehicle.
