English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiffs, You Li et al., alleged that the Defendants, Travis Bayles et al., fraudulently induced them to lend $800,000 to Sanborn Collective, LLC (Sanborn) for real estate development. The Defendants used the funds for personal expenses and other projects instead of the original purpose. The judge found that the Plaintiffs have established their claims of promissory fraud, breach of promissory note, intentional interference with contract, and breach of guaranty. The judge granted the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and the Defendants did not oppose the motion.
