And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a writ petition related to the valuation of possessory interests in providing broadband and telephone services. The court has reviewed the appraisal report by Cushman & Wakefield and the decision by the Court of Appeal. The Assessor has responded to the petition, but the court finds that the Assessor's arguments are unpersuasive. The court is not convinced by the Assessor's interpretation of the Court of Appeal's use of the word "may" and notes that the decision must be interpreted as a whole, citing the Ayyad v. Sprint Spectrum, L.P. (2012) decision. The court also finds that the Assessor failed to respond to a chart presented by Time Warner, which accurately summarized and simplified the calculations in the appraisal report.
