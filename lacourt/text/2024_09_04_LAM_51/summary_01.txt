Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Upinder S. Kalra, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Danita Daley v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, et al. The case involves a dispute over an arbitration award issued on May 7, 2024, in favor of the defendant, Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, in the amount of $59,393.63.

The judge has granted the defendant's petition to confirm the arbitration award, finding that the petition meets the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 1285.4, CCP § 1290.4, and CCP § 1283.6. The judge has also ordered the defendant to provide a proposed judgment consistent with this ruling within 14 days of the ruling.

The dispute arises from the plaintiff's claim that she was discriminated and retaliated against and wrongfully terminated by her former employer, Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, for making complaints about timekeeping violations and patient safety concerns. The defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay action, which was granted, and the case was subsequently referred to arbitration. The arbitrator issued an award in favor of the defendant, which the plaintiff is challenging.

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the facts of the case, including the arbitration award, the parties' conduct, and the applicable laws and regulations. The judge has concluded that the defendant has demonstrated that the arbitration award is valid and should be confirmed, and that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any grounds for vacating or correcting the award.
