And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by Gary Torpy, one of the defendants, to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Hui Jin "Becky" Brooks, the plaintiff. The FAC alleges eight causes of action, including breach of contract, fraud, professional negligence, and conspiracy.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent inducement, finding that the FAC alleges sufficient facts to support this claim. The judge has also overruled the demurrer to the seventh cause of action for professional negligence, finding that the FAC alleges sufficient facts to support this claim.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the eighth cause of action for conspiracy, finding that the FAC alleges sufficient facts to support this claim despite the lack of a court order permitting the claim to be brought.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer to the FAC within 10 days. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
