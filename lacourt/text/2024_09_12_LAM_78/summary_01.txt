And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Wilmington's motion to expunge the lis pendens (a notice of pending action) and for sanctions. The lis pendens was recorded by the Plaintiffs on October 18, 2022, and Wilmington moved to expunge it on June 26, 2024. The judge found that the Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof to show the probable validity of their real property claim, and therefore the lis pendens was expunged. The judge also awarded sanctions to Wilmington in the amount of $2,430.00.
