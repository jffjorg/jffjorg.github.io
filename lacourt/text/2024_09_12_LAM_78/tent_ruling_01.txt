[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO EXPUNGE
  LIS PENDENS



 
I.
        BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Grover Henry Colin Nix IV, and Grover Henry Nix
III, Trustee of Soames Lane Trust (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed their
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against defendants JPMorgan
Chase Bank (“Chase Bank”), Wilmington Trust, N.A. (“Wilmington”), Structured
Asset Mortgage Investment II Trust 2007-AR7, Inc. (“SAMI”), and Wells Fargo
& Company (“Wells Fargo”) for allegations arising from a wrongful
foreclosure of residential real property commonly known as 2651 Aberdeen
Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90027.
On June 26, 2024, Wilmington filed the instant motion to expunge
lis pendens and for sanctions.
Plaintiffs oppose the motion, and Wilmington filed a reply.
 
II.
       REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Wilmington’s request for judicial notice of various recorded
documents and court records is granted. (Evid. Code § 452; Evans v.
California Trailer Court, Inc. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 540, 549.) 
 
III.      LEGAL
STANDARD
Any party or a non-party having an interest in
the property affected by a notice of lis pendens may move for expungement any
time after the lis pendens is recorded. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.30.) A lis
pendens must be removed for being improper on account of (a) the pleading on
which the notice is based not containing a real property claim, assuming the
allegations to be true, or (b) the claimant not being able to establish by a
preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 405.31, 405.32; Ziello v. Superior Court (1995) 36
Cal.App.4th 321, 331-32; Urez Corp. v. Superior Court (1987) 190
Cal.App.3d 1141, 1149.)
 
In a motion to expunge a notice of lis pendens,
the claimant who filed the lis pendens has the burden of proof. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 405.30.) Thus, that claimant, in opposing the motion to expunge the
lis pendens, must demonstrate the following: (1) the action affects title to or
right of possession of the real property described in the notice; (2) in so far
as the said notice is concerned, the party recording the notice has commenced
the action for a proper purpose and in good faith; and (3) the probable validity
of the real property claim by a preponderance of the evidence. (Hunting
World, Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 67, 70; see also Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.30, et seq.) Only admissible evidence is permitted on the
motion. (Burger v. Superior Court (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 1013, 1019.)
The prevailing party on a motion to expunge lis
pendens is entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, “unless the court
finds that the other party acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of attorney's fees and costs unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.38.)
 
IV.       DISCUSSION
Wilmington moves to expunge the Notice of Pending Action
against the real property located at 2651 Aberdeen Avenue, Los Angeles, CA
90027 (“Property”) recorded by Plaintiffs on October 18, 2022 in the L.A.
County Recorder’s Office as Instrument Number 20220998312.
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the motion is moot
because they have voluntarily withdrawn the lis pendens following the Court’s
August 24, 2024 ruling on SAMI’s motion to quash. They argue that up until the
motion to quash ruling, the lis pendens was appropriate. Plaintiffs also filed
a separate document stating that they released and withdrew the lis pendens. 
In reply, Wilmington argues that the motion is not moot
because there has been no proof of recording of the withdrawal, and they did
not meet their burden of proof to show a probable validity of a real property
claim. 
Here, Plaintiffs do not provide evidence showing that their
notice of withdrawal of lis pendens has been recorded. Therefore, even though
the notice of withdrawal has been filed and served, there may be an outstanding
notice of pendency on the Property in this action. Thus, based on the evidence
provided, the motion to expunge lis pendens is not moot. 
Based on the representation that Plaintiffs have withdrawn
the lis pendens, and Plaintiffs’ lack of argument as to the probable validity
of the claim, the motion is GRANTED. Plaintiffs have failed to meet their
burden of proof.
As to sanctions, Plaintiffs only argue that sanctions should
be denied because up until the motion to quash was granted, the lis pendens was
appropriate. However, there is no argument as to the probable validity of the
claim up until that point. Thus, Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden, and as
such, Wilmington is the prevailing party and Plaintiffs do not show any
circumstances making the imposition unjust. Wilmington requests sanctions in
the amount of $4,721 based on 6.8 hours to meet and confer and draft the
motion; another 5 hours to review the opposition, draft the reply, and attend
the hearing all at the rate of $395 per hour; and a filing fee of $60. (Fink
Decl., ¶6.) The Court finds the amount excessive and will award a total of 6
hours at the rate of $395 per hour plus the $60 filing fee for a total of $2,430.00.

 
V.        CONCLUSION
Wilmington’s motion to expunge lis pendens and for sanctions
in the amount of $2,430.00 is GRANTED. Sanctions are ordered against Plaintiff’s
counsel and must be paid within 10 days.
 
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
