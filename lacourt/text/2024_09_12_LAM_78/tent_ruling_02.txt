[TENTATIVE] RULING
  RE: 
 
DEFENDANT gary torpy’S demurrer to first amended complaint
 



 
Defendant
Gary Torpy’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint is OVERRULED.
 
Factual
Background
This is a contractual fraud action.
The First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleges as follows:
On or about October 11, 2013, Plaintiff
Hui Jin “Becky” Brooks loaned Defendant Bradford J. Neal $800,000.00, secured
by Defendant Neal’s property located at 1716 Main Street, Suite 2, Venice, CA
90291 with a Deed of Trust. (FAC ¶¶5-6, 22-24.) On or around November 15, 2013,
Defendant Neal offered Plaintiff an unsigned amendment to the loan, which was
drafted by Defendant Gary Torpy. (FAC ¶¶25-26.) Defendant Torpy advised
Defendant Neal to have Plaintiff either sign the amendment or remove the
security interest on the loan and threaten to withhold payment to Plaintiff.
(FAC ¶34.)

DiscussioN
 
 
I.              
DEMURRER
 
“The primary function of a pleading
is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation],
and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be
said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica
(2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)  
“A¿demurrer¿tests the legal sufficiency of the
factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The
Court looks to whether “the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause
of action or discloses a complete defense.” (Id.) The Court does not
“read passages from a complaint in isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a
demurrer, we read the complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their context.’
[Citation.]” (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th
780, 804.) The Court “assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded factual
allegations, facts that reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded
and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra,
56 Cal.4th p. 240.) “The court does not, however, assume the truth of
contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  
A general demurrer may be brought
under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if insufficient
facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under section
430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of
the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in
Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special
demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).)  
Leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.)   
A.   Meet and Confer
Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a)(3).)   
Defendant Torpy advances the
declaration of his counsel or record, Marta A. Alcumbrac attesting to meet and
confer efforts prior to the filing of the instant demurrer. Specifically,
Alcumbrac avers that she engaged in two lengthy telephone calls with
Plaintiff’s counsel discussing the merits of the allegations and the issues to
be raised in the demurrer. (Alcumbrac Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.) 
Therefore, Defendant Torpy has
complied with the meet and confer requirement. 
B.   Merits of Demurrer
Defendant Torpy demurs to the
fourth, seventh, and eighth causes of action on the grounds that Plaintiff
fails to state a viable claim. Defendant Torpy also contends the eighth cause
of action does not comply with Civil Code Section 1714.10. 
 
Fourth Cause of Action for
Fraudulent Inducement
 
First, Defendant Torpy asserts the
fourth cause of action fails because the FAC does not allege facts supporting a
false misrepresentation made to Plaintiff nor facts of Plaintiff’s reliance on
such misrepresentations. 
 
“The essential elements of fraud,
generally, are (1) a misrepresentation; (2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to
induce reliance; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.” (City
of Industry v. City of Fillmore (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 191, 211.) “Each
element must be pleaded with particularity so as to apprise the defendant of
the specific grounds for the charge and enable the court to determine whether
there is any basis for the cause of action, although less specificity is
required if the defendant would likely have greater knowledge of the facts than
the plaintiff.” (Id.)
 
The FAC re-alleges and re-pleads the
allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs. (FAC ¶142.) The FAC alleges
that Defendant Torpy intentionally made false, misleading statements to
Plaintiff that the Notes containing the language “This Note was made and
arranged by Maker [Defendant Neal], a licensed real estate broker” complied
with the Broker’s Exception to Usury Laws. (FAC ¶143(f).) The FAC alleges that
Defendant Torpy made this representation to her with intent to induce her
agreement to the Notes. (FAC ¶144(f).) The FAC alleges that the
misrepresentation occurred in 2016 and Plaintiff relied on the representation
by consenting to the loans. (FAC ¶¶144(f), 148-150.) The FAC alleges that in
January 2023, Defendant Neal claimed the transactions are usurious. (FAC ¶154.)
 
In reading the FAC as a whole and
taking the allegations as true, Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts to support
the fourth cause of action. Defendant’s arguments go to the merits of the cause
of action, which the Court will not consider here.
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the
fourth cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
 
Seventh Cause of Action for
Professional Negligence
 
Next, Defendant Torpy argues that he
owed no duty to Plaintiff and no conduct by him caused or could have caused
Plaintiff’s alleged damages. 
 
“The elements of a claim for
professional negligence are: ‘(1) the duty of the professional to use such
skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of his profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection
between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or
damage resulting from the professional's negligence.’” (Paul v. Patton
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1095.)  “It
is well established that an attorney has an independent legal duty to refrain
from defrauding nonclients.” (Rickley v. Goodfriend (2013) 212
Cal.App.4th 1136, 1151.)
 
The FAC re-alleges and re-pleads the
allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs. (FAC ¶180.) The FAC alleges
that Defendant Torpy provided legal advice to Plaintiff and neither recommended
nor suggested Plaintiff seek independent legal advice at any point during the
mid-2016 phone call. (FAC ¶¶100-101.) The FAC alleges that Defendant Torpy did
not explain to Plaintiff that he only represented Defendant Neal during this
call. (FAC ¶103.) The FAC alleges after providing legal advice to Plaintiff for
two years, on January 9, 2018, Defendant Torpy sent Plaintiff an email stating
he is only representing Defendant Neal. (FAC ¶109.)
 
In reading the FAC as a whole and
taking the allegations as true, Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts to support
the seventh cause of action. Here, again, Defendant inappropriately argues the
merits of the cause of action.
 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the
seventh cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
 
Eighth Cause of Action for Civil
Conspiracy
Moreover, Defendant Torpy contends a
plaintiff alleging a conspiracy between a lawyer and their client must first
seek and obtain a court order permitting that claim be brought and no such
order has been sought or granted in the present action. 
Pursuant to Civil Code Section
1714.10, subdivision (a), “No cause of action against an attorney for a civil
conspiracy with his or her client arising from any attempt to contest or
compromise a claim or dispute, and which is based upon the attorney's
representation of the client, shall be included in a complaint or other
pleading unless the court enters an order allowing the pleading that includes
the claim for civil conspiracy to be filed after the court determines that the
party seeking to file the pleading has established that there is a reasonable
probability that the party will prevail in the action.” (Civ. Code, § 1714.10,
subd. (a).)
In opposition, Plaintiff does not
contest that she failed to seek or obtain an order permitting her to file the
civil conspiracy claim. Rather, Plaintiff argues that Civil Code Section
1714.10, subdivision (a) does not apply in this case because Defendant Torpy
owed her an independent legal duty. (Civ. Code, § 1714.10, subd. (c).) Plaintiff
alleges sufficient facts to establish Torpy had an independent legal duty to
Plaintiff as a nonclient such that section 1714.10 does not apply. The omitted language
from Favila v. Katter Muchin Rosenman LLP (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th
189 is not applicable here because Plaintiff is not alleging that Neal owed
Plaintiff a duty.
Therefore, the demurrer to the
eighth cause of action is OVERRULED.
Defendant is ordered to file an
answer to the FAC within ten (10) days.
 
Moving Party is ordered to give
notice.
