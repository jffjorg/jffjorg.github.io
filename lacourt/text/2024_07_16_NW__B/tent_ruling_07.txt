BACKGROUND
             
Factual and Procedural
Background
            Mark
Williams (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint on September 27, 2023 against Maria
Ewest and Cristopher Ewest (Defendants) after Cristopher Ewest allegedly
shouted racial epithets at Plaintiff before intentionally colliding with
Plaintiff’s vehicle. (See Complaint, ¶¶ 10-15.) The motion now before the Court
is Defendants Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters in the Request for Admissions
Set 1 Admitted (the Motion). Plaintiff opposes the Motion; Defendants filed a
reply. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
            Concurrently
filed with their moving papers, Defendants file a Request for Judicial Notice
(RJN) which requests that the Court take judicial notice of six separate
matters pertaining to California State Bar Court Disciplinary proceedings
related to Plaintiff who, according to Defendants, holds State Bar number
220341. Although such matters may be judicially recognizable under Evid. Code
§451, “There is, however, a precondition to the taking of judicial notice in
either its mandatory or permissive form—any matter to be judicially noticed
must be relevant to a material issue.”  (People ex rel. Lockyer v.
Shamrock Foods Co. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 415, 422 fn. 2.) Defendants
fail to explain the relevance of the matter to be judicially noticed,
therefore, the request is denied. 
 

Tentative Ruling
             Defendants Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters
in the Request for Admissions Set 1 Admitted is GRANTED. The Court will impose
monetary sanctions on Plaintiff and award them to Defendants in the amount of $880.00.
Both sanctions and responses are to be delivered to Defendants within 15 days
of this order. 
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Legal Standard
            Code of Civil Procedure §
2033.250, provides, in pertinent part, that “[w]ithin 30 days after service of
the request for admissions . . . the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party.” A
motion to deem admitted requests for admissions lies based upon a showing of
failure to respond timely. (CCP §2033.280(b); Demyer v. Costa Mesa Mobile
Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, disapproved on other grounds
by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 983.) Requests for
admissions must be deemed admitted where no responses in substantial compliance
was served before the hearing. (CCP §2033.280(c).) As to motions to deem
matters admitted, no meet and confer is required. (Demyer v. Costa Mesa
Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal. App. 4th 393, 395, overruled on other
grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal. 4th 973, 983. Also see Leach
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 904–906, 169 Cal.Rptr. 42 [rejecting
argument that state rule of court requiring informal meet and confer applied to
motion where no response at all had been made to interrogatory requests,
reasoning that because objections had been waived for failure to timely answer,
there was “nothing to ‘resolve’ with the meaning” of the rule)].) 
 
Analysis
            Attached to the moving papers,
Defendants include the Declaration of Michael D. Rohfeld (Rohfeld Decl.) which
states that Request for Admissions, Set 1 was served on Plaintiff on March 27,
2024. (Rohfeld Decl., ¶5.) Responses were served on April 27, 2024 but only
contained objections and lacked any substantial compliance. (Rohfeld Decl., Exh. C.) As no
responses in substantial compliance have been received, the Motion is granted,
and sanctions are warranted. 
 
Sanctions
            Defense
counsel provides the following calculations. 
·        
Counsel’s hourly rate is $205.00
·        
Counsel spent 2 hours drafting moving papers, 1 hour drafting the reply,
and anticipates 1 hour at the hearing.
·        
Counsel also incurred a $60.00 filing fee.
·        
Counsel requests $880.00 in total to be imposed against Plaintiff. 
 
            The
Court finds the amount reasonable and will impose monetary sanctions on
Plaintiff and grant them to Defendants in the amount of $880.00.
 
CONCLUSION
             Defendants Motion to Deem the Truth of
Matters in the Request for Admissions Set 1 Admitted is GRANTED. The Court grants the
request for monetary sanctions on Plaintiff and awards them to Defendants in
the amount of $880.00. Both sanctions and responses are to be delivered
to Defendants within 15 days of this order.
