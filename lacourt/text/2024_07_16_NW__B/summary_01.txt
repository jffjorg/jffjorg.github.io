And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel discovery and request for monetary sanctions due to the untimeliness of the motion. The judge found that the motion was filed after the 15th day before the trial date, as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.020. The defendant had the option to seek to have the motion heard closer to trial, but chose not to do so. As a result, the motion is denied and the defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
