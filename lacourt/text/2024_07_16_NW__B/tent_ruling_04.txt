BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from Plaintiff
Nathan Jackson, a minor (“Plaintiff”) sustaining injuries arising from crashing
a dirt bike into a walkway railing. On March 5, 2021, Plaintiff filed a
Complaint against Defendants Paul Burke (“Burke”), Yordanose Tesfasilase
(“Tesfasilase”), and Does 1-10, alleging a cause of action for General
Negligence. 
 
On July 16, 2021, in Nathan Jackson
v. Forum Entertainment, LLC, LASC Case No. 21STCV26337 (the “2d Action”),
Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant Forum Entertainment, LLC (“FEL”)
alleging a single cause of action for General Negligence. 
 
On March 18, 2021, in the 2d Action,
Dwain Jackson was appointed as guardian ad litem for Plaintiff. 
 
On October 26, 2021, the instant action
and the 2d Action were deemed related. (10/26/21 Minute Order.) 
 
On September 26, 2022, pursuant to
stipulation, the Court entered an order consolidating the instant action and
the 2d Action. (09/26/22 Order.) The Court’s order provided that both cases
“will be consolidated into case number 21STCV08691.” (09/26/22 Order.) 
 
On October 19, 2023, Burke and
Tesfasilase filed a Cross-Complainant against FEL for: (1) Complete Indemnity;
(2) Partial Indemnity; and (3) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On February 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Notice of Settlement of Entire Case. 
 
On June 5, 2024, Parent and Guardian Ad
Litem Dwain Jackson (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Approve
Compromise of Pending Action (the “Petition”) on behalf of Claimant Nathan
Jackson (“Claimant”). 
 
Initially, the Court notes that there
is no proof of service pertaining to the Petition. Thus, the Court assumes that
no defendant was served with the Petition or its associated papers. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The Petition
to Approve Compromise of Pending Action (the “Petition”) filed on behalf of
Claimant Nathan Jackson is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
DISCUSSION
“When a minor, a person who lacks legal capacity to make decisions, or a
person for whom a conservator has been appointed is a party, that person shall
appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad
litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or
by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(1).)  “The purpose of section 372 is to protect the
minor involved in litigation by adding an extra layer of scrutiny to the
settlement of the minor’s claims.” (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1339.) 
Substance of the
Petition 
Claimant, a minor, by
and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Petitioner, has agreed to settle his
claims against Defendants Burke, Tesfasilase, and FEL for $225,000.00.
(Petition, ¶ 10(b)-(c).) The gross amount of settlement is $225,000.00 and
attorney’s fees in the sum of $56,250.00 are requested to be paid from the
gross amount of the settlement. (Petition, ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(e).) 
Claimant’s medical
expenses to be paid from the proceeds of the settlement amount to $3,320.08.
(Petition, ¶ 16(b).) Cost expenses to be paid from the settlement amounts to
$2,122.33. (Petition, ¶ 16(d).) 
The Court finds that the
requested attorney’s fees, 25% of the total settlement, is fair and reasonable.
The declaration of Anthony Willoughby, Esq. complies with Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 7.955. 
However, the Court notes
that there is a discrepancy on the Petition as to the net balance of proceeds
for Claimant. (See Petition, ¶¶ 15 and 16(f).) Paragraph 15 of the Petition
states that Claimant will receive a net balance of $163,234.56 whereas Paragraph
16(f) of the Petition indicates that Claimant will receive a net balance of
proceeds of $163,307.59.  
While the funds are
proposed to be deposited in an insured account at one or more financial
institutions in this state, Petitioner has not provided any information on the name,
branch, or address of such financial institutions. (Petition, ¶ 18(b)(2).)
Attachment 18(b)(2) is not attached to the Petition. 
Additionally, Petitioner
has also failed to serve all interested parties with the Petition. 
As such, the Petition is
defective as identified above. 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the
Petition is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
