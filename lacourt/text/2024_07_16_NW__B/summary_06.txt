And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Melt. State Farm, the opposing party, only objected to one specific item (UMF No. 6) in its responsive statement, but failed to file any separate evidentiary objections. As a result, the court considers State Farm to not have disputed Defendant Melt's UMF No. 6. The court also notes that Defendant Melt cited non-existent pages of deposition testimony, which are not included in Exhibit H. The court references a previous case, San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308, to emphasize the importance of setting forth objections in a separate statement.
