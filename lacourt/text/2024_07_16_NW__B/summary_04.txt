And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action filed on behalf of Claimant Nathan Jackson is denied without prejudice. The Court notes that there is no proof of service pertaining to the Petition, and the Petitioner has not provided sufficient information on the name, branch, or address of the financial institution where the funds will be deposited. Additionally, the Petitioner failed to serve all interested parties with the Petition. The Court finds that the requested attorney's fees, 25% of the total settlement, is fair and reasonable, but the Petition is defective as identified above. The Court orders the Moving Party to give notice.
