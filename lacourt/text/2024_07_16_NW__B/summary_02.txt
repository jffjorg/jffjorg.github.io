And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny Ralph's Motion to Set Aside Default as to SB Vermont. The motion is based on the contention that the default was based on SB Vermont's inadvertence, mistake, or excusable neglect, that service of the notice of default was insufficient, and that the default judgment is procedurally defective. The Judge disagrees with all three counts and finds that the default was properly served and that the entry of default was not procedurally defective.
