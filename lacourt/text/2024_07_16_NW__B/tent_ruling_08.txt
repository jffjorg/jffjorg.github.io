BACKGROUND
             This case stems from allegations of negligence
after Daniel Abram (Plaintiff) participated in a cycling exercise class.
Plaintiff files a Complaint against SoulCycle Inc., SoulCycle Beverly Hills,
LLC and Lindsay Warner (Defendants). The motion now before the Court is a
Motion to Be Relieved As Counsel filed by counsel for Plaintiff, Chet R.
Bhavsar.
 
Tentative Ruling
             Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved As
Counsel is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Legal Standard
            An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(c)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates
scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)
            Further, the requisite forms must be
served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the effective date of the
order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on
the client has been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would
prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994), 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)
 
Analysis
            Plaintiff’s counsel has
provided the Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 and MC-052. All appropriate notice
has been given, including to the client which Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed by
conversation and by telephone. (See MC-052, §3.) Additionally, Plaintiff’s
counsel provides all upcoming court dates. 
 
 
 
CONCLUSION
             Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion to Be
Relieved As Counsel is GRANTED, effective upon filing of the
proof of service of the Order.  
Moving party to
give notice.
