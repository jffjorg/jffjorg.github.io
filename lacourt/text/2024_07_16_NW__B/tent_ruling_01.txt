BACKGROUND
 
On October 1, 2019, Plaintiff, Araceli Sanchez
(“Plaintiff”), filed this action against Defendant, Alicia Rivera (“Defendant”)
for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident.
 
Defendant now moves for the Court to compel Plaintiff to
provide responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set Five) and
Special Interrogatories (Set Three). In connection with each motion, Defendant
requests the Court to impose $3,288 in monetary sanction against Plaintiff
and/or her counsel of record. Defendant also requests the Court to impose
evidentiary and issue sanctions. 
 
Trial is set for July 23, 2024.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
As a preliminary matter, the court finds that the instant
motions are untimely. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.020, “any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the
action.” In this instance, trial is set for July 23, 2024. Therefore, any
motion concerning discovery had to have been heard on or before July 8, 2024. 
 
Defendant could have either sought to have the instant motions
advanced or permitted to be heard closer to trial pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 2024.050, but Defendant chose to do neither. Accordingly, because
the instant motions are untimely, the motions are denied.
