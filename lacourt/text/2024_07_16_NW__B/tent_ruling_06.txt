[1] The Motion
has a reservation identification number ending in 8616.


[2] State Farm
only objected to Defendant Melt’s UMF No. 6 in its responsive separate
statement; however, State Farm failed to file any separate evidentiary
objections. As such, the Court deems State Farm to not have disputed Defendant
Melt’s UMF No. 6. The Court reminds the parties that “if it is not set forth in
the separate statement, it does not exist.” (San Diego Watercrafts,
Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308, 313, emphasis in
original.) 


[3] Defendant
Melt cites to non-existent pages of deposition testimony that are not included
in Exhibit H. (See DSSF No. 5.) There is no page 90, 91, 94, 135, 238, or 242
in Exhibit H, which is attached to the declaration of Mr. Termechi in support
of the Motion.
