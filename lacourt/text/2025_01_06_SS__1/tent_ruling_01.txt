  Case Number:  23STCV03401    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  1 Party:
  Plaintiffs Carolina Martinez and
Jessica Rodriguez 
Ruling:                        Motion
to approve amended PAGA settlement granted.
 
Plaintiffs Carolina
Martinez and Jessica Rodriguez (Plaintiffs) request approval of a Private
Attorney General Act (PAGA) settlement between themselves and defendants
Advantage Media Services, LLC (AMS) and Jay Catlin (collectively,
Defendants).  Plaintiffs’ operative First
Amended Complaint alleges claims for PAGA penalties arising from violations of
Sections 200, 201, 202, 203, 226, 226.2, 226.3, 226.7, 512, 558, 1174, 1174.5, 1182.12,
1194, 1197, 1198, and 2802 of the Labor Code. 

 
Legal Standards
 
Under Labor Code section 2699(l)(2): “The superior court
shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to
this part. The proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it is submitted to the court.”  (Lab. Code.
§2699(l)(2); see Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549
[noting in passing that “PAGA settlements are subject to trial court review and
approval, ensuring that any negotiated resolution is fair to those
affected.”)  However, “[t]he standards for review [for court approval of a
representative PAGA action settlement] are unclear, however, because the trial
court does not have a fiduciary responsibility to any absent class members as
it does in reviewing class action settlements.”  (The Rutter Group, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Proc.
Before Trial, Ch. 14-D, ¶12:250; see also Haralson v. U.S. Aviation Services
Corp. (N.D. Cal. 2019) 383 F.Supp.3d 959, 971 [“[N]either the California
legislature, nor the California Supreme Court, nor the California Courts of
Appeal, nor the [Labor and Workforce Development Agency (the “LWDA”)] has
provided any definitive answer as to what the appropriate standard is for
approval of a PAGA settlement.”].)  A court may exercise its discretion to
approve a settlement of a suit that includes a PAGA claim even if no portion of
the settlement is allocated toward payment to the LWDA. (See Nordstrom Com.
Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 589.)   
 
Given that California case authority on the issue is
somewhat sparse, the Court looks to a federal district court case, Haralson
v. U.S. Aviation Services Corp. (N.D. Cal. 2019) 383 F.Supp.3d 959, for
guidance on court approval of PAGA settlements.  In Haralson, the
court noted that the rationale behind the statute’s court approval requirement
is that settlement of PAGA claims compromises a claim that could otherwise be
brought by the state.  (See Haralson, supra, 383 F.Supp.3d at
971.)  The court noted that the LWDA has provided the following
guidance:  “It is thus important that when a PAGA claim is settled, the
relief provided for under the PAGA be genuine and meaningful, consistent with
the underlying purpose of the statute to benefit the public and, in the context
of a class action, the court evaluate whether the settlement meets the
standards of being ‘fundamentally fair, reasonable, and adequate’ with
reference to the public policies underlying the PAGA.  (Haralson,
supra, 383 F.Supp.3d at 971.)  
 
The courts have also considered payment of civil penalties
as a factor in approval of PAGA settlements.  (See Flores v. Starwood
Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2017) 253 F.Supp.3d 1074,
1077 [federal district court approved PAGA settlement where court was satisfied
that the parties' settlement was “fair and adequate in view of the purposes and
policies of the statute” and the parties “adequately divvied up the civil
penalties under Section 2699(i) of the California Labor Code.”].)  However, payment
of civil penalties is not dispositive.  (See Nordstrom Com. Cases,
supra, at 589.)  
 
Background
 
This case was originally a
class action.  On September 27, 2023, the
Court granted Plaintiffs’ request for dismissal of their class and individual
wage claims and “individual PAGA claims.” 
On November 5, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for approval of
PAGA settlement without prejudice. 
Plaintiffs’ counsel has filed a supplemental declaration addressing the
issues with the settlement, which the Court will treat as a renewed motion for
approval.

Plaintiffs have
corrected the arithmetical issue present in the initial motion.  The proposed division is in order and will be
approved.  
 
1.     
Notice to the LWDA
 
Labor Code
section 2699(l)(2) requires that the settlement be provided to the Labor Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) at the same time it is presented to
the court.  Plaintiffs provided notice to the LWDA of the amended
settlement on December 2, 2024.  (Supplemental
Solouki Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. F.)  
 
2.     
Fairness of the Settlement
 
a.     
Presumption of
Fairness
 
Under
Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, a
presumption of fairness exists where “(1) the settlement is reached through
arm's-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.”  (Id. at 1802.)  
 
The
settlement agrees to have been reached through arm’s-length bargaining.  The parties exchanged timekeeping, payroll,
and workweek information during the PAGA period for both Plaintiffs and the
other aggrieved employees and attended a full-day mediation with Hon. Jeffrey
K. Winikow (ret.) on March 8, 2024.  (Initial
Solouki Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.) There have been no objections received.  The settlement is presumptively fair. 
 
b.     
Breadth of Release
 
The
release in the revised settlement agreement applicable to aggrieved employees
reads:
 
All Aggrieved Employees are deemed to
release, on behalf of themselves and their respective former and present
representatives, agents, attorneys, heirs, administrators, successors, and
assigns, the Released Parties from all claims for PAGA penalties that were
alleged, or reasonably could have been alleged, based on the PAGA Period facts
stated in the Operative Complaint, and the PAGA Notice.
(Solouki Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 5.2.)
 
This release is
appropriately narrow to include only claims under PAGA, and only those based on
facts in the LWDA notice and the FAC, which bound the scope of this
litigation.  
 
c.      
Amount of Attorney
Fees and Costs
 
The
settlement provides for $82,500 in attorney
fees, approximately one-third (33.33%) of the gross settlement amount.  This is appropriate considering the result
achieved and the Court will approve it.  
 
Counsel request $14,655.31 out of a maximum of $17,000 in
litigation costs.  These costs appear
reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount, and the Court will approve
them.  
 
The
settlement allocates up to $5,350 for settlement administration costs to ILYM
Group, Inc.  This is reasonable in amount
and the Court will approve it.  
 
d.     
Gross
Settlement Amount
 
$20,000 of the gross amount is for
individual settlements, making the true gross settlement amount applicable to
PAGA $230,000.  This represents penalties
for 39,631 pay periods worked by 518 employees. 
This is a little more than $5.80 per pay period and approximately $444
per employee, prior to attorney fees and costs. 
This appears a reasonable amount.
 
e.      
Division
of Civil Penalties
 
“[C]ivil penalties recovered by aggrieved
employees shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and
Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws, including the
administration of this part, and for education of employers and employees about
their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously
appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those
purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees.”  (Labor Code § 2699(i).)
 
The amount of civil penalties is properly
divided between the LWDA and aggrieved employees as the law requires.  
 
f.       
Funding
of Settlement 
 
Under the settlement, Defendants will fund
the settlement within 14 days of the administrator’s finalization of aggrieved
employee data, which will be roughly 30 days after the granting of the motion
to approve.  (Supp. Solouki Decl., Ex. B,
¶¶ 4.2-4.3.)  Payments will be made to
aggrieved employees and for other disbursements within 14 days after that.  (Id., ¶ 4.4.)  Uncashed checks will be canceled and the
funds transmitted to the Unclaimed Property Fund of the State Controller in the
name of the aggrieved employee payee.  These
are all acceptable terms and will be approved. 
 
g.     
Service
Awards and Individual Settlements
 
Plaintiffs each request a service award of
$2,500, a total of $5,000.  These are
reasonable in amount considering the length of this case and the work by
Plaintiffs and will be approved. 
 
Plaintiffs also request individual
payments of $10,000 each for settlement of their individual claims.  As these are not actually settlements of PAGA
claims, they do not require court approval and the Court is satisfied that no
conflict exists.   
 
Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, the motion is granted.  The Court will sign Plaintiffs’ amended
proposed order.  Plaintiffs to give
notice.
