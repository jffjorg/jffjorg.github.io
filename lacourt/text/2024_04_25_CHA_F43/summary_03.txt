And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash the service of summons in an unlawful detainer case filed by the plaintiff on February 5, 2024. The defendant, Don Bratton, allegedly failed to pay rent in excess of $50,000 and the process server made five attempts to personally serve him with the summons. When the defendant refused to open the door, the process server posted the summons and complaint on his door and sent a copy via certified mail. The defendant's attorney later offered to accept service on his behalf. The judge ruled that the return of process is prima facie evidence of proper service, and the defendant's denial of receipt of service is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of service. The defendant's motion was denied, and he was ordered to give notice.
