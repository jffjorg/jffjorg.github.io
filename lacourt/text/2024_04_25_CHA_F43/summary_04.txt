And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants a motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Steven Blake, attorney for third-party claimant Alicia Rodriguez. The motion was filed in response to a breakdown of the relationship between Blake and his client, making it impossible to continue representation. The court has determined that the motion complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 and the case law cited in People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406. As there is no showing of prejudice, the court grants the motion and orders the moving party to give notice.
