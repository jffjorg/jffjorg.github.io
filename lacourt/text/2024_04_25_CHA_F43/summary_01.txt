Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained the demurrer filed by Defendant Plant Works Group, Inc. to Plaintiffs' First Cause of Action for Negligence. The court has given Plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the demurrer. The court's ruling is based on the fact that Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendant owed them a duty of care, nor have they alleged how Defendant breached any duty or contributed to their damages. The court has liberally construed the pleading and determined that the complaint fails to state a cause of action. The court's ruling is intended to give Plaintiffs an opportunity to cure the defects in their pleading and re-file their complaint.
