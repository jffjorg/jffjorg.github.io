And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by defendants Jakob Abergel and Sima Mazri to the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's causes of action are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. However, the court finds that the action is not barred by the statute of limitations. The court holds that the subsequent promises to pay made by the defendants after the original agreement were not time-barred, and that these promises extended the defendants' original liability. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled, and the plaintiff's complaint will proceed.
