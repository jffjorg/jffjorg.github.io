And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for terminating, issue, or monetary sanctions against the defendant and its counsel for failure to comply with the court's ordered deposition. The plaintiff sought sanctions in the amount of $2,167.26, alleging that the defendant failed to produce documents identified in the request for production at deposition and refused to appear as ordered. The judge found that it is unclear whether the defendant willfully disobeyed the court's prior orders and therefore cannot grant the motion for terminating sanctions at this time. The judge also found that the plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated issue or monetary sanctions are warranted given the defendant's reluctant compliance with the previous court order.
