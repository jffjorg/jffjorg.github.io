BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Eli Hertzel Dadon alleges he entered into an agreement with Defendants Jakob
Abergel and Sima Maztri to transfer the rights to certain real property for a
sum of $65,000.00. Plaintiff alleges after Defendants made some payments pursuant
to the terms of the agreement, Defendants went into default. According to
Plaintiff, Plaintiff has repeatedly demanded payment as provided, however,
Defendants have failed to pay the owed amount. Plaintiff filed their original
complaint on December 28, 2023 and on March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint as of right. On June 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Second
Amended Complaint upon court approval.   
 
[Tentative]
Ruling
 
Defendants
Jakob Abergel and Sima Mazri’s Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint is OVERRULED.

 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants Jakob Abergel and Sima Mazri demur
to the Second Amended Complaint on the grounds Plaintiff’s causes of action are
barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 
 
Where the dates alleged in the complaint show
the action is barred by the statute of limitations, a general demurrer
lies.  (Saliter v. Pierce Bros. Mortuaries (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d
292, 300.)  However, when nothing appearing on the face of the complaint
suggests that the action is barred by the statute of limitations, there are no
grounds for a demurrer.  (Union Carbide Corp. v. Superior Court
(1984) 36 Cal.3d 15, 25.)  Further, a demurrer on the ground of the bar of
the statute of limitations does not lie where the complaint merely shows that
the action may have been barred.  (Valvo v. University of Southern
California (1977) 67 Cal. App. 3d 887, 895.)  Instead, it must appear
affirmatively that, upon the facts stated, the right of action is necessarily
barred.  (Id.) 
 
Breach of written
contract claims are subject to a four-year statute of limitations. (See CCP §337.)  The cause of action accrues when the breach
occurs. (See Spear v. California State Automobile Association (1992) 2
Cal.4th 1035, 1042.) Causes of action for open book account and account
stated similarly have a four-year statute of limitations. (CCP §337.) 
 
Defendants argue the
complaint here is based on the claim Defendants failed to make monthly payments
of $2,500 which were to be paid starting October 5, 2011, nearly thirteen years
prior to the filing of Plaintiff’s Complaint. Plaintiff’s own complaint avers
that the last payment was made in April 2013. Accordingly, the last payment of
any kind Defendants allegedly made to Plaintiff was nearly eleven years prior
to the bringing of his Complaint. As a result, the latest Plaintiff could have
brought their breach of written contract, open book account and account stated
claims would have been April 2017. 
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff argues despite Defendants’ assertions, their debt to Plaintiff is still
valid because they continued to promise to make payments. Pursuant to Civil Code
section 1606, “[a]n existing legal obligation resting upon the promisor, or a moral
obligation originating in some benefit conferred upon the promisor, or prejudice
suffered by the promisee, is also a good consideration for a promise…” As a result,
Plaintiff contends, even assuming arguendo that the original agreement is time barred,
a claim on the subsequent promises to pay the debt is not time barred. (See Lambert
v. Schmalz (1897) 118 Cal. 33, 35 holding “[w]hen a debt has been
discharged by proceedings in insolvency, or has become barred by the statute of
limitations, the remedy to enforce the payment of the debt is gone, but the
moral obligation to pay it still remains and is a good consideration for a new
promise to make such payment.”) 
 
The court finds
based on the face of the complaint, the action is not barred by the statute of
limitations. “The acknowledgment of a debt before the statute has run does not
create a new obligation but merely continues the old obligation through a new
statutory period. [] On the other hand, the acknowledgment of a debt already
barred by the statute creates a new contract and a new obligation dating from
the acknowledgment. []” (Kaichen's Metal Mart, Inc. v. Ferro Cast Co.
(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 8, 15 [citing Eilke v. Rice (1955) 45 Cal.2d 66,
73].) Here, Plaintiff alleges the last payment received was on April 23, 2013.
(Compl. ¶11.) However, from 2013 to September 2023, Defendants would make
promises to Plaintiff that they would pay the balance due. (Compl. ¶12.) After
meeting with Defendants in September 2023, Plaintiff decided to file the
instant lawsuit and enforce his rights. (Compl. ¶13.) Since the complaint
alleges the promises to pay occurred up until September 2023, Defendants’
original liability was extended by the new promise. 
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the complaint is OVERRULED.
