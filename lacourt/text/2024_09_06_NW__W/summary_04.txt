And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, as the plaintiff's responses were deemed incomplete and vague. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to pay sanctions of $575.11, payable within 30 days, for failing to provide complete and substantive responses. The plaintiff had previously requested an extension to review and make changes to their responses, but failed to do so. The judge has reviewed the parties' meet and confer correspondence and finds that the parties have reached an impasse on this issue. The court has considered the relevant laws and case citations, including California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 and Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Superior Court (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 326.
