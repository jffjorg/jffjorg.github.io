Miller
v. Shadravan, et al.LEAVE
TO AMEND CONTINUANCETENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Iam Miller’s Motion for Leave to Amend Continuance is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Iam Miller (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona,
filed this action against Defendant Sasan Shadravan (“Defendant”), on November
29, 2021. The action was originally filed in the unlimited civil court and then
reclassified as a limited civil case on June 29, 2023. (Minute Order,
06/29/23.) Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion for Leave to Amend Continuance on January 17, 2024. Defendant filed an
opposition on February 16, 2024. 
 
The action came for
trial on February 20, 2024, at which time the Court granted Defendant’s oral
motion for nonsuit pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision
(b), and entered judgment accordingly. (Minute Order, 02/20/24.) 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Amend Continuance does not make clear
what relief is sought and appears to recite Plaintiff’s arguments in support of
the claims against Defendant. As this action was already adjudicated and there
is no legal basis cited for reconsideration of the ruling, the Motion is
denied. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
