Zimmerman
v. Mighty Ventures, Inc., et al.MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONSANALYSIS:
 
On December 28, 2023, Plaintiff Israel Harry Zimmerman
(“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action
against Defendant Mighty Ventures, Inc. (“Specially Appearing Defendant”). The
Complaint and the First Amended Complaint, filed on December 29, 2023, seek
only declaratory relief against Defendant with respect to certain patents for
inventions. (FAC, ¶¶1, 28-33 and Prayer, ¶¶1-12.) Specially Appearing Defendant
filed the instant Motion to Quash Service of Summons and First Amended on
February 9, 2024. However, the Limited Jurisdiction Court lacks
jurisdiction to issue the declaratory relief sought in the First Amended
Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 85, 86.) 
 
Therefore,
the case is reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the
Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of fees and reassignment of the
case to an Independent Calendar Court. Plaintiff is ordered to pay the
reclassification fee within ten (10) days.

 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
