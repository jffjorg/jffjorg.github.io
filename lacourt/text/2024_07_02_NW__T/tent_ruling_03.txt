 Case Number:  23VECV05683    Hearing Date:   July 2, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV05683 Caremed v Egida Tentative ruling on Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings set 7/2/2024:  The court considers the opposition to be a request for relief from the dismissal since there is a declaration of attorney fault.  If anything, counsel for plaintiff may have been lured into dismissal by defense counsel’s assurance that once the one case was dismissed, defendant would appear in the second case.  It was clear to both attorneys that the duplicate filing was an attorney error.  It was undoubtedly a surprise to plaintiff’s counsel that having acceded to defense counsel’s request to dismiss, defense counsel would use that as a weapon against plaintiff.  The history of this case as set forth in emails is inconsistent with this motion and with what the court would expect from counsel under their duties of cooperation and civility, particularly as there was no indication that acquiescence to defendant’s request to eliminate the duplicate case would be used against plaintiff.  It is certainly a disappointment for the court to see. It sounds in the nature of "dirty pool."  The court would be inclined to deny the motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the dismissal with prejudice was a mistake based on unfairness and lack of civility, and then later vacate the dismissal on the first case, relate, and then consolidate both cases as they are identical. The request for judicial notice is granted.
