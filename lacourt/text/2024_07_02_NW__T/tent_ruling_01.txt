  Case Number:  23VECV02176    Hearing Date:   July 2, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV02176 Gonzalez v Montgomery
Tentative ruling: Motion to set aside
default-Denied.  Defendant has failed to establish facts which would
warrant the setting aside of the default and default judgment. Defendant was
personally served with the complaint on 6/8/2023. He was granted two extensions
to respond to the complaint. Default was entered on 9/18/2023 and the motion
was filed more than 6 months later.  Defendant’s declaration ignores the
warning he was given that there would be no further extensions of time to
respond after August 18th. Even so, default was not entered for
another month. Request for Entry of Default was served on defendant on
9/18/2023 and on 9/15/2023.  There is no evidence at all that he was
granted an extension beyond the final one ending on August 18th. 
Defendant acknowledges personal service, and he sets forth no facts to
constitute excusable neglect. Defendant also has no explanation why he did not
move for relief once he was advised that default was being requested in
September 2023. Counsel for defendant was in touch with plaintiff’s counsel on
11/27/2023 but then waited another 5 months before filing the motion to set
aside.  There is no evidence that defendant acted with diligence. 
Finally, the discussions leading up to the entry of default were between
plaintiff and defendant; no attorney was involved and no misrepresentations
were made.  The duty to provide fair notice
as to default is applicable when an attorney knows there is an attorney
representing the other side.  It does not
apply between parties.
