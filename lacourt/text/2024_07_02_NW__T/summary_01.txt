And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The defendant failed to establish facts that would warrant setting aside the default. The defendant was personally served with the complaint on June 8, 2023, and was granted two extensions to respond. Despite being warned that there would be no further extensions after August 18, 2023, the default was not entered until September 18, 2023. The defendant's declaration ignores the warning and sets forth no facts to constitute excusable neglect. The defendant also failed to move for relief once advised of the default, and counsel for the defendant lacked diligence in filing the motion to set aside, waiting five months after contacting plaintiff's counsel. The judge finds that the duty to provide fair notice as to default does not apply between parties, only when an attorney knows there is an attorney representing the other side.
