And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion for judgment on the pleadings by Caremed, the plaintiff, against Egida, the defendant. The Judge notes that the motion is essentially a request for relief from the dismissal with prejudice of the duplicate case, which was dismissed at the request of the defendant. The Judge finds that the dismissal was an unfair and uncivil act, as the plaintiff's counsel was assured that the defendant would appear in the second case after dismissal, but instead the defendant used the dismissal as a weapon against the plaintiff. The Judge is inclined to deny the motion for judgment on the pleadings and instead vacate the dismissal, relate the cases, and consolidate them as they are identical. The Judge grants the request for judicial notice.
