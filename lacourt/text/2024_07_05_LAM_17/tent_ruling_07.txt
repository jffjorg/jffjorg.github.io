Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to RFPs is GRANTED. Responses

On 1/26/2017, Plaintiff Joy Slagel
(Plaintiff) filed suit against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (LMIC), Ariam
Alemseghed, and Leann Lo, alleging: (1) age discrimination; (2) age harassment;
(3) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (3) discrimination on the basis of taking
disability leave in violation of FEHA; (5) retaliation for taking disability
leave in violation of FEHA; (6) failure to provide reasonable accommodation in
violation of FEHA; (7) failure to engage in the interactive process in
violation of FEHA; (8) breach of express oral contract not to terminate
employment without good cause; (9) breach of implied in fact contract not to
terminate employment without good cause; (10) wrongful termination of
employment in violation of public policy; 
(11) violation of Labor Code section 1102.5; and (12) intentional
infliction of emotional distress (IIED).
 
            On 4/8/2024, Plaintiff moved to
compel further responses from Defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company to her
Requests for Production (Set Six).
 
Discussion

 
            As a preliminary matter, discovery
remains open in this case. Discovery closes 30 days before trial. (CCP §
2024.020) A mistrial, new trial, or reversal of the judgment on appeal
automatically restarts the time limitations on discovery. Discovery is reopened
and the 'cut-off' dates are thereafter measured from the date set for retrial.
(Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 247.) 
            
            Here, Plaintiff argues good cause
exists to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 120, 121, and 122-133. 
 
            After review, the Court agrees. 
 
            As for RFP No. 120, this request
seeks the identification of potential witnesses who may have evidence relevant
to disparate treatment. As noted by Plaintiff, this is a disparate treatment
case, requiring that plaintiff present evidence establishing that Defendant
treated people over the age of 40 (not just plaintiff) less favorably than
others under the age of 40. (Mixon v. Fair Employment and Housing Com.
(1987) Cal.App.3d 1306.)
 
At deposition, Michael Pok testified that in March of 2015, he went
to conduct an investigation in response to Plaintiff’s complaint of age
discrimination, and had a list of employees and their respective lengths of
employment. (Gbewonyo Decl., ¶ 8, Exhibit 7). Plaintiff alleges that long term
employees over the age of 40 received disparate treatment in relation to their
young college age colleagues. Accordingly, this list of employees and their
lengths of employment is relevant to the performance of a statistical analysis
of the average length of employment of persons at the time Plaintiff raised
this complaint. 
 
As for RFP No. 121, the request asks for the findings of the
alleged social media check at issue. This social media check served as the
basis for Plaintiff’s termination. As explained by Plaintiff, “It is unclear
from the evidence whether Defendant conducted a social media check, and if so,
what the findings, if any, were. Assuming that there were no findings, that
evidence would further lend itself to the fact that Plaintiff’s termination was
without merit, as no harm resulted from this single instance of alleged
misconduct to either Defendant or its client, Disney. This is particularly
important in light of the testimony from Stephanie Conner that the alleged
mistake by Plaintiff was not a major factor.” (Opp., 8: 20-24.) Accordingly,
this evidence is directly relevant to whether or not Defendant’s proffered
reason for her termination was pretextual. 
 
As for RFP Nos. 122-133, these requests seek information concerning
the job duties and responsibilities of different relevant employees. This
information is directly relevant to determining whether or not these employees
constitute “managing agents” for the purposes of a punitive damages analysis.
“[T]he determination of whether certain employees are managing agents ‘does not
necessarily hinge on their ‘level’ in the corporate hierarchy. Rather, the
critical inquiry is the degree of discretion the employees possess in making
decisions . . . .’ ” (Powerhouse Motorsports Group, Inc. v. Yamaha Motor
Corp., U.S.A. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 867, 886.)
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to RFPs is granted. Defendant is sanctioned, jointly and severally
with counsel, $1,050. ($350/hr x 3.) 
 
It is so
ordered.

  vs.
                                                               
LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, ARIAM
  ALEMSEGHED, and LEANN LO
 


 Case No.: 
  BC648246
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  July 5, 2024



 
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED. Responses are due within 20
days.  Defendant is sanctioned, jointly
and severally with counsel, $1,050, payable within 30 days.
 
On January 26, 2017, Plaintiff Joy
Slagel (Plaintiff) filed suit against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (LMIC),
Ariam Alemseghed, and Leann Lo, alleging: (1) age discrimination; (2) age
harassment; (3) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (3) discrimination on the
basis of taking disability leave in violation of FEHA; (5) retaliation for
taking disability leave in violation of FEHA; (6) failure to provide reasonable
accommodation in violation of FEHA; (7) failure to engage in the interactive
process in violation of FEHA; (8) breach of express oral contract not to
terminate employment without good cause; (9) breach of implied in fact contract
not to terminate employment without good cause; (1)) wrongful termination of
employment in violation of public policy;  (11) violation of Labor Code section 1102.5;
and (12) intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED).
 
            On 4/8/2024, Plaintiff moved to
compel further responses to her Special Interrogatories (Set Three). 
 
Discussion

 
            Plaintiff argues good cause exists
to compel further responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 27-39, 40-45, 52, and
46-51. 
 
            After review, the Court agrees. 
 
As for SROG Nos. 27-39, these requests seek the identity of
potential witnesses. The disclosure of the names and addressed of potential
witnesses is routine and an essential part of pretrial discovery.” (Puerto
v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1249-50.)
 
As for SROG Nos. 40-45 and 52, these interrogatories seek
information relevant to establishing that Defendant’s reasons for termination
are false and are evidence of pretext.
 
As for SROG Nos. 46-41, these requests seek to better understand
the job duties and responsibilities of different relevant employees. This
information is directly relevant to determining whether or not these employees
constitute “managing agents” for the purposes of a punitive damages analysis.
“[T]he determination of whether certain employees are managing agents ‘does not
necessarily hinge on their ‘level’ in the corporate hierarchy. Rather, the
critical inquiry is the degree of discretion the employees possess in making
decisions . . . .’ ” (Powerhouse Motorsports Group, Inc. v. Yamaha Motor
Corp., U.S.A. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 867, 886.) 
 
The discovery at issue relates to three categories of discovery:
(1) the contact of witnesses, (2) evidence surrounding the legitimacy of the
reasons for Plaintiff’s termination, and (3) punitive damages and determining
whether the persons involved were managing agents. Each category is relevant to
the claims here. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories is granted. Defendant is sanctioned,
jointly and severally with counsel, $1,050. ($350/hr x 3.) 
 
It is so
ordered.
