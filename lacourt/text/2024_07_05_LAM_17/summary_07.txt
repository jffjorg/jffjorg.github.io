Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Joy Slagel's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production (RFPs) and Special Interrogatories. The Court finds that Defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company failed to provide sufficient responses to these discovery requests. The Court orders Defendant to provide further responses to RFP Nos. 120, 121, and 122-133, and to Special Interrogatory Nos. 27-39, 40-45, 52, and 46-51 within 20 days. Additionally, the Court sanctions Defendant, jointly and severally with counsel, in the amount of $1,050, payable within 30 days. The Court finds that Plaintiff's claims of age discrimination, age harassment, and retaliation in violation of FEHA are supported by the evidence and that Defendant's reasons for termination are false and pretextual.
