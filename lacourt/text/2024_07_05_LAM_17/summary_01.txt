And here is a brief summary in English:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims of negligence and breach of mandatory duty. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to perform timely safety checks and failed to summon medical care, leading to injuries. The defendant argues that there is no evidence to support these claims and that they are entitled to summary judgment. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact on these claims and denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
