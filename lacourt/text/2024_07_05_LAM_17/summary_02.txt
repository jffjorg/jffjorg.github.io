And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication filed by the defendants, Brinker International, Inc. and others.

The plaintiff, Jennifer A. Aylward, alleges disability discrimination, retaliation, and harassment based on her physical and mental disabilities, and claims that she was terminated from her job as General Manager at Manhattan Beach Chili's location.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, which sought to dismiss the plaintiff's claims. The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the claims of harassment and failure to allow inspection of personnel file, but has denied summary adjudication as to all remaining claims.

The judge has found that there are triable issues of material fact on the claims of disability discrimination, retaliation, failure to accommodate, failure to engage in interactive process, CFRA violations, and failure to prevent/wrongful termination. However, the judge has found that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim of harassment.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change and will be finalized after the parties have had an opportunity to review and respond to the ruling.
