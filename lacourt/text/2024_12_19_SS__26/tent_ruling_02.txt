Plaintiff Giovanni Gonzalez’s Motion to Compel Arbitration, for
Court to Pick Arbitration Forum, Request for Stay, and Requests for an Order of
Costs and Fees Related to the Arbitration is DENIED.                                                                                                                                
ANALYSIS: 
On April 4, 2024, Plaintiff Giovanni Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for automobile subrogation against Defendant LA Auto
Center, LLC (“Defendant LA Auto”) and Jet Insurance Company (“Defendant Jet”).
Following Defendant LA Auto’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court
entered its default on June 26, 2024. Defendant LA Auto filed a Motion to
Vacate Default, which the Court granted on September 12, 2024. (Minute Order,
09/12/24.) Defendant LA Auto filed its answer on September 20, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration, for
Court to Pick Arbitration Forum, Request for Stay, and Requests for an Order of
Costs and Fees Related to the Arbitration on October 11, 2024. Defendant LA
Auto filed an opposition on December 5, 2024 and Plaintiff replied on December
12, 2024. 
Discussion 
Plaintiff moves to compel arbitration against Defendant LA
Auto on the grounds that it materially breached the arbitration agreement by
failing to pay fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97. (Notice,
p. 2:1-6.) This statute provides: 
(a)(1) In an employment or consumer
arbitration that requires, either expressly or through application of state or
federal law or the rules of the arbitration provider, the drafting party to pay
certain fees and costs before the arbitration can proceed, if the fees or costs
to initiate an arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due
date the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is
in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel arbitration under
Section 1281.2.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.97, subd. (a)(1).) Following such
breach, an employee or consumer may “[c]ompel arbitration in which the drafting
party shall pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs related to the arbitration.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.97, subd. (b)(2).) Plaintiff presents evidence, that
Defendant LA Auto materially breached the arbitration agreement by failing to
pay the invoice sent by AAA. Specifically, Plaintiff sent Defendant LA Auto a
demand for arbitration on May 26, 2023. (Motion, Sadr Decl., ¶5 and Exh. 3.)
Plaintiff then filed for arbitration with the AAA on September 11, 2023. (Id.
at ¶7.) AAA accepted arbitration and sent an invoice to the parties with
payment due by December 6, 2023. (Id. at ¶8 and Exh. 4, p. 2.) When
Defendant LA Auto did not make payment, AAA closed the arbitration file on
December 13, 2023. (Id. at ¶9 and Exh. 5.)
Defendant LA Auto first argues that the Motion should be
denied because Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97 is preempted by the
Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). In support of its preemption argument,
Defendant LA Auto points to Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. (2024)
102 Cal.App.5th 222, in which the Court of Appeals ruled that where an arbitration
agreement plainly indicates it is governed by the FAA, the trial court’s order
based on section 1281.97, a state law statute, must be reversed. (Hernandez
v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. (2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 222, 241-244 [“unless
the parties have expressly selected California’s arbitration provisions to
apply to their agreement, the FAA preempts the portion of section 1281.97 that
dictates findings of material breach and waiver as a matter of law.”].)
Although Plaintiff’s reply attempts to distinguish Hernandez from this
action by citing Court of Appeals cases that have come to a different result on
the preemption issue, the Court finds it is the cases on which Plaintiff relies
that are distinguishable from this action.
For example, in Keeton v. Tesla, Inc., while the
parties’ arbitration agreement did not expressly incorporate the California
Arbitration Act (“CAA”), the Court of Appeals held that those state law procedural
provisions apply in California by default. (Keeton v. Tesla, Inc. (2024)
103 Cal.App.5th 26, 38.) Plaintiff does not point to any case where the parties
expressly selected the FAA in their arbitration agreement but section 1281.97
was held to be applicable for a finding of breach by the drafting party. The
other case cited by Plaintiff also involved an arbitration agreement that
expressly stated the arbitrator was to look “to the “California Arbitration Act
... to conduct the arbitration and any pre-arbitration activities.” (See Gallo
v. Wood Ranch USA, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621, 630.)
The arbitration agreement in this action expressly states
that “[a]ny arbitration under this Arbitration Provision shall be governed by
the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.).” (Motion, Sadr Decl., Exh.
1, p. 5.) While the procedural provisions of CAA apply in California courts by
default, the first question that must be decided is what statutory scheme
applies to the parties’ arbitration agreement. (See Hernandez, supra,
102 Cal.App.5th at 238.) In arguing that section 1281.97 applies, Plaintiff does
not answer this initial question nor address it in reply despite the issue
being raised in the opposition. (Opp., p. 9:26-10:10.)
Furthermore, even if the Court were to find that section
1281.97 is applicable to the facts of this case with respect to just the
request for attorney’s fees and costs, which it does not for the reasons
explained above, Plaintiff has also not shown that its authority regarding the
existence of a valid arbitration agreement under section 1281.2 of the CAA is
applicable.
Conclusion 
Plaintiff Giovanni Gonzalez’s Motion to Compel Arbitration, for
Court to Pick Arbitration Forum, Request for Stay, and Requests for an Order of
Costs and Fees Related to the Arbitration is DENIED.
