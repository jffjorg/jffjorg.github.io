 Case Number:  24STLC02579    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  26 Orewyler v. Wang et. al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Defendants Yichuan Wang and Liang Guan’s Motion to Vacate Default is GRANTED. THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON AUGUST 20, 2024 IS HEREBY VACATED. DEFENDANTS ARE TO FILE AND SERVE THEIR PROPOSED ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER. ALSO, WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER, DEFENSE COUNSEL OF RECORD IS TO PAY ATTORNEY’S FEES OF $4,945.00 TO PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL.ANALYSIS:On April 9, 2024, Plaintiffs Brandon Orewyler and Chante Eliaszadeh (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action against Defendants Yichuan Wang and Liang Guan (“Defendants”). Following Defendants’ failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered their default on August 20, 2024.Defendants filed their first Motion to Vacate Default on September 4, 2024. Following full briefing and oral argument, the Court denied the first Motion without prejudice on November 18, 2024. (Minute Order, 11/18/24.) Defendants filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default on the same date. Plaintiffs filed an opposition on December 6, 2024.DiscussionDefendants move to vacate the entry of default pursuant to the mandatory relief provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute an application for relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of attorney fault attesting to their mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected if the defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.)The instant Motion was timely filed three months after entry of default and is supported by an attorney declaration of fault in which defense counsel states that following months of unsuccessful settlement negotiations, they failed to file a responsive pleading. (Motion, Cole Decl., ¶¶6-13.) Defense counsel contends that the failure to file a responsive pleading was entirely their own and not the fault of Defendants. (Id. at ¶¶13-14.) In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that this declaration by defense counsel contradicts their declaration in the first Motion to Vacate. Plaintiffs argue that where a defense attorney’s contradictory declarations demonstrate a lack of credibility, the request for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) must be denied.The Court considers the cases on which Plaintiffs rely. In Cisneros v. Vueve (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 906, the Court of Appeals held that “the ‘unless’ clause of the statute is not a credibility testing device, it is a causation testing device. Specifically, the statute mandates relief “‘unless the court finds that the default ... was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence’ etc. (Italics added.)” (Cisneros v. Vueve (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 906, 912.) In Todd v. Thrifty Corp. (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 986, the Court of Appeals ruled the trial court abused its discretion by granting a motion for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) when the affidavits revealed that the attorney was trying to cover for their clients’ inexcusable conduct. (Todd v. Thrifty Corp. (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 986, 992.) Finally, in Behm v. Clear View Techs. (2015) 241 Cal. App. 4th 1, the Court of Appeals held that it defers to the trial court’s determination of credibility when evaluating whether the default was actually caused by the attorney. (Behm v. Clear View Techs. (2015) 241 Cal. App. 4th 1, 15-16.) Based on this authority, the Court must determine whether the entry of default was actually caused by defense counsel and not Defendants, and in doing so, may evaluate defense counsel’s credibility.The Court finds defense counsel’s declarations credible and not contradictory. Both declarations explain that after defense counsel was hired, the attorneys met and conferred regarding the date to fileDefendants’ proposed Motion to Strike but could not reach a resolution. (Motion, Cole Decl., ¶¶6-9; Second Motion, Cole Decl., ¶¶6-10.) The only difference is that in the declaration in support of the Second Motion, defense counsel expressly states that the failure to file a responsive pleading was their fault and not that of their clients. (Id. at ¶¶11-13.) This comports with the shift in legal basis for relief from the discretionary provision to the mandatory provision under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), and is not grounds to deny the Second Motion. There is no indication that the lack of responsive pleading was caused by Defendants themselves.Plaintiffs also argue that relief is not permitted under the mandatory provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) where, as here, the failure to respond was part of Defendants’ intentional strategic decision. In Jerry’s Shell v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1058, the Court of Appeals upheld denial of the motion for relief from default because “appellants’ counsel’s obvious plan was to claim attorney fault and revive the claims through a section 473(b) motion for relief.” (Jerry’s Shell v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1073.) Another intentional strategy that warranted denial of a motion for relief was a defendant’s “strategy of delaying and throwing darts at others, rather than taking responsibility for her own actions.” (Del Junco v. Hufnagel (2007) 150 Cal. App. 4th 789, 800.) The evidence here does not bear out that Defendants engaged in a strategy to delay like that in Del Junco. In Del Junco, the conduct of both the defendant and their counsel was clearly to delay. (Id. at 794-797.) Similarly, the Court of Appeals in Jerry’s Shell described the extensive conduct that warranted denial of the request for relief:Appellants’ attorneys regularly failed to respond to discovery when it was due, without informing the other side or seeking an extension. Any and all attempts by opposing counsel to discuss or “meet and confer” were similarly ignored. This gave opposing counsel no choice but to go to the trouble and expense of preparing and filing a motion to compel. But even a formal motion did not engender a response. And while appellants' counsel did not oppose such motions, neither did they concede. Thus, the court was drawn into the conflict, wasting judicial resources and—in the case of an appointed referee—leading to further expense. Finally, when an order issued compelling responses, appellants' counsel defied that too, leading to a second go round of each of these wearying steps.(Jerry’s Shell v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1073.) The proceedings in this action which amounted to a failure to file a responsive pleading began with defense counsel’s request for an extension of the time to respond at the end of May 2024. (Second Motion, Cole Decl., ¶6.) When that extension expired, defense counsel asked for another extension in order to meet and confer about a possible motion to strike. (Id. at ¶7.) Plaintiffs provided the second extension but no agreement was reached regarding the motion to strike; once the second extension expired, default was entered two months later. (Id. at ¶¶7-12.) The entry of default in this case, therefore, followed two short extensions of the time to respond and is nothing compared to the significant obstructionist tactics used by the attorneys in Jerry’s Shell. As the defense’s failure to file a responsive pleading in this action does not rise to the level of an intentional tactical decision in the above-cited cases, this is also not grounds to deny the Second Motion to Vacate.Finally, Plaintiffs request that if relief from the entry of default is granted, they be awarded attorney’s fees under the moving statute. “The court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) Plaintiffs’ counsel requests attorney’s fees of $4,945.00 based on 8.1 hours of attorney time billed at $575.00. (Opp., Orewyler Decl., ¶¶7-16.) The Court finds the requested fees based on a reasonable hourly rate and amount of time spent on this matter with respect to the entry of default following preparation of the request for default judgment and two opposed motions to vacate entry of default.ConclusionDefendants Yichuan Wang and Liang Guan’s Motion to Vacate Default is GRANTED. THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON AUGUST 20, 2024 IS HEREBY VACATED. DEFENDANTS ARE TO FILE AND SERVE THEIR PROPOSED ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER. ALSO WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER, DEFENSE COUNSEL OF RECORD IS TO PAY ATTORNEY’S FEES OF $4,945.00 TO PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL.Moving party to give notice.
