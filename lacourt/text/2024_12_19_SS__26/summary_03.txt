And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of defendants Yichuan Wang and Liang Guan to vacate the entry of default. The default was entered on August 20, 2024, after defendants failed to file a responsive pleading to the complaint. The judge found that defense counsel's declarations were credible and not contradictory, and that the failure to file a responsive pleading was caused by defense counsel's mistake, rather than an intentional decision. The judge also ordered defense counsel to pay attorney's fees of $4,945.00 to plaintiffs' counsel. The defendants are now required to file and serve their proposed answer to the complaint within 20 days of the order.
