**Significant Statements**
```
The court may strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
A motion to strike is appropriate to attack a claim for punitive damages.
In order to state a prima facie claim for punitive damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the general punitive damage statute, Civil Code section 3294.
Punitive damages may not be pled generally.
Leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.
```
Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to strike punitive damages from the FAC, finding that the plaintiff's allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice are insufficient to plead a claim for punitive damages. However, the judge allows the plaintiff to amend the FAC to add specific facts alleging the defendants' actions and intentions that may point to oppression, fraud, or malice.
