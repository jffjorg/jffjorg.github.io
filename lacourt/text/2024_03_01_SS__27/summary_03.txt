And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on three motions brought by the defendants: (1) to compel Plaintiff to serve Form Interrogatories, Set One; (2) to deem Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted; and (3) for sanctions. The judge denied the first motion, as the Plaintiff has since served discovery responses. The judge denied the second motion, as the Plaintiff served responses in substantial compliance with CCP § 2033.220 prior to the motion's hearing. The judge granted the third motion, ordering the Plaintiff and her counsel to pay sanctions in the amount of $1000 to Defendant City of Los Angeles and $500 to Defendant MV Transportation, Inc. The judge noted that the Plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses necessitated the defendants' filing of the motion, leading to the incurrence of attorney's fees.
