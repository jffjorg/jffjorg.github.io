And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., has filed a demurrer to strike the plaintiff's first cause of action for general negligence. The plaintiff, Samuel Hidalgo, alleges that he was injured while loading his truck at Home Depot's designated loading zone, and that defendant Lopez, who was parking his truck next to the plaintiff's, backed out negligently and caused the plaintiff's injury. The defendant argues that the complaint does not sufficiently plead the defendant's involvement in the plaintiff's injury.

The court finds that the complaint does not adequately plead the defendant's involvement, and that the plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing to state a cause of action for general negligence. However, the court also finds that there is a reasonable possibility for the plaintiff to make a sufficient showing to state a cause of action for general negligence if the complaint is amended. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's demurrer with leave to amend.
