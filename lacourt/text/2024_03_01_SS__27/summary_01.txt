And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, 99 CENTS ONLY STORES LLC, filed a motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, which were served on the plaintiff, ALMA JEANETH LOPEZ, on September 27, 2023. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the defendant filed the motion on February 2, 2024. The plaintiff eventually provided responses on February 26, 2024, after the motion was filed. The court finds that the plaintiff's delay in providing responses necessitated the defendant's filing of the motion, leading to the incurrence of attorney's fees. The court grants the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $845, to be paid jointly and severally by the plaintiff and the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days.
