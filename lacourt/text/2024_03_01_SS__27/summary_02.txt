And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to continue trial and the plaintiff's motion for trial preference. The case involves an auto accident where the plaintiff, Michael William Wilson, was allegedly injured by the defendant, Clayton Damian, who was operating a company vehicle while under the influence. The defendant's employer, Southwark Metal Manufacturing, is also named as a defendant.

The Judge finds that the defendants have not made a strong showing of good cause for a lengthy continuance of one year from the date of the hearing. The Judge also notes that the defendants have not filed a summary judgment motion, despite their claims that they need time to prepare one. The Judge will accommodate potential summary judgment motions by setting a date for them in May 2024.

The Judge grants a 120-day continuance from the date of the hearing, setting the new trial date for July 1, 2024. The Judge also sets a final status conference for June 18, 2024.
