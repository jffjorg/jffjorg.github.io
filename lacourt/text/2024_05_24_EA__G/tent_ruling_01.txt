  Case Number:  23PSCV01486    Hearing Date:   May 24, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile
Club’s Application for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile
Club’s Application for Default Judgment
is DENIED without prejudice and Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the
Automobile Club is granted leave to file a First Amended Complaint.
BACKGROUND
This
is a personal injury action arising from an automobile collision. In May 2021,
Defendant Anthony Santanagiles was operating a motor vehicle owned by Defendant
Darryl Ursery on San Bernardino Avenue near Indian Hill Boulevard in Pomona
when Santanagiles collided with Pedro Munostandazo’s vehicle. As a result, Munostandazo’s
insurer, Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (IEAC), paid Munostandazo
$103,500.00 for personal injury and property damages.
On May
16, 2023, IEAC filed a complaint against Santanagiles, Ursery, and Does 1-10,
alleging a single cause of action for subrogation. On July 15, 2023, IEAC’s
process server served Ursery with substitute service in Montclair. On October 25,
2023, the Court entered default against Ursery after Ursery failed to timely
file an answer.
On November
18, 2023, IEAC’s process server personally served Santanagiles in Victorville. On
February 2, 2024, IEAC dismissed Santanagiles from the present action.
On
May 16, 2024, IEAC submitted the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for May 24, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
IEAC
seeks default judgment against Ursery in the total amount of $116,778.11,
including $103,500.00 in damages, $12,763.11 in interest, and $515.00 in costs.¿For
the following reasons, the Court DENIES IEAC’s application.
“[T]he
complaint delimits the nature of the legal theories which plaintiff may pursue
and the nature of the evidence which is admissible.” (Ostling v. Loring (1994)
27 Cal.App.4th 1731, 1744.) “The court cannot allow a plaintiff to prove
different claims or different damages at a default hearing than those pled in
the complaint.” (Heidary v. Yadollahi (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 857, 868.)
Here,
IEAC’s default judgment application proffers evidence that departs from and
contradicts the allegations that were alleged in the Complaint. The Complaint alleges
Santanagiles was negligently operating a vehicle owned by Ursery and caused the
collision at issue. (Complaint, ¶ 4-5, 12-13.) In IEAC’s default judgment
application, the evidence now suggests that Ursery was the driver responsible
for the collision as opposed to merely being the owner of the vehicle that was
involved. (Ngo Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) Accordingly, because IEAC’s Complaint and
default prove-up evidence conflict, IEAC’s application for default judgment is DENIED and IEAC is directed to file
and serve an amended Complaint on Ursery with these new allegations.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, IEAC’s
application for default judgment is DENIED and IEAC is given leave to
file a First Amended Complaint.
