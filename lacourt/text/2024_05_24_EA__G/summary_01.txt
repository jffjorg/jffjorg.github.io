And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying IEAC's application for default judgment against Ursery. The application was denied because the evidence presented in the default judgment application contradicts the allegations in the Complaint. The Complaint alleged that Santanagiles was negligent and caused the collision, but the evidence presented suggests that Ursery was the driver responsible for the collision. Therefore, the Court has denied IEAC's application and granted leave for IEAC to file a First Amended Complaint.
