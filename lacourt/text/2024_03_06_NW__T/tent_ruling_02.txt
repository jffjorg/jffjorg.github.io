 Case Number:  23VECV03231    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  T COUGHLAN v.
VW 23VECV03231
In
reviewing the Declaration of Donald Mahnke filed on 2/29/2024, it is impossible
for the court to discern which of the specifically numbered responses are still
inadequate.  The declaration provides a
narrative of the existence of certain documents but does not connect those documents to specific
requests.  Plaintiff is directed to
specify which RFPs are still inadequate and why.  The matter will be continued for this purpose.  In the future, in order for the court to
issue an enforceable order, there must be specificity as to which RFPs are
still in issue before a hearing.  The 2/29/2024
declaration fails to mention any RFP by number.
