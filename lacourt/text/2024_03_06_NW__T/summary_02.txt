And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling addresses the declaration filed by Donald Mahnke on February 29, 2024. The court has difficulty understanding which specific numbered responses are still inadequate. The declaration provides a narrative of the existence of certain documents, but does not link those documents to specific requests. As a result, the plaintiff is directed to specify which RFPs are still inadequate and why. The matter will be continued for this purpose. In the future, the court will require specificity as to which RFPs are still in issue before a hearing. The 2/29/2024 declaration fails to mention any RFP by number, making it impossible for the court to issue an enforceable order. The plaintiff is expected to provide this specificity in order to move forward."
