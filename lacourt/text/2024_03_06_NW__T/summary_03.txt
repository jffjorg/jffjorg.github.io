And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by Adrine Van Diermen against Ford Motor Company and Harper Motors. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants were aware of defects in the vehicle's transmission but failed to disclose them. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the Economic Loss Rule (ELR) and that the "components exception" does not apply.

The judge has ruled that the ELR does not apply to the plaintiff's claims for fraudulent inducement and concealment, but does apply to the plaintiff's claims for negligent repair. The judge has also ruled that the "components exception" is inapplicable to the plaintiff's claims.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action (COA) for negligent repair without leave to amend, but has overruled the demurrer to the sixth COA for fraudulent inducement and concealment. The judge has ordered Ford Motor Company to file an answer within 20 days, and has dismissed Harper Motors with prejudice. The judge has also ordered Harper Motors to provide the court with a proposed judgment of dismissal.
