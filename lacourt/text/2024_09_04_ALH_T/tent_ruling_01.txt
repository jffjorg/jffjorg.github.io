  Case Number:  22STCV12232    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  T Motion for ReconsiderationMoving Party: Plaintiff Vivi DevereauxResponding Party: Defendants Mr. Furleys Bar, LLC; Richard Norman Foster; Mr. Furleys, LLC, et al.Tentative Ruling: DENYBACKGROUND This is a personal injury case. Plaintiff patroned Mr. Furley’s Bar and was assaulted at an unknown time and place sometime after, waking up with injuries the next morning in a nearby parking lot. Plaintiff asserted a negligence claim against Defendants alleging they failed to protect him from the attack by third parties. The Court granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgement against Plaintiff on the basis that Plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact that Defendants had notice of foreseeable harm giving rise to a duty to protect Plaintiff from a third-party assault.MOVING PARTY POSITION Plaintiff argues the Court should grant his motion for reconsideration based on Plaintiff’s deposition of Trinity Security—which provided security services to Defendants’ bar on the date of the incident. (See Deposition of Chardell Powell (“Trinity Depo.”) (Exhibit A to Declaration of Neer Lerner (“Lerner Decl.”)). Plaintiff argues that this deposition shows there are triable issues of material fact as to Defendants’ negligence that require further discovery, on the basis that Plaintiff’s new evidence shows Defendants exercise substantial control over the scope and nature of the security services and policies.OPPOSITION Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s motion merely renews Plaintiff’s prior motion to continue or deny Defendants’ motion for summary judgment citing the need for discovery, including the Trinity Security deposition. Defendants assert that the deposition of Trinity Security do not raise issues implicating the creation of any duty on the part of Defendants.REPLY  No reply was filed to Defendants’ opposition.ANALYSIS I. Evidentiary ObjectionsDefendants set out 11 objections relating to the Declaration of Neer Lerner in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion For Reconsideration: Sustained: No. 5 (lack of foundation) Overruled: Nos. 1–4, 6–11.  II. Motion for Reconsideration “A motion for reconsideration may only be brought if the party moving for reconsideration can offer ‘new or different facts, circumstances, or law’ which it could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the time of the prior motion....A motion for reconsideration will be denied absent a strong showing of diligence."  (Forrest v. Dept. Of Corps.  (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 183, 202, disapproved on other grounds by Shalant v. Girardi (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 1164, 1172.  See also Baldwin v. Home Sav. of Am. (1997) 59 Cal. App. 4th 1192, 1199 (noting that 1992 amendment to CCP §1008 tightened diligence requirements). “[M]otions to reconsider allow the trial court to consider new facts or law relevant to its order….”  (Morton v. Wagner (2007) 156 Cal. App. 4th 963, 973 (dictum).  [Emphasis added.] Cf. also Wiz Tech., Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 1, 17-18 (no relevant basis for reconsideration shown). Disagreement with a ruling is not a new fact that will support the granting of a motion for reconsideration. (Gilberd v.  AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 requires a plaintiff to provide a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide information earlier in order to merit reconsideration. (Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108; Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)“A defendant moving for summary judgment bears the burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit because plaintiff cannot establish an element of the claim or because defendant has a complete defense. If the defendant makes this showing, the burden then shifts to the plaintiff opposing the summary judgment motion to establish that a triable issue of fact exists as to these issues.” (Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 (2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 768, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143; Code Civ. Proc., §437c, subds. (a), (p)(2).)  “[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact[.]” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 941, 24 P.3d 493.) The burden of production involves the presentation of evidence.” (Id.; Evid. Code, §110.) To meet the burden of production, the party moving for summary judgment must support that motion “by affidavits, declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice shall or may be taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., §437c, subd. (b)(1).) In this case, reconsidering Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is inappropriate because Plaintiff presents new evidence that is immaterial to the issue on which summary judgement turned: Defendants’ duty. Reconsideration may be denied when new evidence is immaterial to the issue the motion turned on. (See, e.g., In re Imperial Ins. Co. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 290, 299) (denying motion for reconsideration due, in part, to evidence being immaterial to the issue judgement depended on.) Here, Plaintiff puts forward some new evidence not originally considered in granting Defendants’ summary judgement motion, but the evidence is immaterial to the issue of whether Defendant exercised sufficient control to give rise to a duty to protect Plaintiff from assault from third parties. Namely, Plaintiff failed to show a triable issue as to Defendants’ duty by failing to provide sufficient evidence of either control or foreseeability of harm (in the form of prior similar criminal incidents or other indications of heightened risk of violent criminal assaults in the parking lot.) (See Delgado v. Trax Bar & Grill (2005) 36 Cal. 4th 224, 244.) In fact, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration explicitly concedes its lack of material evidence with respect to this essential element, stating that while Plaintiff “woke up in the parking lot injured, the precise location where the attack originated is currently unknown.” (Motion for Reconsideration p. 7.) In doing so, Plaintiff concedes its failure to provide new evidence on a central issue summary judgement turned on. Thus, Plaintiff’s new evidence is immaterial to the critical issues pertinent to establish Defendants’ duty. It is accordingly unnecessary to reconsider Defendants’ motion for summary judgement. Further discovery is not necessary or appropriate in this case in the context of the motion for summary judgment. Courts may deny requests to continue discovery when a party fails to demonstrate diligence. (See Rodriguez v. Oto (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1020 (Request denied due to lack of diligence); Knapp v. Doherty (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 76 (Request denied due to failure to make showing justifying the request); Roth v. Rhodes (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 530 (Request denied due to lack of diligence); Johnson v. Alameda County Medical Center (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 521 (Request denied due to a lack of diligence).) Here, Plaintiff has not demonstrated his diligence in conducting discovery, nor has Plaintiff explained why the new evidence provided in this motion or additional future discovery could not have been obtained prior to the Court’s consideration of Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.  Indeed, Plaintiff has had two years to conduct discovery, and fails to explain why this amount of time is insufficient.RULING In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
