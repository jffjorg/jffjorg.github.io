And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment motion. The plaintiff, Vivi Devereaux, patroned Mr. Furley's Bar and was assaulted at an unknown time and place, waking up with injuries in a nearby parking lot. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants, Mr. Furleys Bar, LLC, Richard Norman Foster, and Mr. Furleys, LLC, et al., failed to protect him from the attack by third parties. The court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact regarding the defendants' duty to protect him.

The plaintiff argues that the court should reconsider its decision based on the deposition of Trinity Security, which provided security services to the defendants' bar on the date of the incident. However, the judge finds that the new evidence is immaterial to the issue of whether the defendants exercised sufficient control to give rise to a duty to protect the plaintiff. The plaintiff concedes its lack of material evidence regarding this essential element and failed to demonstrate diligence in conducting discovery. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied, and further discovery is not necessary or appropriate.
