 Case Number:  22STCV30200    Hearing Date:   March 20, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion to correct an alleged error in a minute
order.  The court generally agrees with
plaintiffs’ recitation.  In the prior
order, the court suggested, but did not order, plaintiffs to revise their
discovery.  The court noted that by
adding the prefatory clauses or including assertions of illegality in the
requests, they invited denials based on that language and might therefore not
get the substantive answers they were seeking. 
But the court did not order that. 
The court understands that plaintiffs in fact did revise their
discovery, which was a good thing. 
Revising the discovery had some effects—once revised, no responses to
the old discovery were required (although the verifications to the prior
answers were still required), which meant that the portion of the order
requiring further responses to the old discovery became moot.  The sanctions were as plaintiffs recall—the
defendants were found to have lacked substantial justification for the
situation and they were ordered to pay the filing fee for each motion.
Because there is no need to amend the order, this motion is
DENIED.  However, the court believes that
this motion was brought with substantial justification, and therefore
plaintiffs’ request for sanctions is also DENIED.
