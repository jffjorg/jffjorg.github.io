And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion to correct an alleged error in a previous minute order. The court agrees with the plaintiffs that the order suggested but did not require them to revise their discovery. The plaintiffs did revise their discovery, which had certain effects on the order. As a result, the portion of the order requiring further responses to the old discovery became moot. The court finds that the defendants lacked substantial justification for their actions and were ordered to pay the filing fee for each motion. However, the court believes that this motion was brought with substantial justification and therefore denies the request for sanctions. The motion to correct the alleged error in the minute order is also denied, as there is no need to amend the order.
