```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to vacate or modify the judgment to change the prejudgment interest rate. The defendant argued that the contract states that the interest rate is 75% of the Bank of America Prime Rate, which is 4.125%, rather than the default 10% rate awarded by the court. However, the court disagrees, finding that the contractual interest rate only applies after the full payment of the first installment, which did not occur in this case. The defendant tendered only half of the first installment and the note tendered did not accurately reflect the full amount owing. As a result, the trigger for the contractual interest rate never occurred, and the defendant does not enjoy the lower interest rate as part of the judgment. The prejudgment interest rate therefore remains at 10%.
