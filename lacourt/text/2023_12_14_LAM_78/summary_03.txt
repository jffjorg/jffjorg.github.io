And here is the English summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Jill Feeney regarding a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint filed by Defendant Vilma Hood. The case involves wrongful termination, violations of the Labor Code, false imprisonment, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiffs, Divina Villeda and Consuela "Lucy" Gamboa, claim that they were terminated by the defendants after reporting abuse by defendant Hood to adult protective services and police. The defendant Hood seeks to file a cross-complaint against the staffing agency that employed the plaintiffs during the time of the alleged abuse, claiming that the agency is responsible for her actions. The court grants the motion, finding that the proposed cross-complaint arises from the same series of occurrences leading up to the plaintiffs' termination and that Hood has acted in good faith. The court sets a hearing date for January 31, 2024, to consider dismissal of the cross-complaint if it is not filed and served within the required timeframe.
