Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Annette Brewer's motion to compel Defendant Methodist Hospital of Southern California's further responses to Form Interrogatories. The Plaintiff seeks additional responses to Form Interrogatory 201.5, which asks about the hiring of new employees after Plaintiff's termination. The Court finds that Defendant has already responded to this FROG and therefore denies the motion. The Court also declines to grant sanctions for Defendant's delay in serving supplemental responses, as Plaintiff had previously received sanctions for a related motion. The case will proceed to a hearing on December 14, 2023.
