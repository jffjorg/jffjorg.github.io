And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to stay and quash the deposition subpoena of Jonathan Lee, representing the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The subpoena is procedurally defective because it sought to depose an entity (DFPI) but then named a specific person (Jonathan Lee) as the deponent. Additionally, the Court found that the subpoena topics are unreasonable and do not lead to admissible evidence. The Court interpreted Financial Code section 2035(b)(4) to authorize the commissioner to deny an application if the applicant made a major change in the licensee's "business" of money transmission, and not "staffing levels". The Court also found that the August 18, 2023 Order issued by DFPI did not condition the merger on retaining PayQwick's employees. The motion to join the instant motion was granted, and the Court granted the motion to quash and stay enforcement of the subpoena.
