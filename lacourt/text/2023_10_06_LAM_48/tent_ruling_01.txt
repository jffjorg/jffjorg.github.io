Claimant
Nathan Noah Gama, a minor, by and through his parent and guardian ad litem, Guadalupe

exchange for $23,662.69.  If approved, the
funds will be deposited into a blocked account, subject to withdrawal only upon
authorization of the court.
Claimant
Joshua Joseph Gama, by and through his parent and guardian ad litem, Sabrina Ramona
Acosta, has agreed to settle his claims against Defendant County of Los Angeles
in exchange for $23,662.69.  If approved,
the funds will be deposited into a blocked account, subject to withdrawal only upon
authorization of the court.
Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and finds that it is fair and reasonable.
The
original Petitions did not include Attachments 11b(6), 17a, 17d, and 17e as required.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has now filed amendments to
the Petitions and included the Attachments.
Accordingly,
the Petitions to Approve Minor’s Compromises are GRANTED.  The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Proof
of Deposit Into Blocked Account for December 7, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.  (California Rules of Court, rule 7.953(a).)  If acknowledgement of receipt by the financial
institution is filed before that date, no appearance will be required.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
