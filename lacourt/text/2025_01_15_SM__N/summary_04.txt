And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for an appraisal of the subject property, citing that the motion is now moot due to the plaintiff's dismissal of the first cause of action for partition. The defendant had sought a determination of the value of the property and a buyout notice, but the judge ruled that since the plaintiff has dismissed the partition cause of action, the motion for appraisal is no longer necessary. The judge also noted that the defendant still retains the right to request a partition, but since the current cross-complaint does not contain a cause of action for partition, the motion for appraisal is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days.
