Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Cross-Defendant Aaron Celious' motion to deem his first set of requests for admission admitted. The motion was filed because responses and verifications to the requests for admission were not served in a timely manner. However, since responses and verifications were ultimately provided, the court has denied the motion. The court will only consider arguments about the substance of the responses in the context of a motion to compel further responses, if such a motion is filed.
