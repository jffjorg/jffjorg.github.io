And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment or adjudication filed by Scott D. Bader and 93 Eighty LP, the defendants. The defendants argued that the plaintiff, Milaud Talebizadeh, cannot prove that they breached any duty of care because the pallet at issue was "open and obvious" to the plaintiff. The judge agrees with the defendants, finding that the pallet was indeed "open and obvious" and that the plaintiff failed to provide competent evidence creating a triable issue of material fact as to whether the condition was open and obvious.

The judge also found that the defendants lacked actual and constructive notice of the dangerous condition, as there was no evidence that they had received any complaints or information about the condition, and they did not reside at the property with their children, who placed the pallet on the sidewalk.

The judge has ordered the defendants to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.
