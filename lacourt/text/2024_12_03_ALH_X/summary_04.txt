The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production (Set One) to February 26, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department X of the Alhambra Courthouse. Additionally, the judge has advanced the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production (Set Two) to February 26, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department X of the Alhambra Courthouse. The judge has also scheduled an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) for January 23, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. in Department X of the Alhambra Courthouse, which can be attended virtually or remotely.

The parties are ordered to meet and confer before the IDC and are required to file an IDC form (LACIV 094) at least five court days prior to the IDC. The form should indicate the discovery requests that remain at issue. Counsel for the Plaintiff is also required to give notice.

The judge has also provided guidance on what documents the parties are required to exchange in the event of a discovery dispute in a Song-Beverly case, including warranty policy and procedure manuals, internal analysis and investigation documents, customer complaints, and other relevant documents.
