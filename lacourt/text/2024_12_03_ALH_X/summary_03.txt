And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Baruch Kreiman, counsel for the plaintiff, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in communication with the plaintiff. Despite diligent efforts to re-establish communication, the breakdown was unsuccessful. The judge finds good cause to grant the request, as the plaintiff will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal of counsel. The motion was supported by the required documents, including a declaration stating the reasons for the motion and proof of service of the motion on the plaintiff and the defendant. The judge orders counsel to file proof of service of the signed order on the plaintiff and all other parties within five days after the date of the order.
