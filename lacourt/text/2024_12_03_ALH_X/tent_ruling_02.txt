Pun (“Pun”), and his employment with Defendant Mega Bank (“Bank”).  Plaintiff Pun is a 61-year-old banking expert with experience in the industry, particularly in working with troubled and distressed banks.  Defendant Bank was founded in 2006 by a group of Chinese American investors.  Defendant Edward Lo (“Lo”) served as the CEO and President of the bank until February 2020, and he was responsible for hiring Plaintiff Pun as the CFO in 2016.The FAC alleges seven causes of action: (1) retaliation, (2) age discrimination, (3) hostile work environment, (4) wrongful discharge in violation of Government Code section 12940, (5) defamation, (6) unfair business practices, (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (8) harassment.  (The Demurrer to the eighth cause of action was sustained without leave to amend in October 2022.)Tentative RulingDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.  Summary Adjudication is GRANTED as to Plaintiff Pun’s causes of action for Age Discrimination (second), Defamation (fifth), and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (seventh).  Adjudication is DENIED as to the remaining causes of action (first, third, fourth, and sixth).Request for Judicial NoticePlaintiff Pan requests judicial notice of the following documents:1.

Notice of Orders Issued on March 14, 2022 re: Notice of Related Cases for Case No. 21GDCV00387 and Case No. 22AHCV00045.6. The FAC in this instant case, Rob C. Pun v Mega Bank et al., Case No. 22AHCV00045.7. 10/13/22 Minute Order in this instant case.The requests for judicial notice are GRANTED as to requests nos. 1-3 and 5-7.  Evidence Code section 452(d)(1) authorizes the taking of judicial notice of the official records of any court of this state. The Executive Order N-33-20 in request 4 is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452(b)-(c). The webpage in request 4 is DENIED and not judicially noticed.Evidentiary ObjectionsPlaintiff’s evidentiary objections nos. 1 to 21 are DENIED.Legal StandardSpecial rules govern allocation of the burden of proof on motions for summary judgment in employment discrimination cases, under both federal and state law, and state courts follow the approach taken by federal courts in these cases.  The test uses a system of shifting burdens.  (Guz v. Bechtel Nat’l, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 354-355.)  When the employer seeks summary judgment, the initial burden rests with the employer to show that no unlawful discrimination or retaliation occurred.  (Id.; Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); University of Southern California v. Superior Court (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036; Sada v. Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 138, 155 [same test applies with FEHA retaliation claims].)  It does this first by showing that the employee’s action has no merit (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(p) (2)).  It may do so by evidence that either: 1) negates an essential element of the employee’s claim; or 2) shows some “legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for the action taken against the employee.  (See Caldwell v. Paramount Unified School Dist. (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 189, 202–203.) If the employer meets this initial burden, to avoid summary judgment, the employee must produce “substantial responsive evidence that the employer’s showing was untrue or pretextual,” thereby raising at least an inference of discrimination.  (Hersant v. California Dept. of Social Services (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 997, 1004-1005, internal quotes omitted; University of Southern California v. Superior Court (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.) In determining whether these burdens were met, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, as the nonmoving party, liberally construing his evidence while strictly scrutinizing defendant’s evidence.  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856.)Legal AnalysisRetaliation and Protected Activity (first cause of action)To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he or she engaged in a “protected activity,” (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer’s action.  (Iwekaogwu v. City of Los Angeles (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 803, 814-815; Flait v. North American Watch Corp. (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 467, 476 [adopting the title VII burden-shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green (1973) 411 U.S. 792, 802-805.)  Once an employee establishes a prima facie case, the employer is required to offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action.  (Morgan v. Regents of University of California (2000) 88 Cal.App.4th 52, 68.)  If the employer produces a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, the presumption of retaliation “ ‘ “drops out of the picture,” ‘ “ and the burden shifts back to the employee to prove intentional retaliation.  (Ibid.)Defendants’ motion asserts that Defendant Fong was aware of Plaintiff Pun’s performance issues shortly after Fong began working at the Bank, because it was documented by former CEO John Nerland in Plaintiff Pun’s file.  (UMF 25-26.)  Fong began to notice deficiencies in Plaintiff Pun’s performance after working with Plaintiff Pun for a few months.  (UMF 33.) In July 2020 the FDIC and DFPI came to the Bank to conduct the Safety and Soundness Exam.  (UMF 36.)  During the examination, the FDIC determined weaknesses in the area of Finance.  At the exit meeting with the FDIC, the Bank was told it would be placed under a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”).  (UMF 37.)  The MOU impacted the Bank by placing it under restrictions.  (UMF 40.)  A deficiency noted in the MOU was that the Bank did not have a sound Deposit Management Program (“DMP”).  (UMF 46.)  The DMP is the strategy on how a bank is going to obtain money to fund loans and was one of Plaintiff Pun’s responsibilities.  (UMF 47.)  Plaintiff Pun assured Fong that he knew what to do and that he had a DMP ready to discuss with the examiners come July 2021.  (UMF 49.) In July 2021, the Bank underwent examination, which resulted in a Report of Examination (“ROE”).  (UMF 50.)  Fong, Plaintiff Pun, and Wilson Ngai were informed that there were continued deficiencies which included the DMP.  (UMF 51.)  The FDIC had concerns regarding Plaintiff Pun’s knowledge and his failure to communicate more with one of the Bank’s auditors, Audit One.  (UMF 55.)  On August 30, 2021, Fong placed a memo in Plaintiff Pun’s file, regarding Pun’s deficiencies and his concerns during the examination.  (UMF 59-60.)  On September 3, 2021, Fong informed Plaintiff Pun that he had issues with Pun’s performance and that he wanted to fire Plaintiff Pun (UMF 61), but Fong did not terminate Plaintiff because of the MOU as Fong would have been required to notify the FDIC of any change in management, which would have raised questions about the adequacy of the management (UMF 62-64.) Another issue that arose during the examination was the Call Report, a quarterly-filed public document reflecting the performance of a financial institution.  (UMF 65.)  According to Defendants, the Call Report was Plaintiff Pun’s responsibility, and the examiners determined that the 2021 first and second quarter Call Reports contained errors and needed to be re-filed.  (UMF 66.)  On September 7, 2021, Fong filed a memo about Plaintiff’s continued performance issues.  (UMF 67-68.)  According to Defendants, Plaintiff Pun had almost a year to correct the MOU deficiencies but failed to do so.  (UMF 69.)  On September 13, 2021, Fong discussed with Plaintiff about his performance including the issues in both the memos Fong wrote, but Plaintiff refused to take responsibility, so Fong had no alternative but to terminate Plaintiff’s employment.  (UMF 70-72.)  Defendants assert that they made the decision to terminate Plaintiff for poor performance, not in retaliation for someone else filing a lawsuit.  (Motion, p. 15.)  Defendants argue Plaintiff cannot show a causal connection between his protected activity and the termination.  Defendants have met their initial burden.In opposition, Plaintiff Pun asserts that he had no issues with Defendants Lo and Fong until March 2021—around the time non-party Stephen He filed a lawsuit against Defendant Bank, Lo, Fong, and Ngai—when Lo and Fong suspected Plaintiff Pun assisted He.  (PSS 42.)  Plaintiff Pun also served as a witness in He’s case and another colleague’s case against Defendant Bank.  (PSS 3.)  According to Plaintiff’s opposition, the timing of the retaliation, happening immediately after Lo and Fong suspected Plaintiff referred He to an attorney, shows a causal connection.  (See Steele v. Youthful Offender Parole Bd. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1255 [Employer retaliation against employees who are believed to be prospective complainants or witnesses for complainants undermines this legislative purpose just as effectively as retaliation after the filing of a complaint].)The two memos taking issue with Plaintiff Pun’s performance authored by Fong were written on August 30, 2021 and September 7, 2021—authored quickly in succession and four months after Fong and Lo were served Plaintiff’s colleague’s lawsuit on April 19, 2021 (see PSS 68).  This evidence is sufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to whether Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff Pun. Summary adjudication is denied as to the first cause of action.Age Discrimination (second cause of action)For age discrimination, a plaintiff must allege that he “(1) is over the age of 40; (2) suffered an adverse employment action; (3) was performing satisfactorily at the time of the adverse action; and (4) suffered the adverse action under circumstances that give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination, i.e., evidence that the plaintiff was replaced by someone significantly younger than the plaintiff.”  (Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 321.)Plaintiff Pun is over the age of 40; he is 64 years old (PSS 10) and was 60 years old at the time of the alleged age discrimination (UMF 127).  Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action; he was terminated from his position with Defendant Bank on September 13, 2021.  (UMF 70-72.)Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case because he was not satisfactorily performing his job as CFO, and he was not replaced by a significantly younger person, but rather by Mr. Vecci and Ms. Kim who were over 60 years old at hiring.  Even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case, Defendants assert they had legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Plaintiff’s employment (e.g., his unsatisfactory job performance and because Defendant Bank was placed, and stayed, under the MOU during Plaintiff’s tenure), which Plaintiff cannot show was merely pretext for age discrimination.  (See UMF 59, 60, 67, 68, 131.)  Defendants have met their burden as to this cause of action.In opposition, Plaintiff points to evidence of disparate treatment and discriminatory remarks as indicators that the real motive behind his termination is his age.  Plaintiff Pun declares that Defendant Fong made references to Plaintiff’s age multiple times.  For example, Fong blamed Plaintiff Pun for the errors in the 2021 Q1 Call Report and stated, “you are a 60-year-old-man what the hell are you thinking.”  (PSS 53.)  Plaintiff alleges that after Lo and Fong were served with He’s lawsuit, Fong began retaliating against Plaintiff Pun, “nit-picking his work, blaming him for errors of others, shaming Pun for his age and lack of smarts, magnifying minor errors to manufacture evidence and justify termination.”  (PSS 2.)  Plaintiff’s assertions meet an inference of age discrimination.Plaintiff Pun also alleges he was performing satisfactorily at the time of the adverse action.  That is, “[w]hile gaslighting Pun, Fong also obscured the good work of Pun.  In the 2021 Regulatory Examination regulators upgraded CAMELS component to satisfactory.  (CAMELS is under Pun’s purview).  PSS#59.  On Sept. 7, 2021, due to Pun’s rebalancing initiative, Mega received $322K in tax refunds.  PSS#60.  Pun’s investigation of Rialto Solar Tax Benefits resulting in tax refunds of $378K. PSS# 61.  Pun initiated Fiserv negotiation saving Mega $300K. PSS# 62[.]” (Motion, p. 13.) Plaintiff’s attempt to establish pretext through Defendant Fong’s comments fails to create a triable issue of fact regarding age discrimination.  This is largely due to the fact that Plaintiff Pun was replaced by two people who were over age 60 at the time of hiring.  In the absence of evidence that Plaintiff Pun was replaced by someone significantly younger, Plaintiff fails to satisfy his burden in showing a triable issue of fact. Summary adjudication is granted as to the second cause of action.Hostile Work Environment (third cause of action)“Under the FEHA, it is unlawful ‘[f]or an employer ... or any other person, because of ... national origin ... [or] age ... to harass an employee ....’ (Citation.)  To establish a prima facie case of a hostile work environment, [plaintiff] must show that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her protected status; (4) the harassment unreasonably interfered with her work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (5) defendants are liable for the harassment.”  (Ortiz v. Dameron Hospital Assn. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 568, 581.)  Further, pursuant to Government Code section 12923(b), “A single incident of harassing conduct is sufficient to create a triable issue regarding the existence of a hostile work environment if the harassing conduct has unreasonably interfered with the plaintiff’s work performance or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.” Defendants argue that Plaintiff Pun cannot establish that he was subjected to harassment that was severe or pervasive enough to alter the conditions of his employment.  Defendants cite case law holding that isolated, sporadic, or trivial comments are not enough to create a hostile work environment under FEHA.  Defendants argue Plaintiff’s harassment claim fails because the three isolated comments calling Plaintiff a “sixty-year-old man” are neither severe nor pervasive.  Defendants argue the comments are true because in September 2021, Mr. Pun was a 60-year-old man.  (UMF 91.) In opposition, Plaintiff Pun explains how Defendants Lo and Fong behaved.  Between April 19 to May 12, 2021, Lo incessantly called Plaintiff Pun to accuse him of having referred He to the attorney.  (PSS 35.)  Fong threatened to fire Plaintiff, ordered Plaintiff to resign, and challenged Plaintiff to sue Defendant Bank.  (PSS 53.)  Fong yelled and screamed at Plaintiff Pun, which was overheard by Plaintiff’s employees.  (PSS 53.)  Fong has screamed at Plaintiff and accused him of unknown or supposed problems.  (PSS 55.)A triable issue of fact exists as to whether the atmosphere in the workplace met the legal standard for harassment.  Summary adjudication is denied as to the third cause of action.Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy (fourth cause of action)Defendants assert Plaintiff Pun’s claim for wrongful termination fails because the claim is derivative of Plaintiff’s FEHA claims and those fail.  As Plaintiff Pun has presented triable issues of fact regarding some of his FEHA claims, summary adjudication as to the fourth cause of action is denied.Defamation (Slander) (fifth cause of action)“The tort of defamation ‘involves (a) a publication that is (b) false, (c) defamatory and (d) unprivileged, and that (e) has a natural tendency to injure or that causes special damage.’  [Citations.]”  (Taus v. Loftus (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 720.)  “A false and unprivileged oral communication attributing to a person specific misdeeds or certain unfavorable characteristics or qualities, or uttering certain other derogatory statements regarding a person, constitutes slander.”  (Shively v. Bozanich (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1230, 1242.)Defendants argue that Plaintiff Pun’s defamation claim against Lo fails as a matter of law because Plaintiff Pun admits that Lo did not defame him.  (UMF 112.)  Further, Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s defamation claim against Fong and the Bank also fails for several reasons: Fong’s statements were true, were not defamatory, were not made to third parties, and were based on non-actionable statements of opinion. Defendant says the alleged defamatory statements are as follows. Fong screamed at Plaintiff and told him he ought to be ashamed of himself.  (UMF 114.)  Fong belittled him and stated, “you’ve been in this space for a long time.”  (UMF 115.)  Fong wrongfully accused Plaintiff of making a mistake and also said that if he was not in the examination, he would have fired him.  (UMF 123.)The opposition has a different recollection of the defamatory statements, and cites to PSS 67: Pun knew what Lo and Fong had been planning to terminate him.  Early on, he was warned by Director Wan, when Lo began accusing Pun of having referred He to Atty. Espina.  To protect Pun, Wan provided him with information and documentary evidence.  Wan also informed Pun that he and the other directors were not safe from Lo either - that they were being grilled by Lo about leaking information about Mega’s plan to fire Pun.  Wan informed Pun that Pun was going to be fired after the 2021 Regulatory Examination.  Wan felt sorry about how Lo and Fong were treating Pun.  Wan unfortunately died on December 2022 and hence unable to testify in this litigation.(PSS 67; see Opposition, p. 20.)Here, Plaintiff Pun has not presented sufficient evidence of defamatory statements to third parties.  In the absence of these facts, summary adjudication is granted as to the fifth cause of action. Unfair Business Practices (sixth cause of action)The motion’s only argument regarding the sixth cause of action for unfair business practice is that that since the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action fail, the sixth cause of action fails as well.  Where summary adjudication was denied as to the first, third, and fourth causes of action, summary adjudication as to the sixth cause of action is also denied.Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (seventh cause of action)Defendants’ motion argues two reasons why the claim for IIED should fail.  First, because the first through fifth causes of action fail and this seventh cause of action is based on the same underlying intentional tort.  This argument fails where the first, third, and fourth causes of action survive summary judgment/adjudication.  Defendants next argue that IIED is barred by worker’s compensation exclusivity.“An employee who suffers a disabling emotional injury caused by the employment is entitled, upon appropriate proof, to workers’ compensation benefits, including any necessary disability compensation or medical or hospital benefits.”  (Livitsanos v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 744, 754.)  “So long as the basic conditions of compensation are otherwise satisfied (Lab.Code, § 3600), and the employer’s conduct neither contravenes fundamental public policy (Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 27 Cal.3d 167, 164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330) nor exceeds the risks inherent in the employment relationship (Cole, supra, 43 Cal.3d 148, 233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743), an employee’s emotional distress injuries are subsumed under the exclusive remedy provisions of workers’ compensation.”  (Ibid.)The latter exception, under Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 148, 160, has been described as follows: “[T]he exclusive remedy provisions are not applicable under various circumstances, sometimes various identified as ‘conduct where the employer or insurer stepped out of their proper roles’ [citations], or ‘conduct of an employer having a “questionable” relationship to the employment’ [citations], but which may be essentially defined as not stemming from a risk reasonably encompassed within the compensation bargain.”  (Shoemaker v. Myers (1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 16; see Fermino v. Fedco, Inc. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 701, 714 [“[T]here are certain types of intentional employer conduct which bring the employer beyond the boundaries of the compensation bargain, for which a civil action may be brought.”].)California courts have concluded claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress in the employment context may be asserted where the actionable conduct also forms the basis for a FEHA violation.  (See, e.g., Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243, 288; Murray v. Oceanside Unified School Dist. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1362–1363; Fretland v. County of Humboldt (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1492; Cabesuela v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Cal., Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 101, 113; Kovatch v. California Cas. Management Co. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1277–1278; Leibert v. Transworld Systems, Inc. (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1693, 1706–1707; Accardi v. Superior Court (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 341, 352–353; see also Agarwal v. Johnson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 932, 946–947 [affirming judgment on a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress based on racial harassment in the employment context, without discussing workers’ compensation exclusivity]; Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 498–499 [same].  But see Jones v. Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1382 [holding, as an alternative ground and without discussing the foregoing authorities, that an emotional distress claim based on allegations of discrimination was subject to workers’ compensation exclusivity].)In Accardi, for example, the court reasoned as follows: “Emotional distress caused by misconduct in employment relations involving, for example, promotions, demotions, criticism of work practices, negotiations as to grievances, is a normal part of the employment environment.  A cause of action for such a claim is barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers’ compensation law.  [Citation.]  The Legislature, however, did not intend that an employer be allowed to raise the exclusivity rule for the purpose of deflecting a claim of discriminatory practices.”  (Accardi, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at p. 352.)  The Accardi plaintiff “allege[d] that she suffered emotional distress because of the pattern of continuing violations which were discriminatory; her cause of action for emotional distress is founded upon actions that are outside the normal part of the employment environment and violate this state’s policy against sex discrimination.”  (Id., at pp. 352–353.)  Accardi concluded, “As such, her claim for emotional distress arising out of sexual harassment is not barred by the exclusivity provisions of workers’ compensation laws.”  (Id., at p. 353.)Given these legal principles, Plaintiff Pun may pursue a claim for IIED in the employment context where the conduct at issue violates FEHA and also satisfies the elements of the claim. “The elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are: ‘ “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct. . . .”  Conduct to be outrageous must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.’”  (Christensen v. Superior Court (1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 903.)  “Liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress ‘ “does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities.” ‘ “ (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1051.)  A retaliatory motive alone is insufficient to sustain a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  (Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 80.)Here, the facts are simply insufficient to establish that Defendants engaged in extreme or outrageous conduct with intent or reckless disregard for Plaintiff Pun.  Where Pun claims that he was questioned, blamed for errors, and that his work was nit-picked, this is insufficient to establish outrageous conduct exceeding what is tolerated in a civilized community.  Accordingly, summary adjudication is granted as to the seventh cause of action.Moving Party is to give notice.
