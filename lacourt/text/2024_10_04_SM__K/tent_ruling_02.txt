The term “prejudgment interest” is a convenient
shorthand phrase for CC § 3291 interest but is really a misnomer, as the

However, since that is an unknown date in the future, a good date for
appeal bond purposes would be the 2/2/24 date at which this Court found and ordered
the total amount of § 3291 interest (appx. $534.8K) owed by DAK to all P’s up
to that point.
