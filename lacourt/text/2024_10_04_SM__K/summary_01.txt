- "This Court finds that CC § 3291 interest is both 'payable by the appellant' and 'costs awardable under CCP § 998' and therefore, under CCP § 917.1, must be covered by the appeals bond."
- "The obvious policy behind making a defendant/appellant post an undertaking per § 917.1 is to ensure that the prevailing appellee can be made whole for the amount awarded to it before undergoing the additional cost and expense of an appeal."
- "Excluding an award of prejudgment interest is not only nonsensical, but would fail to completely accomplish the public policy goals of § 917.1."
```
And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the sufficiency of the bond posted by Dakovic & Sons (JMM) to cover the judgment against Desiree Flaws (P-Flaws). The Judge finds that the bond is insufficient and orders Dakovic & Sons to post an additional bond in the amount of $122,605.27 to cover the prejudgment interest owed to P-Flaws.

The Judge holds that the prejudgment interest is an additional penalty imposed on Dakovic & Sons for failing to accept P-Flaws' settlement offer and must be covered by the appeals bond. The Judge also finds that the bond posted by Dakovic & Sons does not account for the prejudgment interest owed to P-Flaws and orders the posting of an additional bond to cover this amount.

The ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) and the California Civil Code (CC), including CCP § 917.1, CCP § 995.930, CCP § 998, and CC § 3291. The Judge's decision is intended to ensure that P-Flaws can be made whole for the amount awarded to her before undergoing the additional cost and expense of an appeal.
