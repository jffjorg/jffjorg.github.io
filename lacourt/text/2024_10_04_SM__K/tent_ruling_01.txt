I
INTRODUCTION
            In this asbestos personal injury
matter, a jury trial was held in May-June 2023 and on 6/26/23 the jury rendered
a verdict in favor of all 3 named Plaintiffs (“P”) and against Defendants JMM
and Dakovic & Sons (“DAK”).  Judgment
was entered on 9/27/23.  Both Defendants
have filed Notices of Appeal.  Pursuant
to CCP § 917.1, in order to forestall any enforcement actions against a
judgment pending appeal, the debtor must post an undertaking/bond in the amount
of 1.5X the judgment or order awarded, including costs.  Here, Plaintiff Desiree Flaws (“P-Flaws”)
asserts that DAK failed to procure such a bond/undertaking to cover her
judgment against DAK.  DAK disputes this
claim and asserts that it has a bond sufficient to cover all 3 Plaintiffs’
judgments.
            An initial hearing on this matter
was conducted on 9/13/24 and continued until 10/4/24.
            
 
 
II
ANALYSIS
A.   
Timeliness of P’s Objection
With respect to DAK’s argument that
P-Flaws’ objection is untimely, this Court 
disagrees.  DAK’s filing of a Rider to the original
undertaking was done on 7/9/24, which for the first time purported to cover
P-Flaws’ judgment and costs.  P-Flaws
filed her objection within the 10 day deadline mandated by CCP  995.930, by filing this motion on 7/18/24.
 
B.   
Sufficiency of Undertaking 
P-Flaws was awarded a judgment in damages
for $270K (for simplicity, all sums in this Order shall for purposes of
readability be rounded off to the nearest $1K). 
Under CCP § 917.1, the undertaking/bond must be for 1.5X the judgment,
thereby equaling $405K to cover P Flaws’ $270K judgment.  DAK has not posted an undertaking/bond
specifically for P-Flaws, and she therefore asserts that enforcement of her
judgment shall not be stayed pending appeal per 
§
917.1(a).
            DAK admits that it did not initially
procure a bond specifically for P-Flaws’ judgment, but argues that her judgment
is nonetheless protected because DAK procured a bond in the amount of $4.715M,
which is purported to cover the entire judgment (including costs) that was
ordered against DAK and in favor of all 3 Plaintiffs, including P-Flaws.  Specifically, DAK asserts that the judgment
against it and in favor of all Plaintiffs totals $3.143M, which when multiplied
by 1.5 equals approximately $4.715M.  DAK
argues that because it subsequently executed a Rider to the bond adding
P-Flaws, it cured the initial failure of a bond protecting her interests.  In so doing, DAK asserts that all of
Plaintiff’s judgements and costs (including P-Flaws’) are collectively
protected by the $4.715M bond.
            P-Flaws appears to have little
quarrel with the structural idea of one bond covering all 3 plaintiffs’
interests, but instead argues that DAK’s figures do not reflect the full amount
of DAK’s liability to all 3 Plaintiffs, including P-Flaws.  According to P-Flaw’s calculations, the total
judgment owed by DAK to all 3 plaintiffs is $3.678M and therefore 1.5X that
figure totals $5.517M.  This is the
amount P-Flaws argues should be undertaken to cover all debts to all 3
plaintiffs by DAK.  Comparing that figure
to DAK’s bond of $4.715M, the shortfall according to P-Flaws is $802K.  The major disagreement between the competing
sums seems to stem from P-Flaws’ position that the $534.8K in pre-judgment
interest (previously stipulated to and awarded) must be covered by the appeal
bond, while DAK’s position is that this figure is exempt from appeal bond
coverage.
1.    
Pre-Judgment Interest [1]
Prejudgment interest is authorized under
CC § 3291 when a plaintiff makes a settlement 
offer
pursuant to CCP § 998, which is rejected by a defendant and the plaintiff subsequently
wins a judgment exceeding the settlement offer sum.  In such a situation, the P is entitled to 10%
pre-judgment interest starting from the date of P’s first offer and running
until the judgment is satisfied.  CC §
3291.  Here, P’s made a collective § 998
offer to DAK to settle for $500K, which DAK rejected, and Plaintiffs recovered
a verdict against DAK in the amount of approximately $2.63M, exclusive of costs
and interest.  As such, P’s are collectively
entitled to prejudgment interest in the stipulated amount of $534.8K.
            DAK cites Hess v. Ford Motor Co. (2002)
27 Cal.4th 516, 532 for the proposition that 
§
3291 prejudgment interest, while awardable, cannot be a part of the
judgment.  This conclusion was compelled by
the Supreme Court’s finding that prejudgment interest could not be compounded post-judgment;
in other words, the Hess court wanted to expressly avoid awarding
post-judgment interest on a pre-judgment interest award.  Id. at 531 (“Section 3291 provides for
a single award of interest and expressly eschews any division of this
award into separate prejudgment and post-judgment components.”)  This analysis, while interesting, has no
bearing on the issue at bar, i.e., whether the appeal bond under § 917.1 must
cover § CC 3291 “prejudgment” interest.  
            CCP § 917.1 specifies that any undertaking
on appeal must cover, inter alia, “money . . .. payable by the appellant,” and “costs
awarded pursuant to Section 998.”  There
is no question that the prejudgment interest awarded by this Court is money owed
and payable by appellant DAK.  Moreover,
while CCP § 998 does not expressly authorize the award of prejudgment interest,
CC § 3291, explicitly conditions the award of prejudgment interest on when “a
plaintiff makes an offer pursuant to Section 998 of the CCP which the defendant
does not accept . . . and the plaintiff obtains a more favorable judgment . . .
.”  In such a scenario, CC § 3291 awards 10%
interest starting on the date of the first § 998 offer, and such “interest
shall accrue until the satisfaction of judgment.”  Thus, while not expressly authorized under §
998, prejudgment interest is clearly another type of reward available to a
plaintiff who chooses to offer settlement pursuant to CCP § 998 and prevails in
that endeavor.  Put in terms of this
case, the $535K award in prejudgment interest is an additional penalty imposed
on DAK for failing to accept P’s $500K § 998 offer.  This is money owed to Plaintiffs for
prevailing on both this suit as well as their 
§
998 offer.  The obvious policy behind
making a defendant/appellant post an undertaking per 
§
917.1 is to ensure that the prevailing appellee can be made whole for the
amount awarded to it before undergoing the additional cost and expense of an
appeal.  The flip side of that same
policy is to ensure that defendant/appellants can and will pay the award
against them before subjecting the plaintiff/appellees and the entire court
system to the cost and expense of an appeal; i.e., that the appeal is not
simply an exercise in futility.  Excluding
an award of prejudgment interest is not only nonsensical, but would fail to
completely accomplish the public policy goals of § 917.1.  Thus, this Court finds that CC § 3291
interest is both “payable by the appellant” and “costs awardable under CCP §
998” and therefore, under CCP § 917.1, must be covered by the appeals bond. 
 
III
REMEDY AND ORDER
At the initial hearing of this matter on
9/13/24, this Court held that the DAK bond was 
insufficient
to cover its true liability against P-Flaws; specifically, that the bond failed
to account for the prejudgment interest on the $270K judgment DAK owes P-Flaws.  This Court ordered each side to submit
further briefing as to the proper additional amount of bond necessary to cover
P-Flaw’s prejudgment interest owed her.  The
parties had previously stipulated that the amount of prejudgment interest owed
to all 3 plaintiffs was $535K, and both sides have submitted competing proposed
formulas for determining how much of that $535K total is owed to P-Flaws.  
In addition, P has submitted another
alternative which this Court favors and will apply  – an actual calculation of the § 3291 interest
DAK owes (both prejudgment and post judgment) to P-Flaws from the date of the §
998 offer (11/23/21) to this Court’s determination of costs (2/2/24).[2]  Starting with the principal $270K judgment
DAK owes P-Flaws, applying the 10% interest mandated by CC § 3291, the interest
owed would be $27K per year or $73.97/day. 
The amount of days from 11/23/21 (the date of P’s § 998 offer) to 2/2/24
(the date of this Court’s Cost Order) is 1105 days.  1105 days times $73.97/day interest equals $81,736.85
in interest accrued to 2/1/24 and owed by DAK to P-Flaws.  Applying 1.5x of that sum per CCP § 917.1, the
net amount of the § 3291 interest bond should be $122,605.27.  Accordingly, DAK is hereby ordered to post an
additional bond in the amount of $122,605.27 with P-Flaws as the sole
beneficiary.  Such additional posting
must be completed within 30 days of this Order or else 
//
//
 
P-Flaws
may begin executing on her judgment against DAK.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
