And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which involves a motion to quash service of summons brought by defendant Wright. Wright claims that California lacks personal jurisdiction over her, as she is licensed in Florida and not California. The court notes that personal jurisdiction is the ability of a state to exercise power over a defendant who is not physically present in the state. The court must determine whether California has jurisdiction over Wright based on her contacts with the state.

The court has reviewed the evidence presented and concludes that it cannot determine whether California has jurisdiction over Wright based on this record alone. Therefore, the court will allow jurisdictional discovery to be taken and continue the motion to allow further briefing based on that discovery.

The court also notes that Wright raises the issue of forum non conveniens, which suggests that even if California has the power to force Wright to litigate here, it ought to decline that power where there is a better forum elsewhere. However, the court believes it is not wise to consider this issue now and will address it only if the motion to quash is denied.

Finally, the court will discuss timing with the parties to determine when the jurisdictional discovery will take place and when the parties will have an opportunity to brief the issue further.
