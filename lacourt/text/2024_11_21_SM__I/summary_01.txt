And here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to continue the trial, without prejudice, in a breach of contract case that has been pending for over five years. The defendant, ATS Construction, is seeking to continue the trial, citing the need to retake discovery and possibly file a summary judgment motion. However, the judge finds that the defendant has not demonstrated diligence in responding to the case, as they waited a year and a half before answering after being served in March 2023. The judge also notes that the case has already been continued three times and that the court's docket is extremely busy, with over 1100 cases currently pending. The judge disfavors continuances and requires a strong showing of good cause to justify one. Therefore, the motion is denied. The judge will also inquire about a notice of disassociation of counsel and may require a motion to withdraw counsel.
