And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to add a cause of action for breach of a lease agreement, but the Defendants oppose the amendment, claiming it is improper. The Judge is unsure why the Plaintiff is only now seeking to add this cause of action, and the Plaintiff has not provided a declaration explaining the delay. The Judge is also concerned about the potential prejudice to the Defendants from the proposed amendment, as it may nullify their 998 offer. The Judge has denied the motion without prejudice, and requires the Plaintiff to file a declaration addressing the issues raised by the motion.
