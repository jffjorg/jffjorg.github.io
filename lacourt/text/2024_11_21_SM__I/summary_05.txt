And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion to continue the trial due to the plaintiff's serious medical problem, which was discovered during the plaintiff's deposition on July 9, 2024. The defendant has not been able to conduct an Independent Medical Examination (IME) or complete the plaintiff's deposition due to the medical issue. The judge is concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the medical treatment and its impact on the trial. The court is considering continuing the trial to a later date, potentially in June 2026, but needs more information to make a decision. The judge is also weighing the potential benefit of forcing the parties to be ready for trial if the court will not be able to hear the matter.
