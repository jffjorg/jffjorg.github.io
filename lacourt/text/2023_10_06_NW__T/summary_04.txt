And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Reliant v Cooper, setting aside two ex parte applications. The first application is by Superior Life for a stay, which the court will hear on its merits. The judge notes that there is no impending sale or distribution, and therefore no basis to hear the application on an emergency basis. The second application is by Scott Grady for an order requiring the Receiver to collect premiums. The court will also hear this application on its merits, as there is no evidence that there are any policies on the verge of lapsing for non-payment. The judge notes that the court will not litigate the case on ex parte applications, and that motions will be heard on notice as set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure.
