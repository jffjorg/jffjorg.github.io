 Case Number:  23VECV00840    Hearing Date:   October 6, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV00840
Levine v Albright
Tentative
ruling on motion to compel form interrogatories:  The motion is moot as the responses have been
served.  If there is need for further
meet and confer, then the parties should engage in that before filing a motion
to compel further responses.  The court
notes also that objections were improperly served. Monetary sanctions granted
pursuant to CCP section 2023.010 for discovery abuse without any justification (the
discovery was served April 2023 and not responded to until September 2023) in
the amount of $1,200 assessed against plaintiff Tamara Levine and her prior counsel,
Lowell Steiger, jointly and severally, payable by 11/6/2023 to the Client Trust
Account of Schumann Arevalo LLP, 3100 Bristol St. #100, Costa Mesa, CA 92626.  Fees in excess of that amount are found by
the court to be unnecessary and not reasonable for this simplest of motions.
Tentative
ruling on motion to compel production of documents:  The motions are moot as the responses have
been served.  If there is need for further

to compel further responses.  If reviewed
in a subsequent motion, the court requires strict compliance with CODE
COMPLIANT language.  The court notes also
that objections were improperly served.
