The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the parties: a motion to compel form interrogatories and a motion to compel production of documents. The Judge finds that both motions are moot as the responses to the discovery requests have been served. The Judge also notes that the objections to the discovery requests were improperly served. Furthermore, the Judge grants monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,200 to the plaintiff, Tamara Levine, and her prior counsel, Lowell Steiger, jointly and severally, payable by November 6, 2023, to the Client Trust Account of Schumann Arevalo LLP, for discovery abuse without justification. The Judge also emphasizes the importance of strict compliance with CODE COMPLIANT language in future motions.
