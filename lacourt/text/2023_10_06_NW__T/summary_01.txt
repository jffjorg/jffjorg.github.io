```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment and motion for summary adjudication as to the first cause of action (COA), which is breach of fiduciary duty. The defendants had argued that there was no triable issue of fact as to the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants, but the judge found that the defendants' own evidence presented a triable issue of fact as to whether they breached their duty of care.

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the second COA, which is negligence, because the defendants have met their burden to show that there is no triable issue of fact as to a fiduciary duty being owed and the plaintiff has failed to meet their burden to show that a triable issue of fact exists.

The judge has also overruled the objections to the defendant's declaration.
