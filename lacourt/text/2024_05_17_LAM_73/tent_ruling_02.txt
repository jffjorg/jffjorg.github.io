MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER ANSWERS TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES (SET ONE) (filed on 01/22/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The request to compel further responses is
granted, in part, and denied, in part, as set forth below.  Further
responses are due within 30 days.  Sanctions are denied. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 20, 2021, Plaintiffs Yedam, Inc. (“Yedam") and Eun
Kyung Choi (“Choi") brought this breach of loyalty and unfair business
practices action against Daniel N. Lee (“Lee") and Jin Sook Lee (together,
“the Lees"), and DM Cosmetics, Inc. (“DM Cosmetics"). 
 
On March 15, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) asserting 5 causes of action for: (1) Breach of Duty of Loyalty; (2) Intentional
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; (3) Negligent Interference
with Prospective Economic Advantage; (4) Unfair Business Practices; and (5) Declaratory
Relief.
 
The FAC alleges the following. Yedam imports and purchases
products including candles and scented oils that are sold at various retail
locations such as department stores in South Korea. (FAC, ¶ 9.) On or about February 2017 Defendant Daniel Lee
began working for Yedam in South Korea. (FAC, ¶
10.) In his capacity as an employee, Defendant Daniel Lee was significantly
involved in dealing with: a) manufacturers that produced candles, scented oils
or related products; b) the manufacturers’ decision makers and the purchase
terms such as price; c) the buyers at the department stores in Korea that
purchased such products from Yedam; d) the buyers’ decision makers and the
purchase terms such as price; and e) the retail locations in both the United
States of America and South Korea where such items were sold at. (FAC, ¶ 22.) Notwithstanding his duty of loyalty,
Defendant Daniel Lee, in conjunction with his wife Defendant Angela Lee, have
misused Yedam’s proprietary information in order to enrich themselves
financially. (FAC, ¶ 24). Defendants’ actions
have caused Buyers for Department Stores in South Korea to cease purchasing
products from Plaintiff Yedam and/or have caused the closure of retail
locations in South Korea. (FAC, ¶ 26).
 
The Lees and DM Cosmetics, Inc. (“Cross-Complainants" or
“Defendants”) cross-complained against Yedam, Choi, Olive House LLC, and Lamis
Tania, LLC (“Cross-Defendants"). On August 10, 2023, Cross-Complainants
filed their third amended cross-complaint (“TACC”) asserting 8 causes of action
against Cross-Defendants: (1) Breach of Oral Contract I; (2) Breach of Oral
Contract II; (3) Breach of Oral Contract III; (4) Breach of Oral Contract IV;
(5) Misappropriation of Trade Secrets; (6) Trademark Infringement; (7) Unfair
Competition in Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §17200 et seq. and
California Trademark Law; and (8) Declaratory Relief.
 
The TACC alleges the following. Prior to 2017,
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Choi owned Yedam. (TACC, ¶
11.) Yedam was experiencing serious financial problems. (Ibid.) In
February of 2017, Choi approached Defendant/Cross-Complainant Lee asking for
help. (Id., ¶ 12.) Choi proposed Lee
serve as Yedam’s general manager, whereby Lee would oversee the Korean market
and Choi would oversee the Chinese market. (Ibid.) In exchange, Lee
would be paid a $10,000 per month salary. (Ibid.) In addition, Choi
would give Lee 49% ownership of Yedam if Lee could help Yedam “overcome [its]
financial hardship and become profitable." (Ibid.) Lee agreed and
moved from the US to Korea to serve as Yedam’s general manager. (Id., ¶ 13.) To help Yedam solve its financial issues, Lee
loaned Yedam $70,000.00 in operating capital. (Id., ¶ 14.) Choi promised that the $70,000.00 would be
paid back when Yedam become profitable, along with 7% interest per annum from
April 1, 2017. (Id., ¶ 12.) Lee
successfully managed Yedam thereafter, and Yedam went from net losses in 2016
and 2017 to net profits of over a million dollars per year by the end of 2019.
(Id., ¶ 15.) However, in July of 2019,
Yedam faced supply chain issues when the “Milk House Candle" company in
the United States refused to renew its exclusive distribution contract with
Yedam. (Id., ¶ 16.) In response, the
Lees created a new brand of merchandise named “Dani Mackenzie" under DM
Cosmetics, Inc. (Id., ¶ 17.) The Lees
trademarked Dani Mackenzie in the United States in May of 2020. (Id., ¶ 18.) Around that same time, Choi proposed that
Yedam purchase Dani Mackenzie merchandise from DM Cosmetics in exchange for
Yedam having the right to use the Dani Mackenzie name. (Id., ¶ 19.) Choi told the Lees that there was no need to
have a written licensing and distribution agreement because Choi would transfer
49% of Yedam’s ownership interest to Lee by the end of December 2020. (Id.,
¶ 20.)
 
Dani Mackenzie became highly popular in Korea, and Yedam’s sales
and profit soared to the point that Yedam was valued at over $50 million. (Id.,
¶ 22.) On December 20, 2020, Lee demanded that
Choi transfer 49% of Yedam to him. (Id., ¶
23.) Lee also demanded that Choi and Yedam repay the $70,000 operating capital
loan with 7% interest from April 1, 2017. (Ibid.) However, Choi
terminated Lee from Yedam shortly thereafter and refused to convey the 49%
ownership share. (Id., ¶ 25.) Further,
Choi and Yedam stopped purchasing Dani Mackenzie merchandise from DM Cosmetics
and started using other suppliers to manufacture products bearing the Dani
Mackenzie trade name. (Id., ¶ 28.) On
March 18, 2021 and April 14, 2021, Cross-Complainants demanded that
Cross-Defendants cease and desist manufacturing, supplying and/or selling
products under the Dani Mackenzie name. (Id., ¶
32.) 
 
On January 22, 2024, Cross-Complainants/Defendants filed the
instant Motion to Compel Further Answers to Form Interrogatories (Set One),
arguing: 
·      
Defendants
move to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, No. 2.3,
2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.11, 2.12, 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 9.1, 9.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4,
12.5, 12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 17.1, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6. 
·      
Plaintiff Choi provided inadequate, evasive and frivolous
responses and objections 
·      
Defendants requests
that the Court award monetary sanctions against Choi and her attorney of record
in the sum of $2,700.00.
Plaintiffs filed an opposition, arguing:
·      
Plaintiffs have properly responded to
the “incident” form interrogatories
o   Defendants did not provide a particular definition to the term “incident”
o   Form
Interrogatories Nos. 9.1 series (entitled Other Damages) and the 12.1 series
(entitled Investigation - General) incorporate the term “incident” and are
objectionable
o   Nevertheless, Plaintiff provided substantive
responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 2.6, 2.11, 2.12, 4.1,4.2, 6.1, 12.2 -
12.6, 13.1 and 13.2
·      
Defendants did not designate a trade secret
o   Given Defendants’
usage of Form Interrogatories and the definition therein of "incident"
it is impossible to separate discovery related on the one part to the trade
secret claim and accompanying claims from other claims. Defendants must first
make a compliant trade secret designation and then propound discovery that does
not overlap between trade secret claims and other matters
·      
Regarding Interrogatory 17.1, Defendants did not attach the
Request for Admissions or responses, thus they failed to carry their
evidentiary burden
·      
Sanctions should be awarded to
Plaintiffs in the amount of $6,682.50
 
Defendants filed a reply arguing:
·      
The TACC amply describes the circumstances and events giving rise to the
present action, which Section 4 of the Interrogatories incorporated into the
definition of “incident.”
·      
Plaintiffs’ argument that Defendants’ didn’t identify a trade
secret is disingenuous as the claims in this action go beyond simply trade
secrets
·      
Regarding Interrogatory 17.1, Plaintiffs argument that Defendants
should have attached the Requests for Admissions with the instant motion is
frivolous as Defendants served the Requests for Admissions on Choi with the
Form Interrogatories
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
“Any party
may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to the action
written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”¿ CCP § 2030.010(a).¿
“Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response.”¿ CCP § 2030.260(a).¿ 
¿ 
“The party to
whom interrogatories have been propounded shall respond in writing under oath
separately to each interrogatory by any of the following: (1) An answer
containing the information sought to be discovered. (2) An exercise of the party's
option to produce writings. (3) An objection to the particular interrogatory.”¿
CCP § 2030.210(a).¿ “If the responding party does not have personal knowledge
sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but
shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by
inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where the information
is equally available to the propounding party.”¿ CCP § 2030.220(c).¿ 
¿ 
“On receipt
of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(a).¿ “A motion under subdivision (a) [of CCP §
2030.300] shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(b).¿ In addition, a separate statement is required.¿
California Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1345(a)(2).¿ 
¿ 
“Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response
to the interrogatories.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(c).¿“[T]he time limitations set forth
in section 2030 and section 2034, subdivision (a) [are] mandatory and [when]
not met, the trial court's order is in excess of its jurisdiction.”¿(Vidal
Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)
 
a.     Interrogatory
Nos. 2.5
 
Defendants
argue that further responses to Form Interrogatories No. 2.5 Set One, must be
compelled. Request No. 2.5 requests the following:  
 
“State: 
(a) your present residence ADDRESS; 
(b) your
residence ADDRESSES for the past five years; and 
(c) the dates
you lived at each ADDRESS”
 
Here, Choi objects
to the information requested and states that it violates the right to privacy. To the extent Choi
asserts a privacy privilege, she must submit a privilege log for the
determination of the applicability of such privilege. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.240(c)(1) [“If an objection is based on a claim of privilege or a claim
that the information sought is protected work product, the response shall
provide sufficient factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits
of that claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log.”].) Choi has not
submitted a privilege log and the Court finds this background information may
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to compel further
responses to Form Interrogatory No. 2.5 is GRANTED.
 
b.     Interrogatory
Nos. 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.11, 2.12, 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 9.1, 9.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3,
12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 
 
Form
Interrogatory Nos. 2.3, 2.4,
2.6, 2.11, 2.12, 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 9.1, 9.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6,
13.1 and 13.2 seek information regarding the “Incident,” which is defined as
“The circumstances and events surrounding the alleged accident, injury, or
other occurrence or breach of contract giving rise to this action or proceeding.”
(Park Decl., Exh. 1, p. 1.) 
 
Choi objects
on the grounds that the interrogatories are vague and ambiguous as to the term
“Incident.” 
 
The Court
agrees that the interrogatories are vague and ambiguous, as it is unclear what
the “Incident” or occurrence
giving rise to this action refers to. The TACC references multiple oral
contracts and there appears to be multiple occurrences that gave rise to this
action. Without more context as to the information Plaintiff seeks, the Court
is unable to fashion a definition for “Incident.” As such,
the Court orders the parties to meet and confer regarding the definition for “Incident.” 
 
Thus, Defendants’ motion to compel further
responses to Form
Interrogatory Nos. 2.3, 2.4,
2.6, 2.11, 2.12, 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 9.1, 9.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6,
13.1 and 13.2 is GRANTED, subject to the parties’ revised definition for “Incident.”
 
c.      Interrogatory
Nos. 17.1
 
Defendants argue
that further responses to Form Interrogatories No. 17.1, Set One, must be compelled.
Request No. 17.1 requests the following:  
 
“Is your
response to each request for admission served with these interrogatories an
unqualified admission? If not, for each response that it is not an unqualified
admission:  
a.              
State the
number of the request;  
b.              
State all
facts upon which you base your response;  
c.               
State the
names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of
those facts; and  
d.              
Identify all
DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support your response and state the
name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT or
thing.”
 
Defendants assert that Choi failed to admit or deny as to Request
for Admission Nos. 10, 11, 14, 16 and 17, and only responded with objections as
to those requests. In addition, Defendants argue Choi admitted to Request for
Admission Nos. 1 and 2, but they were not unqualified admissions because Choi
qualified them with objections. Thus, Defendants argue that Request for
Admission Nos. 1, 2, 10, 11, 14, 16 and 17 should have been included in Choi’s
response to this interrogatory. 
 
Here, Defendants did not provide their Request for Admissions or
Choi’s responses to the Request for Admissions at issue. Therefore, the Court
is unable to make a determination as to whether Choi should have included these
Requests for Admissions in her response to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1. Defendants
have not shown that Choi’s response to Interrogatory No. 17.1 is not code
compliant. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatory No. 17.1 is DENIED.
 
d.     Interrogatory
Nos. 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6
 
Form
Interrogatory Nos. 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6 reference “agreements alleged
in the pleadings.” (Park Decl., Exh. 1, p. 8.) 
 
Choi
responded to Form Interrogatory Nos. 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, by stating “there
are no agreements as alleged by Propounding Party.” (Park
Decl., Exh. 2, p. 10.) However, the Propounding
Party has alleged the parties entered into agreements in the TACC. The TACC asserts
causes of action for the breach of four oral contracts and alleges the parties
entered into these oral agreements. Choi responded to Form Interrogatory Nos.
50.5 and 50.6 by referencing “the first four causes of action” in the TACC.
However, the interrogatories inquire as to the agreements and not the causes of
action. The information sought related to the alleged oral agreements is
relevant to Defendants’ claims. Therefore, the Court finds that a further
response is required. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to compel further
responses to form interrogatory nos. 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6 is GRANTED.
 
B.    
Sanctions
 
The court may impose sanctions against any party for engaging in conduct
constituting a “misuse of the discovery process.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030
(a).)¿Misuse of the discovery process includes “failing to respond or submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010 (d).) 
 
Defendants
request that the Court award monetary sanctions against Choi and her attorney
of record in the sum of $2,700.00. In
opposition, Choi requests sanctions of $6,682.50 on grounds that Defendants
brought this motion without substantial justification.¿ 
 
Here, Defendants’ motion is granted and denied in part. The
Court does not exercise its discretion to impose sanctions.
 
III. DISPOSITION

 
The request to compel further
responses is granted and denied in part.
 
The parties shall meet and confer and define the term “Incident”
within 10 days of the Court’s order.  
 
Plaintiff Choi shall serve supplemental responses within 30 days
of the Court’s order.
 
Sanctions are denied.
