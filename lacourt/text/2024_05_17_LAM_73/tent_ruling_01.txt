MOTION TO COMPEL INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINATION (filed 3/05/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING 
 
Defendant Pentz’s Motion to Compel Independent Medical Examination is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On June 25,
2021, Plaintiff Marchel Gabrielle Auguste (“Plaintiff” or “Auguste”) filed a
Complaint (the “Auguste Lawsuit”) against Defendant Thomas Wesley Pentz
(“Defendant” or “Pentz”), alleging causes of action for (1) Sexual Battery; (2)
Gender Violence; (3) Violation of the Ralph Civil Rights Act; (4) Violation of
the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act; (5) Action Based on Civil Code § 1708.85; (6)
Intentional Intrusion Into Private Affairs; (7) Battery; (8) Assault; (9)
Defamation; (10) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (11)
Fraud.  
  
Auguste has
sued alleging, among other things, the following: (i) Pentz communicated with
her when she was a minor; (ii) groomed her; (iii) gave her an STD; (iv)
ejaculated inside her; (v) raped her (all contradicted by her own
communications); (vi) defamed her and (vii) committed revenge porn against her
(“Auguste Lawsuit”). Auguste alleges that all the aforementioned acts caused
her severe emotional distress.
 
On September
14, 2021, the Court ruled this case and Thomas Wesley Pentz v. Marchel
Gabrielle Auguste, Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 21STCV16321, were
related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). 
 
On March 5,
2024, Defendant Pentz filed a Motion to Compel Independent Medical Examination
of Plaintiff, arguing: 
·      
Auguste has placed her mental condition in controversy in this
case through her allegations and testimony of serious ongoing emotional
distress, including anxiety and depression. As such, there is good cause for
the Court to order an Independent Mental Examination of Auguste pursuant to
§§2032.020(a) and 2032.310(a)
·      
Auguste’s social media postings within the last six-months show
that her mental state should be questioned. For example, Auguste has stated in
videos posted on her social media that she is experiencing anxiety, stress, sleeplessness,
etc. 
·      
Auguste’s supplemental complaint and her verified interrogatory
responses detail Auguste’s claimed mental and emotional damages, thus putting
her mental condition in controversy 
·       Defendant
Pentz attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel but those efforts
were unsuccessful 
 
Plaintiff
did not file an opposition.
 
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.              
Legal Standard 
 
The
Civil Discovery Act authorizes discovery in the form of a physical or mental
examination of a party whose physical or mental condition is in controversy in
the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).) If the action is one for
personal injuries, the defendant may demand exactly one physical examination of
a plaintiff without leave of court. (Id., § 2032.220, subd. (b).) The
examination may not include “any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful,
protracted, or intrusive” and must be conducted “within 75 miles of the
residence of the examinee. (Id., § 2032.220, subd. (a).) 
 
A
demand for an examination that exceeds the dictates of Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2032.210 to 2032.260 requires the Court’s approval. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2032.310, subd. (a).) Thus, a second physical examination, or any mental
examination require the Court’s approval. (Ibid.) A motion for an
examination “shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and
nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any,
of the person or persons who will perform the examination” and include a meet
and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (b).) The court may
only grant such leave for good cause, so as to protect the examinee from
“excessive and unwarranted intrusions.” (Id., § 2032.320, subd. (a); Sporich
v. Superior Court (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 422, 428.) 
 
“Good
cause is established by facts that ‘appear in the record as a demonstrable
reality.’ [Citation.] Mere speculation, standing alone, will not suffice.” (Sporich
v. Super. Ct., supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at 428, quoting People v. Gates
(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1168, 1199.) For example, without further showing, an
attorney’s opinion that an examination is necessary does not provide good
cause. (Ibid.) 
 
But
otherwise, the statute is “silent on both the nature of good cause and the
manner in which it is to be shown.” (Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court In
and For Merced County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 388.) Generally, statutes
relating to discovery procedures, including examinations, “should be liberally
construed in favor of disclosure.” (Harabedian v. Superior Court In and For
Los Angeles County (1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 26, 31.) Yet simultaneously,
“cumulative discovery is prohibited,” as is discovery requested without knowing
precisely what one seeks, in an attempt to “obtain all possible information for
the purposes of his case,” i.e., fishing. (Sporich v. Super. Ct., supra,
77 Cal.App.4th at 428; Greyhound Corp. v. Super. Ct. In and For Merced Cty.,
supra, 56 Cal.2d at 384.) 
 
B.              
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff to undergo an
independent medical examination performed by psychiatrist Dr. Barbara Justice.
(Thomas Mot. Compel Independent Med. Exam. at Decl. McCabe ¶ 3.) 
 
Defendant asserts Auguste has
placed her mental condition in controversy in this case. In Auguste’s
Supplemental Complaint she alleges “extreme emotional distress.” (Suppl. Compl. ¶ 31, 39,
126.) Plaintiff states that “as a result of Defendants’ actions,
Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer general and special damages,
including severe and profound pain and emotional distress, anxiety, depression,
headaches, tension, and other physical ailments, as well as medical expenses,
expenses for psychological counseling and treatment.” (Id. ¶ 38.) Auguste’s verified interrogatory
responses also detail her emotional distress damages and contend that she will
require ongoing treatment. (Yeghiayan Decl, ¶4-9, Ex. A, p. 19.) Based on
Auguste’s allegations of serious emotional distress as stated in her
Supplemental Complaint and discovery answers, the Court finds Defendant has
good cause to take a psychiatric examination of Auguste. 
 
Auguste
does not oppose the motion.  ¿“A party who has not timely filed written
opposition to a motion…may not be afforded an opportunity to offer oral
argument at the hearing.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)¿ “The failure to file opposition creates an inference
that the motion or demurrer is meritorious.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ “In such cases,
the court may hear argument limited to a request for a continuance of the
hearing in order to afford an opportunity for written opposition.”¿ (Ibid.)
“[T]he rule is patently intended to prevent the introduction of legal theories
without prior notice to opposing counsel and the court.”¿ (Ibid.)
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant Pentz’s Motion to Compel Independent
Medical Examination.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Defendant Pentz’s Motion to Compel Independent Medical Examination is GRANTED.
