```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to strike the request for punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint is granted. The court finds that the First Amended Complaint does not state sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages against the defendant. Specifically, the complaint fails to allege that the managing agent, Antonio "Tony" Arista, exercised substantial independent authority and judgment in determining the corporate policy of the defendant and had discretionary authority to terminate or recommend the termination of the plaintiff. The court grants leave to amend the complaint and sets an order to show cause for January 2, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. to give the plaintiff an opportunity to cure the defects in the complaint.
