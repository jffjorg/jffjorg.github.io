ALLEGATIONS: 
 
On October 12, 2022,
Arnon Raphael, individually and as trustee of the Arnon and Terry Raphael Trust
(Plaintiff) filed suit against Scott Amin Sheikh and The Sheikh Law Firm APC
(collectively Defendants) alleging Defendants failed to adequately represent
him in prior legal matters. Shiekh is serving as counsel for himself and The
Shiek Law Firm in this case. 
 
Before the Court are
three motions to compel further responses brought by Plaintiff. Plaintiff seeks
further responses to his Form Interrogatories No. 17.1, Special Interrogatories
Nos. 1-3, 5-6, Request for Production of Documents (RFPD) Nos. 1–9, 10–12,
13–15, 18–23, 25–33, and Requests for Admissions (RFA) Nos. 3–4, 6–7, 9, 15–18,
21–24, 29– 41, 43–44. Plaintiff does not seek sanctions regarding these
motions. 
 
Defendants have
rendered no opposition to these motions, instead submitting a declaration that
they have/intend to serve supplemental responses to the various discovery
requests. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Interrogatories 
 
On
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that the
responses contain: (1) answers that are evasive or incomplete, (2)¿an
unwarranted or insufficiently specific exercise of an option to produce
documents in lieu of a substantive response, or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (C.C.P.
§¿2030.300(a).) The responding party has the burden of justifying the
objections thereto. (Coy v. Sup.Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.)
  
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to RFPD
 
A motion
to compel further responses to RFPD may be brought based on: (1) incomplete
statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or incomplete claims of
inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(C.C.P. § 2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion
to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See C.C.P. §
2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing that there
“a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the discovery sought
will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence
that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.”  
 
If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) 
 
Motion to
Compel Further Responses on RFA
 
On
receipt of a response to requests for admission, the party requesting
admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party
deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) an answer to a particular
request is evasive or incomplete or (2) an objection to a particular request is
without merit or too general. (C.C.P. § 2033.290(a).)
 
Failure
to File Opposition
 
A failure
to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.  Failure to file an opposition to the motion
indicates the other parties' acquiescence that the motion is meritorious. CRC
Rule 8.54(c).
 
II.           
MERITS 
 
Discovery
Timeline 
 
On June 6, 2023,
Plaintiff propounded all discovery via email service on Defendants. (Almon
Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendants issued their responses to discovery on August 15,
2023. (Almon Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs found the responses, consisting mostly
of boilerplate objections, to be inadequate and attempted to meet and confer
with Defendants in October 2023. (Almon Decl. ¶ 4.) After several follow
ups and extensions, Defendants agreed to provide supplemental responses in an
email sent January 9, 2024. (Almon Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. 12.) On January 23,
2024, Defendants provided supplemental responses to some of the requests. (Almon
Decl. ¶ 15.) Plaintiffs found these supplemental responses to be
insufficient and attempted to further meet and confer. (Almon Decl. ¶ 19.,
Exh. 21.) Defendants stated they would render further supplemental responses by
March 15, 2024; however, Plaintiff never received them. (Almon Decl. ¶ 23.)
 
Form Interrogatories

 
Plaintiff seeks
further responses to his Form Interrogatories No. 17.1. Defendants initially responded
by objecting that the request was overbroad and improperly required Defendants
to prove their case in chief. Neither of these objections are accompanied by an
explanation. It does not appear that any supplemental response was ever
rendered for this Form Interrogatory. (Almon Decl. ¶ 17.)
 
Plaintiff
asserts that these objections are without merit. By virtue of failing to oppose
the motion, Defendants have provided no argument to the contrary. While
Defendants declaration states they have now served supplemental responses to
the Form Interrogatory 17.1, they do not attach them to the declaration.
(Sheikh Decl. ¶ 5.) As such, Defendants have failed to carry their burden
of justifying the objections. 
 
Accordingly, the
motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories is GRANTED. 
 
Special
Interrogatories 
 
Plaintiff seeks
further responses to his Special Interrogatories Nos. 1-3, 5-6. As with
Defendants’ responses to Form Interrogatories, these responses consist primarily
of objections. Plaintiff objects to each request on various grounds (“vague and
ambiguous”, compound, improper for soliciting implied admission, overbroad and
unduly burdensome). (Almon Decl. Exh. 2.) On January 23, 2024, Defendants
served supplemental responses to RFPD Nos. 1-2, 5, and 6. (Almon Decl. ¶15,
Exh. 14.)  Plaintiff argues these responses
are insufficient for a number of reasons and continue to assert meritless
objections. None of Defendants’ objections are accompanied by an explanation
and Defendants have rendered no opposition. As such, Defendants have failed to
carry their burden of justifying the objections.
 
Accordingly, the
motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED. 
 
RFPD 
 
Plaintiff seeks
further responses to his RFPD Nos. 1–9,
10–12, 13–15, 18–23, 25–33. The Court
finds good cause to compel further production. Each of the documents requested
is directly related to this litigation. Defendant objected to each of these
RFPD on various grounds (“vague and ambiguous”, compound, improper for
soliciting implied admission, overbroad and unduly burdensome). None of these
objections are accompanied by an explanation and Defendants have rendered no
opposition. Defendants state that that they have yet to render supplemental
responses to RFPD at this time. (Shekh Decl. ¶ 6.) As such, Defendants have
failed to carry their burden of justifying the objections.
 
Accordingly, the
motion to compel further responses to RFPD is GRANTED. 
 
RFA
 
Plaintiff seeks
further responses to his RFA Nos. 3–4,
6–7, 9, 15–18, 21–24, 29– 41, 43–44.
Defendants initially rendered objection only responses to these RFA, objecting
on grounds that the requests were “vague and ambiguous”, compound, or
improperly caused for legal conclusion. (Almon Decl. Exh. 16.) 
 
Plaintiff argues
that these objections are without merit. Plaintiff further argues that
Defendants’ supplemental responses to these RFA remain insufficient in that
they continue to assert these meritless objections. By virtue of failing to
oppose the motion, Defendants have provided no argument to the contrary. While
Defendants’ declaration states they have served supplemental responses to the
RFA, they do not attach them to the declaration. (Sheikh Decl. ¶ 5.) As
such, Defendants have failed to carry their burden of justifying the
objections.
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel further responses to
RFA is GRANTED. 
 
The Court notes that Defendants have filed a
declaration that the responses will be forthcoming.  The Court appreciates the filing of the
declaration and is confident that going forward the parties will timely comply
with all lawful discovery requests without further motion practice.
