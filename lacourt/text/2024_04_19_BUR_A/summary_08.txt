Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of granting Caltrans' motion for leave to conduct a site inspection of the Subject Property. Caltrans claims it has a contractual right to inspect the property and that further inspection is necessary to discover any breach of the lease agreement or fire code violations. The Court finds that Caltrans has demonstrated good cause for further inspection and grants the motion subject to a limitation on the scope of the inspection. The limitation is that no documents on the premises will be inspected or copied, or otherwise moved, except to the extent necessary to complete the fire and safety inspection.
