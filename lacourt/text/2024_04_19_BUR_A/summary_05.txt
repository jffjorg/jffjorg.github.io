The court finds that the service of the deposition subpoena on Glendale Diagnostic Imaging Network, Inc. is lacking. The court denies the motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena without prejudice. The court expresses concerns about the service of the subpoena, stating that it is unclear whether the subpoena was served on the Custodian of Records for Glendale Imaging or someone else who is authorized to accept service. The court also finds that the declaration of the counsel, El Mahdi Young, does not provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the subpoena was served on the Custodian of Records for Glendale Imaging.
