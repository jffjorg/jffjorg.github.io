And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for leave to conduct site inspection filed by Caltrans, the plaintiff, in an unlawful detainer matter. Caltrans seeks to inspect the property to identify fire code and lease violations. Apex Development, Inc. and Anthony Nowaid, the defendants, argue that Caltrans has no right to inspect the property. The Court finds that Caltrans has a contractual right to inspect the property and that further inspection is required to discover any breach of the lease agreement or fire code violations. The Court grants the motion subject to a limitation on the scope of the inspection, which ensures that no documents on the property will be inspected or copied, except to the extent necessary to complete the fire and safety inspection.
