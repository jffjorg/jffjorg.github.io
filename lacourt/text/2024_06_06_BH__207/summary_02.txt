The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion originally set for hearing on March 28, 2024. The Plaintiff, Canning, filed opposition papers on March 14, 2024, but these were disregarded in favor of new opposition papers filed on May 23, 2024. The Judge finds that Canning has not suffered any damages as a result of the Defendant, White's, alleged conduct, and therefore need not address Issue 2.
