And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the plaintiff, Glenn Vallecillos M.D., Inc., is untimely and has failed to meet the statutory requirements for an automatic 30-day extension. The defendant, Michael Keyes DBA Global Ocean and Land Construction, had filed a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, alleging various causes of action. The plaintiff had demurred to the cross-complaint, alleging that the causes of action failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. However, the plaintiff failed to properly meet and confer with the defendant, as required by statute, which is a requirement for filing a demurrer. The court has exercised its discretion and does not consider the late-filed demurrer. The plaintiff is ordered to file an answer to the cross-complaint by June 27, 2024.
