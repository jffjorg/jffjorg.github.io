[1] The Motion was originally set for hearing on March
28, 2024.  On March 14, 2024, Canning
originally filed opposition papers.  On
March 15, 2024, at an ex parte hearing to continue the hearing date on the
Motion, the Court continued the hearing date to June 6, 2024 and ordered all
opposition and reply papers due commensurate with the June 6 hearing date.  On May 23, 2024, Canning submitted different
opposition papers to the motion. 
Therefore, the Court disregards the opposition papers filed on March 14,
and considers only the opposition papers filed on May 23.


[2] Because the Court finds Canning has not suffered any
damages as a result of White’s alleged conduct, it need not address Issue 2.
