And here is a summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Canning v. Vaughan, in which Canning has sued Vaughan and White for professional negligence. White has moved for summary judgment, arguing that Canning has admitted that he suffered no damages as a result of White's actions or omissions. Canning has opposed the motion, arguing that he did suffer damages and that White was negligent. The court has reviewed the evidence and has determined that Canning's deposition testimony contradicts his later statements, and that Canning's explanation for his deposition testimony is not convincing. Therefore, the court has granted White's motion for summary judgment and has ordered White to file a proposed judgment.
