And here is the summary in English:

The tentative ruling by Judge Michael E. Whitaker denies the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Mark W. Huston, without prejudice, due to procedural grounds. The motion was filed instead of a consent, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and lack of communication. The court finds that the motion is substantively proper. However, the motion fails to comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, as it does not indicate that the client's last known address was confirmed current within the last 30 days or that the counsel was unable to confirm the client's current address. The court orders counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
