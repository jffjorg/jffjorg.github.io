And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Gem Healthcare, LLC's petition to compel arbitration in the case of Plaintiff Damon Brown against Defendant Gem Healthcare, LLC. The lawsuit was filed on September 29, 2024, and the petition to compel arbitration was filed on January 3, 2024. The judge found that the arbitration agreement was signed by Bettye Brown, Plaintiff's conservator, but held that she did not have the authority to bind Plaintiff Damon Brown to the agreement. The judge cited the California Supreme Court's decision in Harrod v. Country Oaks Partners, LLC, which held that signing an arbitration agreement does not constitute a healthcare decision and therefore, Bettye Brown's signature did not bind Plaintiff Damon Brown to the agreement. The judge denied the petition to compel arbitration and ordered that Plaintiff be given notice of the decision.
