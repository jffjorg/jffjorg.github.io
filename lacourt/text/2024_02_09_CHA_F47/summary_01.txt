Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by Stewart Title Guaranty Company is sustained, which means that the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Roshmore Development Inc. and Cochran, Inc. is defective and cannot be amended. The judge also placed the motion to strike off calendar as moot due to the ruling on the demurrer.

The judge's decision is based on several grounds. Firstly, the First Amended Cross-Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a breach of contract claim, as it does not specify the terms of the contract or the alleged breach. Secondly, the claims against Stewart Title Guaranty Company are uncertain and fail to state a claim, as they are based on general allegations rather than specific facts. Thirdly, the claims against Fidelity National Title Group are also uncertain and fail to state a claim, as they are based on the same allegations as the claims against Stewart Title Guaranty Company. Finally, the judge ruled that the negligence cause of action is duplicative of the breach of contract cause of action and fails to state a claim.

The judge's decision is significant because it may have implications for the future of title insurance in California. The ruling suggests that title insurance companies may not be liable for damages resulting from the failure to defend or indemnify policyholders, as long as the policy does not provide coverage for the specific claims or damages at issue.
