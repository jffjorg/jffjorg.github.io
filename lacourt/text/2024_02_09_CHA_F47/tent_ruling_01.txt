SUMMARY
OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a dispute regarding real
property commonly known as 28212 Kelly Johnson Parkway #215 and #225 which are
medical office suites (the Property).  
 
On or 5/3/18, Cochran, Inc. (Cochran) purchased the Property
from Modern Diagnostics Medical Services, Inc. (MDMS), a company controlled by
Mark Liker (Liker).  (First Amended
Cross-Complaint (FAXC) ¶¶ 1, 5, 13).  The
grant deed from MDMS to Cochran was recorded on 5/9/18.  (FAXC ¶¶1, 13).  The purchase price was $1,150,000.  (FAXC ¶34).  The May 2018 sale to Cochran was insured by Stewart
Title Guarantee Company (Stewart).  (FAXC
¶43).
 
On 6/7/18, Liker’s partner in MDMS, Thomas Smith (Smith),
filed an action against Liker and Cochran (LASC Case No. BC679714) (Smith
Action).  (FAXC ¶14).  In the Smith Action, Smith alleged that Liker
had sold the Property to Cochran without authorization and without receiving
equivalent value.  Id.  Liker and Smith settled the Smith Action, and
Smith dismissed all parties with prejudice.  (FAXC ¶16). 
Cochran and Roshmore allege that Stewart defended Cochran in the Smith
Action (because that was a lawsuit that “challenged the title in the name of
Cochran”). (FAXC ¶43).
 
On 5/15/19, Cochran sold and transferred the Property to
Roshmore via grant deed recorded on 5/22/19. 
(FAXC ¶¶17, 37).  Cochran and
Roshmore  allege that the May 2019 sale
to Roshmore was insured by Fidelity National Title Group (Fidelity).  (FAXC ¶44).
 
On 10/15/20, Liker (Liker) filed the underlying complaint
in this action for Breach of Contract against Cochran and Roshmore.  Liker’s complaint only seeks monetary relief
and alleges no real property claims. 
(RJN, Ex.A).  On 1/26/21, Liker
recorded a Notice of Pendency of Action (Lis Pendens) against the Property,
which was then owned by Roshmore.  (FAXC
¶¶30, 42; RJN, Ex.B).  
 
Cochran and Roshmore allege that the title companies
insuring title for Cochran (Stewart) and Roshmore (Fidelity) initially refused
to defend them against Liker’s complaint on the ground that “it did not
challenge the title but was merely seeking monetary damage.”  (FAXC ¶30). 
Cochran and Roshmore allege that even after Liker recorded the Lis
Pendens, neither Stewart nor Fidelity would step in to defend “the title to the
hand of Roshmore the then owner of record of the subject property.”  (FAXC ¶30). 
Cochran and Roshmore also allege that Stewart refused to provide a
defense to Liker’s complaint on the ground that once the Property transferred
to Roshmore, Stewart’s obligation had terminated pursuant to the terms of the
policy.  (FAXC ¶46).  
 
Cochran and Roshmore allege that, although Fidelity
initially refused to take action, Fidelity eventually filed a motion to expunge
the Lis Pendens on 8/20/21, which was later expunged by stipulation and was
withdrawn on 9/21/21.  (FAXC ¶50).  Once the Lis Pendens was expunged, Fidelity
advised that their role was complete. 
(FAXC ¶52).  Cochran and Roshmore allege
that Fidelity failed to properly defend Roshmore against the Liker Complaint
and the Lis Pendens. (FAXC ¶55).  Cochran
and  Roshmore allege that Stewart had an
obligation to defend them against the Liker Complaint and the Lis Pendens which
Stewart did not do.  (FAXC ¶54).   
 
Cochran and Roshmore’s operative First Amended
Cross-Complaint against Liker; Lucy Holdings, LLC; Fidelity
and Stewart alleges causes of action for: (1)
Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3)
Indemnity, (4) Declaratory Relief and (5) Negligence.  
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Stewart had with the First Amended Cross-Complaint, on 10/11/23, Stewart
filed and served the instant demurrer to the entire First Amended
Cross-Complaint on the grounds that it fails to allege sufficient facts to
constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. 
CCP 430.10(e), (f).  On the same
date, Stewart filed and served the instant motion to strike which seeks to
strike portions of the First Amended Cross-Complaint relating to attorneys’
fees, punitive damages and treble damages. 
No opposition or other response to the demurrer and/or motion to strike
has been filed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Stewart’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.  
 
1st cause of action – Breach of Contract
 
The First Amended Cross-Complaint does not allege that
Stewart issued any title insurance policy (the contract which underlies
Cochran’s and Roshmore’s cross-claims) to Roshmore.  (See FAXC ¶¶43-44).  A copy of 
the subject policy/contract is also not attached to the First Amended
Cross-Complaint.  Since Roshmore was not
a party to a contract (title insurance policy) with Stewart, Roshmore lacks
standing to bring the cross-claims against Stewart.  See Hatchwell (1988) 198 CA3d
1027, 1034.
 
With regard to Cochran, it has failed to allege
sufficient facts to support the elements of a breach of contract claim which
are: (1) a contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance,
(3) defendant’s breach and (4) damage to plaintiff as a result.  Walsh (1998) 66 CA4th 1532, 1545.
 
A copy of the contract/policy is not attached to the
First Amended Cross-Complaint nor are the material terms of the contract
alleged.  Additionally, Cochran has
failed to identify any policy provision that provides it with coverage or any
policy provision that was breached by Stewart. 
 
The breach of contract claim is uncertain in that Cochran
and Roshmore make general allegations against both Stewart and Fidelity when
each provided separate insurance policies to each of them.  (FAXC ¶¶58-66).  Further, the damages alleged in the First
Amended Cross-Complaint allegedly occurred after Cochran sold the Property to
Roshmore.  (FAXC ¶¶63, 66).  As noted above, Roshmore lacks standing to
bring a claim against Stewart.  
 
A title insurance policy indemnifies the insured against
actual loss attributable to matters for which coverage is afforded under the
policy.  Siegel (1996) 46 CA4th
1181, 1191.  Title insurance is not
prospective in nature and does not insure against title defects or liens that
arise after the effective date and time of the policy.  Elysian Investment Group (2002) 105
CA4th 315, 322.  A title insurance policy
insures against specified defects in title and remains in effect as long as the
insured owns the property.  Safeco
Title Insurance Company v. Moskopoulos (1981) 116 CA3d 658, 666; Wolschlager
(2003) 111 CA4th 784, 789.  Title
insurance does not insure matters involving personal dealings between
individuals.  Barczewski (1989)
210 CA3d 406, 410.
 
Liker’s complaint alleges that Liker sued Cochran and
Roshmore for conduct – i.e., Cochran’s alleged failure to pay Liker $2,000,000
pursuant to an oral contract.  (RJN,
Ex.A).  The First Amended Cross-Complaint
confirms that Liker’s complaint only seeks monetary relief and does not allege
a property claim.  (FAXC ¶41).  Since Liker is not suing Cochran and Roshmore
for a defect in title or asserting any claim that affects the title to the
Property, Liker’s claims are not covered by the title insurance policy issued
by Stewart to Cochran.  
 
Similarly, the recording of the lis pendens by Liker did
not trigger any obligation by Stewart under the policy as the lis pendens
merely republished Liker’s complaint which as noted above did not trigger any
coverage under the policy.  See Estates
of Collins & Flowers (2012) 205 CA4th 1238, 1254.  Further, the lis pendens was recorded on
1/26/21, more than two years after Cochran sold the Property.  As such, the recording is not covered under
the policy issued by Stewart to Cochran. 
See Moskopoulos, supra at 666.
 
2nd cause of action – Breach of Duty of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
The breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing cause
of action is dependent on the breach of contract claim.  If the breach of contract claim fails, so
does the breach of good faith and fair dealing claim.  Love (1990) 221 CA3d 1136, 1153; Hovannisian
(2017) 14 CA5th 420, 437.
 
Even if Cochran and Roshmore could state a claim for
breach of contract, the bad faith claim fails because the First Amended
Cross-Complaint does not allege facts which show that Stewart acted
unreasonably and with a conscious and deliberate intention to deprive Cochran
and Roshmore of policy benefits.  See
Major (2009) 169 CA4th 1197, 1209; Chateau Chamberay Homeowners
Association (2001) 90 CA4th 335, 345.
 
3rd cause of action – Indemnity
 
The indemnity cause of action is duplicative of the 1st
cause of action for breach of contract and fails for the same reasons.  (See FAXC ¶80).  
 
4th cause of action – Declaratory Relief
 
The declaratory relief cause of action alleges that a
controversy exists regarding Cochran and Roshmore’s alleged right to be
defended by cross-defendants, including Stewart, and regarding the validity of
the cross-claims.  (FAXC ¶84).  As such, the 4th cause of action
is also essentially duplicative of the 1st cause of action for
breach of contract and fails because Stewart had no obligation to defend or
indemnify Cochran and/or Roshmore.  
 
5th cause of action – Negligence 
 
The negligence cause of action is based on the alleged
manner Stewart investigated, administered and otherwise handled Cochran and
Roshmore’s title insurance claim.  (FAXC
¶¶87-90, 96).  As such, the cause of
action merely restates the breach of contract and breach of covenant of good
faith and fair dealing causes of action. 
In California, there is no separate cause of action for negligent claims
handling.  See Everett
Associates, Inc. (9th Cir. 2002) 35 Fed.Appx. 450, 452; Sanchez
(1999) 72 CA4th 249, 255; Huber (2012) 881 F.Supp.2d 1195, 1199.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained.  Since Cochran and Roshmore have not opposed
the demurrer or given any indication that they can cure the defects in their
First Amended Cross-Complaint, the demurrer is sustained without leave to
amend.
 
The motion to strike is placed off calendar as moot due
to the ruling on the demurrer.
