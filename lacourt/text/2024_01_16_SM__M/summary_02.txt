And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the demurrer filed by defendants Serenity Care Health Group and Binko Corp. to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Cheverez, is seeking to inspect the medical records of her deceased relative, Decedent, who lived at Bentley Manor, an assisted living facility operated by the defendants. The defendants argue that they are not health care providers under Health & Safety Code section 123110 and therefore do not have a duty to provide medical records to the plaintiff.

The judge has found that the defendants are not health care providers, but rather residential care facilities for the elderly (RCFEs), which are not defined as health care providers under sections 123105(a) and 1250 of the Health & Safety Code. The plaintiff has not alleged any facts that would show that the defendants rendered healthcare to Decedent or could otherwise be considered health care providers.

As a result, the judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's claim will be dismissed unless the plaintiff can file an amended complaint that alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action. The judge has also cautioned the parties that a code-compliant meet and confer effort is required for each demurrer and motion to strike on subsequent pleadings.
