And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Thanou v. Mahgerefteh, case number 22SMCV02950. The Court has considered the motion for sanctions filed by Defendant Kourosh Mahgerefteh against Plaintiff Markella Thanou for her failure to appear for a court-ordered deposition on December 1, 2023.

The Court has found that Plaintiff failed to obey the court order and did not offer any alternative dates for the deposition. While Plaintiff's counsel claimed that Plaintiff was ill and could not attend the in-person deposition, the Court notes that there is no substantial evidence to support this claim.

The Court has imposed monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,063.00 against Plaintiff's counsel, Kingsley Opia-Enwemuche of Twin Oak Attorneys, for failure to oppose the motion to compel deposition and failure to move for a protective order regarding the in-person deposition.

The Court has also ordered that Plaintiff's deposition be taken remotely, via Zoom or similar system, within 10 days. Counsel are to meet and confer on a mutually agreeable date and time to schedule the remote deposition.
