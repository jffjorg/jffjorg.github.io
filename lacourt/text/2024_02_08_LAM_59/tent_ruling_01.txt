Case Name:                Rosa
Maria Vicente Xec v. 310 South Alvarado St. LLC
Case No.:                    22STCV35913
Motion:                       Petition
to Approve Compromise of Pending Action on Behalf of Minor 
Moving Party:             Plaintiff
Rosa Maria Vicente Xec
Opposing Party:          None

Tentative Ruling:      The
petition to approve compromise of pending action on behalf of a minor is granted.


             
            This is a habitability case. Plaintiffs Rosa
Maria Vicente Xec, Desideria Xec Tecum, and Kayden Diego Vicente (a minor) sued
Defendants 310 South Alvardo St. LLC and Rampart Property Management, Inc. for
breach of warranty of habitability, negligence, breach of implied covenant of
quiet enjoyment, and breach of contract. 
            
            Plaintiffs have settled the case
with all Defendants for $85,000. Plaintiffs now seek
approval of a compromise of a claim on behalf of minor, Kayden Diego Vicente. 
 
Discussion
 
            Court approval is
required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) California Rules of Court, rule 7.950
provides that a petition “must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise.” The Petition must be filed on Judicial Council Form
MC-350 and must be fully completed. 
 
            The Petition is properly filed on the Judicial Council
forms and is verified. Plaintiff/Petitioner has also submitted the requisite
attachments with the Petition.  
            
            Of
the $85,000 in settlement funds, $5,000 will be allocated to Kayden Diego Vicente, while Rosa Maria Vicente Xec and Desideria Xec
Tecum will receive $40,000, respectively. This amount
compensates Kayden Diego
Vicente for her injuries suffered from the
uninhabitable living conditions, which are less than the adult Plaintiffs who
also suffered “in the form of rent paid during the unhabitable period
and property damage.” (Attachment 11b(6).)  
 
            As to
attorney’s fees, Plaintiff’s counsel seeks 25% from the minor’s settlement
amount. (Attachment 11b(6).) Counsel requests $1,250, which excludes costs in
the amount of $607.42. In support, she provides a declaration of tasks and services
rendered during the course of this case, which resulted in total working hours
of approximately 25 hours. (Fishenfeld Decl., ¶¶ 5-11.)
 
Counsel’s declaration also supports the factors of
reasonableness under California Rules of Court, rule 7.955(b). (See generally, Fishenfeld
Decl., ¶¶ 1-11.) Upon consideration of those facts, the Court finds that the
amount of $1,250 is reasonable. 
 
            Plaintiffs
also seek to deposit the funds with Rosa Maria Vicente Xec
“upon the terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code
sections 3401-3402, without bond.” (Attach., 18(b)5.) If a minor’s settlement
does not exceed $5,000, the court may order it paid to the custodial parent to
be held in trust until the minor reaches majority. (Prob. Code, §§ 3611, sud. (e); 3401.) 
Plaintiffs
have satisfied all of the procedural and substantive requirements.
Therefore, the petition is granted.
