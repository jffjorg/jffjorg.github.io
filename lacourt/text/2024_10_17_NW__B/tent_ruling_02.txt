BACKGROUND
 
On April 13, 2021, Plaintiff Nadia Farra (“Nadia”), an adult
by and through her guardian ad litem Sym Farra, and Sym Farra (“Sym”)(collectively
“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendants Bloomingdale’s LLC
(“Bloomingdale’s”), Macy’s, Inc. (“Macy’s) and DOES 1 to 20 (collectively
“Defendants”) alleging two causes of action: (1) general negligence; and (2)
premises liability. Plaintiffs allege they sustained serious injuries when, on
April 19, 2018, while travelling down on an escalator at a Bloomingdale’s
store, the escalator shook or hesitated, causing Plaintiffs to fall down the
escalator.
 
On August 21, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an amendment to their
complaint identifying Schindler Elevator Corp. (“Schindler”) as DOE 1.
 
On August 15, 2024, Defendants Bloomingdale’s and Schindler
filed the instant motion for terminating sanctions.
 
The motion remains unopposed.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendants’ motion is GRANTED .
 
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 permits the Court, in its
discretion, to impose the following types of terminating sanctions against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery process”:
 
(1) An order striking out the pleadings
or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process.
 
(2) An order staying further
proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is obeyed.
 
(3) An order dismissing the action, or
any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4) An order rendering a judgment by
default against that party.
(CCP § 2023.030(d).) Conduct that is a
“misuse of the discovery process” includes failing to respond or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Ibid., § 2023.010(d) and (g).)
 
“Imposition of sanctions for misuse of discovery lies within
the trial court's discretion, and is reviewed only for abuse.” (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 991.) “The trial court
should consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party
seeking discovery[.]” (Ibid., 992.) Sanctions should be tailored to the
harm created by the withheld discovery and should not be used as punishment. (Ibid.)
 
The court should also consider whether the discovery
misconduct was “willful” and whether the requesting party was prejudiced by the
other’s failure to comply. (Do It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v.
Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 37.)
 
Lastly, courts have held that terminating sanctions are
warranted when a party repeatedly fails to propound adequate discovery
responses, even after the court imposed monetary sanctions. (Liberty Mutual
Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrations, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093.)
For example, in Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, the Court of Appeal held that five motions to compel created a record
“replete with evidence of [appellant’s] failures to answer discovery requests.”
(Ibid., 279–280.)
 
Defendants argue that terminating sanctions are warranted
because Plaintiffs have failed to respond to Defendants’ discovery requests,
failed to comply with prior court orders, and failed to pay ordered sanctions.
As a result, Defendants seek to dismiss the entire action with prejudice.
 
On December 23, 2023, Defendants
propounded upon each Plaintiff a set of Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents. (Casolari Decl. ¶ 2.)
Responses were due on January 16, 2024. (Ibid.) On January 30, 2024,
Defendants asked Plaintiffs for their responses, having received none. (Ibid.
at ¶ 3.) On February 6, 2024, Plaintiffs represented over the phone that
they had sent their responses, but Defendants ultimately never received them. (Ibid.
at ¶¶ 4 and 5.) Defendants sent another inquiry on March 4, 2024, with no
response. (Ibid. at ¶ 6.) As a result, on Defendants filed six motions
to compel Plaintiffs’ discovery responses, which were granted on July 15, 2024.
(Ibid. At ¶ 7.) The Court ordered Plaintiffs to serve their responses by
August 4, 2024. (Ibid.; Exh. B [copy of the Court’s ruling].) The Court
also imposed sanctions due by August 14, 2024. (Ibid.) Plaintiffs never
complied. Defendants attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiffs before filing
this motion to no avail. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 8 and 9.)
 
The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ conduct
as outlined above is an abuse of the discovery process, subject to sanctions. “A
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) Here,
Plaintiffs have largely remained silent in this action for the past year and
have failed to comply with court orders, to comply with numerous discovery
request and to pay court ordered sanctions. The Court does not believe
additional monetary sanctions will compel Plaintiffs to act. Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion and dismisses the action with prejudice.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
