B  DATE:    OCTOBER     17, 2024 TIME:  8:30     A.M.   COMPLAINT    FILED: MAY 7, 2021 TRIAL    DATE: JANUARY 13, 2025      I.        BACKGROUND   On May 7, 2021, Plaintiff  Jason Gray (“Plaintiff”), by and through his guardian ad litem Gregory Gray,  filed a complaint against Defendants City of Rancho Pablos Verdes (“RPV”), City  of Rolling Hills Estates (“Rolling Hills”), and DOES 1 to 50 (collectively  “Defendants”) alleging one complaint of negligence. The complaint arises from a  September 20, 2020, incident, when Plaintiff allegedly suffered serious  injuries when thrown off his bike due to dangerous conditions on the sidewalk.   On June 5, 2024, the matter  was reassigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse  East, effective June 24, 2024.   On June 20, 2024, RPV filed  a motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s claim.  On October 3, 2024,  Plaintiff filed their opposition.  On October 11, 2024, RPV  filed their reply.  II.        MOTION  FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT             RPV moves for summary judgment on  Plaintiff’s complaint for negligence. RPV alleges that RPV does not own or  control the sidewalk which caused Plaintiff’s injuries, and therefore cannot be  held liable to Plaintiff as a matter of law. (Takaoka Decl ¶¶ 5 and 6.)  III.        LEGAL  STANDARDS  Burden on Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication  In reviewing a motion for  summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the  issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met  his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has  demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.  (Hinesley  v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  “[T]he  initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that  there are no triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D.B. Log  Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for  summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing  that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more  elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a  complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd.  (p)(2).)  A moving defendant may  satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be  established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the  plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid  discovery responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot  reasonably obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v.  Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic  Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [It is insufficient for the  defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura (2003)  108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) The defendant must present evidence, typically in  the form of factually devoid discovery responses, showing that plaintiff does  not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.” (Ibid.)  Unless and until a defendant  meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting  evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454,  468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything  by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts  establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his  favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be  denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer  any evidence.  On the other hand, if the  defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to  show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause  of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) The plaintiff may  not merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a  triable issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the  specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the  cause of action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary  judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center  (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)         IV.        DISCUSSION  Evidentiary Objections  Plaintiff’s October 3, 2024,  evidentiary objections are sustained as to Nos. 1 and 2; the street improvement  plans of Rolling Hills High School are not authenticated, nor does RPV lay a  sufficient foundation for introducing them.     Plaintiff’s objection to No.  3 is overruled as it falls within the business records hearsay exception under  Cal. Evid. Code § 1272(a) and (b).    Defendant’s Burden  RPV meets their initial  burden.  RPV argues that they are not  liable to Plaintiff as a matter of law because RPV does not own the subject  sidewalk.   "One  who owns, possesses, or controls [property] has a duty to act reasonably to  protect others from a dangerous condition [stemming from] that property.” (Soto  v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 168, 177.) “The  ‘crucial element’ for imposing a duty in such circumstances is control . . .  the rationale being that whoever has the means to control the property can take  steps to prevent the harm.” (Ibid.) Conversely, “[a] defendant cannot be  held liable for the defective or dangerous condition of property which it did  not own, possess, or control.” (Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital  (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 125.)                  Here,  RPV establishes facts showing they do not own the subject sidewalk. RPV asserts  that, on November 23, 2020, they received Plaintiff’s Claim for Damages  concerning the underlying incident. (RPV Separate Statement of Facts  (“RPV-SSF”) No. 2; Takaoka Decl. ¶ 4.) On December 16, 2020, Plaintiff’s Claim  was rejected after RPV determined it did not own the sidewalk in Plaintiff’s  Claim. (RPV-SSF No. 3; Takaoka Decl. ¶¶ 5 and 6; Exh. B.) RPV claims that the sidewalk  is within Rolling Hills Estates’ city limits. (RPV-SSF No. 7; Knell Decl. ¶ 6;  Exh. L.) In the past eight years, RPV has not received any maintenance orders  or complaints related to this sidewalk. (RPV-SSF No. 12; Awwad Decl. ¶¶ 8-9,  12-13.) Furthermore, no records indicate RPV’s ownership of the sidewalk.  (RPV-SSF No. 13; Takaoka Decl. ¶ 5; Ex. O.) Additionally, RPV claims it never  performed repairs on the sidewalk. (RPV-SSF No. 23; Awwad Decl. ¶ 11, Ex. O.)  Therefore, RPV set forth  sufficient evidence demonstrating they do not own, possess, or control the  property which caused Plaintiff’s injuries.  The burden now shifts to  Plaintiff.    Plaintiff’s Burden  Plaintiff admits that RPV  does not own the subject sidewalk. (Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of Facts  (“P-SSF”) No. 7.) However, Plaintiff asserts that RPV owns Silver Spur Road  which abuts the sidewalk. (Ibid.; Exh. 7.) Plaintiff also asserts that  RPV owns a public right-of-way easement over the sidewalk. (P-SSF No. 13.)  Furthermore, Plaintiff claims that RPV had actual notice of the sidewalk’s  condition when it was assigned a calculated pavement condition index in 2019.  (P-SSF No. 14; Exh. 7.) In 2022, RPV selected Willdan  Engineering “to provide engineering and support services for the rehabilitation  of the roadway segment of Silver Spur Road from the Rancho Palos Verdes city  limit north of Hawthorne Boulevard to Elkmont drive.” (Exh. 6.) Willdan’s  proposal included “assessing the pavement, sidewalk, and curb and gutter.” (Ibid.)  Plaintiff claims this maintenance shows RPV exercised control over the subject  sidewalk. An entity may be liable for injuries  to pedestrians on sidewalks abutting their property, as evaluated by the degree  of maintenance performed. (Alpert v. Villa Romano Homeowners Ass’n  (2008) 81 Cal.App.4th 1320, 1334-1335.) “ . . . A landowner or possessor of  land has a duty to take reasonable measures to protect persons from dangerous  conditions on adjoining land when the landowner or possessor exercises  possession or control over that adjacent land.” (Ibid.) Plaintiff provides evidence of an assessment which  shows RPV may have exercised control over the subject sidewalk. On summary  judgment, the opposing party’s affidavits or declarations are liberally  construed. (Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc. (1971)  4 Cal.3d 842, 851-852.) Therefore, Plaintiff meets their burden by providing  evidence showing a triable issue of material fact as to RPV’s control over the  sidewalk. Accordingly, RPV’s motion is denied.   V.        CONCLUSION              A triable issue of material fact exists as to  RPV’s control over the sidewalk. Accordingly, RPV’s motion for summary judgment  is DENIED.   Dated: October 16,  2024                                 __________________________________                                                                                                 Hon.

COMPLAINT
  FILED: MAY 7, 2021
TRIAL
  DATE: JANUARY 13, 2025


 I.      
BACKGROUND  On May 7, 2021, Plaintiff
Jason Gray (“Plaintiff”), by and through his guardian ad litem Gregory Gray,
filed a complaint against Defendants City of Rancho Pablos Verdes (“RPV”), City
of Rolling Hills Estates (“Rolling Hills”), and DOES 1 to 50 (collectively
“Defendants”) alleging one complaint of negligence. The complaint arises from a
September 20, 2020, incident, when Plaintiff allegedly suffered serious
injuries when thrown off his bike due to dangerous conditions on the sidewalk.  On June 5, 2024, the matter
was reassigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys
Courthoue East, effective June 24, 2024.  On July 1, 2024, Rolling
Hills filed a motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s claim. On September 24, 2024,
Plaintiff filed their opposition. On October 11, 2024, Rolling
Hills filed their reply. II.      
MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT            Rolling Hills moves for summary
judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint for negligence. Rolling Hills alleges that it
does not own or control the sidewalk which caused Plaintiff’s injuries, and
therefore cannot be held liable to Plaintiff as a matter of law.  III.      
LEGAL
STANDARDS Burden on Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication In reviewing a motion for
summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the
issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met
his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has
demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.  (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  “[T]he
initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that
there are no triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D.B. Log
Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing
that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more
elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a
complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd.
(p)(2).) A moving defendant may
satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be
established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the
plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid
discovery responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot
reasonably obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v.
Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [It is insufficient for the
defendant to merely point outthe absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura (2003)
108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) The defendant must present evidence, typically in
the form of factually devoid discovery responses, showing that plaintiff does
not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.” (Ibid.) Unless and until a defendant
meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting
evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454,
468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything
by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts
establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his
favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be
denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer
any evidence. On the other hand, if the
defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to
show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause
of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) The plaintiff may
not merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a
triable issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
cause of action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary
judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center
(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)       IV.      
DISCUSSION Judicial Notice            Rolling
Hills’s requests for judicial notice are denied. Judicial notice of the
Court’s own case file is redundant as the Court can always review the case at
hand.Evidentiary Objections Plaintiff’s September 24,
2024, evidentiary objections are sustained as to Nos. 1 and 2;  the street improvement plans of Rolling Hills
High School are not authenticated, nor does Rolling Hills lay a sufficient
foundation for introducing them.  Rolling Hills’s October 11,
2024, evidentiary objections are sustained as to Nos. 1, 4, 6. Nos. 1 and 4,
regarding certain portions of Gary Gsell (“Gsell”)’s declaration, constitute
speculation and lack foundation. No. 6, regarding Rolling Hills’s counsel’s
discussion with Mel Zapf, is hearsay. Evidentiary objections Nos. 2, 3, 5, and
7 are overruled.Defendant’s Burden Rolling Hills meets their
initial burden. Rolling Hills argues they
are not liable to Plaintiff as a matter of law because Rolling Hills does not
own or control the subject sidewalk.  "One
who owns, possesses, or controls [property] has a duty to act reasonably to
protect others from a dangerous condition [stemming from] that property.” (Soto
v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 168, 177.) “The
‘crucial element’ for imposing a duty in such circumstances is control . . .
the rationale being that whoever has the means to control the property can take
steps to prevent the harm.” (Ibid.) Conversely, “[a] defendant cannot be
held liable for the defective or dangerous condition of property which it did
not own, possess, or control.” (Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital
(1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 125.)                 Here,
Rolling Hills provides facts showing they do not own or control the subject
sidewalk. Rolling Hills asserts that, in June 2023, the subject sidewalk was
repaired by Hardy & Harper Inc., who was contracted by the city of Rancho
Palos Verdes. (Rolling Hills Separate Statement of Facts (“RH-SSF”) No. 4;
Exhs. R, B, and S.) Rolling Hills claims they were not involved with this
repair. (Ibid.) Defendant also asserts that the sidewalk was built by
the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District in 1963, and that there has
been no transfer of ownership since. (RH-SSF Nos. 6 and 7; Exh. D.)Therefore, Rolling Hills sets
forth sufficient evidence demonstrating that they do not own, possess, or
control the property which caused Plaintiff’s injuries. The burden now shifts to
Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s Burden Plaintiff provides evidence
that Rolling Hills participated in the June 2023 repair of the subject
sidewalk. (Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of Facts (“P-SSF”) No. 4; Exh. C.)
Plaintiff provides the deposition of David Wahba, Rolling Hills’s Public Works
Director, who testifies that Rolling Hills assisted with striping the roadway.
(Exh. C [Wahba Depo. p. 41:9-17].) Plaintiff also provides a 2013 Rolling Hills
sidewalk limits map prepared for the city by Willdan Engineering. (Exh. I.) Additionally,
Plaintiff notes the following testimony of Wahba: “. . . typically a sidewalk
that’s in the public right-of-way adjacent to a school within the
jurisdictional boundaries of Rolling Hills Estates would be [Rolling Hills]’s
responsibility.” (Exh. C [Wahba Depo. p. 46:20-23.]) Here, the subject sidewalk
abuts Rolling Hills high school.An entity may be liable for injuries
to pedestrians on sidewalks abutting their property, as evaluated by the degree
of maintenance performed. (Alpert v. Villa Romano Homeowners Ass’n
(2008) 81 Cal.App.4th 1320, 1334-1335.) “ . . . A landowner or possessor of
land has a duty to take reasonable measures to protect persons from dangerous
conditions on adjoining land when the landowner or possessor exercises
possession or control over that adjacent land.” (Ibid.)Plaintiff provides evidence that Rolling Hills may own
or exercise control over the subject sidewalk. On summary judgment, the
opposing party’s affidavits or declarations are liberally construed. (Corwin
v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc. (1971) 4 Cal.3d 842,
851-852.) Therefore, Plaintiff meets their burden by providing evidence showing
a triable issue of material fact as to Rolling Hills’s ownership and control
over the sidewalk. Accordingly, Rolling Hills’s motion is denied. V.      
CONCLUSION             A triable issue of material fact exists as to
Rolling Hills’s control over the sidewalk. Accordingly, Rolling Hills’s motion
for summary judgment is DENIED. Dated: October 16,
