And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Petitioner Shannon Escott's petition for approval of a compromise of a claim or action for a minor or person with a disability. The petition was denied due to several deficiencies, including the lack of a medical expense statement, an insufficient attorney declaration, and unreasonable attorney's fees. The court also noted that the proposed fees violate the contingent fee agreement between counsel and Claimant. The court is prepared to approve the trust instrument, but the petition is denied and the hearing is continued to allow the deficiencies to be corrected. The court warns Petitioner that further deficient petitions may result in sanctions or dismissal without prejudice.
