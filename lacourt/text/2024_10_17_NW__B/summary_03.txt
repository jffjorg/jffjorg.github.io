Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions for summary judgment filed by the City of Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills Estates, and has denied both motions. The City of Rancho Palos Verdes argues that it is not liable for the plaintiff's injuries because it does not own or control the sidewalk, while Rolling Hills Estates claims that it is not liable because it does not own or control the sidewalk. The Court finds that the City of Rancho Palos Verdes has met its initial burden of showing that it does not own or control the sidewalk, but that the plaintiff has presented evidence showing a triable issue of material fact as to whether the City has control over the sidewalk. Similarly, the Court finds that Rolling Hills Estates has met its initial burden of showing that it does not own or control the sidewalk, but that the plaintiff has presented evidence showing a triable issue of material fact as to whether Rolling Hills Estates has control over the sidewalk. As a result, the Court denies both motions for summary judgment.
