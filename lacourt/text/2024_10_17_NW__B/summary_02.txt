Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Bloomingdale's LLC, Macy's, Inc., and Schindler Elevator Corp. The motion was filed on August 15, 2024, and remains unopposed. The judge finds that the Plaintiffs, Nadia Farra and Sym Farra, have failed to respond to discovery requests, failed to comply with court orders, and failed to pay ordered sanctions. The judge considers the conduct of the Plaintiffs to be an abuse of the discovery process and finds that terminating sanctions are warranted. The judge grants the motion and dismisses the action with prejudice, meaning that the Plaintiffs cannot refile the lawsuit.
