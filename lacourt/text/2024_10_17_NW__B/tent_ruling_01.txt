Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of

Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Petitioner Shannon Escott’s
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of
Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability is DENIED. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On June 27, 2019, Plaintiffs
Weslee Davis Jr. (“Claimant”), by and through his guardian ad litem Shannon
Escott (“Petitioner”), and the Estate of Weslee Davis Sr., decedent, filed a
complaint against Defendants Singer Vehicle Design (“Singer”), the Estate of
Ryan Blanks (“Blanks”), the State of California (“State”), the County of Los
Angeles (“County”), the City of Los Angeles (“City”), and DOES 1 to 50
(collectively “Defendants”) alleging wrongful death and dangerous condition on
public property. The complaint arises from a June 20, 2018, incident in which Blanks,
within his scope of employment through Singer, negligently operated a motor
vehicle and collided with decedent, resulting in death to them both.
 
On January 28, 2020, Petitioner
filed an application for appointment of guardian ad litem for Claimant, which
was approved.
 
On October 11, 2022,
Petitioner filed a Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim as to Minor
Claimant (“Minor’s Comp.”). The Court denied the petition for filing
deficiencies.
 
On September 6, 2023,
Petitioner filed a second Minor’s Comp. The Court denied the petition as it
declined to approve the creation and funding of the proposed trust at that
time. (April 8, 2024, Minute Order.)
 
On May 3, 2024, Petitioner
filed a third Minor’s Comp. The Court denied the petition for trust instrument
deficiencies.
 
On June 7, 2024, the case was
reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
 
On July 1, 2024, Claimant filed the instant Petition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s or
incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code,
§§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Cal. Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a
petition for approval must be presented to the court and, until it is granted,
there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by
the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Ibid. at 1606.) 
 
Prob. Code § 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement
proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to Prob. Code § 3601, the order shall approve
payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows: 
 
The court
making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part
thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that such
reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a
parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court
shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property
to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or incompetent person.
(Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).) 
 
In cases pursuant to Prob. Code § 3601, “unless the court
has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee
standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from
money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person
with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he
court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made
between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances
existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the
attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (CRC Rule 7.955(a)(2).)
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner seeks court
approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $3,760,000.
Attorney’s fees in the amount of $1,692,000 and costs in the amount of
$167,395.44 will be deducted from Claimant’s settlement amount. Therefore,
Claimant would receive a net settlement amount of $1,900,604.56.
 
The Petition is denied for
the following deficiencies:
 
·        
Item 12a is blank.
Even if Claimant has no medical expenses, the Petition must indicate as such.
·        
Attachment 13a
must provide an attorney declaration on the basis for attorney’s fees,
including a discussion of applicable factors listed in CRC Rule 7.955(b). Here,
counsel states that this matter involved “multiple hearings” and that they made
“appropriate changes” to the trust instrument. (Attachment 13a ¶¶ 2 and 3.)
This declaration is insufficient under Rule 7.955(b).
·        
Counsel’s
proposed fees represent 45% of Claimant’s total settlement amount. The Court
finds this figure unreasonable. Furthermore, this amount directly violates
counsel’s contingent fee agreement with Claimant, which stipulates attorney’s
fees as 40% of the gross settlement amount if settled before trial. (See
Attachment 17a, Contingent Fee Agreement ¶ 2(b).) The Court also notes that, even
if counsel claimed 40% as agreed upon, this amount is still unreasonably high.
·        
Under Item 17e,
counsel indicates they are representing or employed by another party or
insurance carrier involved in the matter. However, counsel fails to identify
the party in Attachment 17e.
 
The Court is prepared to
approve the trust instrument. This is Petitioner’s fourth
petition which contains multiple filing deficiencies. The Court denies the
instant Petition and continues this hearing to [date] so that the deficiencies
can be corrected. The Court warns Petitioner that further deficient petitions
risk sanctions on Claimant and/or claimant’s counsel as well as possible dismissal
without prejudice pursuant to CCP § 583.410.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES the petition to confirm minor’s compromise
and continues the hearing to [date].
 
Claimant to
give notice.
