And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Liu v. JCTLA Investment Corp. et al. (Case No. 20SMCV00486). The plaintiff, Justin Liu, has moved for an order imposing terminating, issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against the defendants, Jean Liu and JCTLA Investment Corp., for their failure to obey discovery orders and engage in discovery abuse.

The court finds that the defendants have engaged in willful discovery abuse and have failed to obey multiple discovery orders, including orders to produce documents and serve discovery responses. The court also finds that the defendants have made false statements and have failed to provide meaningful responses to discovery requests.

The court orders terminating sanctions against the cross-defendants' action, striking the cross-complaint, and prohibiting the defendants from raising specified issues or introducing evidence to attempt to prove such issues. The court also precludes Jean Liu from testifying at trial.

The court imposes monetary sanctions in the amount of $11,260.50 to account for the fees and costs associated with the instant motion and the defendants' deposition misconduct. The court also orders the defendants to pay the outstanding monetary sanctions of $6,955.00.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any objections or further submissions from the parties.
