And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Joshua Romero and Jennifer Romero, in response to the complaint filed by TH Community, LLC, the landlord. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer because the plaintiff is suspended, the complaint improperly alleges that the Tenant Protection Act does not apply, and the complaint omits certain material facts concerning the amount of rent owed. The motion to strike argues that the attached 3-day notice fails to include the fact that Saturdays, Sundays, and judicial holidays are excluded from the computation of the three-day period, and that Jennifer Romero is improperly joined as a defendant.

The court has found that the demurrer is without merit. The complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer, and the plaintiff is not suspended. The complaint does not improperly allege that the Tenant Protection Act does not apply, and the plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to show that the action may proceed under the act. The complaint also does not omit material facts concerning the amount of rent owed, and the attached 3-day notice complied with section 1161 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

The court has also found that the motion to strike is without merit. The attached 3-day notice does not need to include the fact that Saturdays, Sundays, and judicial holidays are excluded from the computation of the three-day period, and Jennifer Romero is properly named as a defendant as a guarantor of rent.

The court has denied the demurrer and motion to strike, and ordered the defendants to file an answer within 5 days.
