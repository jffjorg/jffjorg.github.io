As for the summary in English text, here is a brief summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has reviewed the complaint and the demurrer filed by the defendants, Joshua Spiegal and Sotheby's International Realty, and has tentatively ruled as follows:

* The demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges a violation of Civil Code section 2079, is sustained without leave to amend. The Judge found that the complaint fails to state a cause of action under this section because the defendants did not breach their duty to conduct a visual inspection of the property and disclose the results of that inspection.
* The demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which alleges a violation of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL), is sustained with leave to amend. The Judge found that the complaint fails to plead specific relief, which is required by law.
* The demurrer to the fifth through tenth causes of action, which allege fraud, is sustained with leave to amend. The Judge found that the complaint fails to plead fraud with specificity, including the dates, times, and circumstances of the alleged misrepresentations.
* The motion to strike the request for punitive damages is moot since the demurrer was sustained with leave to amend.
* The motion to strike the request for attorneys' fees is granted because the defendants are not direct parties to the Real Estate Purchase Agreement and there is no statute that authorizes attorneys' fees.

The Judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified in the demurrer. The parties are ordered to file a new complaint, if necessary, within 30 days of the date of this order.
