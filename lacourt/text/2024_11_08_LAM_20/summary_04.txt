And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Plaintiff Jose Ronquillo and Defendants Sidney Sungchul Sohn, Alexander Tsao, and Venerable-Counselors At Law, PC. The settlement was reached after Plaintiff terminated his current counsel, FLG, and the parties agreed to dismiss the case. However, Plaintiff failed to file the request for dismissal and instead obtained a fraudulent default judgment against the Defendants in the amount of $1 million. The judge granted the motion to enforce settlement, deeming the dismissal to be the final resolution of the action.

The Defendants now seek sanctions against Plaintiff and his attorneys in the amount of $37,500 for taking frivolous actions after having settled the case. The judge has awarded reduced sanctions in the amount of $30,000 against Plaintiff, but has declined to sanction Plaintiff's attorneys. The judge has also noted that there must be a showing of subjective bad faith on the part of the attorney or party to be sanctioned, and that a determination of frivolousness requires a finding that the tactics at issue were "totally and completely without merit."
