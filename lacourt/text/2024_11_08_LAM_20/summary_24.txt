And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling to consolidate two cases: Case No. 24STCV20962, an action to quiet title, and Case No. 24STUD07698, an unlawful detainer matter. Both cases involve the same parties, Nicholas Aparicio and Sandra Vidal, and the same property, 808 N. Montebello Boulevard in Montebello, California. The judge has decided to consolidate the cases because title issues exist in both disputes and should be resolved through a joint hearing or trial, rather than through summary procedures in the unlawful detainer matter. The judge cites Code of Civil Procedure section 1048(a) and a previous court decision, Martin-Bragg v. Moore, to support the consolidation. The motion to consolidate is granted, and the moving party is required to give notice.
