And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Tyson & Mendes, LLP, seeking relief from its waiver of discovery objections. The plaintiff, Latoya S. Redd, claims that the defendants failed to pay her $35,489.51 attorneys' fee lien with settlement funds from case number YC072873. The defendants claim that they did not receive the plaintiff's written discovery and therefore did not serve timely responses. The judge grants the motion because the defendants have now served substantially compliant responses and have shown excusable neglect in having misplaced the subject discovery. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
