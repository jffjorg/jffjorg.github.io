And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff Anna Flores to compel Defendant Luis Carlos Munoz to provide further responses and documents in an employment action. Munoz had refused to answer a deposition question about his daughter's plastic surgery, which the judge believes is relevant to the case. The judge denied Munoz's objections to certain document requests, including requests for time records and text messages, but denied others, including a request for phone records, which the judge found to be overbroad. The judge also denied Munoz's procedural arguments and overruled his objections. The judge granted the motion in part, requiring Munoz to provide further responses and documents within 30 days. The judge did not award sanctions, despite finding that Munoz's conduct was sanctionable, because Plaintiff improperly filed the motion.
