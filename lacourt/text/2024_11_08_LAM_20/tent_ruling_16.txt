This was an unlawful detainer matter.  Possession has been resolved, but rent remains at issue.Defendant Jeffrey Benjamin, a pro per litigant, now seeks summary judgment.The law of summary judgment provides courts “a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  In reviewing a motion for summary judgment or adjudication, courts employ a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.”  (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  The moving party bears the initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue, in which case the burden shifts to the opposing party to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).)  To show a triable issue of material fact exists, the opposing party may not rely on the mere allegations or denials of the pleadings, but instead must set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.  (Aguilar, at p. 849.)  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(a)(2) provides that “Notice of the motion [for summary judgment] and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing.”  “[T]he statutory language regarding minimum notice is mandatory, not directive.”  (Urshan v. Musicians' Credit Union (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 758, 764.)Here, the notice for the Motion is defective.  The Motion was filed on October 4, 2024, set for October 28, 2024, and then continued to November 8, 2024.  Notably, when possession in a UD matter has been resolved and rent remains at issue, the case is set for an ordinary civil calendar.  (Civ. Code § 1952.3.)  That is, the case is no longer subject to expedited unlawful detainer procedures.  As the issue of rent is merely contractual, Defendant was required to provide a 75-day notice period for the Motion.  This was not provided.  Further, the Court lacks authority to continue a motion for summary judgment so as to rectify the notice requirement.  (Robinson v. Woods (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1268; Cal. Judges Benchbook Civ. Proc. Before Trial § 13.15.)The Motion also fails to provide a separate statement of undisputed facts, which is a basis to deny the Motion. (CCP § 437c(b)(1).)For all of these reasons, the Motion is denied.Moving party to give notice.
