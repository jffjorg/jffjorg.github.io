  - "The statutory language regarding minimum notice is mandatory, not directive."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which was filed on October 4, 2024, and set for hearing on October 28, 2024, but continued to November 8, 2024. The judge found that the notice for the motion was defective, as the defendant did not provide a 75-day notice period, which is required when the issue of rent is merely contractual. The judge also noted that the motion failed to provide a separate statement of undisputed facts, which is a basis to deny the motion. Additionally, the judge found that the case is no longer subject to expedited unlawful detainer procedures, as possession has been resolved and rent remains at issue. The judge ruled that the motion was denied, and the moving party must give notice.
