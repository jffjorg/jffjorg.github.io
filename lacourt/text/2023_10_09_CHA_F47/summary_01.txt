And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion filed by the plaintiff, Ruben Ramirez, to compel further responses and documents from the defendant, K12 Schools Services. The plaintiff had previously served discovery requests on K12 Schools Services, but the defendant failed to provide complete and responsive answers. The judge finds that K12 Schools Services' objections to the discovery requests were unjustified and that the defendant failed to meet its burden of justifying its objections. The judge orders K12 Schools Services to provide further responses and documents within 30 days. Additionally, the judge awards sanctions against K12 Schools Services and its counsel in the amount of $2,560.00, which is reduced from the requested amount of $4,560.00.
