MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Ruben Ramirez
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant K12 Schools Services
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
compelling Defendant K12 Schools Services to provide further responses and

RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Ruben Ramirez’s
(Plaintiff) employment as a truck driver with/for Defendants: (1) Juan Carlos
Saucedo (Saucedo), (2) K12 School Services (K12), 
(3) Fresh Start Healthy School Meals (Fresh Start
Healthy) and (4) Fresh Start Meals, Inc. (Fresh Start Meals).  On 8/2/21, Plaintiff filed this action
against Defendants for: (1) Unpaid Overtime; (2) Unpaid Minimum Wages; (3)
Non-compliant Wage Statements; (4) Wages Not Timely Paid During and Upon
Separation of Employment; (5) Unpaid Business Expenses; (6) Unpaid Meal Period
Premiums; (7) Unpaid Rest Period Premiums; (8) Violation of California Business
& Professions Code§§ 17200, et seq.; and (9) Failure to Provide Employment
Records in Violation of Labor Code§§ 1198.5 & 432.7.
 
On 12/23/22, Saucedo, whom Plaintiff contends co-owns,
controls and is the Chief Executive Officer of the entity defendants, testified
that he is not the owner of Fresh Start Meals. 
Rather, Saucedo claimed he purchased the assets, but not the
liabilities, of Fresh Start Meals.  
 
In order to investigate Saucedo’s relationship with Fresh
Start Meals, including any purchase of the entity and the relationship between
the three entity defendants, Plaintiff served discovery on Defendants.
 
On 1/30/23, Plaintiff served K12 with Requests for
Production of Documents, Set 3. 
(Roshanian Decl., Ex.A).  On
4/3/23, after being granted extensions of time to respond, K12 served responses
to the discovery.  (Id.,
Ex.B).  On 4/13/23, Plaintiff sent a meet
and confer letter regarding what it perceived to be deficient responses.  (Id., Ex.C).  During the meet and confer process, it was
ultimately agreed that K12 would have until 5/19/23 to provide
supplemental/further responses and Plaintiff’s deadline to file a motion for
further responses would be extended until 6/13/23.  (Id., Ex.D-F).  On 5/18/23, K12’s counsel filed and served a
motion to be relieved as counsel which was denied without prejudice on
9/21/23.  (Roshanian Decl.; 9/21/23
Minute Order).  K12 did not serve
supplemental responses as promised. 
(Roshanian Decl.).  On 5/22/23,
Plaintiff inquired as to whether further responses would be served or whether
motions should be filed.  Id.  K12 did not respond.  Id. 
 
Therefore, on 6/9/23, Plaintiff filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order compelling 
K12 to provide further responses and produce documents to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents, Set 3. 
Additionally, Plaintiff requests an award of sanctions against K12 and its
 counsel in favor of Plaintiff in the
amount of $4,560.00.  K12 has not filed
an opposition or any other response to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
By way of this motion, Plaintiff seeks to compel further
responses and/or the production of documents in relation to Requests 31, 32,
33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 42, 44, 47 and 48.  (See
Plaintiff’s Separate Statement).
 
CCP 2031.310(a) provides: 
 
“On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.”
 
In response to Requests 31, 32, 33 and 44, K12 asserts various
objections and then states without waiving such objections, no responsive
documents exist.  If a timely motion to
compel further responses is filed, the responding party has the burden to
justify any objection.  See Fairmont
Insurance Co. (2000) 22 C4th 245, 255; Coy (1962) 58 C2d 210,
220-221.  K12 has failed to meet its
burden of justifying the objections made in response to these requests.  Additionally, K12’s response/conclusion that
“no such documents exist” is insufficient. 
CCP 2031.230 provides: 
 
“A representation of inability to
comply with the particular demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent
search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is
because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed,
has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”
 
In response to Requests 34, 37 and 39, K12 asserts
unsupported objections, references its responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents, Set 2 noting “especially, for example, Exhibits 1 and
4” and then indicates that a diligent search is in progress and “all relevant
documents will certainly be produced.” 
Again, K12 has failed to meet its burden of justifying its
objections.  See Fairmont
Insurance Co., supra; Coy, supra.  K12’s reference to prior discovery responses
and citing certain exhibits thereto as “examples” and its indication that a
search is in progress and all relevant documents will be produced renders the
responses uncertain as it is unclear what documents in its prior discovery
responses are being referenced, if some responsive documents are being withheld
on the basis of the unsupported objections, and/or what responsive documents
are the subject of the search.  
 
In response to Request 36, K12 asserts unjustified
objections.  See Fairmont
Insurance Co., supra; Coy, supra.
 
In response to Request 42, K12 references its response to
Request for Production, Set 2 and “all pertinent provisions of the California
Labor Code” and then indicates that a search is in progress and “all relevant
documents will certainly be produced.” 
K12’s general reference to its prior discovery responses and
unidentified “pertinent” sections of the Labor Code is evasive and
non-responsive.   K12 has failed to
produce any documents which resulted from its “diligent search.”
 
In response to Requests 47 and 48, K12 states “[s]o far
as is known to this Responding Party, no such documents exist” and indicates
that a search is being conducted and all relevant documents will be
produced.  K12’s response that no
documents exist fails to comply with the requirements set forth in CCP 2031.230
noted above.  K12 has failed to produce
any documents from its claimed diligent search. 

 
Plaintiff is entitled to an award of sanctions against
K12 and its counsel of record for their failure to comply with their discovery
obligations.  CCP 2023.010(d), (e); CCP
2023.030(a); CCP 2030.310(h).  However,
the Court finds that the $4,560.00 requested to be excessive.  The Court awards $2,560.00 in sanctions (4
hours to prepare the motion + 1 hour to appear x $500.00/hour +$60.00 filing
fee).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The request to compel further responses is granted.  The request for sanctions is granted in the
reduced amount of $2,560.00.  Further
responses are due and sanctions are payable within 30 days.  
 
The Court
notes that Plaintiff has failed to electronically bookmark the declaration and
exhibits attached to the moving papers. 
Plaintiff’s counsel is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended
General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil.  When e-filing documents, parties must comply
with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set forth at page 4, line 4 through
page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First Amended General Order Re Mandatory
Electronic Filing for Civil.  See also
CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Failure to comply with
these requirements in the future may result in 
matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents
can be resubmitted in compliance with these requirements, documents not being
considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
