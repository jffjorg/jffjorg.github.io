BACKGROUND
            On August 15, 2023, plaintiff

LEGAL
AUTHORITY
CCP §418.10 states:  “(a) A defendant, on or before the last day
of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for
good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the
following purposes:
(1) To quash service of summons on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.
(2) To stay or dismiss the action
on the ground of inconvenient forum.
(3) To dismiss the action pursuant
to the applicable provisions of Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 583.110)
of Title 8.”  This section provides the
exclusive procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset.  Roy v.
Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal. App. 4th 337, 342.  Although defendant is the moving party, the
burden of proof is on plaintiff to defeat the motion by establishing that
jurisdictional grounds exist.  Mihlon v. Superior Court (1985) 169 Cal.
App. 3d 703, 710.
Under Evidence Code § 647, “[t]he
return of a process server registered pursuant to Chapter 16 (commencing with
Section 22350) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code upon process
or notice establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing
evidence, of the facts stated in the return.” 
Under Evidence Code § 604, “[t]he effect of a presumption affecting the
burden of producing evidence is to require the trier of fact to assume the
existence of the presumed fact unless and until evidence is introduced which
would support a finding of its nonexistence, in which case the trier of fact
shall determine the existence or nonexistence of the presumed fact from the
evidence and without regard to the presumption. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the drawing of any
inference that may be appropriate.”
Under CCP 415.20(b), “If a copy of
the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally
delivered to the person to be served, as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70,
416.80, or 416.90, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and
complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of
business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service
post office box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a
person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual
mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, at
least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by
thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class
mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of
the summons and complaint were left.  Service
of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after the
mailing.”
DISCUSSION
            Defendant John Nicol Lisman requests
that the court quash service of the summons and complaint.
            The proof of service filed on
October 19, 2023, by a registered process server indicates that defendant was
substitute served on October 16, 2023, at 9:30 a.m. on John Doe (refused name)
– co-occupant, and described as age 70, weight: 180, hair: gray, height: 6’1”,
eyes: brown, race: white, at 24723 Walnut St., Lomita, CA 90717.
            According to defense counsel’s
declaration, defendant passed away in April 2022.  Counsel states that on November 3, 2023, he
retained an investigator to go to the address where service was purportedly
completed and attempted to identify “John Doe.” 
According to investigator Sergio Garcia’s declaration, on November 3,
2023, he ran a court search and discovered two probate matters filed as to
defendant.  He also discovered a notice
of death of April 9, 2022 from the Water & Power Employees Retirement
Notice of Deaths for April 2022.  On
November 4, 2023, he traveled to 24723 Walnut St., Lomita and noted that the
house appeared to be vacant.  He
approached the front door and observed a “Warning” notice sealed across the
door frame stating, “DO NOT ENTER! PURSUANT TO LAW, THESE PREMISES ARE THE
CHARGE AND CUSTODY OF THE LA COUNTY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR. . . .”  Garcia states that the seal did not appear to
have been broken or tampered with for along time.  He canvassed the neighborhood and located a
next door neighbor who stated that the house had been vacant since Lisman’s
death and that no one lived or stayed at the house and that she and the
neighbors have been monitoring the house for any house squatters trespassing.
            There is no opposition.  Defendant has provided sufficient evidence to
rebut the presumption that he was properly substitute served.  The court also finds that 24723 Walnut St.,
Lomita was not defendant’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of
business, or usual mailing address on October 16, 2023, when he was purportedly
served, as he had passed away and the house was “sealed.”  
The motion is thus GRANTED.
Defendant is ordered to give notice
of the ruling.
