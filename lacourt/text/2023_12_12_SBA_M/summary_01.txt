And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has granted the motion filed by defendant's attorneys, Jason M. Stone and Blake S. Slater of Stone & Sallus, LLP, to be relieved as counsel for defendant Beata Stylianos. The court has found that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, causing irreconcilable differences and undue delay to the proceeding. The court has also found that the attorney has shown sufficient reasons why the motion to be relieved as counsel should be granted. The motion is granted, and the attorneys are relieved as counsel of record for defendant Beata Stylianos, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed 'Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel â€“ Civil' (Judicial Council form MC-053) upon the client."
