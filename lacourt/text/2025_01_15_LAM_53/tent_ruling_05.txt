The court notes, as Fidelity argues in its opposition, that Defendant has
stated that he received some papers that included R. Hernandez’s name on them
in January 2024.  (Supp. Hernandez Decl.,
¶ 5.)  This appears to refer to the
January 8, 2024 letter sent to Defendant by Fidelity, in which Fidelity (i) demanded
that Defendant take action to satisfy the subject lien and (ii) stated facts
regarding the existence of this action and the judgment entered in this action.  (Breeling Decl., Ex. 4.)  However, even if Defendant should have
discovered this action as of January 2024, the court finds that he acted with
substantial diligence in seeking relief on August 2, 2024.
