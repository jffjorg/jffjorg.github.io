Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court rules on two motions filed by plaintiff Rochelle Smith. The first motion is to deem the subject matter of requests for admission admitted and to award sanctions against defendants Scott Michael Barnes, Scott Barnes, Inc., Scott Barnes Labs, LLC, and Jack Cummins. The court finds that plaintiff has not properly served defendant Cummins with the discovery, so the motion is denied as to Cummins. However, the court grants the motion as to the other defendants, deeming admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission and awarding sanctions in the amount of $1,060.

The second motion is to compel responses to requests to produce, set two, and to award sanctions against the same defendants. The court finds that the defendants failed to serve timely responses to the discovery, so the motion is granted. The court orders the defendants to serve on the plaintiff full and complete verified responses, without objections, to the requests to produce and to produce all documents and things in their possession, custody, or control which are responsive to those requests. The court also awards sanctions in the amount of $1,060 against the defendants.

The court orders the defendants to pay the sanctions within 30 days and gives notice to the parties of the ruling.
