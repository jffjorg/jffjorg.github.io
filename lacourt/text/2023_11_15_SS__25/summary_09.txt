And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Jazmin Escobar's Motion on the Pleadings is granted in part and denied in part. The Motion is granted as to the first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, and denied as to the third cause of action. The judge finds that the causes of action for violation of California Penal Code § 632.7, intrusion into private affairs, public disclosure of private facts, and intentional infliction of emotional distress fail because they require a reasonable expectation of privacy, which was not present in this case. The cause of action for false light, on the other hand, withstands the Motion because it does not require a reasonable expectation of privacy and the Court finds that the out-of-context screenshot of the conversation makes Plaintiff appear cruel and sexually perverted.
