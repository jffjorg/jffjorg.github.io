ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion
for Costs after Judgment 
A.               
Request for Judicial Notice 
Pursuant to Evidence
code sections 452(c), (d) and 453, the Court grants Defendant’s request for
judicial notice in full, and grants Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice in
full.
 
B.                
Legal Standard 
A prevailing
party is entitled to recover costs, including attorney’s fees, as a matter of
right. (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1032(a)(4), 1032(b), 1033.5.) Attorney’s
fees are allowable as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(10).) 
 
“The judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs
of enforcing a judgment. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are
not included in costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by
law. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs
collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award of
attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of
paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
685.040.)
 
“The judgment creditor may claim costs authorized by Section 685.040 by
noticed motion. The motion shall be made before the judgment is satisfied in
full, but not later than two years after the costs have been incurred. The
costs claimed under this section may include, but are not limited to, costs
that may be claimed under Section 685.070 and costs incurred but not approved
by the court or referee in a proceeding under Chapter 6 (commencing with
Section 708.010) of Division 2.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080(a).)
 
“The notice of motion shall describe the costs claimed, shall state their
amount, and shall be supported by an affidavit of a person who has knowledge of
the facts stating that to the person’s best knowledge and belief the costs are
correct, are reasonable and necessary, and have not been satisfied. The notice
of motion shall be served on the judgment debtor. Service shall be made
personally or by mail.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080(b).)
 
The calculation of attorney’s fees in
California begins with the “lodestar” method – multiplying the number of hours
reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate. A computation of time spent
on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a
determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award. The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on factors specific to the case, in order to fix the
fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25,
49.) Such an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective
determination of the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount
awarded is not arbitrary. (Ibid. at
p. 48, fn. 23.) After the trial court has performed the lodestar calculations,
it shall consider whether the total award so calculated under all of the
circumstances of the case is more than a reasonable amount and, if so, shall
reduce the section 1717 award so that it is a reasonable figure. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095-1096.)
 
As explained in Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.:
 
“[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the
community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as
relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award. [Citation.] The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a
fee at the fair market value for the particular action. In effect, the court
determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation involved a contingent risk
or required extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned
lodestar in order to approximate the fair market rate for such services. . . .
This approach anchors the trial court's analysis to an objective determination
of the value of the attorney's services, ensuring that the amount awarded is
not arbitrary.” [Internal citations and internal quotation marks omitted.]
 
((2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “It is well
established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees
is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be
reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion. [Citations.] The value of
legal services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its
own expertise. . . . The trial court makes its determination after
consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation,
its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the
skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and other
circumstances in the case.  [Citations.]”
(Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
No specific findings reflecting the
court’s calculations are required. The record need only show that the attorney
fees were awarded according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. The
court’s focus in evaluating the facts should be to provide a fee award
reasonably designed to completely compensate attorneys for the services
provided. The starting point for this determination is the attorney’s time
records. (Horsford v. Board of Trustees
of Calif. State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395-397 [verified time
records entitled to credence absent clear indication they are erroneous].)
However, California case law permits fee awards in the absence of detailed time
sheets. (Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651; Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1794, 1810; Nightingale v.
Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 103.) An experienced trial
judge is in a position to assess the value of the professional services
rendered in his or her court.  (Ibid.; Serrano, 20 Cal.3d 25 at 49.)

Analysis
Plaintiff
Sharon Alfers obtained judgment in this case against Defendant Jordan Simons in
the amount of $12,714.02 on May 23, 2022, pursuant to a sister state judgment
from the District Court, Park County, Colorado in case number 20CV030020. Plaintiff
claims that Defendant refused to pay the judgment, or any part of it, for well
over a year. After refusing to pay the judgment, or any part of it for a year
and two months, and facing a judgment debtor’s examination set for August 29,
2023, Defendant on August 23, 2023, tendered a check in the amount of $14,309.06
to Plaintiff’s counsel, representing the face amount of the judgment of
$12,714.02 and the accrued interest through August 23, 2023. Plaintiff moves
for an order granting costs and attorney’s fees after judgment in the total
amount of $9,637.21.
            The
following represents a breakdown of the costs incurred:
 
1.     
$81.70 for preparing and issuing abstract of judgment
incurred on 8/16/22
2.     
$156.70 for recording and indexing of the abstract of
judgment incurred on 8/23/22
3.     
$39.95 for approved fee on application for order of
appearance of judgment debtor incurred on 5/31/23
4.     
$1,233.86 for other fees in reference to the service of
application and order for appearance and examination re enforcement of judgment
a.      
$74.67 incurred 6/1/23
b.     
$572.60 incurred 6/23/23
c.      
$586.89 incurred 7/5/23
5.     
$8,125.00 for attorney’s fees incurred from August 9,
2022 to August 16, 2023
 
Plaintiff argues that Colorado law
applies pursuant to the “governmental interest test” under the California
choice-of-law rules because Colorado has the primary interest in seeing that
real property within its state is not subject to improper liens, and one method
to deter frivolous lien filings is by awarding attorney’s fees. (See Grant
v. McAuliffe (1953) 41 Cal.2d 859; Pacific Diamond Company, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 871; Kearney v. Salomon Smith
Barney, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal. 4th 95.) Plaintiff cites to Colorado statutes
which provide for an award of actual costs incurred in post judgment as well as
attorney’s fees. Plaintiff also states that California law also allows for costs
that were reasonable and necessary in enforcing the judgment.
 
In opposition, Defendant does not
dispute that Plaintiff is not entitled to costs but rather asserts that the
fees sought are unreasonable and excessive. 
 
Since Defendant fails to argue
against Plaintiff’s award of actual costs, the Court awards $1,512.21 for
actual costs incurred. However, Defendant does dispute the $8,125.00 that
Plaintiff claims she incurred in attorney’s fees. Plaintiff’s counsel, Mark
Egerman claims an hourly rate of $650. Defendant does not dispute that the
claimed rate is unreasonable but rather the hours spent. Mr. Egerman provides
in his declaration that he has been practicing law in the state of California
for 57 years, and he is a senior partner at the Egerman Law Group, LLP firm.
Egerman Decl. ¶¶ 2, 3.) He also attaches a copy of his curricula vitae, which
shows he graduated from UCLA School of Law, specializes in real property law,
participated in numerous multi-million dollar transactions, served as judge
pro-tem in multiple courts, and received an “a.v.” rating by Martindale,
Hubble, a national publication of attorneys, which is the highest rating given
for professional qualifications and ethics. (Id., Exhib. A.) The
Court finds Mr. Egerman’s hourly rate to be reasonable. 
 
Defendant challenges the fees on
the grounds that lower billers could have performed much of the work, which
included filling out judicial council forms. The Court addresses the
reasonableness of the breakdown of fees in turn.
 
June 20, 2023: Review email from First Legal
 
Mr. Egerman billed a half hour to
review a two-page email from First Legal regarding service issues. (Egerman
Decl., Ex. F.) Defendant argues that at most this should have been .1 hours, and
that a lower billing associate or paralegal could have handled service issues.
 
The Court agrees that the hours
claimed here are excessive and reduces the number of hours for the June 20,
2023 entry to .1 hours as Defendant requests. 
 
July 5, 2023: Research execution sale of a dwelling;
Research value of 6977 Los Tilos Road
 
Mr. Egerman billed a half hour for
this research. Defendant argues this information is readily available in a
treatise that should take no more than 15 minutes to research, and a two-minute
Zillow search will reveal the property value. Moreover, a lower billing
associate or paralegal could have performed the research.
 
The Court agrees that the hours
claimed here are excessive and reduces the number of hours for the July 5, 2023
entry to .25 hours as Defendant requests. 
 
July 19, 2023: Received email from Dana Delman; Email to Dana
Delman & July 21, 2023: Memo re Jordan Simons' Judgment payoff.
 
Mr. Egerman billed .2 hours for the
following email exchange: From Ms. Delman: “Please let me know the current
amount owing on the Colorado judgment.” Mr. Egerman’s response: “My secretary
is on vacation until the end of next week. When she return, I shall forward the
information to you.” (Delman Decl., Ex. 7.) Defendant states none of this is
reasonable under the circumstances and it demonstrates that Mr. Egerman’s
billing is excessive.
 
Mr. Egerman billed .1 hours for a
memorandum. Defendant states this appears to be a memorandum to Mr. Egerman’s
assistant to provide the payoff amount. Defendant claims this is an
unreasonable amount as he could have just forwarded the two-sentence email
exchange to his secretary. At most, the billing for July 19 and 21 should be .1
hours.
 
The Court agrees that the hours
claimed here are excessive and reduces the number of hours for the July 19,
2023 and July 21, 2023 entries to .1 hours, collectively, as Defendant requests.

 
August 3, 2023: Received email from Sharon Alfers;
Telephone conference with Wade Ash; Review C.R.S. 15- 10-602(6); Reserve hearing
date for Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs; Email to Sharon Alfers.
 
Mr. Egerman billed .6 hours. Defendant
states none of this time should be compensable. A secretary could have reserved
the hearing date. Moreover, § 1710.35 makes it clear that California law
applies and therefore any research regarding Colorado law is unreasonable.
Moreover, this is block billing and it is impossible to determine how much time
was spent on each task, and whether the emails to and from Ms. Alfers were necessary
or reasonable.
 
The Court agrees that the hours
claimed here are excessive and declines to award attorney’s fees for the August
3, 2023 entry.
 
August 7, 2023: Telephone conference with Sharon Alfers; Review
C.R.S. §§38-35- 204 and 38-35-109; Telephone conference with Dana Delman; Print
out time records and review time records.
 
Mr. Egerman billed 1.1 hours. Defendant
claims this is block billing and therefore automatically suspect. The telephone
conference with Ms. Delman was six minutes (Delman Decl., ¶ 2.) Moreover, since
Colorado law does not apply in this case, any research regarding Colorado law
is unreasonable. There was no need to review time records. At most, only .1
hours should be compensated.
California courts have recognized that block billing
“obscure[s] the nature of some of the work claimed,” damaging a counsel’s
credibility. (Id. at p. 1325.) Block billing, while not objectionable per
se, exacerbates the vagueness of a counsel’s fee request, which is a risky
choice since the burden of proving entitlement to fees rests on the moving
party. (Ibid.) Block billing, however, is less problematic when a party
is entitled to recover all of its attorney’s fees than when the fee request
must be apportioned between recoverable and non-recoverable claims. (See Heritage
Pac. Fin., LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1010-1011 [“Trial
courts retain discretion to penalize block billing when the practice prevents
them from discerning which tasks are compensable and which are
not.”].)   
The Court notes that the fact of
block billing alone does not automatically disqualify a prevailing party from
being awarded attorney’s fees. However, the Court finds that the hours claimed
are excessive and reduces the number of hours for the August 7, 2023 entry to
.1 hours as Defendant requests. 
 
August 8, 2023: Received email from Dana Delman; Work on Motion
for Costs After Judgment; Email to Dana Delman;
 
Mr. Egerman billed 0.9 hours. The
emails referenced were with respect to the probate case pending between the parties.
(Delman Decl., Ex. 8.) On August 7, Mr. Egerman promised to send the fees
billed to date before drafting the motion. He ignored his promise, and did not
send a fee breakdown until September 18, after he drafted the motion. Moreover,
a lower biller could have done the research on the motion. Defendant claims all
the time spent researching Colorado law was unreasonable, and there was no
research on California law other than citation to one statute.
 
            The Court
does not find the hours billed in this entry to be unreasonable. Further, Defendant
fails to provide any authority which would require a lower biller to do
research on a motion such as the one in the August 8, 2023. Thus, the Court
declines to reduce the hours for this entry.
 
August 9, 2023: Work on Points and Authorities for Cost Motion;
 
Mr. Egerman billed 2.8 hours. Defendant
states all of the case law cited in the motion related only to the
applicability of Colorado law. Without the extensive unnecessary and
inapplicable recitation of Colorado law, the motion consists of a short summary
of the probate case and Mr. Egerman’s declaration, which should have taken no
more than an hour to draft. Moreover, none of the fees incurred in drafting the
motion should be compensated given that Simons was willing to pay reasonable
fees without the need for motion practice.
 
The Court
finds that Defendant does not present
sufficient evidence that the time spent on the motion was excessive. Thus,
the Court declines to reduce the hours for this entry.
 
August 10, 2023: Work on Motion for Costs.
 
Mr. Egerman billed 1.2 hours. Defendant
simply states this is excessive.
 
The Court
finds that Defendant does not present
sufficient evidence that the time spent on the motion was excessive. Thus,
the Court declines to reduce the hours for this entry.
 
August 14, 2023: Received email from Dana Delman(two);
 
Mr. Egerman billed 0.2 hours. Defendant
points out that only one of these emails related to this case (Delman Decl.,
Ex. 5) and it was a short follow up email. The other email on that date related
to the Probate Case. (Delman Decl., Ex. 9.) Thus, this time billed was
excessive.
 
The Court agrees that the hours
claimed here are excessive and declines to award attorney’s fees for the August
14, 2023 entry.
 
August 16, 2023: Work on Points and Authorities for
Motion.
 
Mr. Egerman billed 0.9 hours. Defendant
states this is excessive time given that almost the entire motion was dedicated
to inapplicable law.
 
The Court
finds that Defendant does not present
sufficient evidence that the time spent on the motion was excessive. Thus,
the Court declines to reduce the hours for this entry.
 
Upon review of the breakdown of
fees charged, the Court makes the following reductions:
