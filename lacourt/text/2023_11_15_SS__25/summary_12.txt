Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has written a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Armen Shaghzo, Esq. Counsel is seeking to withdraw as counsel for plaintiff Raul Garcia due to a breakdown in communication with the plaintiff. The judge finds that counsel has provided a valid reason for withdrawal and has complied with the relevant rules of court. The judge also finds that counsel's withdrawal will not prejudice the plaintiff. Therefore, the judge grants the motion and orders counsel to file a proof of service of the signed order granting the motion. The judge notes that the hearing date for this motion was continued to November 15, 2023, and that counsel should give notice of the order.
