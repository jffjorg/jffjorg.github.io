  Case Number:  23PSCP00529    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Swift  Financial, LLC, as Servicing Agent of WebBank v. Lumenos Technologies, et al.  Petition  to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award  TENTATIVE  RULING The Court DENIES the petition to confirm contractual arbitration  award without prejudice.               Petitioner is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order. BACKGROUND This is a contractual arbitration matter. On December 8, 2023, petitioner  Swift Financial, LLC, as Servicing Agent for WebBank (Petitioner) filed a  petition against respondents Lumenos Technologies, Inc., Matthew Laney  (collectively, Respondents) and Does 1 to 10, to confirm an arbitration award  issued on July 12, 2023 in the amount of $111,196.02. Respondents did not oppose  the petition.  LEGAL  STANDARD             “Any party to an arbitration in which an award has  been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “[A] court, before granting a petition to compel  arbitration, must  determine the factual issue of ‘the existence or validity of the arbitration  agreement.’ [Citation.]” (Toal v. Tardif  (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1208, 1219, italics added.)  “No petition may be served and filed under this  chapter until at least 10 days after service of the signed copy of the award  upon the petitioner.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.4.) “A petition under this title  shall be heard in a summary way in the manner and upon the notice provided by  law for the making and hearing of motions, except that not less than 10 days'  notice of the date set for the hearing on the petition shall be given.” (Id.,  1290.2.)  DISCUSSION             Petitioner seeks to confirm an  arbitration award issued on July 12, 2023, in the amount of $111,196.02 against  Respondents. (Petition, Attachment 8, subd. (c).) However, the Court notes that  Petitioner did not file a proof of service of the petition on Respondents with  the Court. Notice is required before the Court can rule substantively on the  petition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Diaz v. Professional Community  Management, Inc. (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 1190, 1204-1205 [trial court “lacks  jurisdiction to rule on a motion that has not been properly noticed for hearing  on the date in question. [Citations].”]) Given Respondents’ lack of opposition  to the Petition, it is unclear whether Petitioner ever served the petition on  Respondents and whether the Court has jurisdiction to rule on the petition.  Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the petition.  CONCLUSION The Court DENIES the petition to confirm contractual arbitration  award without prejudice.                Petitioner is ordered to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
