And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Swift Financial, LLC, as Servicing Agent of WebBank v. Lumenos Technologies, et al. The petition to confirm a contractual arbitration award has been denied without prejudice. The Judge notes that the Petitioner did not file a proof of service of the petition on the Respondents with the Court, and therefore, the Court lacks jurisdiction to rule substantively on the petition. The Respondents did not oppose the petition, and it is unclear whether the Petitioner ever served the petition on them. The Judge orders the Petitioner to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
