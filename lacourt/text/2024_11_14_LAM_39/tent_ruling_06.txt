[1]Plaintiffs
request the Court take judicial notice, pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452
and 453, of a set of declarations filed in a case in the Los Angeles County
Superior Court.  The Court does so;
however, the Court  does not notice the
truth of the contents of such pleadings or documents.  (Herrera v. Deutsche Bank national Trust
Company (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.)  
 


               [2]The
Court also notes Plaintiffs respond to Defendant’s contention the signatures on
the documents that purportedly authorized Plaintiffs’ entry onto Defendants’ property
by refuting the claim the documents bore forged signatures.  At a minimum, this issue is far from
undisputed.  As this constitutes a
disputed issue of a material fact related to whether or not Defendants granted
Plaintiffs permission to enter Defendants’ property, summary judgment as to the
trespass cause of action is not warranted, and a determination by the trier of
fact of the issue is necessitated.
