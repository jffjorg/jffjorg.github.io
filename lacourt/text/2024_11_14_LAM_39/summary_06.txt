Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case where the plaintiffs are asking the court to take notice of certain documents that were filed in a different case in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. The judge grants this request, but notes that the court is not necessarily accepting the truth of the contents of these documents. The judge also notes that the defendant is disputing the signatures on certain documents that allegedly authorized the plaintiffs' entry onto the defendant's property. The judge finds that this issue is disputed and that a determination by the trier of fact is necessary to resolve the issue. As a result, the judge is not granting summary judgment on the trespass cause of action.
