request the Court take judicial notice, pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452
and 453, of a set of declarations filed in a case in the Los Angeles County
Superior Court.  The Court does so;
however, the Court  does not notice the
truth of the contents of such pleadings or documents.  (Herrera v. Deutsche Bank national Trust
Company (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.)
