And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by plaintiff Teresita Mahayag Teichman, who is 75 years old and alleges tenant harassment by defendants Farivar Gouhari, Eric D. Beck, and Mag Estate Property LLC. The plaintiff seeks an order granting her trial preference due to her age and poor health, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 36. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that her health necessitates trial preference. The plaintiff has presented evidence of her medical conditions, including scoliosis and arthritis, but has not explained how they impact her participation in the litigation. Additionally, the declaration of her counsel, Andres Rapoport, does not establish that the plaintiff's interests in the litigation would be prejudiced if she does not receive a trial preference. Therefore, the judge denies the motion, but allows the plaintiff to renew it if she can address the matters noted above.
