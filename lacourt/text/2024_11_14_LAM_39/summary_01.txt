Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants summary adjudication to the defendants on the first cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets, finding that the information at issue is not a trade secret. The judge also grants summary adjudication on the fourth cause of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, as the plaintiffs concede they cannot state this claim.

The judge denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication on the third cause of action for unfair competition, finding that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the defendants' conduct damaged the plaintiffs.

The judge also denies the defendants' motion for summary adjudication on the issue of unclean hands, finding that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the plaintiffs engaged in unconscionable, bad faith, or inequitable conduct.

The judge orders the defendants to give notice of the court's order and to file proof of service of same.
