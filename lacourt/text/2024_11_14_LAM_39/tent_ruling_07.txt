MOTION
            Plaintiff
Harold Burton Igdaloff, individually and on behalf of the Estate of Evelyn
Igdaloff, and the Igdaloff 1993 Family Trust (“Plaintiff”) moves to enforce a
settlement agreement with Defendants Hany S. Fangary and Fangary Law Group
(“Defendants”) under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  Defendants have not opposed the motion.
ANALYSIS
Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 (section 664.6 )provides “[i]f parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence
of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part
thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of
the settlement.”  In ruling on a motion
to enter judgment, the Court acts as a trier of fact.  The Court must determine whether the parties
entered into a valid and binding settlement.  To do so, the Court may receive oral testimony
in addition to declarations.  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
Plaintiff does not
advance a settlement agreement that Defendants signed, or one the parties
entered in open court.  (Declaration of Steven
C. Glickman, ¶ 7.)  As such, the Court
cannot enforce a settlement agreement under section 664.6, as Plaintiff fails
to present a signed agreement to the Court. 
The motion to enforce the settlement is denied without prejudice. 
 If Plaintiff believes Defendants entered into
an enforceable settlement agreement with Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s remedy is to
assert a claim for breach of contract against Defendant.  (Smith v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co. (1999)
69 Cal.App.4th 1371, 1374.)  While
Plaintiff states Plaintiff seeks leave to assert such a claim in the
alternative to Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the settlement agreement,
Plaintiff’s motion does not meet the procedural requirements for a motion for
leave to amend.  (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324.)
Plaintiff is to
give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
