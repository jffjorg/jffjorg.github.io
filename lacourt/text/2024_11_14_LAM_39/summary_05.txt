And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment on their cross-complaint for trespass to land. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs entered their property without permission and caused disruption to their tenants. However, the defendants did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims, including the amount of damages they seek. The judge ruled that the defendants have not met their burden of persuasion to show that there is no triable issue of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
