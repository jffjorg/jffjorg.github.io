H. Jack
 Kakoian seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiff
 Edward Lee on grounds that the attorney-client
 relationship has deteriorated. Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) The Court notes that trial in this matter is not yet set
and no prejudice will result from granting this motion. However, the motion is
not accompanied by a proposed order on Form M-053 as required by California Rules
of Court rule 3.1362. Accordingly, the hearing on this unopposed motion to be
relieved is continued to December 21, 2023. A proposed order should be
submitted no later than 5 days before the date of the next hearing. 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 7th
day of December 2023
