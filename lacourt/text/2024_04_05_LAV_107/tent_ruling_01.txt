I. BACKGROUND
On October 25,
2021, plaintiff Harris Davis (“Plaintiff”) tripped and fell over a door mat at
a restaurant owned by defendants Norms and Norms Restaurants, LLC (“Defendant”
and, together with Plaintiff, “Parties”). Plaintiff thereby incurred injuries.
(Complaint pp. 3–4.)
 
On July 10, 2023,
Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint (the “Complaint”)
alleging a single cause of action for premises liability — negligence.
 
On October 18,
2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with discovery requests. (Motions p. 3.)
Parties agreed to multiple response deadline extensions, finally agreeing to a
January 24, 2024 deadline but Defendant had not received responses as of the
filing of the Motions (as defined below). (Ibid.) 
 
On February 5,
2024, Defendant filed four motions to compel: a motion to compel responses to
requests for production (“Motion #1), a motion to compel responses to form
interrogatories (“Motion #2”), a motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories (“Motion #3”), and a motion to compel responses to requests for
admission (“Motion #4” and, together with Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3,
the “Motions”). 
 
On March 27, 2024,
Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition for each of the Motions.
 
II. DISCUSSION
 

Motion #1 (Requests for Production),
     Motion #2 (Form Interrogatories), and Motion #3 (Special Interrogatories)

 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response,…[t]he party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§¿2030.290.) And, “a party's failure to object to interrogatories within 30
days, or such additional time as extended by the court, constitutes a waiver of
any right to object.” (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) Similarly, “[i]f a party to whom¿a¿demand¿for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling¿is directed fails to serve a timely response to it,… [t]he
party to whom the¿demand¿for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling¿is
directed waives any objection to the demand [and]…[t]he party making the demand
may move for an order compelling response to the¿demand.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§¿2031.300.) In the absence of any response to the discovery request, all that
a motion to compel need show is that a set of¿interrogatories¿was properly
served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no
response of any kind has been served. (See Leach v. Superior Court, supra
at 905–06.) 
 
Defendant
attaches to each of Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3 evidence that each such
discovery request was properly served on Plaintiff’s attorney by mail on
October 18, 2023. (Motions Exh. “A.”) Defendant also attaches to each of Motion
#1, Motion #2, and Motion #3 copies of e-mail correspondences between its
attorney and Plaintiff’s attorney in which they agree to extend the deadline
for responses to such discovery requests to January 24, 2024 as well as a copy
of an e-mail sent by its attorney to Plaintiff’s attorney inquiring about the
requested discovery responses after that January 24 deadline had passed. (Motions
Exh. “B,” Exh. “C,” Exh. “D.”)  Finally,
Defendant attaches to each of Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3 evidence that
no response of any kind to any of the three
discovery requests was received by that response due date or thereafter.
(Stewart Decls. ¶¿10.) Thus, Defendant has met its burden of showing that
Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3 are necessary.
 
Accordingly, Motion #1 is GRANTED, Motion #2 is GRANTED, and
Motion #3 is GRANTED. 
 

Motion #4 (Requests for Admission)

 
“If a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response,…
[t]he requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§¿2033.280, subd. (b).) Additionally, “[t]he party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests.” (§¿2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
 
In Motion #4,
Defendant does not move for an order that the matters specified in the requests
for admission be deemed admitted under California Code of Civil Procedure §¿2033.280, subdivision (b) but
rather moves for an order to compel responses to its requests for admission
under California Code of Civil Procedure §¿2030.290, subdivision (b). However, California Code of Civil
Procedure §¿2030.290, subdivision
(b) permits a party who has propounded discovery requests to move for an order
to compel responses to only interrogatories, not to requests for
admission. Finding no statutory authority for Defendant to move to compel
responses to requests for admission, this court DENIES Motion #4.
 

Sanctions

 
Sanctions are mandatory against the party, the attorney, or
both whose failure to serve a timely response to the request necessitated the
motion to compel response to interrogatories or the motion to compel response
to a demand for inspection. (Cal. C. Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c);
see also Cal. Rules of Court R. 3.1348(a) (the court can award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though
no opposition was filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed). “As to
the amount of¿sanctions,¿Cal. C. Civ. Proc. §¿2023.030(a)¿authorizes the trial
court to impose an amount representing ‘the reasonable expenses, including
attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result’ of a party's misuse of the
discovery process.” (Parker v. Wolters Kluwer United States, Inc. (2007)
149 Cal.App.4th 285, 294.) 
 
Each of the Motions requests sanctions in the amount of
$510.00 for a total of $2,040.00. (Stewart Decls. ¶ 11.) For each of the
Motions, this is based on one hour of attorney time preparing each of the
Motions and an additional hour of attorney time responding to any opposition
thereto at a rate of $225.00 per hour, plus a $60.00 filing fee for each of the
Motions.
 
Because this court denies Motion #4, we do not find Motion #4
to have been necessary. 
 
Accordingly, this court DENIES the sanctions requested in
Motion #4. 
 
Because this court grants Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion
#3, we find these Motions to have been necessary. However, we observe that
because no oppositions were filed to any of Motion #1, Motion #2, or Motion #3,
half of the attorney time for which sanctions are sought was never spent on
bringing or defending these Motions. We believe that the one hour of attorney
time spent preparing each of Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3 at a rate of
$225.00 per hour is reasonable. We additionally find that seeking sanctions in
the amount of the $60.00 filing fee in costs for each of Motion #1, Motion #2,
and Motion #3 is reasonable. 
 
Accordingly, this court GRANTS sanctions against Plaintiff
and in favor of Defendant in the reduced amount of $285.00 for each of Motion
#1, Motion #2, and Motion #3, for a total of $855.00.
