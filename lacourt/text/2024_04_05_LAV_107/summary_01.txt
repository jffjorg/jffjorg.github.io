Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motions to compel Plaintiff's responses to discovery requests, including requests for production, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. The judge also grants sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $285.00 for each of the granted motions, totaling $855.00. The judge denies Defendant's motion to compel responses to requests for admission, as there is no statutory authority for such a motion. The judge notes that Plaintiff failed to respond to discovery requests despite multiple deadline extensions, and that Defendant's motions to compel were necessary to obtain the requested discovery.
