And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Defendant Platinum Security Inc.'s Motion to Compel Arbitration. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Chandi Davis's complaint, which alleges claims of hostile work environment, sexual harassment, and retaliation. The parties had entered into a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, which plaintiff argued was unenforceable due to the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA). The court agreed with plaintiff, finding that the EFAA applies to plaintiff's claims and renders the arbitration agreement unenforceable. The court held that because plaintiff's claims alleged "conduct constituting a sexual harassment dispute" as defined by the EFAA, the entire arbitration agreement is rendered unenforceable.
