And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge issued tentative rulings on several motions in limine (MILs) filed by both parties. The judge denied Plaintiff's MIL #1, which sought to exclude evidence of drug use or suspected drug use by the Plaintiff's children. The judge agreed that the evidence is centrally relevant to the question of whether the Defendant's comment was harassment or criticism.

The judge granted Plaintiff's MIL #7, which sought to exclude evidence of the estimated monetary value of the Plaintiff's residence. The judge ruled that non-expert opinion about the monetary value of the home is inadmissible lay opinion testimony.

The judge denied Defendant's MIL #1, which sought to exclude speculative testimony regarding Dr. Jina Kim's departure from the MMED. The judge ruled that Dr. Kim may testify about Stephens' alleged requests to "write up" the Plaintiff, Dr. Kim's refusal to do so, and any conduct directed at Dr. Kim that induced her to leave her position.

The judge denied Defendant's MIL #4, which sought to exclude Plaintiff's personal journals. The judge ruled that the journals may be used at trial to refresh the Plaintiff's recollection, as evidence of her then-existing state of mind, or as a prior consistent statement in response to efforts to impeach the Plaintiff's testimony.
