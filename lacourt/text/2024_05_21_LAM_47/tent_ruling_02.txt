CASE
HISTORY:
·        
02/06/23: Petition for approval of
transfer of structured settlement payment rights filed. 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            Petitioner seeks court approval of a
proposed transfer of structured settlement payments.  
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Petitioner seeks court approval of a proposed
transfer of structured settlement payments.  
 
A direct or indirect transfer of structured settlement
payment rights is not effective unless the transfer has been approved by a
court order finding:  
 
(1) The
transfer is in the best interest of the payee, considering the welfare and
support of the payee’s dependents. 
 
(2) The
payee has been advised in writing by the transferee to seek independent
professional advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice
or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice.  
 
(3) The
transferee has complied with the notification requirements pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has provided the payee with a
disclosure form that complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement
complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.  
 
(4) The
transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court
or other government authority. 
 
(5) The
payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms set
forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136.  
 
(6) The
payee understands and does not wish to exercise the payee’s right to cancel the
transfer agreement.  
 
(Ins. Code § 10139.5(a).) 
 
As a result of a personal injury settlement entered into
when he was a minor, Payee Robert Bravo, Jr. became entitled to certain
structured settlement payments. (Amended Petition, Exh. C.) 
 
Robert Bravo, Jr., as Payee, and Petitioner J.G. Wentworth
Originations, LLC, as Assignee, have entered into a Structured Settlement
Payments Purchase Agreement, under which Payee is to sell future payments
totaling $509,146.92 in exchange for a purchase price of $27,583.41. (Amended
Petition Exh. A.)  
 
The discounted present value of the amount being sold is $279,721.14,
calculated by applying the 5.0% discount rate used by the Internal Revenue
Service to value annuities in probate proceedings. The purchase price was
calculated using a discount rate of 29.99%. If Payee did not sell the right to
receive structured settlement payments but instead borrowed the net amount of $27,583.41
and paid that loan back in installments with each of the payments he is now
selling, the equivalent interest rate would be 29.99%. (Ibid.) 
 
All this information has been properly disclosed to Payee
by way of the disclosure form in compliance with Insurance Code § 10136, as
required by § 10139.5(a)(3). (Amended Petition, Exh. B.) Payee was advised in
writing to seek independent professional advice, both legal and financial. (Ibid.)
Payee chose not to seek an independent professional’s advice. (Amended Petition,
Exh. E.) Thus, Petitioner has complied with the statutory disclosure
requirements. (Ins. Code § 10139.5(a)(2).) 
 
The transfer agreement (Exh. A) also complies with
Insurance Code §§ 10136 and 10138 as required by § 10139.5(a)(3). It does not
contravene any applicable statute or order of any court or other governmental
authority. (Ins. Code § 10139.5(a)(4).)  
 
Copies of the relevant portions of the annuity contract,
qualified assignment agreement, and underlying structured settlement agreement
were submitted as required by Ins. Code § 10139.5(f)(2)(E)-(G). (Amended
Petition  Exh. C.) 
 
Information About Transferor 
 
Payee is 73 years old. (Second Amended Declaration of Robert
Bravo ISO Petition. ¶ 8).  
 
Payee has indicated that he resides in La Verne,
California, but has not disclosed his address. (Chapman Decl. ¶ 8.) This
address must be provided at the hearing on this motion before the
transfer may be approved. 
 
Payee has stated that he is unmarried as required by
Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(2). (Bravo Decl. ¶ 8.) 
 
Payee has stated that he has no minor children as required
by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(3). (Id.) 
 
Payee has indicated that he is unemployed and receives
$2,550 per month from Social Security and has therefore attested as to the
amount and his source of his monthly income as required by Insurance Code §
10139.5(c)(4). (¶ 8.) 
 
Payee has stated that he has no child support obligations,
as required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(5). (Id.) 
 
Payee has provided information regarding previous transfers,
as required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(6). (¶¶ 9-13.) 
 
In sum, Payee has provided all the information required by
Insurance Code § 10139.5(c) with the exception of his address. 
 
Payee indicates how the proceeds would be used as required
by Insurance Code § 10139.5(b)(2). He intends to use the proceeds to pay $2,000
towards outstanding credit card debt, and the remainder to pay outstanding
rent, medical bills, and monthly cost of living. (¶ 15.) He has indicated that
he is currently experiencing a financial hardship, as required by Insurance
Code § 10139.5(b)(3). (¶ 15.)  
 
Payee has indicated that the periodic payments were not
intended for necessary living expenses nor medical expenses, as required by
Insurance Code § 10139.5(b)(5)-(7). (¶¶ 6-7.) 
 
Given the foregoing, the Court finds that the transfer is
fair, reasonable and in the best interest of Payee. (Insurance Code §
10139.5(a)(1) & (b)(1)-(15).)  The Payee understands the terms of the
transfer agreement, including those set forth in the § 10136 disclosure
statement, as required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(a)(5). In signing the
California Disclosure Statement and in his declaration and affidavit in support
of to the Petition, Payee has evidenced an understanding of the right to cancel
and election not to cancel the transfer agreement, as required by Insurance
Code § 10139.5(a)(6). 
 
Thus, Petitioner has met all the procedural requirements
under the Insurance Code. The Petitioner has also served a copy of the notice
to all interested parties and the Attorney General.  
 
Accordingly, the petition for approval of structured settlement
payments is GRANTED. This ruling is conditioned on Petitioner providing the
Payee’s full address to the Court at the hearing on this motion. 
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
