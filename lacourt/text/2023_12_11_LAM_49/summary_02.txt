The defendant is ordered to file an answer (if needed) within 21 days, and the moving party is to give notice (unless waived). The ruling is based on the parties' stipulation agreeing to apply the previous ruling on a similar demurrer and motion to strike to this case. The judge's ruling is consistent with the parties' agreement and previous order.
