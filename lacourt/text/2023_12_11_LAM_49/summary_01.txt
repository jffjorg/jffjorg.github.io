And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Michael Reyes Vettoretto (Plaintiff) and Joshua Gafni (Defendant). The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant refused to allow an inspection of the condominium unit before selling it, and is seeking damages, declaratory relief, and an injunction. The Defendant demurred to each cause of action, arguing that the Plaintiff lacks standing, that the parties are in the same relative position in each action, and that the Plaintiff's right of entry was suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Judge has overruled the Defendant's demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to maintain each cause of action. The Judge has also ordered the Defendant to file an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 10 days.
