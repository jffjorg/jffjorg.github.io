Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court tentatively rules in favor of the plaintiffs' motion to lift the stay in the McCleery case and consolidate it with the related Lunde case. The court grants the motion to consolidate the cases for all purposes, with Lunde being the lead case. The trial for the 13 previously designated Lunde plaintiffs, plus plaintiffs Timothy McCleery and Yvonne Beckner, is set for April 8, 2024. The claims of the remaining two McCleery plaintiffs, Terry Quimby and April Jackson, will remain stayed pending further order and will be tried with the remaining Lunde plaintiffs at a later date. The court finds that consolidation is warranted due to the substantial overlap of witnesses and evidence between the two cases and the likelihood of efficiencies for the parties and the court. The court also finds that the addition of only two McCleery plaintiffs to the initial trial date will not cause undue prejudice to the defendants.
