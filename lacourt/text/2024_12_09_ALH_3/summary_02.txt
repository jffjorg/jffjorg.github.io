And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a decision made by Judge William A. Crowfoot regarding a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's "person most knowledgeable" and production of documents in a case between German Perez Garcia and Andrea Martinez Negrete (Plaintiffs) and Ford Motor Company (Defendant). The case arises from the purchase of a 2022 Ford F-150 which does not conform to the warranty issued by Defendant. The Plaintiffs served a deposition notice for Defendant's "person most knowledgeable" and requested production of documents and information.

The Court grants the Plaintiffs' motion to compel in part, ordering Defendant to produce certain documents and information, including policies and procedures for authorized repair facilities, non-privileged communications with Galpin Ford Service and Sunrise Ford, and training materials for employees regarding consumer requests for vehicle repurchase. The Court also denies the Plaintiffs' motion to compel in part, rejecting requests for production of certain documents and information. The Court does not issue sanctions and the parties are advised to submit on the tentative ruling and appear at the hearing if necessary.
