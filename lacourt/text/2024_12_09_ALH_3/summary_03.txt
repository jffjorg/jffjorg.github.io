And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to reopen the trial in a case between KCB Towers, Inc. and Angeles Contractor, Inc. Angeles Contractor, Inc. is seeking to reopen the trial to introduce new evidence from three witnesses, including Daniel Martinez, Robert Roginson, and Robert Lucas. The judge has denied the motion, finding that Angeles Contractor, Inc. did not act diligently in making its request to reopen the trial.

The judge notes that Angeles Contractor, Inc. had opportunities to review the trial transcripts and prepare multiple briefs, but it only realized the importance of introducing this evidence after the proposed statement of decision was issued. The judge also finds that Angeles Contractor, Inc. failed to provide reasonable justification for failing to introduce evidence at trial and that the witnesses it is seeking to call were not previously disclosed as witnesses.

The judge rejects Angeles Contractor, Inc.'s contention that it only discovered the importance of the evidence after the proposed statement of decision was issued and that it was unable to introduce the evidence at trial due to a "hard-stop" date. The judge finds that Angeles Contractor, Inc. could have obtained the necessary documents and information earlier and that the issue of workers' compensation coverage was not "flushed out" during discovery.

The judge concludes that the motion to reopen the trial is denied and that the case will proceed as scheduled.
