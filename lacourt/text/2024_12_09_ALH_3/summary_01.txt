And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Employee Retention Benefits, Inc. v. Atlas Voluntary Benefits Financial & Insurance Solutions, Inc. and Marisol Flores. The defendants, Atlas and Marisol Flores, had filed a motion to compel further responses to a request for production, set one, and to impose sanctions in the amount of $2,860. The plaintiff, Employee Retention Benefits, Inc., had served objection-only responses and later provided "supplemental" responses.

The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's statement of compliance in response to certain requests for production is not acceptable, and that the plaintiff must provide a statement of compliance in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge has also sustained the plaintiff's objections to certain requests for production that are overly broad or vague.

The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer to agree on a date when document production will be complete, and has given them until January 31, 2025, to complete document production. If the parties are unable to agree on a date, they must be prepared to justify their positions with specific facts.

The judge has also ordered the parties to provide a joint statement, in a specific format, identifying the requests for production and the responses, and explaining why further responses are or are not necessary. The judge has concluded that the parties' requests and responses are both riddled with problems, and has ordered the parties to meet and confer to resolve the issues raised by the motion.
