And here is the summary in English text:

On June 25, 2024, the court issued a tentative ruling in the case of PC048948, a claim of exemption hearing. The case involves a judgment debt of $32,607.94 owed by defendant Gordon C. Greene to plaintiff Citibank, N.A. The defendant has filed a claim of exemption, claiming that certain property is exempt from execution. The plaintiff has opposed the claim, seeking proof of the defendant's income and expenses.

The court has determined that it does not have sufficient evidence to make a determination on the defendant's claim of exemption. As a result, the hearing will be continued. The defendant is ordered to file and serve evidence regarding his gross monthly income, payroll deductions, other money he receives each month from personal training, and actual monthly rent or house payment and maintenance expenses. The defendant must also explain why his wife and adult son do not contribute to the family's monthly income. The court has also requested further information regarding any accounts the defendant may hold at Logix. The defendant must file and serve this evidence at least 16 court days before the continued hearing date.
