Aliaskari, and Edgardo Vanegas 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff James Kaldawi
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order enforcing
the arbitration agreement entered into by Plaintiff James Kaldawi and
compelling binding arbitration of this matter. 

 

RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of an employment dispute between
Plaintiff James Kaldawi (Plaintiff) and Defendant Mass Automotive Group LLC dba
Nissan of Mission Hills (Nissan).  On 5/15/21,
Plaintiff executed an Applicant’s Statement and Agreement and on 5/18/21,
Plaintiff signed an Employee Acknowledgement and Agreement which contains an
arbitration provision.  (Ayala Decl.,
Ex.A, B).  
 
On 3/28/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Nissan,
Tom Awada (Awada), Fariborz David Massoudi (Massoudi), Shahryar Aliaskari
erroneously sued as Shahiriar Alo Shari (Aliaskari), and Edgar Venegas
(Venegas) (collectively, Defendants) for: (1) Wrongful Termination Due to
Employment Discrimination Based on Again in Violation of Government Code 12940,
et seq.; (2) Wrongful/Tortious Termination in Violation of Public Policy
Protecting Persons from Age Discrimination; (3) Employment Discrimination Based
on Medical Condition in Violation of Government Code 12940(a), et seq.; (4)
Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy Protecting Employees from
Discrimination Based on Medical Condition; (5) Harassment in the Workplace in
Violation of Government Code 12940(j), et seq.; (6) Breach of Implied Contract
or Continued Employment; (7) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing; (8) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and (9) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress.   
 
On 6/6/23, Defendants filed and served a prior motion to
compel arbitration which was set for hearing on 10/6/23 based on the 5/15/21
agreement.  In opposition to that motion,
Plaintiff denied electronically signing the agreement.  Defendants’ counsel then discovered another
arbitration agreement signed by Plaintiff on 5/18/21.  On 9/28/23, Defendants withdrew their prior
motion to give the parties additional time to meet and confer regarding
arbitration.  
 
On 10/4/23, Defendants’ counsel advised Plaintiff’s
counsel about the additional arbitration agreement.  (Javier Decl. ¶3, Ex.2).  Having received no response, on 10/16/23,
Defendants’ counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel regarding whether Plaintiff
would agree to arbitrate this dispute.  (Id.
¶4, Ex.3).  Again, no response was
received.  (Id. ¶5).  Therefore, on 11/30/23, Defendants filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order enforcing the arbitration agreement
entered into by Plaintiff and compelling binding arbitration of this matter.  Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise
responded to the instant motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The arbitration provision in the Employee Acknowledgement
and Agreement, signed by Plaintiff on 5/18/21, covers all disputes which may
arise out of the employment context.  (Ayala
Decl., Ex.A).  Here, all of Plaintiff’s
claims arise out of his employment with Nissan. 
(See Complaint).
 
The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs arbitration
agreements when the agreements “evidence a transaction involving
commerce.”  9 U.S.C. §2; Circuit City
Stores, Inc. (2001) 532 U.S. 105, 111-119. 
As long as a company purchases out of state materials and/or engages in
any interstate commerce, the FAA preempts state law.  Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. (1995) 513
U.S. 265, 282; Basura (2002) 98 CA4th 1205, 1214.  
 
Nissan’s business bears on interstate commerce through
the selling of automobiles purchased in interstate commerce to customers, some
of whom are from out of state; through the purchase and sale of
automotive-related supplies; through the use of various financial and insurance
instruments as part of the automobile dealership business; through nationwide
and international marketing, etc.  (See
Ayala Decl. ¶4).  Therefore, the arbitration
agreement between Plaintiff and Nissan falls within the FAA.  See Scott (2016) 248 CA4th 392,
402.  The arbitration agreement itself
provides that the signatories “agree that the arbitration and this Agreement
shall be controlled by the Federal Arbitration Act.”  (Ayala Decl. ¶8, Ex.A).  
 
The FAA creates a general presumption in favor of
arbitration and requires enforcement of a written arbitration agreement.  9 U.S.C. §2; AT&T Mobility LLC
(2011) 563 U.S. 333, 347, n.6; Gilmer (1991) 500 U.S. 20, 26; AT&T
Technologies, Inc. (1986) 475 U.S. 643, 650.  Courts consistently uphold arbitration
agreements in employment related disputes. 
See Circuit City Stores, Inc., supra; EEOC
(9th Cir. 2003) 345 F.3d 742. 
A party seeking to compel arbitration under the FAA need only provide a
copy of the agreement or recite its terms in the petition/motion to compel
arbitration.  Condee (2001) 88
CA4th 215, 218-219; CRC 3.1330.  The
opposing party has the burden to prove the agreement is invalid.  Green Tree Financial Corp. (2000) 531
U.S. 79, 91-92.  
 
Defendants have met their burden by providing a copy of
the arbitration agreement signed by Plaintiff. 
(Ayala Decl. ¶8, Ex.A).  The
non-signatory, individual defendants, can also enforce the arbitration
agreement as third-party beneficiaries.  Comer
(9th Cir. 2006) 436 F.3d 1098, 1101. 
The agreement expressly provides: 
 
“I and the Company both agree that
any claim, dispute, and/or controversy that either party may have against one
another . . . which would otherwise require or allow resort to any court or
other governmental dispute resolution forum between myself and the Company (or
its owners, directors, officers, managers, employees, agents, and parties
affiliated with its employee benefit and health 
plans) . . . 
 
(Ayala Decl., Ex.A)
 
Awada is a current director/officer of Nissan, Massoudi
is a current owner of Nissan, Vanegas is a current employee of Nissan and Aliaskari
is a former employee of Nissan.  (Ayala
Decl. ¶5).  
 
The subject arbitration agreement is also enforceable
under California law.  Under the
California Arbitration Act, a court must compel arbitration of any controversy
covered by the terms of a written to arbitration agreement, except under
limited exceptions, none of which have been shown to exist here.  See CCP 1281.2.  California also has a strong policy favoring
arbitration.  See United
Transportation Union (1992) 7 CA4th 804, 808; Bayscene Resident
Negotiators (1993) 15 CA4th 119, 127. 
California courts have also liberally held that arbitration agreements
encompass actions of any type arising out of an employment relationship.  See Vianna (1994) 27 CA4th
1186, 1190; Writers Guild of America, West, Inc. (1982) 130 CA3d 212,
219.
 
Under California law, Plaintiff also bears the burden of
establishing that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable.  See Armendariz (2000) 24 C4th
83, 114;  Crippen (2004) 124 CA4th
1159,1165.   In California, in order for
a court to refuse to enforce an arbitration contract/clause under the doctrine
of unconscionability, the agreement must be procedurally and substantively
unconscionable.  Armendariz, supra.
 
In California, arbitration agreements arising out of
employment relationships must meet the following requirements: neutrality of
the arbitrator, the provision of adequate discovery, a written decision that
will permit a limited form of judicial review, and limitations on the cost of
arbitration.  Armendariz, supra
103-105,  107, 111-112.  Here, the arbitration agreement meets all of
the necessary requirements and Nissan has agreed to pay all costs associated
with arbitration.  (Ayala Decl. ¶¶8, 10,
Ex.A).  Moreover, Plaintiff has not
opposed the motion and, therefore, has not made any showing of
unconscionability.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
This action is stayed pending the completion of the arbitration.  CCP 1281.4.
