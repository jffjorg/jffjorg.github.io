And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings pending arbitration. The plaintiff, James Kaldawi, executed an arbitration agreement with Mass Automotive Group LLC dba Nissan of Mission Hills on May 18, 2021, which covers all disputes arising out of his employment with Nissan. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and California law, and that the defendants have met their burden of showing that the agreement is valid and enforceable. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement meets the requirements of the California Arbitration Act, including neutrality of the arbitrator, adequate discovery, a written decision, and limitations on the cost of arbitration. The plaintiff has not opposed the motion and has not made any showing of unconscionability. Therefore, the court grants the motion and stays the proceedings pending the completion of the arbitration.
