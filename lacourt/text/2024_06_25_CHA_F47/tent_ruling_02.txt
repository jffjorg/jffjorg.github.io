Case #PC048948
 
HEARING ON
CLAIM OF EXEMPTION
 
Notice of Hearing filed 5/22/24.
 
JUDGMENT CREDITOR: Plaintiff Citibank, N.A.
JUDGMENT DEBTOR: Defendant Gordon C. Greene
 
RULING: The hearing will be continued.  
 
On 10/10/12, judgment was entered against Defendant
Gordon C. Greene and in favor of Plaintiff Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. in the
amount of $27,713.84.  On 7/22/22, the
judgment was renewed in the amount of $32,567.94.  On 1/24/24, a Writ of Execution was issued in
the amount of $32,607.94.
 
On 5/22/94, Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of
Hearing on Claim of Exemption and Notice of Opposition to Claim of
Exemption.  On 5/29/24, Defendant filed a
Claim of Exemption wherein Defendant states that the property he claims to be
exempt is “Bank accounts, wages, Logix” pursuant to CCP 704.220 and Defendant’s
Financial Statement.  In the supporting
Financial Statement, Defendant indicates that his and his family’s total
monthly expenses exceed Defendant’s total monthly income.  
 
In the opposition to the claim of exemption, Plaintiff seeks
proof of Defendant’s claimed monthly gross income, payroll
deductions, other money Defendant receives each month from personal training,
and actual monthly rent or house payment and maintenance expenses.  Plaintiff indicates that it is willing to
accept the applicable rate of net earnings under CCP 706.050 per pay period
from Defendant by way of payment installment, until the balance owing is paid
in full.  

 
As the exemption claimant, Defendant has the burden of
proof at the hearing.  CCP 703.580.  It is not entirely clear what property
Defendant is claiming is exempt as he provides no evidence from his monthly
wages as an actor or personal trainer. 
Additionally, Defendant has generically stated “bank accounts” as
property which is exempt, but also mentions “Logix.”  (See Claim of Exemption, .p1,
No.4).  However, Defendant does not list
Logix as one of the banks/financial institutions where he has an account.  (See Financial Statement, p.1, No.3.b).  As such, it is not clear how much money
Defendant has in a Logix account.  The Sheriff’s
Department is not holding any personal property of Defendant at this time.  (See Claim of Exemption, pdf p.5).
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court does not have
sufficient evidence to make a determination as to Defendant’s claim of
exemption.  Therefore, the hearing will
be continued.  CCP 703.580(c).  Defendant is ordered to file and serve evidence
regarding his gross monthly income, payroll deductions, other money Defendant
receives each month from personal training, and actual monthly rent or house
payment and maintenance expenses.  Additionally,
Defendant is to file and serve evidence regarding any account he holds at Logix.  Also, Defendant must explain why his wife and
adult son (21 years old/college student) do not/cannot contribute to the
family’s monthly income.  Further,
Defendant is to explain why Plaintiff is not entitled to levy amounts pursuant
to CCP 706.050.
 
Such evidence and explanation must be filed and served at
least 16 court days before the continued hearing date.  Plaintiff may file and serve a response to
this additional evidence within 5 court days of the continued hearing
date.  The foregoing additional evidence
and response must be served pursuant to CCP 1005(c).
