  Case Number:  22AHCV01269    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT EMMAUS’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO CONDUCT MENTAL
EXAMINATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS I.        INTRODUCTION
This action arises from claims of (1) sexual assault,
(2) negligence, and (3) negligent failure to educate, train, or warn, brought
by Plaintiffs JANE M.A.T. DOE and JANE M.I.G. DOE (“Plaintiffs”) against
Defendants DEFENDANT DOE 1, DEFENDANT DOE 2, and DOES 3 through 100, inclusive.
Plaintiffs initiated this action on December 29, 2022, alleging harm stemming
from sexual abuse they endured as minors.
On October 30, 2024, Defendant Doe 1 (“Emmaus”)
filed a motion for leave to conduct mental examinations of Plaintiffs. On
November 11, 2024, Plaintiffs opposed the motion, and on November 19, 2024,
Emmaus filed its reply.
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
 Pursuant to CCP § 2024.020, "except as
otherwise provided in this section, any party shall be entitled as a matter of
right … to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day
before the date initially set for the trial of the action. A continuance or
postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen discovery
proceedings." When the hearing for a discovery motion is held after the
discovery motion hearing cut-off date, the Court cannot grant a motion to
compel without first deciding on a motion to reopen discovery (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568,
1588.)
“The
purpose of imposing a time limit on discovery is to expedite and facilitate
trial preparation and to prevent delay.¿ Without a cutoff date, the parties
could tie up each other and the trial court in discovery and discovery disputes
right up to the eve of trial or beyond. Furthermore, . . . to be effective the
cutoff date must be firm or some litigants will manipulate the proceedings to
avoid the cut-off date.”¿ (Beverly Hosp. v. Superior Court¿(1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 1289, 1295.)  The reopening of discovery is a matter that is
committed to the trial court’s sound discretion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.050(a), (b).)¿ In exercising that discretion, the trial court considers
“any matter relevant to the leave requested,” including:¿ 
          (1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery.¿ 
 (2)
The diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the
hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not
completed or that the discovery motion was not heard earlier.¿ 
 
(3)
Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery motion
will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise
interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any other
party.¿ 
(4)
The length of time that has elapsed between any date previously set, and the
date presently set, for the trial of the action.¿ 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.050(b).)¿ 
          A motion to reopen discovery pursuant to CCP section
2024.050 must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating a
good faith effort at informal resolution.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.050(a).) 
III.     ANALYSIS
          Emmaus files the instant motion for leave to conduct mental
examinations of Plaintiffs JANE M.A.T DOE and JANE M.I.G DOE pursuant to CCP §§
2032.310 and 2032.320. Emmaus asserts that the mental conditions of each
plaintiff are in controversy in this action, and as a result, Emmaus must be
allowed to conduct appropriate discovery into these claims by obtaining mental
examinations conducted by their retained psychologist, Dr. Veronica Thomas.
Emmaus maintains they have good cause for the examinations to proceed because
the allegations of emotional distress place Plaintiffs mental health directly
at issue.
Plaintiffs
oppose the motion, raising two main arguments: (1) the motion is untimely, and
(2) Emmaus is not entitled to inquire into Plaintiffs’ sexual histories beyond
what pertains to the alleged perpetrator in this case. Upon review, the Court
finds that the issue of timeliness is dispositive and will address this
argument.
Plaintiffs
argue that the motion is untimely because it was filed after the non-expert
discovery cut-off, which occurred 30 days before the original trial date of
November 12, 2024, under CCP § 2024.020(a). They contend that mental health
examinations are governed by CCP § 2032 and constitute non-expert discovery.
Plaintiffs highlight that trial continuances do not automatically extend
discovery deadlines under CCP § 2024.020(b) and note that Emmaus failed to file
a motion to reopen discovery as required by CCP § 2024.050 (Opposition at pp.
2–4).
In
response, Emmaus asserts that the mental health examinations sought fall under
expert testimony. Alternatively, Emmaus argues that the Court has discretion
under CCP § 2024.050 to allow the examinations to proceed despite their timing.
Emmaus also claims to have made good-faith efforts to stipulate to the
examinations (Reply, pp.3-4)
The
Court finds that the applicable cut-off date for mental health examinations is
30 days before the originally set trial date, as outlined in CCP § 2024.020(a).
Accordingly, the non-expert discovery cut-off in this case was October 13,
2024, based on the original trial date of November 12, 2024. The mental health
examinations sought by Emmaus fall under CCP § 2032, and thus the discovery
deadline for these examinations has passed. Even if the 15-day expert discovery
cut-off under CCP § 2024.030 were applicable, the motion would still be
untimely as it was filed on October 30, 2024, two days after that deadline. The
mental health examinations sought by Emmaus fall under CCP § 2032, and thus the
discovery deadline for these examinations has passed.
Pursuant
to CCP § 2024.050, Emmaus must file a motion to reopen discovery if additional
discovery is sought after the statutory cut-off. Without such a motion, the
Court lacks a statutory basis to evaluate whether good cause exists to allow
the examinations after the cut-off (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v.
Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1578). Emmaus
has not complied with the procedural requirements of CCP § 2024.050 by failing
to file a motion to reopen discovery. 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Emmaus motion for leave to conduct mental
examinations of Plaintiffs without prejudice. Should Emmaus wish to pursue the
examinations, Emmaus must submit a proper motion to reopen discovery which
would allow the Court to address whether good cause exists to permit the
examinations at this stage of proceedings. 
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          The Court DENIES Emmaus motion for leave to conduct mental
examinations of Plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs
are to give notice.
