And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Emmaus's motion for leave to conduct mental examinations of Plaintiffs JANE M.A.T. DOE and JANE M.I.G. DOE. The motion was filed on October 30, 2024, after the non-expert discovery cut-off date of October 13, 2024, and Emmaus failed to file a motion to reopen discovery as required by CCP § 2024.050. The court finds that the mental health examinations sought by Emmaus fall under CCP § 2032 and are governed by the non-expert discovery cut-off date. The court denied Emmaus's motion without prejudice, meaning that Emmaus may re-file the motion if it can demonstrate good cause for the examinations and comply with the procedural requirements of CCP § 2024.050.
