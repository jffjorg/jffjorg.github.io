 Case Number:  23AHCV02451    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS - SET ONE and MONETARY
SANCTIONS I.         INTRODUCTION
            This is a
personal injury action arising from a motor vehicle collision involving
plaintiffs Robert James Ruiz, Michael Meza, a minor by and through his guardian
ad litem, Alicia Aragon, Aniela Ruiz, a minor by and through her guardian ad
litem, Robert Ruiz Jr., Sarina Ruiz, a minor by and through her guardian ad
litem, Robert Ruiz Jr. and Amara Ruiz, a minor by and through her guardian ad
litem, Robert Ruiz Jr. (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), against defendants Rafael
Heraldez; Pactrack Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC,  Amazon
Logistics, Inc., and Does 1 to 100, inclusive.
Plaintiffs allege that on October
25, 2021, defendant Rafael Heraldez, while acting within the course and scope
of his employment with defendant Pactrack Inc., failed to stop at a stop sign
and collided with Plaintiffs vehicle, causing severe and lasting injuries.
Plaintiffs bring this action to recover damages related to those injuries.
On October 10, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion to compel Defendant Pactrack Inc. (“Defendant”) to
produce documents responsive to Plaintiffs Request for Production of Documents
- Set One. Defendant filed a late Opposition on November 22, 2024.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
            A party
must respond to interrogatories and requests for production of documents within
30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including one
based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for
a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or production of documents
other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)
 
III.      ANALYSIS
            Plaintiffs
move for an order compelling Defendant Pactrack Inc. to produce documents
responsive to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production of Documents - Set One,
specifically Request Nos. 9, 19, 26, 28, 31, and 32. These requests seek
critical documents, including insurance coverage information (Request No. 9),
photographs and videos of individuals involved (Request No. 19), evidence of
Defendant Heraldez’s employment status and scope at the time of the incident
(Requests Nos. 26 and 31), Heraldez’s driving history (Request No. 28), and the
relationship between Defendant Pactrack and Heraldez (Request No. 32).
Defendant has failed to produce
documents responsive to Request for Production of Documents Set One, served on
April 23, 2024. (Malek Decl. ¶ 4.) While Defendant provided verified responses
on June 18, 2024, these responses included commitments to produce responsive
documents, yet no documents were provided. (Malek Decl. ¶¶ 7, 10.)  On July 12, 2024, Plaintiffs sent detailed
meet and confer letters identifying deficiencies in Defendant’s responses and
requesting a reply by July 19, 2024. (Malek Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiffs
subsequently granted Defendant several extensions to respond, but Defendant
failed to remedy its deficient production. (Malek Decl., ¶¶ 9–15.)
On August 28, 2024, the parties met
and conferred on the phone, but Defendant’s counsel was unprepared to address
the deficiencies. Defendant served second supplemental responses on September
26, 2024, but these were unverified and failed to resolve the identified
issues. (Malek Decl., ¶¶ 14–17.) Under California law, failure to verify
responses is equivalent to providing no response. (Appleton v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
Despite multiple meet and confer
efforts and numerous extensions, Defendant has failed to comply with its
discovery obligations. To date, Defendant has not produced any documents
responsive to Plaintiffs Request for Production Nos. 9, 19, 26, 28, 31, and 32.
(Malek Decl., ¶ 18.)
Defendant has filed an opposition,
while late, on November 22, 2024, and has conceded to the motion to compel.
Defendant argues that the failure to provide timely responses and documents was
due to mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(b). Defendant’s counsel contends that errors, including
the failure of staff to properly calendar the motion and upload documents to
the case file, resulted in the oversight. (Natoli Decl., ¶¶ 4–7.)
Defendant further asserts that it
has now remedied these issues by providing verifications for prior responses
and producing all responsive documents within its custody or control by
November 22, 2024. (Natoli Decl., ¶¶ 9–14.) While the Court acknowledges these
remedial efforts, they are not yet completed and occurred only after Plaintiffs
were compelled to file this motion.
Therefore, the Court grants the
motion to compel.
 
Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a), authorizes the Court to impose a monetary sanction
for misuse of the discovery process, requiring the offending party, or their
attorney, to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by the opposing party,
including attorney’s fees. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the Court must impose that sanction unless it finds
that the offending party acted with substantial justification or that the
imposition of the sanction would be unjust. However, Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) permits the
court to relieve a party or its counsel from the consequences of procedural
missteps due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, provided
the errors are promptly addressed.
Here, Plaintiffs request monetary
sanctions in the amount of $6,213.51, encompassing fees and costs related to
the preparation of three motions, multiple meet and confer efforts, and
anticipated responses to opposition briefs. Plaintiffs seek sanctions jointly
and severally against Defendants Pactrack Inc., Rafael Heraldez, Defendant’s
counsel of record, and Defendant’s law firm of record, Kahana & Feld LLP,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030(a).
Plaintiffs’ requested amount
includes reviewing initial discovery responses, drafting four meet and confer
letters, conducting telephonic conferences, reviewing supplemental responses,
preparing the instant declaration, and preparing motions and supporting
documents. Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate is $450/hour, and Plaintiffs also
claim $206.73 in filing costs, with additional anticipated costs for
oppositions and reply briefs.
Defendant argues that the failure
to provide timely verifications and documents was the result of excusable
neglect rather than intentional misconduct. Defense counsel admits that
internal errors, including the mishandling of deadlines by former staff members,
led to the oversight. (Declaration of Noelle M. Natoli, ¶¶ 4–5.) Specifically,
defense counsel states that the motion to compel was not properly calendared or
uploaded to the file, and the attorney responsible for managing these
obligations, Mr. Yen, was no longer employed at the firm. (Natoli Decl., ¶¶
3–5.)
Upon discovering the deficiencies
on November 20, 2024, defense counsel took immediate steps to rectify the
situation by serving verifications, meeting with the client to locate
additional documents, and filing a late opposition to the motion. (Natoli Decl.,
¶¶ 6–7.) Defense counsel has also apologized to the court and opposing counsel,
emphasizing that these errors were unintentional and have since been addressed.
While the Court acknowledges
defense counsel’s efforts to remedy the deficiencies, and the explanation of
excusable neglect under section 473(b), the court finds that Plaintiffs were
nonetheless forced to file this motion due to Defendant’s initial noncompliance.
Plaintiffs incurred unnecessary costs in preparing and filing the motion, as
well as engaging in meet and confer efforts that could have been avoided had
Defendant acted in a timely manner. 
Given the above, the Court finds
that Defendant’s conduct constitutes a misuse of the discovery process but
mitigates the severity of sanctions in light of defense counsel’s explanation
and remedial efforts. 
For the instant motion, the court
finds that $450/hour is a reasonable hourly rate but reduces the time allocated
to reflect the scope of this motion. The court allocates one hour for
preparation of this motion, one hour for meet and confer efforts related to
this motion, and a filing fee of $68.91.
Based on the foregoing, the Court
awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $968.91, consisting of $900 for
attorneys’ fees (2 hours at $450/hour) and $68.91 for the filing fee. 
These sanctions are imposed against Defendant Pactrack
Inc.’s counsel of record and their law firm, Kahana & Feld LLP, jointly and
severally,
 
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            The Court
GRANTS Plaintiffs motion to compel and orders monetary sanctions in the sum of $968.91.
Defendant is ordered to provide
documents and pay sanctions within 20 days of this order.
