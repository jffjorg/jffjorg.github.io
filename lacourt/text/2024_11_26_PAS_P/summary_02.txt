And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Pactrack Inc. to produce documents responsive to discovery requests. The plaintiff's motion was filed after Defendant failed to provide timely responses to discovery requests, despite multiple meet and confer efforts and extensions. The judge found that Defendant's conduct constituted a misuse of the discovery process, but mitigated the severity of sanctions in light of defense counsel's explanation and remedial efforts.

The judge awarded monetary sanctions in the amount of $968.91, consisting of $900 for attorneys' fees and $68.91 for the filing fee. The sanctions are imposed against Defendant Pactrack Inc.'s counsel of record and their law firm, Kahana & Feld LLP, jointly and severally.

The judge ordered Defendant to provide documents and pay sanctions within 20 days of the order.
