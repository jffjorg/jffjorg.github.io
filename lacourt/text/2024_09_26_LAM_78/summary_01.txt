And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the motion to compel non-party production filed by Force Protection Agency (FPA). FPA sought to compel its prior counsel, Cole Sheridan, to produce his entire client file. However, FPA's counsel only informally requested Mr. Sheridan to produce his file, without serving a deposition subpoena. The judge found that FPA failed to provide legal support for compelling production of a non-party based solely on professional conduct rules, and that there is no evidence that Mr. Sheridan was served with the motion. As a result, the motion is denied.
