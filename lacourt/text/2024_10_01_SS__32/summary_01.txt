And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion for leave to intervene filed by Everest National Insurance Company, which insured Jonathan Alexander Almache, a defendant in the case. The motion is in response to Almache's failure to participate in the defense of the case, which Everest believes could result in discovery sanctions or an order deeming facts admitted. The Judge grants the motion, finding that Everest has a direct and immediate interest in the case, the intervention will not enlarge the issues in the case, and the parties would not be prejudiced.
