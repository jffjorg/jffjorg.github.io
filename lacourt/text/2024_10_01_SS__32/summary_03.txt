And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to continue trial and all related dates filed by the defendants, Eshagh Neman, Simin Neman, and Dorin Realty Company, Inc. The defendants had requested a continuance to February 3, 2025, citing the need to prepare for trial and the discovery of a new fire sprinkler company that they claim is primarily liable for the damages in the case. However, the judge found that the defendants did not provide sufficient good cause to justify a continuance, especially since the court has not yet ruled on the merits of the October 8, 2024 motions. The judge also noted that the defendants' counsel had filed motions to be relieved as counsel, which would be heard before trial, and that the court had not reached the merits of these motions. Therefore, the judge denied the motion to continue trial and all related dates.
