And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel Defendant Tyrell Edward Pate to attend a deposition. The deposition was scheduled for May 29, 2024, but Pate failed to appear. The plaintiff, Claudia Yareli Carrasco, has tried to meet and confer with Pate's counsel to propose solutions for his non-appearance, but has been unresponsive. The judge notes that Pate is a percipient witness to the accident and his testimony appears relevant. However, the plaintiff has not provided a copy of the objection served by Pate's counsel, and therefore cannot determine if the objection had merit. As a result, the motion to compel is denied. The judge encourages the parties to meaningfully meet and confer to find a solution for Pate's non-participation in the case.
