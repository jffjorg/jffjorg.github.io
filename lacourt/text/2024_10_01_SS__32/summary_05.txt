And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion of Defendants Jardiel Ochoa and Melissa Rosann Diazochoa to compel Plaintiff Shontia Johnson to submit to a physical examination with Dr. Deven Khosla on October 15, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. The Plaintiff failed to appear for a previously scheduled examination and did not respond to the Defendants' offer of new dates. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the demand for a physical examination warrants the granting of the motion to compel.

The Court also awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $800.25 against the Plaintiff and her counsel, which represents 1.5 hours of attorney time, the $500 no-show fee, and the $60 filing fee. The Plaintiff and her counsel are ordered to pay this amount within 30 days.
