And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. and Danny Alberto against Jarame Smith. The motion is unopposed. The proposed cross-complaint alleges that Jarame Smith was responsible for the accident and seeks equitable indemnity, equitable contribution, and declaratory relief. The judge finds that the cross-complaint arises out of the same occurrence as the original complaint and grants leave to file the cross-complaint in the interest of justice. The defendants are ordered to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.
