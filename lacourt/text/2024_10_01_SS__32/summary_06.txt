And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses three motions to compel filed by the defendant, Kate McCaslin, against the plaintiff, Tara Rogachefsky. The motions seek to compel responses to supplemental requests for production of documents and interrogatories. The defendant asserts that the plaintiff has failed to serve responses to these requests, despite multiple attempts. The court grants the motions to compel and orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses within 20 days. The court also awards monetary sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $967.50, which is reduced from the defendant's requested amount of $535 per motion.
