And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion for terminating sanctions filed by Cross-Defendant Pink Sparrow Scenic Ltd. against Plaintiff Amanda Pham. Pink Sparrow is seeking terminating sanctions for Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders, including failing to respond to discovery requests and not paying monetary sanctions. The court notes that Pink Sparrow is not a defendant in the action, but rather a cross-complainant and cross-defendant, and therefore cannot dismiss Plaintiff's action against it. As a result, the motion for terminating sanctions is denied. The court also declines to award additional monetary sanctions.
