 Case Number:  20STCV10091    Hearing Date:   October 9, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  10/09/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV10091 JING WANG, et al. vs CHIA JUNG AKA LISA CHOU, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  Chia Jung Chou aka Lisa Chou; and Jesus Guillermo Orozco erroneously sued as Jesus Orozco RECOMMENDATION:   DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  Plaintiffs obtained Defendants Chia Jung Chou and Jesus Guillermo Orozco, erroneously sued as Jesus Orozco, (“Defendants”) default on May 19, 2022. One day later, Defendants filed their Answer on May 20, 2022.   However, entry of default cuts off a party’s right to appear in the action, including by filing pleadings, until default is set aside. (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-86.) “A defendant against whom a default has been entered is out of court and is not entitled to take any further steps in the cause affecting plaintiff's right of action; he cannot thereafter, until such default is set aside in a proper proceeding, file pleadings or move for a new trial or demand notice of subsequent proceedings.” (Brooks v. Nelson (1928) 95 Cal.App. 144, 147–148.)   Defendants have not moved to set aside default, and therefore the default against Defendants still stands.   In the Court’s previous rejection, the Court requested further evidence to support the amount requested, in the form of comparable judgments and other evidence regarding current generally accepted economic calculations regarding the value of life. (Min. Order, May 11, 2023.) On September 7, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a brief in support of default judgment.   However, the request for default judgment submitted on September 7, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  Plaintiffs’ CIV-100, JUD-100, and declarations make it unclear the amount of damages actually sought against Defendants.   Form CIV-100 seeks general damages of $40 million against Defendants, jointly and severally.  However, both declarations of Plaintiffs request the Court grant judgment jointly and severally against Defendants for $20 million in general damages, and costs in the amount of $4,383.32. This would mean that, if jointly and severally liable, Plaintiffs are seeking $10 million against each Defendant in general damages. Plaintiffs’ JUD-100, Item 6(a)(1), appears to support this request that the total general damages sought against both Defendants, jointly and severally, is $20 million and not $40 million as stated in CIV-100.   If Plaintiffs are actually seeking general damages of $20 million total against both Defendants, jointly and severally, then Plaintiffs must correct form CIV-100 to reflect the same. If Plaintiffs are seeking a different amount, then Plaintiffs must ensure CIV-100, JUD-100, and Plaintiffs’ declarations are consistent in the amount sought.   No later than _________________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects.  Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ___________________.  Clerk is to give notice.
