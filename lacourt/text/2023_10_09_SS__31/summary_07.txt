And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling granting a motion to compel further responses from a defendant in a personal injury lawsuit. The plaintiff, Margaret Duran, sought to compel the defendant, Wilson Abelyan and Vahe Termirzavants, to provide further responses to requests for production of documents and form interrogatories. The defendant opposed the motion, but the court found that the plaintiff had made a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the issues through informal discovery conferences. The court granted the motion and ordered the defendant to provide further responses within 20 days. The court also imposed sanctions on the defendant and its counsel, requiring them to pay the plaintiff's attorney's fees and costs.

The court's decision is based on the California Civil Procedure Code and the California Rules of Court. The court found that the plaintiff had complied with the procedural requirements for making a motion to compel further responses, including serving a meet and confer declaration and attending informal discovery conferences. The court also found that the defendant had not provided adequate responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, which was the basis for the motion to compel further responses.
