And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is that the request for default judgment against Chia Jung Chou aka Lisa Chou, et al. (Jesus Guillermo Orozco) is DENIED. The default against the defendants still stands, as they have not moved to set it aside. The Court requested further evidence to support the amount requested, but the recent brief filed by Plaintiffs' counsel does not clarify the amount of damages sought. The Court finds that the form CIV-100 and the declarations of Plaintiffs make it unclear whether they are seeking $40 million or $20 million in general damages. The Court orders the Plaintiffs to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects by a certain date, and failure to do so may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
