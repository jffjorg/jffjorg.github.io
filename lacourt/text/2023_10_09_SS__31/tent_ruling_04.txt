Background Defendant Apex Mechanical Services, Inc. (“Apex”) moves to consolidate Case Nos. 21STCV12326, 21STCV22180, 21STCV23203, 21STCV23173, 21STCV25523, and 21STCV24684 contending that the six cases arise from the same event of a roof collapse on July 15, 2019 at Larry Flynt’s Lucky Lady Casino. Defendant Casino LLC (“Casino”) joins the motion to consolidate. Apex avers each Plaintiff in each case alleges he or she suffered personal injuries arising from the same event. Case Nos. 21STCV12326 (lead case), 21STCV22180, 21STCV23203, 21STCV23173, and 21STCV25523 have been deemed related and are pending in Department 31.  (Min.

Legal Standard CCP § 1048 grants discretion to the trial courts to consolidate actions involving common questions of law or fact.  A consolidation of actions does not affect the rights of the parties.  The purpose of consolidation is to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, avoid duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both action, and avoid inconsistent results by hearing and deciding common issues together.  (See Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.)  Each case presents its own facts and circumstances, but the court generally considers the following: (1) timeliness of the motion: i.e., whether granting consolidation would delay the trial of any of the cases involved; (2) complexity: i.e., whether joining the actions involved would make the trial too confusing or complex for a jury; and (3) prejudice: i.e, whether consolidation would adversely affect the rights of any party. (See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d 428, 430–431.)   Consolidation is not a matter of right; it rests solely within the sound discretion of the trial judge. (Fisher v. Nash Bldg. Co.¿(1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 397, 402.)¿ Actions may be thoroughly “related” in the sense of having common questions of law or fact, and still not be “consolidated,” if the trial court, in the sound exercise of its discretion, chooses not to do so.¿ (Askew v. Askew¿(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 942, 964.)¿ It is not abuse of discretion to deny motion for consolidation of actions where parties in each action are different or issues are different.¿ (See¿Muller v. Robinson¿(1959) 174 Cal App 2d 511, 515.)¿ On the other hand, actions may be consolidated in the discretion of the trial court whenever it can be done without prejudice to a substantial right.¿ (Carpenson¿v.¿Najarian¿(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 856, 862.)  IV. Discussion Roessler opposes the motion on the grounds that it is a party only in the Dyer Action, and Roessler therefore objects to being forced to share a trial date with the other cases. Roessler avers that its involvement with the incident was to perform structural engineering work regarding the replacement of the HVAC systems, which concluded before the incident. On the date of the incident, the property was undergoing a remodeling project. On July 15, 2019, part of the ceiling collapsed. Roessler argues it will suffer costs, delay, and due process issues if the cases are consolidated. The crux of Roessler’ arguments is that it is a party only to the Dyer Action, and is not a party to the Luu, Martinez, Richardson, Dunn, or Phillip Action. However, contrary to Roessler’s assertion that it is involved only in the Dyer Action, the Court’s review of the docket finds that Roessler is additionally a defendant/cross-defendant to the Martinez Action, and a cross-defendant to the Luu and Dunn Actions. Out of the five related actions, and the sixth action pending in the same department, Roessler is involved as a party in four out of the six actions. Accordingly, Roessler’s proposal of consolidating all actions for trial purposes, but leaving the Dyer Action as a separate trial premised upon the factually incorrect assertion that it is involved in only the Dyer Action, is without merit.  Apex and Casino contend that each Plaintiff alleges injury from the same roof collapse at the subject property, and each assert a negligence cause of action and assert the same legal theories. Apex and Casino further argue that the complexity of the causation and mechanics of the collapse will require a number of experts, and that these issues are common to all four actions in which Roessler is involved in, such that Defendants/Cross-Defendants should not have to repeat costly efforts four separate times. Apex and Casino aver that consolidation will serve to promote unnecessary duplication of financial resources, duplicative discovery requests, and duplicative depositions.  The Court agrees. The Court finds that there are common questions of law and fact, as all six cases arise out of the same roof collapse accident and concern the same set of circumstances under the same legal theories. Consolidation would thus promote trial convenience and economy. Moreover, the Court finds that the motion complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.350(a).   The motion is GRANTED. The Court sets the consolidated cases for trial on ______________, at 8:30 a.m. in Dept. 31. The FSC in the consolidated cases is set for ________________, at 10:00 a.m. in Dept. 31.  All hearing dates in 21STCV22180, 21STCV23203, 21STCV23173, 21STCV25523, and 21STCV24684 are vacated.  The parties must reschedule any hearings in 21STCV22180, 21STCV23203, 21STCV23173, 21STCV25523, and 21STCV24684 for hearing in 21STCV12326.  All future papers must be filed in 21STCV12326 only and all future hearings must be scheduled in 21STCV12326 only.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.  PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 6th day of October 2023      Hon.
