And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate six related cases arising from a roof collapse at Larry Flynt's Lucky Lady Casino. The cases were filed by six different plaintiffs, each alleging personal injuries from the same event. The defendants, including Flynt Management Group, LLC and Apex Mechanical Services, Inc., argue that the cases should be consolidated to avoid unnecessary costs and delay. Roessler Design Group, a defendant in one of the cases, opposes the motion, arguing that it will suffer costs, delay, and due process issues if the cases are consolidated.

The judge has granted the motion to consolidate, finding that there are common questions of law and fact among the cases. The judge has set the consolidated cases for trial on a future date and has vacated all hearing dates in the individual cases. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
