Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint brought by the Stelnick Defendants. The motion is granted, and the proposed cross-complaint is deemed filed. The cross-complaint is compulsory, as it asserts claims between the parties arising out of the same transactions or occurrences as the causes of action in the original complaint. The Stelnick Defendants have demonstrated good faith in bringing the motion, and there is no evidence of bad faith. The judge has granted the motion in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure sections 426.50 and 428.50, and has deemed the proposed cross-complaint filed as of the date of the ruling.
