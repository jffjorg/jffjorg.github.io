```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, 11649 Mayfield, LLC, has moved to bifurcate the matter, including discovery, to address the statute of limitations issues (equitable tolling and equitable estoppel) before the substance of the factual claims. The plaintiff, Christine Medrick, opposes the motion. The defendant cites to two California appellate court cases, Nwosu v. Uba and Hopkins v. Kedzierski, which support bifurcation of the equitable issues from the factual claims.

The court has considered the arguments and has determined that it cannot determine, at this early stage of the litigation, that judicial economy will be best served by bifurcating discovery and/or trial. Therefore, the court denies without prejudice the defendant's motion to bifurcate discovery and trial. The defendant is required to provide notice of the court's order and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
