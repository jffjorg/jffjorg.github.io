And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Counsel's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, citing a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The motion is unopposed, and Counsel has complied with the procedural requirements by filing the necessary forms and serving them on the client and opposing party. The judge finds that the motion is both procedurally and substantively proper. The order relieving Counsel of his duties will take effect once Counsel files proof of service of the signed order on the client. Counsel will remain the attorney of record for Plaintiff until filing the proof of service.
