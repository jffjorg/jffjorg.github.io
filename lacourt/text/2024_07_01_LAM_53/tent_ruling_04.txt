[1] On
April 26, 2024, the court issued an order (1) continuing the Order to Show
Cause re entry of default judgment to July 1, 2024, and (2) advanced the
hearing on defendant Bezares’s motion to set aside default to July 1, 2024. 


[2]
The court notes that Bezares’s notice of motion does not state that he is
moving for relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(b).  However, because his moving papers
make clear that he is seeking relief under this statute, the court has considered
his arguments thereunder.  (Luxury
Asset Lending, LLC v. Philadelphia Television Network, Inc. (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 894, 909 [“‘As a general rule, the trial court may consider only
the grounds stated in the notice of motion. 
[Citations.]  An omission in the
notice may be overlooked if the supporting papers make clear the grounds for
relief sought’”].)
