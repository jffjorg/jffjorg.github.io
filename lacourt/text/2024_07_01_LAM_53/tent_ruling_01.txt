MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Gustavo Rosas          
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Defendants Nissan North America, Inc., and
Wish Automotive, Inc., d/b/a Nissan of Van Nuys
Motion for Attorney’s Fees
The court
considered the amended moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Gustavo Rosas (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
awarding attorney’s fees and costs in his favor and against defendants Nissan
North America, Inc. and Wish Automotive, Inc., d/b/a Nissan of Van Nuys
(“Defendants”) in the total amount of $23,367.15, consisting of $22,388.50 in
attorney’s fees and $978.65 in costs. 
First, the court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees pursuant to the Song-Beverly Act. 
Civil
Code section 1794, subdivision (d), provides:¿ “If the buyer prevails in an
action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover
as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.”¿¿ 
Plaintiff has presented evidence, and Defendants do not dispute, that (1)
the parties settled this action for the amount of $36,000 on Mrach 23, 2024,
and (2) Defendants’ offer (which Plaintiff accepted) “provided for Plaintiff’s
‘attorney’s fees and costs reasonably incurred by Plaintiff[,]’” by either
stipulation or noticed motion presented to the court.  (Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 20-21.)  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff is
entitled to recover attorney’s fees and costs from Defendants pursuant to Civil
Code section 1794. 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has established, as to the
attorney’s fees incurred in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
this action and the preparation of this fee motion, a lodestar amount of $20,697.50.
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. . . . .¿ The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community
for similar work.¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted); Reck v. FCA US
LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 682, 691 [“To determine a reasonable attorney fee
award, the trial court applies the lodestar method”].)  “[T]he verified time statements of the
attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of
a clear indication the records are erroneous.”¿ (Horsford v. Board of
Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)¿¿ 
Plaintiff has submitted the declaration of attorney Michael Saeedian,
in which Saeedian attests to the qualifications, skill, and experience of the
attorneys that worked on this action. 
(Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 2, 4-5.)  The
court finds that a reasonable hourly rate for attorney Michael Saeedian is
$600.  The court finds that (1) the $525
hourly rate charged by Christopher Urner is reasonable in light of his
experience and qualifications, and (2) the two hourly rates charged by Jorge
Acosta—i.e., $250 for work performed as a law clerk and $350 for work performed
as an attorney—are reasonable in light of his experience and qualifications.  (Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, 23.)  
The court has reviewed (1) each work and time entry on the billing
statement attached to Saeedian’s declaration, which establish that Plaintiff’s
attorneys expended a total of 46.4 hours in prosecuting this action (consisting
of 17.8 hours expended by Michael Saeedian, 8.5 hours expended by Christopher
Urner, 14.8 hours expended by Jorge Acosta as a law clerk, and 5.3 hours
expended by Acosta as an attorney), and (2) Defendants’ objections to the 28
entries set forth in their opposition papers. 
(Saeedian Decl., Ex. A, Billing Statement; Saeedian Decl., ¶ 23; Opp.,
p. 6:1-28.)  Upon the court’s review of
the billing statement and Defendants’ opposition papers, the court finds that all
of the 46.4 hours were reasonably expended. 
(Saeedian Decl., Ex. A.)   Moreover,
while the court notes that Defendants take issue with the billing entries by
Acosta on the ground that he was an “operations manager, not an assigned
attorney on the matter[,]” the court disagrees that they are unreasonable,
because Saeedian has explained in his declaration that, as operations manager,
Acosta “work[s] on active cases in litigation” and “directly handles the litigation
of lemon law cases for clients in [the] office as the primary assigned
attorney.”  (Opp., p. 7:12-15; Saeedian
Decl., ¶ 5.) 
The court therefore finds that Plaintiff has shown that his attorneys
reasonably expended a total of 46.4 hours in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of this action at the hourly rates of $600 (Michael Saeedian), $525
(Christopher Under), $250 (Jorge Acosta, law clerk), and $350 (Jorge Acosta,
attorney).  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd.
(d).) 
Third, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that he is entitled to
costs in the amount of $978.65, consisting of $526.68 in filing fees, $168.52
in jury fees, $100 in service of process fees, and $91.46 in electronic filing
and/or service fees.  (MC-010, ¶¶ 1, 2,
5, 14, 16; Opp., p. 2:19-20 [“Defendants do not dispute the costs and expenses
of $978.65 for purposes of this motion”]; Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486 [“A ‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie
evidence of the propriety’ of the items listed on it, and the burden is on the
party challenging these costs to demonstrate that they were not reasonable or
necessary”].)  
The court therefore finds that Plaintiff has shown that he is entitled
to recover $20,697.50 in attorney’s fees and $978.65 in costs from
Defendants.  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd.
(d).) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Gustavo Rosas’s motion for attorney’s fees as follows.
            The court orders that plaintiff
Gustavo Rosas shall recover a total of $21,676.15 from defendants Nissan North
America, Inc., and Wish Automotive, Inc., d/b/a Nissan of Van Nuys, consisting
of $20,697.50 in attorney’s fees and $978.65 in costs, pursuant to Civil Code
section 1794, subdivision (d).
            The court orders plaintiff Gustavo
Rosas to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
