And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on three motions: Royal Halo, LLC's motion to set aside default, Ricardo Hernandez Bezares' motion to set aside default, and Asiana Resources, Inc.'s request for court judgment by default.

The judge denies Royal Halo, LLC's motion to set aside default, finding that the company has not met its burden to show that its default was excusable neglect. The judge also denies Ricardo Hernandez Bezares' motion to set aside default, finding that Bezares has not met his burden to show that his default was excusable neglect.

The judge grants Asiana Resources, Inc.'s request for court judgment by default, awarding damages in the amount of $73,832.88, interest in the amount of $0 (since the complaint did not pray for interest), and costs in the amount of $1,946.20. The judge orders Asiana Resources, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
