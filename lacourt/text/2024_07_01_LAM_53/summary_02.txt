And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The amended complaint will clarify that the plaintiffs are bringing both individual and derivative claims against the defendants, and will plead additional facts regarding the formation of a new homeowner's association and the defendants' alleged misconduct. The judge found that the proposed amendment is in furtherance of justice and that the defendants have not shown that the plaintiffs' approximate four-month delay in filing the motion was unwarranted or that they will be unduly prejudiced by the amendment. The judge ordered the plaintiffs to file their first amended complaint within five days of the date of the order and to give notice of the ruling.
