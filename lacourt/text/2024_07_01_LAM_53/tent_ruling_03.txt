for Court Judgment by Default
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with each
motion to set aside default.  No reply
papers to those motions were filed.
The court
considered the default judgment papers filed on April 5, 2024. 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Asiana Resources,
Inc., d/b/a Asiana USA, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed its Complaint in this action
on October 11, 2023, against defendants Royal Halo, LLC (“Royal”) and Ricardo
Hernandez Bezares (“Bezares”) (collectively, “Defendants”). 
The clerk entered (1) Royal’s
default on December 13, 2023, and (2) Bezares’s default on December 18, 2023. 
Now pending before the court
are the following three matters: (1) defendant Royal’s motion to set aside the
entry of its default, (2) defendants Bezares’s motion to set aside the entry of
his default, and (3) Plaintiff’s request for court judgment by default against
Defendants.[1]
MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFENDANT ROYAL’S
DEFAULT
Defendant Royal moves the
court for an order setting aside its default, entered by the clerk on December
13, 2023.
“The court may, upon any terms
as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  Application for this relief shall be accompanied
by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein,
otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a
reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  “[T]he moving party bears the burden of
establishing a right to relief” under this statute.  (Austin v. Los Angeles Unified School
Dist. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 918, 928.)  
First, the court finds that
Royal’s motion is timely because (1) its default was entered on December 13,
2023, and (2) it filed this motion on April 23, 2024, i.e., within six months
after its default was entered.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Austin, supra, 244 Cal.App.4th at
p. 928 [“This six-month time limitation is jurisdictional”].)  
Second, the court finds that
Royal has not met its burden to show that its default was entered because of
its “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Austin,
supra, 244 Cal.App.4th at p. 928.) 
Royal does not appear to
dispute that it was personally served with the summons and complaint on October
16, 2023.  (Oct. 25, 2023 POS-010, ¶¶ 2-5;
Bezares Decl., ¶ 2 [“Plaintiff asserts that it effected personal service by
delivering the Summons and Complaint to Royal’s authorized agent for service of
process on October 16, 2023”].)  However,
defendant Bezares—the managing member of Royal—asserts, in his declaration,
that he attempted to file Royal’s answer to the Complaint on December 6, 2023
(i.e., more than 30 days after the date of service of the summons).  (Bezares Decl., ¶¶ 1, 3.)  Royal’s answer was rejected by the clerk
because the case name did not match the court’s records.  (Bezares Decl., ¶ 3; Bezares Decl., Ex. A
[Notice of Rejection of answer submitted on December 6, 2023].)  Bezares was not aware that the answer had
been rejected, and he discovered that fact when he attempted to participate in
the February 8, 2024 case management conference.  (Bezares Decl., ¶ 5.)
While the court acknowledges
that Royal has presented evidence establishing that it attempted to file an
answer and did not discover its rejection until February 8, 2024, the court
finds that Royal has not presented argument or evidence establishing
that its default was taken as a result of this conduct.  Specifically, Royal did not address its
failure to file an answer within 30 days of October 16, 2023 (i.e., the date
that summons was served).  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 412.20, subd. (a)(3).)  By the
time that Royal attempted to file its answer, the deadline to do so had
passed.  (Ibid.)  Royal did not present evidence explaining (1)
why it failed to timely file an answer and (2) why such failure constitutes
excusable neglect, mistake, or inadvertence.  Thus, even if the court were to find that Royal’s
conduct, in attempting to file an answer and discovering its rejection two
months later, constituted excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect, Royal has not shown that it was this conduct that caused its default
to be entered, since Royal attempted to file its answer beyond the 30-day
deadline.  (County of San Bernardino
v. Mancini (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1095, 1102 [“Section 473(b) authorizes the
trial court to vacate a dismissal, order, or judgment if it occurred because
of the excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect of a party or
its attorney”] [emphasis added].)  
The court also notes that,
even if Royal had filed its answer on that date, Royal attempted to do so as a
self-represented corporate entity, such that its answer would have been
invalid.  (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145
[“a corporation, unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself before courts
of record in propria persona, nor can it represent itself through a corporate
officer, director, or other employee who is not an attorney.  It must be represented by licensed counsel in
proceedings before courts of record”].)
Thus, the court finds that
Royal has not met its burden “of establishing a right to relief” and therefore
denies Royal’s motion.  (Austin, supra,
244 Cal.App.4th at p. 928; Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) 
MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFENDANT BEZARES’S
DEFAULT
Defendant Bezares moves the
court for an order setting aside his default, entered by the clerk on December
18, 2023, on the grounds that (1) service of the summons did not result in
actual notice in time to defend the lawsuit, and (2) his lack of actual notice
was not caused by avoidance or inexcusable neglect. 
“When service of a summons has
not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a
default or default judgment has been entered against him or her in the action,
he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or
default judgment and for leave to defend the action.  The notice of motion shall be served and
filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two
years after entry of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days
after service on him or her of a written notice that the default or default
judgment has been entered.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)  A motion
made pursuant to this statute must be accompanied by (1) an affidavit showing
that the lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by
his avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, and (2) a copy of the answer,
motion, or other pleading proposed to be filed in the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (b).) 
First, the court finds that
Bezares’s motion is timely because (1) his default was entered on
December 18, 2023, and (2) he filed this motion on April 23, 2024, i.e., within
two years after the entry of his default. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)
Second, the court finds that
Bezares has not met his burden (1) to show that he did not have actual
knowledge of this case in time to defend himself in this action, or (2) to
submit “an affidavit showing under oath that [Bezares’s] lack of actual notice
in time to the defend the action was not caused by his . . . avoidance of
service or excusable neglect.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subds. (a), (b).)  
Although Bezares submitted a
declaration in support of this motion, his declaration does not state that he
did not receive actual notice of this lawsuit in time to file an answer, nor
does the declaration state the date on which Bezares learned that he was a
defendant to this action.  For example,
while Bezares states that he first learned of his default on January 10, 2024,
Bezares did not state that he did not have actual knowledge of this action at
this time, or that the lack of such notice was not taken as a result of his
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. 
(Bezares Decl., ¶ 5.)  Further,
while Bezares’s motion states that he first learned of this lawsuit on February
8, 2024 (which the court notes appears to be inconsistent with his
representation that he learned of his default on January 10, 2024), Bezares did
not state that fact in his declaration. 
(Mot., pp. 4:12, 4:17-18, 7:22-23.) 
Bezares also did not state that his lack of actual notice was not caused
by his avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, as required.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (b).) 
The court notes that Bezares
has also argued that service was improper, such that the default is void for
lack of jurisdiction.  (Mot., pp. 5:26-7:5.)
 However, Bezares did not move for relief
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), which
provides for relief from void judgment or orders.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d); Mot., pp.
5:1-4 [beginning argument under section 473.5], 7:7-10 [beginning argument
under section 473, subdivision (b)].) 
Third, the court finds that
Bezares has not met his burden to show that his default was entered because of
his “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”[2]  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Austin,
supra, 244 Cal.App.4th at p. 928.) 
It appears that Bezares
contends that he is entitled to relief pursuant to section 473, subdivision (b)
on the ground that he “was not aware that he was named as a defendant in his
individual capacity until February 8, 2024.” 
(Mot., p. 7:22-23.)  However,
Bezares did not submit evidence in support of that assertion.  Moreover, while Bezares states that he “first
learned of the default entered against” him on January 10, 2024, he did
not state facts establishing when he discovered that he was a defendant to this
action.  (Bezares Decl., ¶ 5 [emphasis
added].)  Bezares also did not present
argument establishing what act of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect caused his default to be entered. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Mancini (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th
at p. 1102.)  Bezares did not, for
example, argue that his default was entered as a result of his surprise based
on improper service.  Instead, Bezares
has only generally argued that he did not discover that he had been sued in
this action until February 8, 2024. 
Thus, the court finds that
Bezares has not met his burden “of establishing a right to relief” and
therefore denies Bezares’s motion.  (Austin,
supra, 244 Cal.App.4th at p. 928; Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT
BY DEFAULT
Plaintiff requests that the court enter default judgment against
Defendants in the total amount of $78,210.85, consisting of $73,832.88 in
damages, $2,431.77 in interest, and $1,946.20 in costs. 
First, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that it is entitled to
damages in the amount of $73,832.88.  (Sass
v. Cohen (2020) 10 Cal.5th 861, 880 [“plaintiffs in default cases must
still prove their damages to obtain monetary recovery”]; Compl., ¶¶ 13, 15, 17,
20, 25, 27; Cohen Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, 5, 6, 7-8; Cohen Decl., Ex. A [Personal
Guarantee of Payment executed by Bezares]; Cohen Decl., Ex. B [Invoices issued
by Plaintiff to Royal in total amount of $73,832.88].) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that it may
recover prejudgment interest because Plaintiff did not request interest in its
Complaint and “the relief awarded in such a default judgment ‘cannot exceed’
the ‘type and amount of relief’ sought in the plaintiff’s operative
pleadings.”  (Compl., p. 6, Prayer; Sass,
supra, 32 Cal.App.5th at p. 1034; Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a).) 
The court notes that Plaintiff appears to contend that it may recover
interest notwithstanding its failure to pray for interest, citing North
Oakland Medical Clinic v. Rogers (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 824.  (Urasi Decl., p. 3, n. 1.)  The court acknowledges that, there, the court
stated that “[a] general prayer in the complaint is adequate to support an
award of prejudgment interest.  ‘No
specific request for interest need be included in the complaint; a prayer
seeking “such other and further relief as may be proper” is sufficient for the
court to invoke its power to award prejudgment interest.  [Citations.]’”  (North Oakland Medical Clinic, supra,
65 Cal.App.4th at p. 829.)  However, that
case concerned the appeal from an order denying prejudgment interest on a
damages award following a jury trial, and not the award of prejudgment interest
on default.  (Id. at p. 826.)  Thus, this case appears to reflect the
principle that prejudgment interest may be awarded after trial even if the
complaint does not pray for interest.  (Newby
v. Vroman (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 283, 286 [“It has long been settled that,
in a contested action, prejudgment interest may be awarded even though the
complaint contains no prayer for interest”].)  The court therefore finds that Plaintiff is
not entitled to an award of prejudgment interest on default judgment.
Third, the court finds that the requested costs are allowable as
costs.  (CIV-100, ¶ 7; Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subds. (a)(1) [filing fees], (a)(4) [process server fees].)
Thus, the court grants Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
against Defendants in the modified amount of $75,779.08, consisting of
$73,832.88 in damages and $1,946.20 in costs.
