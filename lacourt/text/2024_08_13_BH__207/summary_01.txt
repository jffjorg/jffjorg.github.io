And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Claim of Exemption filed by Christine Adamian, seeking to exempt funds in her Bank of America account from wage garnishment to enforce Plaintiff Judith Wurmbrand's judgment. The Court has considered the opposition by Plaintiff and has found that the funds in question are Defendant's community property, not Claimant's separate property. The Court notes that Claimant and Defendant were and remain married at all relevant times, and that Claimant has not provided any evidence in reply to support her claim of exemption. Therefore, the Court denies Claimant's claim of exemption.
