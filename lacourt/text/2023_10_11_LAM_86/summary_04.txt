And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the City's motion to strike purported inadmissible evidence and Petitioner's argument. The City's motion is alternatively styled as an objection to purported inadmissible evidence. The court previously sustained a demurrer to Petitioner's claim based on Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. Petitioner's argument about Section 2802 is incomplete and does not provide a substantive analysis until her Reply Brief. The court notes that Labor Code § 2802 has been applied to public employers, including the City of Los Angeles. The court will address Petitioner's argument despite not taking judicial notice of the statement of decision.
