While Petitioner contends the City failed to
comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5 subdivision (a), the City’s
motion to strike is alternatively styled as an objection to purported
inadmissible evidence.

Petitioner’s reference to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (e) in her Reply Brief does not
constitute a motion permitting the City with a full and fair opportunity to
address the extra-record evidence issue. (See Reply 8:5-11.)

Skelly v. State Personnel Bd. (1975) 15
Cal.3d 194, 218 [Skelly].)  
 
 


[4]
The court previously sustained a demurrer to
Petitioner’s claim based on Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.


[5]
Petitioner does not provide a substantive
analysis until her Reply Brief. (See Reply 8:16-20.) Petitioner’s complete
argument about Section 2802 provides: “Respondents argue at page 18 of their
Opposition, that Labor Code § 2802 ‘is not applicable in this case,’ because,
Respondents claim, that Section applies only to private sector employees.
However, Labor Code § 2802 has been applied to public employers, including the
City of Los Angeles. See, e.g., In re Acknowledgment Cases (2015) 239
Cal.App.4th 1498. Moreover, even the authority cited by Respondents, ‘In re
Working Uniforms Cases,’ acknowledged that Labor Code §§ 2802 and 2804 does
apply to the City. In re Working Uniforms (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th at 344
fn.14.”

While the court did not take judicial notice of
the statement of decision, the court nonetheless addresses Petitioner’s
argument.


[7] The court judicially notices the court file in Los
Angeles County Superior Court, Case No. 21STCV39987.

The board initially indicated it did not believe
Section 2802 applied to public employees and asked for additional briefing on
the issue. (AR 419.)


[9]
Testimony established police officers had not
been invoiced by the City for any testing they completed. (AR 165, 435-436.)

Nothing suggests the Charter provision is
applicable here.
