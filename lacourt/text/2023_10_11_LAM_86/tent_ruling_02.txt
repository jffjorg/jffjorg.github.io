[1] As L.A. Care has produced the performance score cards
to Petitioners, the issue presented is whether the names of the individual
providers on the performance score cards must also be disclosed.


[2] The court generally refers to IPGs and PPGs together as
Provider Groups.


[3] Mihalik’s expertise, among other things, relates to
performance measurement and quality assessment and improvement for health care
organizations. (Mihalik Decl. ¶
7.)


[4] Petitioners reference service two types of service
agreements—fee for service and shared risk agreement. (Coursolle Decl., Exh. J,
K, respectively.) Respondent provides evidence Respondent uses five “general
forms with slight variations between each provider group.” (Lageson Decl. ¶ 3.)


[5] Given the service agreements’ apparently conflicted
provisions on confidentiality, Provider Group reliance on oral representations
from Baackes would be reasonable. 


[6] While there is evidence of the accusation filed by
DMHC, the court cannot locate any evidence to support Petitioners’ claim DHCS
filed an accusation. However, Respondent acknowledges actions by both agencies.
(Opposition 6:1-3; Mapp Decl. ¶
2.)


[7] Levander also discusses how Provider Group names could
be used to help individual consumers select medical providers. (Levander Decl.
¶¶ 22-23.)  As discussed earlier, the
interest is a private one and speculative as well given that the Provider Group
names do not reflect particular physicians within the Provider Group.  


[8] Petitioners do not persuasively respond to or address
these arguments and evidence in reply. 
(Reply 5-9.) In particular, Petitioners do not rebut the evidence and
argument that the performance of individual Provider Groups can be tracked from
year to year from the scorecards, albeit with the Provider Groups’ names
redacted.
