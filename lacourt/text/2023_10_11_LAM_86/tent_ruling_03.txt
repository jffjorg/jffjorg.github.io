Petitioner, Natalie Stringer, seeks a writ of mandate
requiring Respondent, the City of Los Angeles, to set aside her discharge, to
reinstate her to her prior position as a Police Officer III with the City’s
police department with backpay, and to remove any reference of misconduct in
her personnel records. The City opposes the request.
 
The City’s evidentiary objection (objection
1) to Petitioner’s declaration is sustained. The declaration constitutes
extra-record evidence.[1]
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (e) governs augmentation of the
record in administrative mandate. The requirements of the statute are
“stringent.” (Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center v. Superior
Court (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 93, 102.) 
“If the moving party fails to make the required showing, it is an abuse
of the court's discretion to [augment the record].” (Ibid.) A motion to
augment the administrative record “must be filed as a noticed motion.”[2]
(Los Angeles County Court Rules, Rule 3.231, subd. (g)(3).)
 
Petitioner’s
declaration filed August 11, 2023 is extra-record evidence. As it is not part
of the administrative record (and the administrative record has not been
augmented), the court may not consider it. The court also notes the transcript
of a podcast significantly postdated the events at issue in this proceeding.
 
Petitioner’s
Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) of Exhibit A, a statement of decision issued
by the court in Los Angeles Police Protective League v. City of Los Angeles,
Case No. 21STCV39987, is denied. The City’s objection (objection 2) is
sustained. The City contends the RJN “must be denied by this Court, it is not a
final judgment on the merits for purposes of collateral estoppel and is not
dispositive of any of the issues in this case, making it irrelevant for this
matter.” (Objection 4:13-15.) While the court may take judicial notice of the
records of any court of this state, the records must be relevant to an issue in
this proceeding. (See Mangini v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994) 7
Cal.4th 1057, 1063.) As the statement of decision is not binding authority and
is not a judgment, the relevance of Petitioner’s RJN is unclear. Moreover, the
statement of decision substantially post-dated Petitioner’s Board of Rights
hearing and was not considered by the agency during the underlying
administrative proceeding.
 
The City’s objection
(objection 3) to Petitioner’s RJN Exhibit B is sustained. Petitioner fails to explain
the relevance of the resolution—unlike the City’s ordinance at issue here, a
resolution is not a local law and not equivalent to an ordinance. (See City
of Sausalito v. County of Marin (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 550, 565-566.) Petitioner’s
RJN Exhibit D is similarly irrelevant, and the court does not take judicial
notice of Petitioner’s Exhibit D (the City Council’s vote adopting the resolution).
 
To the extent
Petitioner has relied on inadmissible evidence, the court does not consider the
argument (objections 4, 5 and 6).
 
BACKGROUND
 
The City Makes COVID-19 Testing a “Condition of
Employment” for Employees Seeking an Exemption from the COVID-19 Vaccination
Requirement 
 
On August 18, 2021, the City adopted Ordinance
No. 187134 (Ordinance), requiring all present and future employees be
vaccinated against COVID-19. Alternatively, an employee could avoid the vaccine
by requesting an exemption for religious or medical reasons by October 20, 2021.
The requirements of the Ordinance became a condition of employment with the
City. (AR 473-478.) 
 
Section 4.702, subdivision (b) of the Ordinance provides:

 
Employees
with medical or religious exemptions and who are required to regularly report
to a City worksite shall be subject to weekly COVID-19 tests. Testing will be
provided to the employees at no cost during their work hours following a
process and timeline determined by the City. 
(AR 475.)
 
On October 14, 2021, the City’s Administrative
Officer (CAO) issued the City’s Last, Best and Final Offer (LBFO) to employee
unions detailing the consequences for a City employee’s failure to comply with the Ordinance.
(AR 486.) After meet and confer efforts with labor organizations reached an
impasse, the City Council passed a resolution implementing the LBFO. (AR 479-485.)  
 
Pursuant to the
LBFO, failure to fulfill the conditions detailed in the LBFO would constitute a
failure to meet a condition of employment and would result in appropriate and
immediate corrective action. (AR 487.) For employees who filed a request for
exemption from the vaccine requirement, the LBFO also imposed the following
testing requirements: 
 
Employees who have reported a vaccination
status of "not vaccinated" and who file exemption paperwork and are
awaiting the result of the City's evaluation process shall be subject to the
same terms applicable to employees who are not fully vaccinated and who have
received a Notice, including and limited to items 2, 3, 4, and 5 . . . . (AR 488.)
 
Items 2, 3, 4, and
5 provide: 
 
2. The employee must test for COVID-19
twice per week; 
 
3. To facilitate the testing process for
the employee and ensure that test results are reported accurately and timely,
all testing shall be administered by the City or a vendor of the City's
choosing. The employee shall be required to test through the City or its
vendor. No third-party tests shall be substituted for tests provided for by the
City or its vendor;
 
4. The employee shall reimburse the City
$260 per pay period for four tests at $65 each. Reimbursement shall be made on
a biweekly basis through an employee's paycheck, e.g., through a negative
payroll deduction; and 
 
5. The employee shall test on their own
time, i.e., not on paid work time. (AR 487-488.)
 
On October 28, 2021, the City’s mayor issued a
memorandum to all City department heads, including the Chief of Police, to
immediately implement the Ordinance and LBFO. (AR 479-481.) As relevant here,
the mayor directed the department heads to issue a “Notice of Mandatory
Covid-19 Vaccination Policy Requirements – While Awaiting an Exemption/Appeal
Determination” to each unvaccinated employee with a pending exemption request.
(AR 480.)  The mayor directed department
heads to immediately begin the corrective action process outlined in the LBFO
for each employee who remains non-compliant as of December 18, 2021. (AR 481.)
The memorandum stated: “An employee
that remains out of compliance shall be placed off duty without pay pending
service of a Skelly[3]
package that includes a Notice of Proposed Separation. Sworn employees shall be
subject to applicable Board of Rights proceedings.” (AR
481.)
 
The City selected a vendor, Bluestone, to perform
the twice weekly COVID-19 testing for the department’s employees who were awaiting
the City’s response to request for exemptions from the vaccine requirement. Pursuant
to the LBFO, the employees were required to pay $65 for each twice weekly test.  (AR 114, 115, 125, 134, 487.)
 
Petitioner Files for Religious Exemption and Does
Not Sign the Notice or Complete COVID-19 Testing 
 
Petitioner filed for a religious exemption from
the City’s COVID-19 vaccination requirement. (AR 250, 284.)  On November 3, 2021, Commander Al Pasos,
Petitioner’s commanding officer, served on Petitioner a Notice of Mandatory
Covid-19 Vaccination Policy Requirements – While Awaiting an Exemption/Appeal
Determination. (AR 246, 491, 492.) At that meeting, Pasos also orally informed
Petitioner of the testing requirements and consequences for
non-compliance.  (AR 246, 248, 250-251.)
 
Petitioner did not sign the notice. (AR 251,
494.) Petitioner also refused to submit to COVID-19 testing with Bluestone. (AR
253, 254.)  
 
Administrative Complaint and Skelly Protections

 
On December 16,
2021, the Chief of Police signed a complaint and relief from duty against
Petitioner. (AR 1-3.)  The
complaint directed Petitioner to a Board of Rights. (AR 1.) The complaint
alleged a single count: 
 
On
or about November 30, 2021, you, while on-duty, failed to comply with the
requirements of the Notice of Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination Policy
Requirements, a condition of employment. (AR 1.)
 
On December 16, 2021, the Chief of Police removed
Petitioner from duty. (AR 1.) The complaint
advised Petitioner she would “not suffer a loss of compensation for thirty
calendar days after the date on which [she was] served with the charge(s) . . .
.”  (AR 4.)  
 
Board of Rights Hearing and Decision
 
On February 2,
2022, the department began Petitioner’s Board of Rights hearing on the single
count alleged against her. (AR 69.) Petitioner pleaded not guilty to the
charge. (AR 103.)
 
On May 20, 2022, after
several days of hearing wherein three witnesses testified (AR 453-454), the board
unanimously found Petitioner guilty of the misconduct count alleged.  (AR 457.) 
Specifically, the board explained:
 
[Petitioner] is unvaccinated and has
refused to be tested and thereby charged by the City’s vendor. She initially
was going to be tested at Kaiser, where she is insured and would not have to
incur a testing fee. Later, she testified she refused testing because she
believed it was unfair that vaccinated officers were not required to be tested.
She felt discriminated against as an officer seeking a religious exemption. (AR
456.)
 
The board also
noted “[w]hether the City’s policy of mandatory testing by the City’s vendor,
Bluestone, as well as the policy that an officer may have payment for testing
deducted from their paycheck, is not before this board.” (AR 456-457.)
 
The board
thereafter proceeded to the penalty phase of the proceedings. (AR 534.) The
board noted Petitioner had no prior sustained complaints, three single-spaced pages
of commendations for leadership, hard work, teamwork, integrity, “and also
thorough investigations at the scene.” (AR 534.) The board also recognized
Petitioner’s educational background and performance evaluations that “either
met or sometimes exceeded standards.” (AR 534.) The board acknowledged Pasos’
testimony that he would “take her back in a heartbeat.” (AR 535.)
 
After considering
the totality of the circumstances, the board sustained the proposed penalty of
discharge as a Police Officer III. (AR 535.)
 
On May 20, 2022,
the Chief of Police executed the order to terminate Petitioner’s employment
“with total loss of pay” effective January 17, 2022. (AR 536.)
 
This proceeding ensued.
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
Petitioner
seeks relief pursuant Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.[4] 
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (b), the issues for review
of an administrative decision are: whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An
abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the
manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the
findings are not supported by the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd.
(b).)
 
As
noted by the City, judicial review here is under the court’s independent
judgment. (Opposition 10:20-21.) (See Cipriotti v. Board of Directors (1983)
147 Cal.App.3d 144, 154; Sandarg v.
Dental Bd. of California (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1440.)  
 
Under
the independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law, but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.” (Bixby v. Pierno
(1971) 4 Cal. 3d 130, 143.) The court may draw its own reasonable inferences
from the evidence and make its determinations as to the credibility of
witnesses. (Morrison v. Housing Authority
of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003) 107 Cal. App. 4th
860, 868.) Exercise of independent
judgment “does permit (indeed, [] requires) the trial court to reweigh the
evidence by examining the credibility of witnesses.” (Barber v. Long Beach
Civil Service Com. (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 652, 658.) Under independent
judgment, “abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the
findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence.” (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 1094.5, subd. (b).)
 
“In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal. 4th 805, 817; see also
Evid. Code, § 664.)
 
Finally, “[o]n questions of law arising
in mandate proceedings, [the court] exercise[s] independent judgment.” (Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  The
interpretation of statute or regulation is a question of law.  (See State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co.
v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.) “A challenge to the procedural fairness
of the administrative hearing is reviewed de novo on appeal because the
ultimate determination of procedural fairness amounts to a question of
law.”  (Nasha v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470, 482.)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Petitioner challenges the City’s actions
on three grounds. First, Petitioner argues the City’s condition of employment was “illegal” and
violated Labor Code section 2802 (Section 2802). (Opening Brief 14:20.) Second,
Petitioner contends the City violated her
constitutional rights under Skelly, supra, 15 Cal.3d at
194. (Opening Brief 15:19.) Last, Petitioner alleges the penalty imposed by the
City is disproportionate to her misconduct. (Opening Brief 17:1.) 
 
Alleged Illegality of the Condition of Employment
 
In a short argument in her Opening Brief, Petitioner
reports she was “discharged after refusing to sign a contract which would have
obliged her to pay the cost of COVID testing while her application to be exempt
from vaccination was pending.” (Opening Brief 14:23-24.) Petitioner contends
Section 2802 “made it unlawful for the City to impose such a demand on”
Petitioner. (Opening Brief 14:25.) Petitioner asserts the City’s demand was illegal.
(Opening Brief 14:28-15:1.)
 
Petitioner provides no real substantive analysis
of Section 2802 in her Opening Brief.[5]
Instead, Petitioner waited and briefly discussed Section 2802, other applicable
statutes and/or case law to support her claim of illegality in her Reply Brief
in response to the City’s claim Section 2802 does not apply to public employers.
Petitioner’s initial argument about Section 2802 rests entirely on a statement
of decision issued by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Rupert Byrdsong on
September 30, 2022 (Los Angeles Police Protective League v. City of Los
Angeles, Case No. 21STCV39987), more than four months after Petitioner’s
administrative proceeding had concluded and the discharge penalty imposed.[6]
 
After a bench trial, Judge Byrdsong found Section
2802 barred the City from imposing financial liability for COVID-19 testing on
City employees. Judge Byrdsong concluded “invoicing” or “negative deductions”
for the costs of COVID-19 testing were prohibited by Section 2802. (RJN Exh. A
at 8-18.) Judge Byrdsong’s statement of decision reflects he would issue a writ
of mandate enjoining the City from requiring unvaccinated employees to incur
the cost of City-required COVID-19 testing and compelling the City to indemnify
and reimburse unvaccinated employees who had paid such testing costs through
payroll deductions or direct payment of billed invoices. (RJN EXH. A at
18-19.)  
 
The court dismissed Los Angeles Police
Protective League v. City of Los Angeles after the parties entered into a
settlement.[7] The
case did not result in a judgment. That is, the court never issued the writ of
mandate contemplated by Judge Byrdsong’s statement of decision. While Judge
Byrdsong’s ruling may be persuasive, Petitioner does not show the statement of
decision is “final” or has any binding effect or precedential value. (Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center v. Belshe (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 819, 830 [“. . . a written
trial court ruling has no precedential value”].)  
 
Nor does Petitioner show it would be
appropriate for this court to reach a conclusion regarding Section 2802, and
whether Section 2802 is a defense to the administrative charge against
Petitioner, based solely on her citation to a non-binding and non-precedential
trial court decision. As noted earlier, Petitioner did not provide any separate
analysis of Section 2802 or appellate authority applying Section 2802 to a
public employer in her case-in-chief. Petitioner also has not cited cases relevant
to an analysis of the consequences to the administrative charge against
her—failure to complete mandatory COVID-19 testing—if the City’s reimbursement
policy violated Section 2802. (See, e.g., Ordinance severability clause [AR
477].)  
 
Petitioner properly exhaust her
administrative remedies on the issue. The board elected not to address the
claim and decided Section 2802 was not properly before it. (AR 456-457.)[8]

 
The City argues Section 2802 does not apply to
public entities. (Opposition 18:11-21.)  
“ ‘Generally, . . . provisions of the Labor Code
apply only to employees in the private sector unless they are
specifically made applicable to public employees.’ ” (Stoetzl v.
Department of Human Resources (2019) 7 Cal.5th 718, 752.) Section 2802 does
not expressly mention public employers. (Opposition 18:20.) However, the City understandably
also does not fully develop the argument, including with a discussion of cases
cited in Judge Byrdsong’s statement of decision, where Section 2802 applied to
public entities. (See RJN Exh. A at 9; see e.g. In re Acknowledgment Cases
(2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 1498.) The City also does not cite a case holding that Section
2802 is not applicable to a public employer.   
 
The board based its finding of guilt on
Petitioner’s unvaccinated status “and . . . refus[al] to be tested and thereby
charged by the City’s vendor.”[9]
(AR 456.) To the extent Petitioner had a religious exemption request pending and
the City discharged her for failing to test, whether Section 2802 is an invalid
condition of employment is significant.
 
Based on the foregoing, the court finds the
briefing from both Petitioner and the City insufficient on the questions of (1)
whether the City’s policy of requiring
employees who sought an exemption to pay for testing conflicted with Section
2802 at the time of the administrative proceedings in this case (concluding in
May 2022); and (2) if any conflict with Section 2802 excused the mandatory COVID-19
testing requirement that applied to employees seeking an exemption, such as
Petitioner. Even if the City’s policy of requiring employees who sought an
exemption to pay for testing conflicted with Section 2802 during the relevant
time period for this petition, it does not necessarily follow that Petitioner
would be excused from complying with the rest of the Ordinance and LBFO. 
 
The court is inclined to order
supplemental briefing on the issue of the validity of Section 2802, and the
effect of invalidity on the administrative proceedings, if any.
 
Violation of Skelly 
 
Petitioner
contends the City denied Petitioner her constitutional right to a
pre-discipline Skelly hearing. 
 
In Skelly, supra, 15 Cal.3d at 194,
the California Supreme Court determined “due process does not require the state
to provide the [permanent civil service] employee with a full trial-type
evidentiary hearing prior to the initial taking of punitive action.” (Id.
at 215.) The Court held, however, “due process does mandate that the employee
be accorded certain procedural rights before the discipline becomes effective.
As a minimum, these preremoval safeguards must include notice of the proposed
action, the reasons therefor, a copy of the charges and materials upon which
the action is based, and the right to respond, either orally or in writing, to
the authority initially imposing discipline.” 
(Ibid.)   
 
“The
essence of procedural due process is notice and an opportunity to respond.” (Gilbert
v. City of Sunnyvale (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1279.) “The minimal due
process rights required by Skelly prior to discharge are merely
anticipatory of the full rights which are accorded to the employee after
discharge. The employee can exercise those rights at the subsequent hearing,
and if that hearing shows that there were good grounds for dismissal, the
employee is not entitled to reinstatement; he is merely entitled to damages for
the limited time period in which discipline was wrongfully imposed, i.e., the
employee is entitled to back pay for the period from the time discipline was
actually imposed to the date the commission filed its decision validating the dismissal.”
(Kirkpatrick v. Civil Service Com. (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 940, 945.)  
 
Here, the City
served Petitioner with the complaint and relief from duty form on December 17,
2021. (AR 1.) The form advised Petitioner she had temporarily been relieved
from duty and referred to a Board of Rights hearing because she failed to
comply “with the requirements of the Notice of Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination
Policy Requirements, a condition of employment.” (AR 1.) The form also advised
Petitioner the Chief of Police was recommending Petitioner be discharged from
her position with the department. (AR 1.) Finally, the form noted Petitioner
would not receive pay 30 days following her relief of duty. (AR 1.)
 
Thus, the City
complied with Skelly in part by providing Petitioner notice of the
proposed action and the reasons therefor. However, Skelly also required the
City to provide Petitioner with “the right to respond, either orally or in
writing, to the authority initially imposing discipline.” (Skelly, supra, 15
Cal.3d at 194.) The opportunity to respond is necessarily a meaningful one. 
 
Petitioner argues, however, “[t]here is
no evidence that she was afforded an opportunity to respond to the charge
against her before she was relieved of duty and her compensation ended.”
(Opening Brief 16:22-24.) Thus, Petitioner contends the City violated her Skelly
rights by failing to provide her with “the right to respond, either orally or in
writing, to the authority initially imposing discipline.” (Skelly, supra, 15 Cal.3d at 215.)
 
The court
agrees.
 
The City’s
argument otherwise is not persuasive. First, whether a Board of Rights hearing
satisfies the administrative appeal requirements of the Public Safety Officers
Procedural Bill of Rights Act (the Act), Government Code section 3300 et
seq. is irrelevant to Petitioner’s claim. Petitioner has not alleged a
violation of the Act. Second, the provisions of the City of Los Angeles Charter
(Charter) relied upon by the City do not address Skelly or its
requirements. In fact, Charter section 1070, subdivision (b)(1) expressly notes
a police officer may be temporarily relieved of duty but “shall not suffer a
loss of compensation until 30 days after the date on which the member was
served with the charge or charges . . . .” The provision requires, however,
that “predisciplinary procedures otherwise required by law” must be followed.
(Charter, § 1070, subd. (b).) Skelly is just that—a predisciplinary
procedure required by law. Where the City did not follow “predisciplinary
procedures otherwise required by law,” the City could not deprive Petitioner of
her compensation while relieved of duty and pending a Board of Rights.
 
While the City is correct and procedural due process violations are
subject to harmless error analysis (Hinrichs v. County of Orange (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 921, 928), the
California Supreme Court has held “the imposition of discipline prior to
affording the employee notice of the reasons for the punitive action and an
opportunity to respond” violates Skelly’s due process rights. (Barber
v. State Personnel Bd. (1976) 18 Cal.3d 395, 403.)  “This infirmity
is not corrected until the employee has been given an opportunity to present
his arguments to the authority initially imposing
discipline.” (Ibid.)  
 
Here,
Petitioner merely need show the City violated her Skelly rights; she has
made that showing. The department did not provide
Petitioner with a reasonable opportunity to present her arguments to the Chief
of Police before he recommended Petitioner be discharged. Significantly, the
Chief of Police temporarily removed Petitioner from duty effective December 16,
2021, and also specified that she would suffer a loss of compensation starting
in 30 days (except as provided in section 1070, subdivision (q) of the City of
Los Angeles Charter [the Charter].)[10] (Ibid.)
The Chief of Police’s final order similarly stated Petitioner’s removal, “with
total loss of pay,” was effective January 17, 2022. (AR 536.) While Petitioner
could challenge the proposed discipline before the Board of Rights, the loss of
pay was effective before the Board of Rights hearing. Skelly procedures
are required prior to a loss of pay—a punitive action affected a vested
property right.
 
Moreover, the City has cited no persuasive
authority for its contrary position. The logical extension of the City’s view
would suggest Skelly has no application for the department’s
employees who receive a Board of Rights hearing before final imposition of
penalty. That is not the law.
 
When a Skelly violation occurs, “the employee
is not entitled to reinstatement; [s]he is merely entitled to damages for the
limited time period in which discipline was wrongfully imposed, i.e., the
employee is entitled to back pay for the period from the time discipline was
actually imposed to the date the commission filed its decision validating the
dismissal.”  (Kirkpatrick v. Civil
Service Com., supra, 77 Cal.App.3d at 945; see also Barber v. State
Personnel Bd., supra, 18 Cal.3d at 402-403 [same].)  
 
Neither party
has provided the court a calculation of backpay or specified the dates for
which Petitioner is entitled to backpay. The Chief of Police’s final order of
removal, dated May 26, 2022, discloses Petitioner was removed from her position
with total loss of pay effective January 17, 2022. (AR 536.) Based on the
City’s violation of Petitioner’s Skelly rights, Petitioner is entitled
to backpay running from January 17, 2022 through and including May 25, 2022.
 
Propriety of the Penalty
 
Petitioner argues the penalty imposed—her
discharge—“was clearly excessive and disproportionate to the alleged wrong.”
(Opening Brief 17:6.) Petitioner asserts: “the penalty was clearly excessive.
There was no showing or finding that [Petitioner’s] conduct affected public
service, with the Skelly Court found was an ‘overriding concern.’ ”
(Opening Brief 17:7-9.) Petitioner contends she lost her job “for refusing to
sign a contract obliging the employee to submit to City-mandated testing by a
City-chosen private contractor, and they requiring the employee to pay the
City for that testing is clearly a case of the punishment not fitting the
conduct alleged.” (Opening Brief 17:11-13.)
 
“The propriety of a penalty imposed by an
administrative agency is a matter vested in the discretion of the agency, and
its decision may not be disturbed unless there has been a manifest abuse of
discretion.”  (Williamson v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance (1990) 217
Cal.App.3d 1343, 1347.)  “If reasonable
minds may differ with regard to the appropriate disciplinary action, there is
no abuse of discretion.” (County of Los
Angeles v. Civil Service Commission (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 620, 634.)  
 
In
considering whether an abuse of discretion occurred, the “overriding
consideration . . . is the extent to which the employee’s conduct resulted in,
or if repeated is likely to result in, ‘[h]arm to the public service.’
[Citations.] Other relevant factors include the circumstances surrounding the
misconduct and the likelihood of its recurrence.”  (Skelly,
supra, 15 Cal.3d at 218.)  
 
Here, the Ordinance and LBFO both specified
regular COVID-19 testing was a condition of employment for employees seeking an
exemption from the vaccination requirement. (AR 1088, 975-977.) As discussed, the
board found (and Petitioner does not challenge that finding) Petitioner failed
to fulfill this condition of employment. Since Petitioner failed to meet a
condition of employment, it follows she could no longer be employed by the department
once the board made its finding of guilt on the complaint. Brian Taft, a Senior Personnel Analyst II
and the Officer-in-Charge of the Return to Work Section of the Personnel
Division of the police department (AR 129) testified a “conditions of City
employment would mean that an employee has to meet this requirement in order to
continue their employment with the City.” (AR 142.) Taft explained: “So in this
particular instance, an employee who would like to stay within the City and be
employed, [] would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19.” (AR 142.) Taft also
explained a medical or religious exemption would make the “condition of
employment . . . not applicable to them.” (AR 143.) 
 
Petitioner has
cited no evidence or authority to the contrary Taft’s explanation that
compliance with the Ordinance is a condition of employment. Accordingly,
the board and the Chief of Police could reasonably determine, as they did, discharge
was the only appropriate penalty based on Petitioner’s failure to meet a
condition of her employment.  
 
Considering the public health emergency caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, 2021 and 2022, and the impact on the City’s
employees and operations, as reflected in the Ordinance and Resolution (see
e.g. AR 473, 479), the court cannot conclude it was unreasonable for the board
to select a penalty of discharge. For all these reasons, the board could
reasonably conclude Petitioner’s refusal to comply with the City’s COVID-19
policies harmed the public service and risked additional harm to the public
service.  
 
Accordingly, the court finds the City did not
commit a manifest abuse of discretion when it discharged Petitioner as a
penalty.  
 
[Whether the City properly discharged Petitioner,
however, is subject to the court’s later analysis of issues raised by Section
2802.]
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Based on the foregoing, on this briefing
the court finds Petitioner established the City violated her Skelly rights
and is entitled to damages based on the violation. 
 
The court also finds to the extent the
City discharged Petitioner based on a valid condition of employment, Petitioner
is entitled to no further relief.
 
As to the Section 2802 issue, the court
intends to consider supplemental briefing and conduct further argument on that
issue alone. The court suggests simultaneous briefing not to exceed three pages
to be served and filed no later than November 1, 2023. The court also suggests
December 1, 2023 at 9:30 as a continued hearing date for the Section 2802
issue.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED. 
 
October 11, 2023
