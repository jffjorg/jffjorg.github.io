And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the issue of whether the names of individual providers on performance score cards must be disclosed. The court has reviewed the evidence presented by both parties, including service agreements, oral representations, and actions by regulatory agencies. The Judge notes that the service agreements have conflicted provisions on confidentiality, and therefore, it is reasonable for Provider Groups to rely on oral representations from Baackes. The Judge also finds that Petitioners have not persuasively responded to the arguments and evidence presented by Respondent, including the ability to track Provider Group performance from year to year with redacted names. The Judge concludes that the issue is still pending and will be addressed at the future Court Hearing.
