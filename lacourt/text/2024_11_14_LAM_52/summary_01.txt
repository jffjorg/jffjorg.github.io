Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions: Plaintiff Maureen Martinez's motion to compel further deposition of Bill Matlock and defendants' motion to compel plaintiff's attendance at an independent mental examination.

Regarding the first motion, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff has shown good cause to require Bill Matlock to answer five specific questions at deposition, but notes that the Plaintiff's counsel failed to meet and confer with the defendants in good faith before filing the motion. The Judge admonishes the Plaintiff's counsel to refrain from filing discovery motions without attempting to informally resolve the dispute.

Regarding the second motion, the Judge grants the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's attendance at an independent mental examination, finding that the plaintiff's mental condition is in controversy in the action and that the defendants have shown good cause for the examination. However, the Judge orders that the examination be conducted within 75 miles of the plaintiff's residence and that the parties meet and confer on selecting a different psychologist if the original examiner is unable to conduct the examination at a location within 75 miles of the plaintiff's residence.
