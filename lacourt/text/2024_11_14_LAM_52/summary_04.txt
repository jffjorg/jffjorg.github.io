The court has reviewed the petition by J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC for approval of the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from payee J. Runia. After considering the relevant factors and circumstances, the court finds that the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in the best interest of J. Runia. The transfer agreement provides that J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC will pay J. Runia $17,500 in exchange for the right to 24 payments of $4,233.91, which is equivalent to a loan at a rate of 8.63% interest. J. Runia intends to use the money to pay off high-interest debt of about $45,000. The court finds that paying off this debt is in J. Runia's best interest, and therefore grants the petition for approval of the transfer.
