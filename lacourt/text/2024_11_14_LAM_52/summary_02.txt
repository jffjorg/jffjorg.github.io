And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge denies Defendant Sandra Mariana Vidal's motion to quash the deposition subpoena issued to Provident Title Company and for a protective order. The subpoena seeks business records related to a dispute over an easement to use part of a property. The Judge finds that the subpoena is not overly broad and is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Judge also finds that the Defendant does not meet her burden of showing that the subpoena violates her right to financial privacy. The Judge notes that the Defendant did not raise objections about the subpoena's scope in her initial brief and that she has not shown good cause for a protective order. The Judge denies the motion and does not award sanctions to the Plaintiff.
