   (Cal. Rules of Court, 3.1324(b).)
            Plaintiff
has not sufficiently complied with Rule 3.1324. As such, the
motion for leave to amend is CONTINUED to November 8, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
Plaintiff is to file a revised declaration which sufficiently addresses the
requirements of Rule 3.1324 by November 1, 2024.
The Court will address Defendant’s
argument regarding the proposed oral agreement relative to the integration
clause and operation of the parol evidence rule. Because Plaintiff seeks to add
a cause of action for fraudulent inducement, the parol evidence rule does not
bar evidence of a prior oral agreement in this regard: 
[T]he recent Supreme Court decision
in Riverisland [*1440]  overruling Pendergrass,
supra, 4 Cal.2d 258 establishes that the evidence is admissible under the
statutory exception for fraud found in section 1856, subdivision (g).

II. The Exception for Fraudulent Inducement
 “Section
1856, subdivision (f) establishes a broad exception to the operation of the
parol evidence rule:  ‘Where the validity of the agreement is the fact in
dispute, this section does not exclude evidence relevant to that issue.’” (Riverisland,
supra, 55 Cal.4th 1169, 1174.) Section 1856, subdivision (g),
expressly states: “This section does not exclude other evidence … to establish
illegality or fraud.” (Italics added.) With respect to fraudulent
inducement, “ ‘It is … settled that  parol evidence of fraudulent
representations is admissible as an exception to the parol evidence rule to
show that a contract was induced by fraud.’ [Citations.]” (Citations
omitted.) Fraud in the inducement occurs “ ‘when “ ‘the promisor knows
what he is signing but his consent is induced by fraud, mutual
assent is present and a contract is formed, which, by reason of the fraud,
is voidable. …’ ” [Citation.]’ ” (Citations omitted.)
(Julius Castle Restaurant, Inc.
v. Payne (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1423, 1439-40 [bold emphasis added].)
            Defendant’s
other arguments—unreasonable delay and prejudice if leave to amend is
permitted—are not persuasive. Trial is set for next year, so there is
sufficient time for Defendant to engage in necessary discovery.  
“Leave to amend is in general required to be
liberally granted (citation omitted), provided there is no statute of
limitations concern. Leave to amend may be denied if there is prejudice to the
opposing party, such as delay in trial, loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation. (Citation omitted.)” (Kolani
v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 402.)
            Where an additional
theory of liability is proposed against an existing defendant, this not
prejudice which would justify the denial of leave to amend.  (See Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490;
see also Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003)
109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761: “[I]t is irrelevant that new legal theories are introduced as long as the
proposed amendments 'relate to the same general set of facts.'
[Citation.]" [Citation omitted].)
Courts must apply a policy of liberality in
permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, including during trial,
when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Huff v. Wilkins (2006) 138
Cal.App.4th 732, 746 [41 Cal. Rptr. 3d 754].) “However, ‘ “even if a good
amendment is proposed in proper form, unwarranted delay in presenting it may—of
itself—be a valid reason for denial.” ’ ” (Ibid.; see Magpali v. Farmers Group,
Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 488 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 225] [“Where the trial date
is set, the jury is about to be impaneled, counsel, the parties, the trial
court, and the witnesses have blocked the time, and the only way to avoid
prejudice to the opposing party is to continue the trial date to allow further
discovery, refusal of leave to amend cannot be an abuse of discretion.”].)
