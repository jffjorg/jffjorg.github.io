And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for prejudgment interest as untimely. The plaintiff had sought an award of prejudgment interest after judgment was entered in their favor in the amount of $313,000.00. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's request for prejudgment interest was made after the 15-day period allowed for such a request had expired. The judge cited the Code of Civil Procedure and relevant case law to support their decision.
