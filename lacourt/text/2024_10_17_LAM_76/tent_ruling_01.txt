TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Josef Mamaliger’s
motion for prejudgment interest is DENIED as untimely. 
Motion For
Prejudgment Interest
Following a court trial, judgment
was entered on July 10, 2024 in favor of Plaintiff in the principal amount of
$313,000.00. Plaintiff seeks an award of prejudgment interest.
            On June 11,
2024, the Court issued a Tentative Decision and Proposed Statement of Decision
whereby the Court made various findings. Among those findings, the Court found
that the terms of the Promissory Note create a usurious transaction which
imposes interest upon interest. (Statement of Decision, Page 13.) Accordingly,
the Court found that the $25,200 in annual interest could not be recovered by
Plaintiff. (Id.)
In Steiny,
the court concluded that the award of interest after entry of the judgment was
proper where the complaint requested prejudgment interest and the parties
stipulated that request for interest would be adjudicated in a postjudgment
hearing. (Steiny, supra, 79 Cal.App.4th at p. 294.) In Rogers,
supra, 65 Cal.App.4th 824, the court stated that, at the latest, a
request for prejudgment interest could be pursued as part of a motion under
Code of Civil Procedure section 657, subdivision 5, on the ground of
“‘inadequate damages.’” (Rogers, supra, at p. 830.) The court
stated such a motion would be timely if made within the “time limits for a
motion for new trial (Code Civ. Proc., § 659).” (Ibid.)
In
the present case, there is no dispute that Watson's request for prejudgment
interest was made less than 15 days after the judgment was filed. As such, the
request was made within the statutory time limit for motions under Code of
Civil Procedure section 657. (Code Civ. Proc., § 659, subd. (a)(2).)
Consequently, we conclude Watson's request for prejudgment interest was timely.

(Watson Bowman Acme Corp. v. RGW Construction, Inc. (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th
279, 298.)
            Here, notice of entry of judgment
was served by the clerk on July 10, 2024 by mail. The instant motion was served
and filed on July 29, 2024. Civ. Proc. Code, § 1013, which extends by 5
calendar days the time for exercising a right or doing an act where service is
by mail, does not apply to the 15 day period in which a service of notice of
intention to move for a new trial must be served and filed. (Civ. Proc. Code, §
659(b).
            The fact that Plaintiff decided to
file a notice of entry of judgment does not extend Plaintiff’s time to bring a
motion for new trial (and thus this motion), because the 15-day period begins
to run at the earlier date of the mailing of notice of entry of judgment by the
clerk of the court. (Civ. Proc. Code, § 659(a)(2).)
            As such, because this motion was
served and filed 19 days after the clerk mailed the notice of entry of
judgment, this motion is untimely and is thus DENIED.
