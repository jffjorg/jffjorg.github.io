And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tri-Star Dyeing & Finishing, Inc. (Plaintiff) v. Brenntag Pacific, Inc. (Defendant). The Plaintiff has moved for leave to file a First Amended Complaint to add a cause of action for fraudulent inducement of the Tank Agreement. The Defendant has opposed the motion.

The judge has continued the motion to November 8, 2024, and ordered the Plaintiff to file a revised declaration by November 1, 2024. The declaration must sufficiently address the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324.

The judge has also stated that the parol evidence rule does not bar evidence of a prior oral agreement in this regard, as the Plaintiff seeks to add a cause of action for fraudulent inducement.

The judge has rejected the Defendant's arguments regarding unreasonable delay and prejudice if leave to amend is permitted. The judge has noted that the proposed amendments relate to the same general set of facts and do not introduce new legal theories. The judge has also stated that the Defendant has sufficient time to engage in necessary discovery, as trial is set for next year.

Overall, the judge has continued the motion for leave to amend and ordered the Plaintiff to file a revised declaration, while rejecting the Defendant's arguments regarding delay and prejudice.
