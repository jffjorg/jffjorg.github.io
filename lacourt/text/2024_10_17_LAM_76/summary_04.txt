And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Andrew Ellis, moves for summary judgment, arguing that he is not liable for the plaintiff's sole claim of breach of contract. The judge agrees with the defendant, ruling that Andrew Ellis is not a party to the contract and therefore not liable for any alleged breach. The judge notes that the plaintiff's own complaint admits that Andrew Ellis is not a party to the agreement, and that the agreement was signed "by" the signatory "for the firm" and not in an individual capacity. The judge also cites California law, specifically Michaelis v. Benavides, which holds that directors and officers are not personally liable on contracts signed by them for and on behalf of the corporation unless they purport to bind themselves individually. Since the defendant has met his initial burden of demonstrating that he is entitled to judgment against the plaintiff, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that a triable issue of material fact exists. However, since the plaintiff failed to file an opposition, the judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
