And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the motion to demurrer filed by Specialty Surgical Center, LLC. The judge has sustained the demurrer in part and overruled it in part.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's first cause of action for medical negligence fails to state a claim because it lacks allegations of duty, breach, and causation. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's second cause of action for corporate negligence fails to state a claim because it lacks allegations of breach and causation.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's third cause of action for assault and battery fails to state a claim because the plaintiff's consent to the surgery was not conditional, and the plaintiff has not alleged any specific condition that was exceeded by the defendants.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the plaintiff's fourth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendants and vicarious liability on the part of Specialty Surgical Center, LLC.

The judge has granted the plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend the complaint.
