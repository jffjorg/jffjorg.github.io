And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The plaintiffs are seeking documents related to the defendant's knowledge of defects in other 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan vehicles, but the judge finds that the requests are duplicative and overbroad. The judge also finds that the requests are unduly burdensome because they require the defendant to review and analyze documents for over 120,000 vehicles. The judge denies the motion in its entirety, finding that the requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also notes that the defendant's earlier productions and the testimony of Chris Lewis, the manager of products analysis, provide adequate foundation for the defendant's contention that undertaking a search and review to produce documents responsive to the requests would cause undue burden.
