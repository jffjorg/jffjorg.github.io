 Case Number:  23NWCV01054    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  F Hanslikdink v. Mike Thompson Recreational Vehicles,
Santa Fe Springs, et al. 23NWCV01054
 
This lemon law action was filed on April 6, 2023. Trial is
currently scheduled for January 17, 2025.  Cross-Defendant Cummins Inc.
now moves ex parte to Continue Trial Date because counsel for Cross-Defendant
will be engaged in another trial. 
 
Cross-Defendant’s application to Continue Trial Date is GRANTED.
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(3) permits a continuance for the
unavailability of counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstance. Here, the trial date was scheduled before Cross-Defendant was
added as a party and Cross-Defendant has requested the parties stipulate to a
continuance on multiple occasions. A trial continuance to a date in March of
2025 or after September 15, 2025, is reasonable. The discovery cut-off date and
related deadlines will correspond with the new trial date. Moving party to give
notice.
