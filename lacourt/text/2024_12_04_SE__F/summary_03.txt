And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., has moved to continue the trial and related dates in a lemon law action filed by Cortez. The original vehicle inspection, scheduled for November 6, 2024, was cancelled and the parties are unable to schedule a new inspection until February 7, 2025. The court has granted the defendant's request to continue the trial and related dates, citing California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(6), which permits a continuance when a party is unable to obtain essential evidence despite diligent efforts. The trial will now begin in May 2025, with the discovery cut-off date and related deadlines adjusted accordingly.
