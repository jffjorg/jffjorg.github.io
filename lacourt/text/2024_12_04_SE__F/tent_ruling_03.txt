23NWCV02319
 
This lemon law action was filed on July 28, 2023. Trial is
currently scheduled to begin on February 20, 2025. Defendant now moves ex parte
to Continue Trial and Related Dates, including the mandatory settlement
conference, to allow time to perform a noticed inspection of the Subject
Vehicle. Here, the vehicle inspection, originally noticed for November 6, 2024,
was cancelled and the parties are unable to schedule an inspection until
February 7, 2025. 
 
Defendants request to Continue Trial and Related Dates is GRANTED.
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(6) permits a continuance for a
party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts. A trial continuance to a date in
May of 2025 is reasonable. The discovery cut-off date and related deadlines
will correspond with the new trial date. Moving party to give notice.
