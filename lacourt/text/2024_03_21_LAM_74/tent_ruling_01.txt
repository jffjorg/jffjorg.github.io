  Case Number:  23STCV30055    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  74 Gavin
Polone, et al. v. New Regency Productions, Inc., et al
Defendants’ Motion to Seal Portions
of Motion to Compel Judicial Reference
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a contractual dispute.
            On
December 5, 2024, Plaintiffs Gavin Polone and Pariah (Plaintiffs) filed a
redacted complaint against Defendants New Regency Productions, Inc, PK Prods,
Inc., and Yariv Milchan (Defendants).
            On
February 13, 2024, Defendants filed a redacted motion to compel
judicial reference and redacted declarations in support. Defendants also
lodged unredacted versions of the papers with the court. That same day,
Defendants filed this motion to seal portions of the motion to compel judicial
reference.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Unless confidentiality is required
by law, court records are presumed to be open to the public. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).) Consequently, pleadings, motions, evidence, and
other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties;
rather, a prior court order is necessary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551,
subd. (a).) 
            To
grant such an order, the court must expressly find that . . . “an overriding
interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the record, an
overriding interest supports sealing the records, a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed, the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550, subd. (d).) 
            If
the court fails to make the required findings, the order is deficient and
cannot support sealing. (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
DISCUSSION  
            In
support of their motion to seal, Defendants cite potentially overriding
interests. First, the motion to compel judicial reference and declarations
contain information that the parties contractually agreed to keep confidential.
(See NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Super. Ct. (Locke) (1999) 20
Cal.4th 1178, 1222.) Under the contract, the parties cannot disclose any
information related directly or indirectly to their agreement and project.
(Complaint, ¶ 40; Ex. A-1, ¶ 11.) Second, the motion to compel judicial
reference discloses the parties’ private financial and proprietary information.
Defendants’ interests would be compromised if the information were open to the
public. 
            Moreover,
Defendants have lodged unredacted papers that highlight the proposed redactions.
The court has reviewed the papers, and the following proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to protect Defendants’ overriding interests:

            However,
the court does not find the following redactions in the memorandum of points
and authorities narrowly tailored: page 9, line 22 to page 10, line 5; page 15,
line 25 to page 16, line 4; page 16, lines 14-25. These proposed redactions are
not limited to protecting Defendants’ cited overriding interests. 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendants’ motion to seal in part.
Defendants
shall give notice.
