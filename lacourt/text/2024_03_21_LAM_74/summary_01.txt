And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to seal portions of a motion to compel judicial reference filed by the defendants, New Regency Productions, Inc., PK Prods, Inc., and Yariv Milchan. The motion seeks to keep confidential certain information related to a contractual dispute between the parties. The court finds that the motion to seal is justified in part, as some of the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the defendants' overriding interests. However, the court does not find that the proposed redactions on certain pages of the memorandum of points and authorities are narrowly tailored, and therefore, those redactions are not granted. The court grants the motion to seal in part and orders the defendants to give notice.
