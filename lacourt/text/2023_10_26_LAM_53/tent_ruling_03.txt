[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiffs’ request for entry of court
  judgment by default
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Plaintiffs Lindsay Hughes and
Connie Hughes
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Court Judgment by Default 
Plaintiffs Lindsay Hughes and Connie Hughes (“Plaintiffs”) request that
the court enter judgment by default against defendant Gregory D. Brandon
(“Defendant”). 
The court notes several defects with Plaintiffs’ default judgment
papers. 
First, Plaintiffs have not submitted the mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) on Judicial Council form
CIV-100.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule
3.1800.) 
Second, although Plaintiffs have submitted a proposed Judgment on
Judicial Council form JUD-100 and supporting declarations, it is unclear the amount
of judgment that Plaintiffs are seeking. 
Although Plaintiffs prayed for damages in the amount of $1,000,000 in
their Complaint, Plaintiffs have not requested that the court award any
damages.  (JUD-100, ¶ 6.)  Further, although Plaintiffs have submitted
their declarations, which may show that they have proven that they are entitled
to some damages, Plaintiffs have nowhere indicated the total amount of damages
that they seek.  (C. Hughes Decl.,
¶ 14 [“I asked the court to enter judgment on my behalf”]; L. Hughes
Decl., ¶ 23 [“I asked the court to enter judgment on my behalf”].)
Third, the court notes that Plaintiffs appear to request prejudgment
interest.  (C. Hughes Decl., ¶ 12; L.
Hughes Decl., ¶ 14.)  However,
Plaintiffs have not set forth the exact calculations used to determine the
amount of interest requested as required. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(3).) 
Finally, the court notes that Plaintiffs have not dismissed Doe
defendants 1-10.  (Compl., p. 1 [naming
as defendants “DOES 1 TO 10”]; Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(7).) 
The court therefore denies plaintiffs Lindsay Hughes and Connie
Hughes’s request for court judgment by default against defendant Gregory D.
Brandon, without prejudice to plaintiffs Lindsay Hughes and Connie Hughes’s
filing new default judgment papers that cure the defects set forth above. 
The court orders that the Order to Show Cause re entry of default
judgment is continued to February 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders plaintiffs Lindsay Hughes and Connie Hughes to file
new default judgment documents required by California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800 (including a proposed judgment on form JUD-100) no later than December
15, 2023.    
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 26, 2023
