And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sustains the defendant's demurrer to the complaint, citing both uncertainty and lack of sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The complaint is deemed ambiguous and unintelligible, and does not state facts sufficient to establish a valid claim against the defendant. The court grants the plaintiff 20 days to file a First Amended Complaint that addresses these defects.
