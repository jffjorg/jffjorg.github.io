[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendant’s demurrer to complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Sean Vallin
(erroneously sued as Sean Villin)  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Demurrer to Complaint
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this demurrer.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Phillip Chatman (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on August
21, 2023, against defendant Sean Vallin (erroneously sued as Sean Villin)
(“Defendant”), alleging a claim for “Landlord [Tenants] Harassment by Guest.”
Defendant now moves the court for an order sustaining his demurrer to
the Complaint.[1] 
The court sustains Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint on
the ground of uncertainty because the Complaint is ambiguous and
unintelligible.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.10, subd. (f).) 
The court sustains Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint on
the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action because Plaintiff has not alleged    (1) a valid cause of action against
Defendant, or (2) facts that are sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.10, subd. (e).)  
ORDER
            The court sustains defendant Sean
Vallin’s demurrer to plaintiff Phillip Chatman’s Complaint. 
            The court grants plaintiff Phillip
Chatman 20 days leave to file a First Amended Complaint that cures the defects
set forth above. 
            The court orders defendant Sean
Vallin to give notice of this ruling.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 26, 2023
