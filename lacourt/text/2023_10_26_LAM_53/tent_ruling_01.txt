MOVING PARTIES:
            Plaintiffs Kazem Sanikhatam,
by and through his successor-in-interest Mitra Azizi, and Mitra Azizi
 
RESPONDING
PARTY:       Defendant Persian-American
Adult Day Health Care Center, Inc., d/b/a Forever Young Adult Day Health Care
Center
Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Admission or, Alternatively, Form Interrogatories
The court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in
connection with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Kazem Sanikhatam, by and through his successor-in-interest
Mitra Azizi, and Mitra Azizi (“Plaintiffs”) move the court for an order (1)
compelling defendant Persian-American Adult Day Health Care Center, Inc., d/b/a
Forever Young Adult Day Health Care Center (“Defendant”) to provide further
responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission, Set Two, numbers 61-70, 74,
76-78, 80-87, 91-97, 99-100, 102, 105, 107-113, 115, and 117-121 or,
alternatively, to provide further responses to Form Interrogatory number 17.1,
and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant in the
amount of $1,110.  
The court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admissions, numbers 61-68, 74, 80, 86,
111, 115, 118, and 120-121 because the answers to those requests are evasive
and incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.290, subd. (a)(1).)  
The court denies Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admissions, numbers 69-70, 76-78, 81-85, 87,
91-97, 99-100, 102, 105, 107-110, 112-113, 117, and 119 because the answers to
those requests are not evasive or incomplete. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court denies Plaintiffs’ alternative request that the court compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two, number 17.1 as an improper
attempt to combine two motions to compel further responses to two sets of
discovery in one motion.
In light of the mixed results of the court’s ruling on this motion,
the court finds that the circumstances presented would make the imposition of
sanctions unjust and therefore denies Plaintiffs’ request for monetary
sanctions against Defendant. 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiffs
Kazem Sanikhatam, by and through his successor-in-interest Mitra Azizi, and
Mitra Azizi’s motion to compel further responses to requests for admission or,
alternatively, form interrogatories, as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.290, the court orders defendant Persian-American Adult Day Health
Care Center, Inc., d/b/a Forever Young Adult Day Health Care Center to serve
further, full and complete answers to plaintiffs Kazem Sanikhatam, by and
through his successor-in-interest Mitra Azizi, and Mitra Azizi’s Requests for
Admissions, numbers 61-68, 74, 80, 86, 111, 115, 118, and 120-121, which comply
with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.210-2033.220, and 2033.240, within
20 days of the date of this order. 
            The court denies all other requests
for relief, including the request for monetary sanctions, made in plaintiffs
Kazem Sanikhatam, by and through his successor-in-interest Mitra Azizi, and
Mitra Azizi’s motion. 
            The court orders plaintiffs Kazem
Sanikhatam, by and through his successor-in-interest Mitra Azizi, and Mitra
Azizi to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
