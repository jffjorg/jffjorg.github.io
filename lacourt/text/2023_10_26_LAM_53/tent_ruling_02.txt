[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production of documents
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Todd Richard Cole   
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Volkswagen Group of America,
Inc. 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Todd Richard Cole (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
compelling defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (“Defendant”) to provide
further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One,
numbers 3, 5, 9, 16-18, 22, 24, and 29-37.
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 3, 5, 16, 18, 22, 24,
and 34-35 because the statements of compliance with those demands are not
incomplete and the objections in the responses are not without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subds.
(a)(1), (a)(3).) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to Request for Production of Documents, number 9 because Defendant’s
representation of its inability to comply with that demand is not inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2).) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 17, 29-33, and 36-37
because the objections in those responses are not without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a)(3).)  
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Todd
Richard Cole’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents. 
            The court orders defendant
Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
