And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff, Joseph Furman, his motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The dismissal was entered on February 14, 2024, after the Plaintiff failed to appear for the order to show cause and did not file a proof of service. However, the Plaintiff's motion is timely and is supported by an affidavit of fault, stating that the Plaintiff mis-calendared the date of the order to show cause. As a result, the case is reinstated. The Judge sets an order to show cause for May 28, 2024, at 9:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
