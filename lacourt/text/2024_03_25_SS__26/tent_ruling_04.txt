ANALYSIS:
 
On November 20, 2023, Petitioner Garden
West Estates (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Declare Mobilehome
Abandoned against Respondents Mizell Jones (“Respondent Jones”) and City of
Gardena (“Respondent City”). On January 4, 2024, Petitioner’s request for entry
of default against Respondents was entered as to Respondent Jones but rejected as
to Respondent City for improper proof of service. (Notice of Rejection,
01/05/24.) On March 4, 2024, Petitioner filed a supplemental declaration
regarding proof of service. To date, no response to the Petition has been
filed. 
 
 
Discussion
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code section 798.61, Petitioner
seeks a court order deeming Respondents’ mobilehome, (“the Mobilehome”) located
at 17700 S Western Avenue, Space 66, Gardena, California (“the Space”), to be
abandoned, and awarding Petitioner rent due on the Mobilehome site from June 5,
2023 to the present, accruing at $736.52 per month, plus other charges,
attorney’s fees, and costs. (Pet., ¶5 and Prayer ¶¶1-6.) 
 
A. Determination of “Abandoned Mobilehome”—Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1), an “abandoned mobilehome” means
a mobilehome about which all of the following are true:
 
(A) It is located in a
mobilehome park on a site for which no rent has been paid to the management for
the preceding 60 days.
 
(B)
It is unoccupied.
 
(C)
A reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned.
 
(D)
It is not permanently affixed to the land.
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (a)(1).) As set forth in the
Petition, no rent has been paid for the Premises and the Mobilehome has been
unoccupied since June 2023. (Pet., ¶6.) The Petition is supported by the
declaration of Petitioner’s property manager, who states no rent has been paid
for the Space and the Mobilehome, which is not affixed to the Space, has been
unoccupied since March 2023. (Stafford Decl., filed 01/04/24, ¶¶6-8.)
Therefore, the Petition demonstrates that the Mobilehome is unoccupied and that
a reasonable person would believe the Mobilehome to be abandoned within the
meaning of Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1).
 
B.         Notice of Belief of Abandonment—Civ.
Code § 798.61(b)
 
Civil Code, section
798.61, subdivision (b) requires: 
 
“After determining a mobilehome
in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome, the management shall post a
notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome for not less than 30 days,
and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known address and to any known
registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and to any known holder of a
security interest in the abandoned mobilehome. This notice shall be mailed by
registered or certified mail with a return receipt requested.”


(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (b).) Petitioner attached a
Notice of Abandonment to the Petition, which indicates that it was served on
Respondents by posting and certified mail. (Proof of Service of Notice of
Abandonment, filed 01/04/24.) This is likewise attested to by the Stafford
declaration. (Stafford Decl., ¶6 and Exh. 1.) Therefore, Petitioner has
satisfied the requirements of Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (b).
 
C.        Petition for Judicial Declaration—Civ.
Code § 798.61(c)
 
Civil Code, section 798.61(c)(1) states:
 
“Thirty or more days following posting
pursuant to subdivision (b), the management may file a petition in the superior
court in the county in which the mobilehome park is located, for a judicial
declaration of abandonment of the mobilehome. A proceeding under this
subdivision is a limited civil case.  Copies
of the petition shall be served upon the homeowner, any known registered owner,
and any known person having a lien or security interest of record in the
mobilehome by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing copies to those
persons at their last known addresses by registered or certified mail with a
return receipt requested in the United States mail, postage prepaid.”  (Emphasis added.)
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (c)(1).) Gardena is located
within the County of Los Angeles, which is within this Court’s jurisdiction.
The instant Petition was filed more than 30 days after the Notice of
Abandonment was posted. Petitioner has shown proper service of the Petition and
initial Notice of Hearing on Respondents. (Proofs of Service by Posting, filed 01/04/24;
Supp. Decl., filed 03/04/24.) 
 
D.        Charges, Attorneys’ Fees, and Costs
 
“If, at the hearing, the petitioner shows by a preponderance
of the evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has been
satisfied and no party establishes an interest therein at the hearing and
tenders all past due rent and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment
of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to which the petitioner is
entitled, and award attorney's fees and costs to the petitioner.” (Civ. Code, §
798.61, subd. (d)(2).) Petitioner asks for accrued rent/storage fees on the
Space in the amount of $6,628.68 based on monthly rent of $736.52 per month
from April 1, 2023 through December 1, 2023 (nine months). (Decl, filed 01/04/24,
¶10.) Accordingly, damages are awarded in the amount of $6,628.68 principal and
$225.00 costs. 
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner Garden West Estates’ Petition to Declare
Mobilehome Abandoned is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $6,628.68
PRINCIPAL AND $225.00 COSTS. PETITIONER IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED
JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
