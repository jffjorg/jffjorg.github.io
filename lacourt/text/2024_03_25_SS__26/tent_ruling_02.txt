ANALYSIS:
 
On February 14, 2022, Plaintiff
Joseph Furman (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the instant action for
breach of contract, common counts, fraud, and intentional tort against
Defendant Edvin Ghahramanian (“Defendant”). The action came for trial on August
14, 2023 at which time Plaintiff requested more time to serve Defendant.
(Minute Order, 08/14/23.) The Court also set an order to show cause regarding
failure to file proof of service for February 14, 2024. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on February 13, 2024 but did not
appear for the order to show cause. When Plaintiff failed to appear at trial,
the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. (Minute Order, 02/14/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on March
4, 2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed less
than one month after dismissal of the action and is supported by an affidavit
of fault. Plaintiff declares that they mis-calendared the date of the order to
show cause as February 16, 2024. (Motion, Furman Decl., ¶9.) Therefore, the
case may be reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(b).

Vacate Dismissal is GRANTED. THE DISMISSAL ENTERED ON FEBRUARY 14, 2024 IS
