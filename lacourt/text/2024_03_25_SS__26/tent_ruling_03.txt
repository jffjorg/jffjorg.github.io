ANALYSIS:
 
On September 14, 2022, Plaintiff Antonio E. Banda, Jr. (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendant Lloyd Vernis (“Defendant”).
Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered
default on November 1, 2022 and default judgment on January 4, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed the first Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment on January 12, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on January
26, 2024. On February 8, 2024, the Court denied the first Motion to Vacate.
(Minute Order, 02/08/24.) Defendant filed the instant Renewed Motion to Vacate
Default and Default Judgment (“the Renewed Motion”) on February 21, 2024.
Plaintiff filed an opposition on March 13, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
As with the first Motion, Defendant again moves to vacate
the entry of default and default judgment. (Notice, p. 1:19-26.) When a party seeks the same relief
that was previously denied, it must bring a renewed motion pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (b). (California Correctional
Peace Officers Ass’n v. Virga (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30, 43, fn. 11; see
also Tate v. Wilburn (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 150, 156-157.) When a motion
has been denied in whole or in part, the moving party may apply again for the
same relief at a later time only upon “new or different facts, circumstances or
law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (b); see Graham v. Hansen (1982)
128 Cal.App.3d 965, 969-970.) 
 
Despite
being a renewed motion, Defendant has not filed a supporting declaration as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The Court lacks the
jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling, on motion of a party, where the
motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (e); Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35
Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) The purpose of this jurisdictional bar is to protect the
Court from repetitive motions. (Ibid.) Also, the statute requires the
moving party “to show a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the
evidence earlier, which can only be described as a strict requirement of
diligence” the purpose of which is to incentivize parties “to efficiently
marshall their evidence.” (Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199 [citing Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
674, 689-690].) Therefore, the Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider its
prior ruling pursuant to Defendant’s Renewed Motion. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff requests an award of attorney’s fees and costs as
sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b),
which provides that relief may be granted upon “any terms as may be just.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) As relief is not granted to Defendant, the
request for sanctions is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Lloyd Vernis’ Renewed Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment is DENIED. Plaintiff Antonio E. Banda’s request for sanctions
is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
