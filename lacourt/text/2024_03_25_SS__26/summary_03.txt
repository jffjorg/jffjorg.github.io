And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's renewed motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against him. The defendant had failed to file a responsive pleading, resulting in the entry of default and default judgment. The judge had previously denied the defendant's first motion to vacate, and the defendant had not filed a supporting declaration as required by law. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as relief was not granted to the defendant.
