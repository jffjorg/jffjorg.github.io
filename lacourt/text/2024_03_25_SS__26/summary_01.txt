And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules in favor of the defendants, granting their motions to compel further responses to discovery requests and requesting sanctions. The plaintiff, Toby Lee Jones, is ordered to serve further responses to form interrogatories, set one, and requests for production, set one, without objections, within 20 days of service of this order. The plaintiff is also ordered to pay sanctions of $948.00 to defense counsel within 20 days of service of this order. The judge finds that the plaintiff's discovery responses were inadequate and that the defendants made a reasonable effort to obtain further responses through meet and confer efforts.
