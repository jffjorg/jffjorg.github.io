ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Toby
Lee Jones (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence
against Defendants Maya Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel (“Defendants”) on
March 18, 2020. The case was not at issue until Defendants filed an answer on
May 10, 2023. On February 20, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motions to
compel initial responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests. (Minute Order,
02/20/24.)
 
On February
21, 2024, Defendants filed the instant (1) Motion for Order Compelling Further
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2)
Motion for Order Compelling Further Responses to Requests for Production, Set
One, and Request for Sanctions. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Notice of the
motion to compel further must be given “within 45 days of service of the
verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or any specific later
date to which the requesting party and the responding party have agreed in
writing,” otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c); § 2031.310, subd. (d).) Plaintiff’s
discovery responses were served electronically on January 8, 2024. (Motions, Rickett
Decl., ¶5.) The Motions were timely filed and served on February 21, 2024. 
 
Also, the Motions must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) The supporting declarations demonstrate
an effort by defense counsel to obtain further responses from Plaintiff after
service of the original responses. (Motions, Rickett Decl., ¶¶6-7 and Exh. A.)
The meet and confer requirement, therefore, is satisfied. 
 
Finally, Cal. Rules
of Court Rule 3.1345 requires all motions or responses involving further
discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the
response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further
responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a).) Alternatively, “the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).) The
Motions are accompanied by separate statements. (Separate Statements, filed 02/21/24.)

 
Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
Defendants move to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 102.8, 102.9, 102.10, 102.11, 107.1, and 120.1
because Defendant’s responses contained meritless objections and were
non-responsive. Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 states in relevant
part: 
 
On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:
 
(1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
 
. . . 
 
(3) An objection to an interrogatory is
without merit or too general.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).) Plaintiff’s
responses to Nos. 102.8, 102.9, 102.10, 102.11, 107.1 were simply objections
despite being untimely such that all objections had been waived. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290.) They also stated that the interrogatories were “not
applicable”, which does not conform to the mode of responses provided for by
statute. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.210, 2030.220.) Finally, the response to
No. 107.1 did not include objections but improperly stated that the information
sought would be provided later. A response that indicates the information will
be provided later is not permitted under the Discovery Code. Therefore,
Defendants are entitled to an order compelling further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 102.8, 102.9, 102.10, 102.11, 107.1. 
 
Request for Production of Documents, Set One
 
A corresponding statute exists with respect to a motion to
compel further responses to requests for production. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a)(3).) Defendants move to compel Plaintiff’s further response
to No. 3, which asks for all writings that support Plaintiff’s claims.
Plaintiff responded with a non-responsive statement that non-privileged
documents would be produced and that a diligent search and reasonable inquiry
were made to comply with the request. (See Separate Statement, filed 02/21/24, No.
3.) Yet the documents were not produced by the due date, as required by
statute, nor did Plaintiff respond to the meet and confer effort. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).) Therefore, Defendants are entitled to an
order compelling a further response to Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, No. 3.
 
 
Sanctions
 
Sanctions are appropriate and have been properly noticed.
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h), 2023.010.) Defendants
request sanctions in the amount of $612.00 per motion based on four hours of
attorney time billed at an hourly rate of $138.00, plus $60.00 in costs.
(Motions, Rickett Decl., ¶8.) The Court finds this amount should be reduced
based on the relative simplicity of this discovery dispute which involves
boilerplate objections and is unopposed. Sanctions are awarded in the amount of
$474.00 per motion based on three hours of attorney time and the filing fee.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Maya Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel’s (1)
Motion for Order Compelling Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion for Order Compelling Further
Responses to Requests for Production, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, are
GRANTED.
