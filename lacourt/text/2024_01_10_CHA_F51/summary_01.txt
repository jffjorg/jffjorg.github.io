And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Jose Zamora and Brenda Valadez, in part and grants it in part. The defendants sought to demur the second cause of action for public nuisance and to strike attorney fees and punitive damages allegations in the complaint. The Judge finds that the complaint states a cause of action for public nuisance and that the alleged injury is of a character different in kind from that suffered by the general public.

The Judge grants the motion to strike the request for attorney's fees and denies the motion to strike the request for punitive damages. The Judge also denies the demurrer and finds that the complaint states a cause of action for public nuisance.

The Judge's ruling is tentative and may be modified after further consideration.
