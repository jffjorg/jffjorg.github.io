Magdaleno v. Muranaka Farm, et al., Case No. 19STCV12070
 
The
Court recently granted the parties’ stipulation to continue the trial date, as
well as all related dates, and set trial for August 20, 2024.  Now,
Defendants seek a brief trial continuance to accommodate another trial from the
personal injury hub.  The Court grants the ex parte application and
advances and continues the final status conference and trial dates as follows:
 
Final
Status
Conference:           
September 20, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. 
 
Trial:                                         
October 1, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. 
 
The
Court denies the ex parte application to the extent it seeks to continue all
related dates.  The discovery and motions deadlines shall be based on the
former trial date (August 20, 2024).  

Defendants’ counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the
Court.
