English-text summary:

The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Defendant, Rob Bowman. The Plaintiff, Dusty Bowman, is seeking to enforce an agreement to modify child support payments made in 2016. The Judge sustains the demurrer to the first and second causes of action with leave to amend, due to concerns about jurisdiction and the statute of frauds. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action for declaratory relief, as it is duplicative of the indemnity claims. The Judge orders the parties to meet-and-confer to resolve the dispute in family court or dismiss the case without prejudice. The Judge also orders the filing of a second amended complaint or a request for dismissal without prejudice by February 20, 2024.
