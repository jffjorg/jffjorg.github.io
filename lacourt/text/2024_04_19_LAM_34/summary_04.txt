And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the second cause of action for negligence in the case of 23STCV24520. The demurrer was filed by Defendant Gelfand, Rennert & Feldman, LLP, and argues that the Defendant does not owe a duty to the Plaintiff, that the economic loss rule prevents the Plaintiff's claim, and that the application of factors under Biakanja v. Irving (1958) do not show that there was a duty. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend the First Amended Complaint. The Judge has concluded that the Plaintiff's allegations do not state a claim for negligence, and that even if the Defendant acted negligently, the Defendant can only be liable for damages on the contract, not for the tort of negligence.
