And here is the English summary:

The Court's tentative ruling denies the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings filed by Sarah Emmi Tibstra. The Court concludes that the plaintiff, Oliver Damavandi, has sufficiently pleaded the causes of action for civil conspiracy, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, accounting, and unfair competition. The Court assumes the truth of the allegations for the purpose of a demurrer or Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Court finds that the defendant's arguments that the causes of action fail due to lack of intent, causation, or property interest are without merit.
