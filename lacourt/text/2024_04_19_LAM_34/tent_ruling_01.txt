ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“A party may move for judgment on the pleadings.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (b)(1).)
 
“The motion provided for in this section may only be
made on one of the following grounds: . . . (B) If the moving party is a
defendant, that either of the following conditions exist: (i) The court has no
jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint.
(ii) The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B).)
 
“A motion for
judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and
hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters
that can be judicially noticed.” (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999, citations omitted.) 
 
“In deciding
or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded material facts
are deemed to be true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred
from those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins. Exch. v. Super. Ct. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 446, 452.)
 
II.       Discussion
 
Damavandi’s FAC contains thirty-two causes of
action. 
 
The eleven causes of action pleaded against
Tibstra are: 
(1)   the
tenth cause of action for civil conspiracy; 
(2)   the twelfth cause of action for aiding and
abetting breach of fiduciary duty; 
(3)   the fourteenth cause of action for aiding and
abetting conversion; 
(4)   the fifteenth cause of action for violation of
Penal Code section 496; 
(5)   the seventeenth cause of action for inducing
breach of contracts; 
(6)   the eighteenth cause of action for intentional
interference with contractual relations; 
(7)   the nineteenth cause of action for intentional
interference with prospective economic relations; 
(8)   the twentieth cause of action for negligent
interference with prospective economic relations; 
(9)   the twenty-fourth cause of action for
restitution to avoid unjust enrichment; 
(10)  the
twenty-fifth cause of action for accounting; and 
(11)  the thirty-second cause of action for violation
of the unfair competition law. 
 
Tibstra moves for judgment on the pleadings
on each of these 11 causes of action. (MJOP, p. 15–16.)
 
A.      Civil
Conspiracy
 
1.      Legal
Standard
 
“The elements of a civil conspiracy are (1)
the formation of a group of two or more persons who agreed to a common plan or
design to commit a tortious act; (2) a wrongful act committed pursuant to the
agreement; and (3) resulting damages.” (City of Industry v. City of Fillmore
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 191, 212.)
 
“Conspiracy is not a cause of action, but a legal
doctrine that imposes liability on persons who, although not actually
committing a tort themselves, share with the immediate tortfeasors a common plan
or design in its perpetration. By participation in a civil conspiracy, a
coconspirator effectively adopts as his or her own the torts of other
coconspirators within the ambit of the conspiracy.¿In this way, a coconspirator
incurs tort liability co-equal with the immediate tortfeasors. Standing alone,
a conspiracy does no harm and engenders no tort liability. It must be activated
by the commission of an actual tort.” (Applied Equip. Corp. v. Litton Saudi
Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 510–511, citations omitted.)
 
2.      Discussion
 
Tibstra argues that the civil conspiracy
cause of action fails because Damavandi does not adequately allege that Tibstra
conspired to commit a tort against Damavandi. (MJOP, p. 5:2–3.)
 
The Court disagrees. 
 
Among other things, Damavandi alleges: (1)
that “Tibstra became intricately involved in these matters and the Scheme to
divest [Damavandi] of his interests, all without [Damavandi’s] knowledge or
consent”; and (2) that “Tibstra . . . entered into a conspiracy to help Aryeh remove
[Damavandi] and eliminate [Damavandi’s] membership interests”. (FAC, ¶¶ 57,
62.)
 
The pleading sufficiently alleges that
Tibstra conspired to commit a tort against Damavandi. 
 
B.      Aiding
and Abetting Causes of Action
 
1.      Legal
Standard
 
a.       Aiding
and Abetting, Generally
 
“California has
adopted the common law rule for subjecting a defendant to liability for aiding
and abetting a tort. Liability may be imposed on one who aids and abets the
commission of an intentional tort if the person (a) knows the other's conduct
constitutes a breach of duty and gives
substantial assistance or encouragement to the other to so act or (b) gives
substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and the
person's own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of duty to
the third person.” (Casey v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n (2005) 127
Cal.App.4th 1138, 1144, cleaned up.)
 
“California
courts have long held that liability for aiding and abetting depends on proof
the defendant had actual knowledge of the specific primary wrong the defendant
substantially assisted.” (Casey, supra,
at p. 1145.)
 
b.       Breach
of Fiduciary Duty
 
“The elements of a cause of action for
breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of a fiduciary relationship, its
breach, and damage proximately caused by that breach.” (City of Atascadero
v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
445, 483.)
 
“There are¿two kinds¿of fiduciary
duties — those imposed by law and those undertaken by agreement.” (Gab Bus.
Servs. v. Lindsey & Newsom Claim Servs. (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 409, 416,
emphasis omitted, overruled in part on other grounds by Reeves v. Hanlon
(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1140, 1154.)
 
“Fiduciary duties are imposed by law in certain technical, legal relationships such
as those between partners or joint venturers, husbands and wives, guardians and
wards, trustees and beneficiaries, principals and agents, and attorneys and
clients.” (Gab Bus. Servs., supra, at p. 416, citations omitted.)
 
“A fiduciary duty is undertaken by
agreement when one person enters into a confidential relationship with another.” (Gab Bus. Servs., supra,
at p. 417.)
 
c.       Conversion
 
“Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the
property of another. The elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the
plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the
defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and
(3) damages.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.)
 
“It is not necessary that there be a manual
taking of the property; it is only necessary to show an assumption of control
or ownership over the property, or that the alleged converter has applied the
property to his own use. Money can be the subject of an action for conversion
if a specific sum capable of identification is involved. Neither legal title nor
absolute ownership of the property is necessary. A party need only allege it is
entitled to immediate possession at the time of conversion. However, a mere
contractual right of payment, without more, will not suffice.” (Farmers Ins.
Exch. v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 451–52 [cleaned up].)
 
2.      Discussion
 
Defendant argues that the causes of action
for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and conversion fail because
Damavandi does not allege that Tibstra had the requisite intent or provided
substantial assistance or that such a tort was even committed. (MJOP, p.
6:8–11.)
 
The Court disagrees.
 
Among other things, Damavandi alleges: (1)
that Tibstra had actual or constructive knowledge of the details surrounding
[the] Projects”; (2) that Tibstra became intricately involved in these matters
and the Scheme to divest [Damavandi] of his interests, all without
[Damavandi’s] knowledge or consent”; (3) that “Tibstra . . . entered into a
conspiracy to help Aryeh remove [Damavandi] and eliminate [Damavandi’s]
membership interests”; (4) that to do this, Tibstra was involved in an effort
to “manufacture a written record against [Damavandi]”; (5) that these actions
were substantial factors in causing Damavandi harm via his interests in the
various entities; and (6) that Aryeh owed various fiduciary duties to
Damavandi. (FAC, ¶¶ 57, 62–64, 113, 143–145, 155–157.)
 
The pleading sufficiently alleges that
Tibstra had the requisite intent and provided substantial assistance to aid and
abet in the torts of conversion and breach of fiduciary duty. 
 
C.      Penal
Code Section 496
 
1.      Legal
Standard
 
“Every person who buys or receives any property
that has been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft
or extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, or who
conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding any
property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained,
shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year,
or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170. . . .” (Pen. Code,
§ 496, subd. (a).)
 
“Any person who has been injured by a violation of
subdivision (a) or (b) may bring an action for three times the amount of actual
damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable
attorney’s fees.” (Pen. Code, § 496, subd. (c).)
 
2.      Discussion
 
Tibstra argues that the cause of action for
violation of Penal Code section 496 fails because no property was stolen and
Tibstra never received, concealed, or withheld any property. (MJOP, p.
7:15–17.)
 
The Court disagrees. 
 
Among other things, Damavandi alleges: (1)
that his interests in various entities had been taken in a manner constituting
theft; and (2) that Defendants have continued to withhold and conceal or aid in
withholding or concealing this property from Damavandi. (FAC, ¶¶ 164–165.)
 
“Property” need not be literally taking a
personal property or real property away — an equity interest in an entity is
sufficient.
 
Furthermore, the Court must assume the truth
of the allegations for the purpose of a demurrer or Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings.  The allegation that Tibstra
withheld and concealed or aided in the withholding and concealing of the
interest from Damavandi is sufficient to allege a violation of Penal Code
section 496, subdivision (a).
 
D.      Inducement
and Interference Claims
 
Defendant argues that the inducement and
interference causes of action fail because Damavandi does not allege the
requisite causation or intent. (MJOP, p. 8:6–7.)
 
The Court disagrees. 
 
Damavandi repeatedly alleges that Tibstra had
the requisite intent and that her actions were a substantial factor in causing
Damavandi damages. (FAC, ¶¶ 178, 180, 183, 186–187, 190, 193–194, 197,
200–201.)
 
E.      Restitution
 
1.      Legal
Standard
 
“Unjust enrichment . . . is synonymous with
restitution.” (Dinosaur Dev., Inc. v. White (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1310,
1314.) 
 
“The elements for a claim of unjust enrichment
are ‘receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of
another.’” (Prakashpalan v. Engstrom, Lipscomb, & Lack (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1132, quoting Lectrodryer v. SeoulBank (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 723, 726.)
 
“The theory of unjust enrichment requires one
who acquires a benefit which may not justly be retained, to return either the
thing or its equivalent to the aggrieved party so as not to be unjustly
enriched.” (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transp. Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d
452, 460.)
 
“In addition, as [trial courts have] observed,
there is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment.” (Melchior
v. New Line Prod., Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793.)
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
Defendant argues that the cause of action for
restitution fails because Damavandi does not allege that Tibstra obtained any
benefit from Damavandi. (MJOP, p. 9:7–8.)
 
Restitution (otherwise known as “unjust
enrichment”) is not a cause of action in California. While restitution might be
available later as a remedy, it is not available as a theory of liability. 
 
However,
“[t]he court must, in every stage of an action, disregard any error, improper
ruling, instruction, or defect, in the pleadings or proceedings which, in the
opinion of said court, does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 475.) Mistakenly arguing a remedy as a theory does not
affect the Parties’ substantial rights. The Court chooses to ignore this defect
with the pleading. 
 
F.       Accounting
 
1.      Legal
Standard
 
“A cause of action for an accounting requires a showing that a
relationship exists between the plaintiff and defendant that requires an
accounting, and that some balance is due the plaintiff that can only be ascertained
by an accounting. An action for accounting is not available where the plaintiff
alleges the right to recover a sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by
calculation. A
plaintiff need not state facts that are peculiarly within the knowledge of the
opposing party.” (Teselle v.
McLoughlin (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 156, 179, citations and paragraph break
omitted.)
 
“[A] fiduciary relationship between the parties is not required to
state a cause of action for accounting. All that is required is that some
relationship exists that requires an accounting. The right to an accounting can arise from the
possession by the defendant of money or property which, because of the
defendant's relationship with the plaintiff, the defendant is obliged to
surrender.” (Teselle, supra, at pp. 179–180, citation omitted.)
 
“[T]he nature of a cause of action in
accounting is unique in that it is a means of discovery. An accounting is a
species of disclosure, predicated upon the plaintiff's legal inability to
determine how much money, if any, is due. Thus, the purpose of the accounting
is, in part, to discover what, if any, sums are owed to the plaintiff, and an
accounting may be used as a discovery device. An action for accounting is not
amenable to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication upon a
showing that the plaintiff does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain the
evidence needed to compel the accounting, because the very purpose of the
accounting is to obtain such evidence.” (Teselle, supra, at p. 180.)
 
2.      Discussion
 
Defendant argues that the cause of action for
accounting fails because Damavandi does not allege that Tibstra owes anything
to Damavandi or that Tibstra had any relationship with Damavandi. (MJOP, p.
9:21–22.)
 
The Court disagrees. 
 
The purpose of an accounting is to determine
the amount of money, if any, is due. It is typically not amenable to a demurrer
or even a motion for summary judgment as it is a discovery device. 
 
Here, Damavandi alleges that an accounting is
necessary to determine how much property and/or money was received by Tibstra
and others as a result of the acts alleged. (FAC, ¶¶ 226–227.) 
 
If in fact no balance is due, then this
should be quickly ascertained through an accounting. But at this stage,
judgment cannot be granted against the pleading when the allegation has been
properly made. 
 
G.      Unfair
Competition Law
 
1.      Legal
Standard
 
“As used in this
chapter, unfair competition shall mean and include any unlawful, unfair or
fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading
advertising and any act prohibited by Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 17500)
of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code.” (Bus. &
Prof. Code, § 17200.)
 
2.      Discussion
 
Defendant argues that the cause of action for
violation of the unfair competition law (“UCL”) fails because: (1) the UCL is
inapplicable; (2) Damavandi cannot seek the available relief; and (3) Tibstra
did not engage in any actionable business acts or practices. (MJOP, p.
10:12–14.)
 
The Court disagrees.
 
Damavandi has alleged that Tibstra engaged in
unfair, unlawful, and fraudulent conduct in violation of the UCL. Damavandi
need not have been a consumer or competitor of Tibstra’s to allege a violation
of the UCL, and questions of fact cannot be resolved on a demurrer.  
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.
