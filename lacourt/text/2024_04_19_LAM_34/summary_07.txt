And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court rules that the anti-SLAPP motions filed by Defendants Litt, Battles, and Kim are GRANTED. The Court finds that the pleadings in the underlying case are protected activity and that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a probability of success in this matter. The Court also finds that the statute of limitations for defamation has expired, and therefore, no cause of action for defamation on these publications is actionable under California law. The Demurrer is taken off calendar as the Defendants have been stricken from the Complaint.
