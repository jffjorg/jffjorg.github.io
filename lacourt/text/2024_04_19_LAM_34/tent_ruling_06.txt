BACKGROUND:
 
On January 9,
2024, Petitioner National General Insurance Company (“Petitioner”) filed its
Petition to Open Superior Court File for Purposes of Obtaining Jurisdiction
Over Uninsured Motorist Matter (“Petition”) against Respondent Ariana Hill
(“Respondent”). The underlying issue in this matter involves an ongoing
arbitration regarding an uninsured motorist claim. 
 
On January
23, 2024, Petitioner filed its Proof of Service. 
 
On March 1,
2024, Petitioner filed Motion to have Truth of Matters Specified in Requests
for Admissions (Set No. 1) be Deemed Admitted [and] Request for Sanctions
(“RFAs Motion”). Petitioner concurrently filed its Proposed Order. 
 
No
oppositions or other responses have been filed regarding the discovery motions.

 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a response
from the party to whom the request for admissions is directed within 30 days
after service of the request for admissions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250,
subd. (a).)
 
If the party fails to serve a timely response,
“the party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection
to the requests.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
 
The requesting party may then “move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanction
under Chapter 7.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
A court will deem requests admitted, “unless
it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.
It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A.      The
Discovery Requests
 
“[T]he uninsured motorist law grants the superior court the exclusive
jurisdiction to hear discovery matters arising under uninsured motorist
arbitrations.” (Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th
913, 926, italics in original, citing Ins. Code, § 11580.2, subd. (f).)
 
        Here, Petitioners moves the Court to
deemed admitted the truth of all matters specified in the requests for
admission (“RFAs”) that were served by Petitioner on Respondent on January 8,
2024. (RFAs Motion, p. 12:12–14 and Exh. E.)
 
        Respondent does not oppose or other
respond to the motions. 
 
        The Court does not have any evidence
that would indicate responses to the RFAs have been served. Rather,
Petitioner’s Counsel declares that no such responses have been served. (RFAs
Motion, ¶ 13.)
 
        The Court GRANTS the RFAs Motion.
 
        The COURT DEEMS ADMITTED the truth of
the matters specified in the requests for admission. 
 
B.      Sanctions
 
Petitioner requests $661.65 in monetary sanctions. (RFAs
Motion, p. 12:15–19.)
 
        Respondent has recently lost her legal
representation, through no fault of her own. (Notice of Status; MC-052, filed
3/20/2024.) The Court finds that monetary sanctions are not appropriate here. 
 
        The Court DENIES the Request for
Monetary Sanctions. 
 
III.    
Conclusion
 
The RFAs Motion is GRANTED. 
The truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission are
DEEMED ADMITTED.  The Request for
Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.
