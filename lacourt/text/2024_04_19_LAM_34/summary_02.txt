And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

Based on the Plaintiff's repeated failures to serve the complaint and file the Case Management Statement (CMS), and his numerous excuses and requests for continuances, the Court has dismissed the case without prejudice. Despite numerous opportunities to comply with court orders, the Plaintiff failed to take the necessary steps to move the case forward. The Court has repeatedly warned the Plaintiff of the consequences of non-compliance, and has granted him multiple extensions and continuances. However, the Plaintiff's excuses and requests have become increasingly frivolous, and the Court has lost patience with his lack of progress. Therefore, the Court has dismissed the case, allowing the Plaintiff an opportunity to re-file or re-start the case in the future.
