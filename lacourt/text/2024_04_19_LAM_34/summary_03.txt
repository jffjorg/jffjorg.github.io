And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has dismissed the case without prejudice. The plaintiff failed to file the required documents for entry of default judgment, and therefore, the court cannot enter default judgment. The court had set an order to show cause (OSC) for April 19, 2024, giving the plaintiff an opportunity to comply with the requirements. However, since the plaintiff failed to file the necessary documents, the court has dismissed the case.
