And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to deem the truth of matters specified in the requests for admission (Set No. 1) as admitted. The judge finds that the respondent did not oppose or respond to the motion, and there is no evidence that the respondent served a proposed response to the requests for admission. The judge orders that the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission are deemed admitted. Additionally, the judge denies the request for monetary sanctions of $661.65, finding that the respondent recently lost her legal representation through no fault of her own.
