  - "excluding an award of prejudgment interest is not only nonsensical, but would fail to completely accomplish the public policy goals of § 917.1."

And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the sufficiency of Dakovic & Sons' (DAK) appeal bond in a case where a jury awarded a verdict in favor of three named plaintiffs (P), including Desiree Flaws (P-Flaws), against DAK and Ameron International Corp. DAK failed to procure a bond specifically for P-Flaws' judgment, and P-Flaws argues that DAK's bond is insufficient to cover all judgments. The judge finds that P-Flaws' objection to the undertaking is timely and that DAK's bond does not cover all judgments. The judge orders DAK to submit an additional appeal bond in the amount of $405K (1.5x of P-Flaws' judgment) within 30 days or else P-Flaws may begin execution of her judgment. The judge also finds that prejudgment interest awarded to the plaintiffs must be covered by the appeal bond.
