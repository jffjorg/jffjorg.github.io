I
INTRODUCTION
            In this asbestos personal injury
matter, a jury trial was held in May-June 2023 and on 6/26/23 the jury rendered
a verdict in favor of all 3 named Plaintiffs (“P”) and against Defendants JMM
and Dakovic & Sons (“DAK”).  Judgment
was entered on 9/27/23.  Both Defendants
have filed Notices of Appeal.  Pursuant
to CCP § 917.1, in order to forestall any enforcement actions against a
judgment pending appeal, the debtor must post an undertaking/bond in the amount
of 1.5X the judgment or order awarded, including costs.  Here, Plaintiff Desiree Flaws (“P-Flaws”)
asserts that DAK failed to procure such a bond/undertaking to cover her
judgment against DAK.  DAK disputes this
claim and asserts that it has a bond sufficient to cover all 3 Plaintiffs’
judgments.
            
 
 
II
ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Timeliness of P’s Objection
With respect to DAK’s argument that P-Flaws’
objection is untimely, this Court finds 
the
objection timely.  DAK’s filing of a
Rider to the original undertaking was done on 7/9/24, which for the first time
purported to cover P-Flaws’ judgment and costs. 
P-Flaws filed her objection within the 10 day deadline mandated by
CCP  995.930, by filing this motion on 7/18/24.
 
B.   
Arguments of the Parties re: Sufficiency of Undertaking

P-Flaws was awarded a judgment in damages
for $270K (for simplicity, all sums in this Order shall for purposes of readability
be rounded off to the nearest $1K).  Under
CCP § 917.1, the undertaking/bond must be for 1.5X the judgment, thereby equaling
$405K to cover P Flaws’ $270K judgment.  DAK
has not posted an undertaking/bond specifically for P-Flaws, and she therefore asserts
that enforcement of her judgment shall not be stayed pending appeal per 
§
917.1(a).
            DAK admits that it did not initially
procure a bond specifically for P-Flaws’ judgment, but argues that her judgment
is nonetheless protected because DAK procured a bond in the amount of $4.715M,
which is purported to cover the entire judgment (including costs) that was
ordered against DAK and in favor of all 3 Plaintiffs, including P-Flaws.  Specifically, DAK asserts that the judgment
against them and in favor of all Plaintiffs totals $3.143M, which when multiplied
by 1.5 equals approximately $4.715M.  DAK
argues that because it subsequently executed a Rider to the bond adding P-Flaws,
it cured the initial failure of a bond protecting her interests.  In so doing, DAK asserts that all of
Plaintiff’s judgements and costs (including P-Flaws’) are collectively
protected by the $4.715M bond.
            P-Flaws appears to have little
quarrel with the structural idea of one bond covering all 3 plaintiffs’
interests, but instead argues that DAK’s figures do not reflect the full amount
of DAK’s liability to all 3 Plaintiffs, including P-Flaws.  According to P-Flaw’s calculations, the total
judgment owed by DAK to all 3 plaintiffs is $3.678M and therefore 1.5X that
figure totals $5.517M.  This is the
amount P-Flaws argues should be undertaken to cover all debts to all 3 plaintiffs
by DAK.  Comparing that figure to DAK’s bond
of $4.715M, the shortfall according to P-Flaws is $802K.  The major disagreement seems to stem from P-Flaws’
position that the $534.8K in pre-judgment interest awarded must be covered by
the appeal bond and DAK’s position that this figure is exempt from appeal bond
coverage.
 
C.   
Pre-Judgment Interest
Prejudgment interest is authorized under
CC § 3291 when a plaintiff makes a settlement 
offer
pursuant to CCP § 998, which is rejected by a defendant and the plaintiff subsequently
wins a judgment exceeding the settlement offer sum.  In such a situation, the P is entitled to 10%
pre-judgment interest starting from the date of P’s first offer and running
until the judgment is satisfied.  CCP §
3291.  Here, P’s made a collective § 998
offer to DAK to settle for $500K, which DAK rejected, and Plaintiffs recovered
a verdict against DAK in the amount of approximately $2.63M, exclusive of costs
and interest.  
            DAK cites Hess v. Ford Motor Co. (2002)
27 Cal.4th 516, 532 for the proposition that 
§
3291 prejudgment interest, while awardable, cannot be a part of the
judgment.  This conclusion was compelled by
the Supreme Court’s finding that prejudgment interest could not be compounded post-judgment;
in other words, the Hess court wanted to expressly avoid awarding post-judgment
interest on a pre-judgment interest award. 
Id. at 531 (“Section 3291 provides for a single award of
interest and expressly eschews any division of this award into separate
prejudgment and postjudgment components.”) 
This analysis, while interesting, has no bearing on the issue at bar, i.e.,
whether the appeal bond under § 917.1 must cover prejudgment interest.  
            CCP § 917.1 explicitly covers an
undertaking on appeal to cover, inter alia, “money . . .. payable by the appellant,”
and “costs awarded pursuant to Section 998.”  There is no question that the prejudgment
interest awarded by this Court is money owed and payable by the appellant, DAK.  Moreover, while CCP § 998 does not expressly authorize
the award of prejudgment interest, CC § 3291, explicitly conditions the award of
prejudgment interest on when “a plaintiff makes an offer pursuant to Section 998
of the CCP which the defendant does not accept . . . and the plaintiff obtains
a more favorable judgment . . . .”  In
such a scenario, CCP § 3291 awards 10% interest starting on the date of the first
§ 998 offer, and such “interest shall accrue until the satisfaction of judgment.”  Thus, while not expressly authorized under §
998, prejudgment interest is clearly another type of reward available to a
plaintiff who chooses to offer settlement pursuant to CCP § 998 and prevails in
that endeavor.  Put in terms of this case,
the $535K award in prejudgment interest is an additional penalty imposed on DAK
for failing to accept P’s $500K § 998 offer. 
This is money owed to Plaintiffs for prevailing on both this suit as
well as their § 998 offer.  The obvious policy
behind making a defendant/appellant post an undertaking per § 917.1 is to ensure
that the prevailing appellee can be made whole for the amount awarded to it
before undergoing the additional cost and expense of an appeal.  The flip side of that same policy is to ensure
that defendant/appellants can and will pay the award against them before subjecting
the plaintiff/appellees and the entire court system to the cost and expense of
an appeal; i.e., that the appeal is not simply an exercise in futility.  Excluding an award of prejudgment interest is
not only nonsensical, but would fail to completely accomplish the public policy
goals of § 917.1.
            For these reasons, this Court finds
that prejudgment interest already awarded against DAK in favor of the
Plaintiffs must be covered by their appeal bond/undertaking.  1.5 times the $535K in prejudgment interest
equals $802.5K, however that amount includes the prejudgment interest due to
all 3 name plaintiffs and not just P-Flaws. 
Rather than calculating what portion of that figure is attributable to
P-Flaws alone, (as P-Flaws is the only Plaintiff complaining about the bond
amount), DAK is ordered to submit an additional appeal bond in the amount of $405K
(1.5x of her judgment of $270K) for the benefit of P-Flaws within 30 days of
this Order or else P-Flaws may begin execution of her judgment.
