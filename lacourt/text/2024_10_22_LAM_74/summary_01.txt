And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by Defendant Fred Wendall Vickers: a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint and a motion for leave to amend the answer. The judge has granted both motions.

Regarding the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, the judge found that Vickers' motion was filed in good faith and that Vickers failed to timely file the cross-complaint due to inadequate legal advice. The judge declined to assess the merits of the cross-complaint at this time and granted Vickers' motion.

Regarding the motion for leave to amend the answer, the judge found that Vickers' proposed amendments were necessary and proper, and that Vickers had provided adequate notice and a declaration explaining the reasons for the proposed amendments. The judge granted Vickers' motion and allowed the proposed amendments to the answer.

The judge noted that the proposed amendments would allow Vickers to add 27 affirmative defenses and correct errors in the original answer. The judge also noted that the proposed amendments would require Plaintiff to expand its discovery and that trial is one year away.
