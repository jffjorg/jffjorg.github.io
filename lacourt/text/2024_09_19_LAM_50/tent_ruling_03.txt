[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
MOTION TO EXPUNGE NOTICE OF PENDENCY OF
  ACTION AND FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF $897.00.00



 
 
Background
Plaintiff Judith Baldwin
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on March 2, 2022 against, inter alia, Defendant
Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (“SPS”) On December 27, 2022, Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint, alleging fourteen causes of action. 
SPS now moves to “to
expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action recorded by [Plaintiff] on or about
March 11, 2022 as Instrument No. 20220288017 and for attorney’s fees in the
amount of $897.00.00.”[1]
The motion is unopposed. 
            Legal Standard
The authorization to
file a notice of lis pendens is found in section
405.20 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That statute provides in part: “A
party to an action who asserts a real property claim may record a notice of
pendency of action in which that real property claim is alleged. The
notice may be recorded in the office of the recorder of each county
in which all or part of the real property is situated.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.20.) “The whole idea of a notice of lis pendens is to
give constructive notice of the legal proceeding affecting title to a specific
piece of property.” ((Gale v. Superior Court (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1396.)
“A court shall order a notice of lis pendens expunged if it
determines (1) that the pleading on which the notice is based does not contain
a real property claim (§ 405.31); (2) that the
claimant has not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, the probable
validity of a real property claim (§ 405.32); or
(3) that adequate relief can be secured by an undertaking. (§ 405.33.)…Unlike most motions, the party opposing a motion to expunge bears the
burden to show the existence of a real property claim….In considering whether
the burden has been met, the court engages in a demurrer-like analysis.”
((Shoker v. Superior Court (2022)
81 Cal.App.5th 271, 277 [internal quotations omitted].)
            Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 405.30, “[a]t any time
after notice of pendency of action has been recorded, any party, or any
nonparty with an interest in the real property affected thereby, may apply to
the court in which the action is pending to expunge the notice. However, a
person who is not a party to the action shall obtain leave to intervene from
the court at or before the time the party brings the motion to expunge the
notice. Evidence or declarations may be filed with the motion to expunge the
notice. The court may permit evidence to be received in the form of oral
testimony, and may make any orders it deems just to provide for discovery by
any party affected by a motion to expunge the notice. The claimant shall have
the burden of proof under Sections
405.31 and 405.32.” 
Discussion
In the motion, SPS
asserts that “[i]n connection with her action, Plaintiff caused the Lis Pendens
to be recorded against the Property on March 11, 2022.” (Mot. at p. 3:11-12.)
SPS asserts that “[t]he entire action was dismissed on March 24, 2024. As such,
there is no longer any pending action which affects title to or the right to
possession of the Property. For this reason, alone, the Lis Pendens must be
expunged.” (Mot. at p. 4:7-9.) On May 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for
dismissal of the Complaint, without prejudice. Dismissal was entered on May 24,
2024.  
As an initial matter, SPS
does not provide evidence of any notice of lis pendens in connection with the
motion. The sole declaration filed in support of the motion is silent as to the
lis pendens. Thus, the Court does not find
that SPS has demonstrated grounds for the Court to grant the instant motion. 
SPS asserts that it is “entitled to its
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for the preparation of this Motion to
Expunge.” (Mot. at p. 4:12-14.) SPS cites to Code of Civil Procedure section 405.38, which provides that “[t]he court shall direct that the
party prevailing on any motion under this chapter be awarded the reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing the motion unless the court
finds that the other party acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s fees and costs unjust.” 
As SPS did not prevail on the instant motion, the Court
denies SPS’s request for attorney’s fees. 

Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, SPS’s motion is denied, without prejudice. 
SPS is ordered to
provide notice of this ruling.
