And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court denies the motion to expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action and for attorney's fees in the amount of $897.00.00, filed by Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. ("SPS"). SPS asserts that the Notice of Pendency of Action was recorded on March 11, 2022, and that the action was dismissed on March 24, 2024. However, SPS fails to provide evidence of the Notice of Pendency of Action in connection with the motion. The Court finds that SPS has not demonstrated grounds for the Court to grant the instant motion. SPS also requests attorney's fees, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 405.38, but the Court denies this request as SPS did not prevail on the motion. The Court orders SPS to provide notice of this ruling.
