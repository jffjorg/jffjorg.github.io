Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 520, fn. 2.)
 


[2]The Court notes
that the County raises certain arguments for the first time in its reply. “¿Points
raised for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered,
because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to
counter the argument.¿” (See American Drug
Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453¿.) Plaintiff has not had the opportunity to
address the points raised for the first time in the County’s reply. Thus, the
Court disregards such points. 


[3]Plaintiff does not
appear to specify what the acronym “COLA” refers to.
