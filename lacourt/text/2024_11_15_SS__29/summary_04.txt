And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff had filed a complaint on February 24, 2022, alleging negligence and negligent entrustment arising from an automobile accident on March 30, 2020. However, the plaintiff failed to appear at the Final Status Conference and trial, and the action was dismissed on August 24, 2023. The plaintiff has now filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, which the judge has granted on equitable grounds. The judge has found that the plaintiff's attorney lost track of the trial date due to external circumstances, which was an extrinsic mistake that deprived the plaintiff of the opportunity to litigate the case on the merits. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to support a potentially meritorious case and that the plaintiff acted diligently in seeking relief once the mistake was discovered. The judge has set a trial setting conference for approximately 45 days.
