Background
On September 14, 2021, Claudia Herrera (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Charly Romualdo Trigueros Rivera, Susan Trigueros, Monique
Robledo (“Defendant”), and Does 1 through 21 for motor vehicle negligence arising
out of an accident occurring on October 18, 2019.
 
On October 5, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to
name Selvin Trigueros as Doe 1.
 
On December 18, 2023, Defendant filed an answer to the
complaint.  On the same day, Defendant
also filed a cross-complaint against Charly Romualdo Trigueros Rivera, Selvin
Trigueros, and Roes 1 through 20.
 
On October 22, 2024, Defendant filed these
three motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to written discovery. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not
provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant moves
for an order compelling Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for Production of Documents, Set
One. 
On February 27,
2024, Defendant propounded the written discovery in question on Plaintiff. (Wilson
Decls., ¶ 3; see also Exhs. A.) Plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery. (Id.,
¶ 6.) 
Defendant need
show nothing more.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motions to compel are granted.
The requests for sanctions are denied.  In the
chapters of the Civil Discovery Act governing interrogatories and requests for
production, the Legislature has authorized sanctions in the context of a motion
to compel initial responses “against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion
to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, however, Plaintiff has not opposed
the motion, and so the requests for sanctions are denied.

Court GRANTS Defendant Monique Robledo’s motions to compel.
