```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has decided to continue the hearing on the motions to compel Albertsons Safeway LLC to provide further responses to discovery for approximately 45 days. This decision is based on the Eighth Amended Standing Order For Procedures In The Personal Injury Hub Courts, which requires parties to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) before hearing motions to compel further discovery responses. Since the parties have not yet participated in an IDC, the court has scheduled the hearing for a later date to allow for this conference to take place. The moving party, Coolsys, Inc., is ordered to give notice of the new hearing date.
