And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Defendant's motions to compel the Plaintiff to respond to written discovery. The Plaintiff failed to respond to the Defendant's Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, which were propounded on February 27, 2024. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to serve written, verified, and code-compliant responses to the Defendant's discovery requests within 15 days of notice. The Judge has also denied the Defendant's requests for sanctions, as the Plaintiff did not oppose the motions to compel.
