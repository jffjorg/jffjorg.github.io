And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion filed by Plaintiffs' Counsel, Daniel Azizi, to be relieved as attorney record. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Despite Counsel's efforts to verify Plaintiffs' address, the relationship has become untenable. The court finds that Counsel has established good cause to be relieved as attorney record. The motions are granted, and the dates in the proposed orders will be corrected. The orders will be effective once proof of service showing service of the signed order on the clients has been filed with the court.
