And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Plaintiff's counsel, Hazel Chang, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed on October 24, 2024, but was not served on the client and other parties until October 24, 2024, which is 16 court days before the scheduled hearing date of November 15, 2024. The judge notes that the service of the motion was untimely, and therefore denied the motion. The judge also references the legal standards and rules governing the withdrawal of counsel, including the California Rules of Professional Conduct and the California Rules of Court.
