v. Singh
21STCV13775
Defendant’s Motion to Exclude Trial Testimony of Plaintiff’s Experts
Tentative
The
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Background
On April
12, 2021, Juan Pelayo (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Ranjit Singh, individually
and d.b.a. Gora Transport (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes
of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of an
automobile accident on June 10, 2019.
 
On July
6, 2021, Defendant filed an answer. 
 
On October 14,
2024, Defendant filed this motion to exclude the
testimony of Plaintiff’s experts. On November 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition. No reply has been filed.
 
Trial is set for
December 2, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
California Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.300
provides that if certain conditions are satisfied, and subject to certain
exceptions, “the trial court shall exclude from evidence the expert opinion of
any witness that is offered by any party who has unreasonably failed to …
[m]ake that expert available for a deposition.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.300, subd. (d).)  The trial court also has inherent authority
to exclude evidence when a party has acted unfairly and prejudice would result
to the other party.  (Cottini v. Enloe
Medical Center (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 401, 428.)¿ 
Discussion 
Defendant moves to exclude the testimony of
Plaintiff’s experts Brendan Bourdage, Ph.D. and John Smith P.E. (Fang Decl., ¶¶
2, 4.) 
In cases assigned to the Personal Injury Hub,
the case will be tried by a different judge than the one assigned to rule on
this motion. The trial judge makes the decisions regarding requests to preclude
any witness, including an expert witness, from testifying.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.300.)  And, indeed, Defendant has filed a Motion in
Limine (No. 4) to exclude the expert witness testimony of Mr. Smith.  
There is no need for two judges to rule on
the same motion.  The motion is properly
one for the trial court to rule on, whether through a motion in limine or other
timely objection by Defendant.  This
request for exclusion of testimony is one for the trial judge to make.
Accordingly, motion is denied without
prejudice. 
Conclusion 
The Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the motion
of Defendant Ranjit Singh, individually and d.b.a. Gora Transport to exclude
Plaintiff’s Experts’ Testimony.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
