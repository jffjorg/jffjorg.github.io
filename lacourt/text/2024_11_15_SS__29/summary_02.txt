```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiff's experts without prejudice. The defendant had argued that the experts, Brendan Bourdage and John Smith, should be excluded from testifying because they had not been made available for deposition. However, the judge has determined that this is a matter for the trial judge to decide, and not for the judge hearing the motion. The judge has also noted that the trial court has inherent authority to exclude evidence when a party has acted unfairly and prejudice would result to the other party. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice, and the defendant is ordered to give notice. The case will proceed to trial on December 2, 2024.
