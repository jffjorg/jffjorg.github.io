On June 14,

Victoria Murcia, Luis Hidalgo, Herminio Hidalgo, Virginia Hidalgo, Hidalgo
H&V Bypass Trust, and Does 1 through 50 for (1) negligence, (2) statutory
liability – dog bite statute, and (3) strict liability arising out of an

Herminio Hidalgo filed an answer. On April 3, 2024, Defendants Herminio Hidalgo
and Virginia Hidalgo were dismissed. 
 
On October 24,
2024, Hazel Chang, Esq. of Wilshire Law Firm (“Counsel”)
filed this motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. 
 
No opposition
has been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284, subd.(b).) An attorney is permitted to
withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable
to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct
3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel seeks to
be relieved as Plaintiff’s attorney of record. 
However, the
service of motion was untimely; 16 court days before this November 15 hearing was
October 23, plus five days for mail service, requires mail service of the
papers by no later than October 18. (See Code of Civil Procedure section
1005(b).) Service of this motion was made on October 24.
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
 
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.  
 
Moving counsel
to give notice.
