And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case Paez v. Alta Construction, Inc., et al. The case involves a slip and fall accident that occurred in February 2021, and the cross-complainant, 330 North Brand, Inc., is seeking indemnity from the cross-defendant, Infinity Insurance Company, for any damages assessed against it by the plaintiff.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for express indemnity, finding that the cross-complaint does not clearly allege the existence of an express indemnity agreement with the moving cross-defendant. The court has given the cross-complainant leave to amend to more clearly allege the existence of an express indemnity agreement.

The court has also granted the motion to strike the allegations and prayer for attorney's fees included in the cross-complaint, finding that the cross-complaint does not sufficiently allege that such fees are specifically provided for by statute, or by agreement of the parties. The court has given the cross-complainant leave to amend to more clearly allege the basis for any allegations and prayers involving attorney's fees.

The court has cautioned counsel for cross-defendant that future pleadings must be filed in conformity with the statutes, rules, and procedures governing this litigation, and that the court may refuse to consider pleadings not filed in conformity with such rules.

The parties are ordered to meet and confer in full compliance with CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5 before any further demurrer or motion to strike may be filed.
