And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the court's thoughts on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Cahit Soyat dba Roma Pizza. The demurrer challenges the plaintiff, A&T Advisors dba Anchor Bookkeeping's, complaint and seeks to dismiss the case. The court has considered the demurrer and has ruled that:

* The demurrer will be sustained with leave to amend to the first cause of action for breach of contract, as the pleading does not clearly indicate whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct.
* The demurrer will be overruled to the second, third, and fourth causes of action for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and quantum meruit, as the complaint alleges sufficient facts to plead around the economic loss rule.
* The court will not consider the demurrer without a meet and confer declaration, and the parties are cautioned to comply with this requirement in the future.

The case involves a dispute over a consulting services agreement between the plaintiff and defendant, with the plaintiff alleging that the defendant failed to pay for services rendered and made representations that induced the plaintiff to enter into the agreement. The court's ruling is a tentative ruling, and the parties may still object or appeal the decision.
