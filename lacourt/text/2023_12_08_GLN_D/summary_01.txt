The tentative ruling is a decision by the Judge regarding the motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendant, David Chang. The Judge notes that the client has not responded to attempted communications and has ignored the request for consent. The Judge also notes that the client is in breach of the legal services agreement. The motion to be relieved as counsel was originally scheduled for October 27, 2023, but was continued to December 8, 2023, due to lack of notice to the client. The Judge orders that the motion is denied or continued to permit proper notice to be served on the client. If proper notice can be shown, the proposed order will be modified and the motion will be granted. The Judge also notes that the client has not been given notice of the hearing date and that the moving party has not submitted a notice or proof of service showing that the client has been given notice of the new hearing date.
