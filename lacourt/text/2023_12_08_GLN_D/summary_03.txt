Significant Statements:
  - "The decision on how to treat plaintiff's dog bite was not in the purview of the nursing and non-physician staff of the clinic. This was a physician's decision." (David Barcay, M.D.)
  - "The patient had neurologic symptoms related to his finger prior to his abscess being drained. After the abscess was drained the neurologic symptoms persisted despite drainage of the abscess which would be more indicative, to a reasonable medical probability, that the nerve injury was related to the dog bite and not the abscess." (Howard Pitchon, M.D.)
  - "Dr. Martello sutured the dog bite wound extremely tightly, which is not recommended even with ongoing bleeding because of the heightened risk of retained infection with an animal bite." (Sanjeev Puri, M.D.)
```

Summary:

The tentative ruling is in favor of the plaintiff, denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The ruling finds that triable issues of fact exist regarding the defendants' alleged negligence and medical malpractice. The expert testimony of Sanjeev Puri, M.D. raises questions about whether Dr. Martello's treatment of the plaintiff fell below the standard of care and caused or contributed to the plaintiff's alleged injuries. The ruling also notes that Glendale Urgent Care is vicariously responsible for Dr. Martello's actions as an employee.
