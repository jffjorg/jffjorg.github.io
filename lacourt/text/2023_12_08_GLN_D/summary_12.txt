Significant Statements:
  - "The court finds that due process concerns are satisfied here by the court's consideration of defendants' opposition papers filed on October 23, 2023, in connection with the court's current review for this hearing of the tentative ruling on plaintiffs' original motion, as published to the parties prior to September 15, 2023 hearing, limiting recovery to fees permitted by statute, as previously allocated and limited by the court."
  - "The court will find these billing rates reasonable."
  - "The court finds it is reasonable to allocate 25% of the time spent by the plaintiffs' attorneys in prevailing on the statutory cause of action for which fees are awardable, and in establishing the uninhabitability issues to support that cause of action."
  - "The court finds that the remaining 75% of the time was directed to pursuing the separate theories upon which the emotional distress damages were awarded."
  - "The court determines that the total fees which can be claimed in this matter are $100,881.05."
  - "The court will also reduce from the fees the half of that second charge which would pertain to this matter, resulting in a further reduction of $1,625."
  - "The total of $100,881.05, reduced by $350 ($100,531.05) and by $1,625 results in a subtotal of $98,906.05."
  - "The court finds that 25% of this sum is $24,726.51, which the court finds to represent the reasonable sum of fees to be awarded to plaintiffs as prevailing parties under Civil Code section 1942.4 (b)(2)."
