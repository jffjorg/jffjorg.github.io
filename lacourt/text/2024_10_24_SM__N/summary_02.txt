And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiffs, Herbert C. Rubinstein and Colby Development LP, have filed a motion to vacate a judgment of dismissal of their complaint. The judgment was entered on February 5, 2024, and the plaintiffs are seeking to set it aside due to the negligence and abandonment of representation by their former attorney. The attorney failed to serve any responses to discovery, failed to oppose discovery motions, and failed to notify the plaintiffs of motions and resulting orders.

The court has granted the plaintiffs' motion, finding that there is a proper basis to vacate the judgment. The court has also granted the plaintiffs' request for judicial notice of 12 court records in the action. The court has determined that the plaintiffs' motion was timely filed, as it was made less than six months after the entry of the judgment. The court has also accepted the plaintiffs' sworn statement that they provided discovery responses to their attorney, but the attorney did not communicate with them and they had no knowledge of the motions or failure to provide discovery responses or appear at hearings.

The court has concluded that the plaintiffs have provided a satisfactory excuse for not properly prosecuting the action and complying with discovery obligations, and they have timely moved to set aside the judgment. As a result, the court has granted the plaintiffs' motion to vacate the judgment of dismissal of their complaint.
