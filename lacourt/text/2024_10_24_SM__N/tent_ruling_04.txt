 Case Number:  24SMCV03659    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGPlaintiff Oakhurst Income Fund I, LP’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication is GRANTED.Plaintiff Oakhurst Income Fund I, LP shall prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.Plaintiff Oakhurst Income Fund I, LP to give notice. REASONINGRequest for Judicial NoticePlaintiff Oakhurst Income Fund I, LP (“Plaintiff”) requests judicial notice of (1) a Deed of Trust, recorded on or about April 15, 2022, in the Official Records of Los Angeles County as Instrument No. 20220420265; (2) a Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust,recorded on or about February 21, 2024, in the Official Records of Los Angeles County as Instrument No. 20240111636; (3) a Substitution of Trustee, recorded on or about March 1, 2024, in the Official Records of Los Angeles County as Instrument No. 20240135052; (4) a Notice of Trustee’s Sale, recorded on or about May 23, 2024, in the Official Records of Los Angeles County as Instrument No. 20240338093; and (5) a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale, recorded on or about July 9, 2024, in the Official Records of Los Angeles County as Instrument No. 20240448246. Plaintiff’s request is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c).AnalysisPlaintiff moves the Court for summary judgment or adjudication in its favor on the ground that no triable issue of material fact exists as to Plaintiff’s sole cause of action for unlawful detainer under Code of Civil Procedure section 1161a. Defendant Mark Siffin (“Defendant”) has not filed an opposition to the motion.The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) “On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Med. Ctr. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)“Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “[T]he court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection) . . . in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that it owns the premises at 1675 Woods Drive in West Hollywood, and Defendant was the owner until April 15, 2022, when the property was the subject of foreclosure. (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 8.) Plaintiff bought the property in a nonjudicial foreclosure sale on June 28, 2024, and perfected its title on July 9, 2024. (Compl. ¶¶ 9-10.) Defendant has failed to vacate the property, and Plaintiff served a notice to quit, which has expired. (Compl. ¶¶ 11-14.)Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1161a, subdivision (b)(3), “a person who holds over and continues in possession of a manufactured home, mobilehome, floating home, or real property after a three-day written notice to quit the property has been served upon the person, . . . may be removed therefrom . . . [w]here the property has been sold in accordance with Section 2924 of the Civil Code, under a power of sale contained in a deed of trust executed by such person, or a person under whom such person claims, and the title under the sale has been duly perfected.” Thus, Plaintiff must establish that the property was sold in accordance with Civil Code section 2924, Plaintiff has perfected title to the property, and Defendant has held over and continued in possession of the property after the three-day notice to quit was served.Plaintiff provides undisputed evidence that on April 15, 2022, a deed of trust executed by Defendant was recorded against the property, securing a loan in the amount of $2,800,000. (Pl.’s UMF No. 1.) On February 21, 2024, a Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust was recorded against the property, indicating a default amount of $192,566.99 as of February 20, 2024; on March 1, 2024, a substitution of trustee was recorded substituting C&H Trust Deed Service as the new trustee for the deed of trust; and on May 23, 2024, C&H Trust Deed Service recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale against the property, indicating that the property would be sold at auction. (Pl.’s UMF Nos. 2-4.) On June 28, 2024, Plaintiff purchased the property as the foreclosing beneficiary at a public auction, and on July 9, 2024, the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale granting Plaintiff title to the property was recorded, with the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale containing the requisite statement to create a presumption of proper sale, and the deed of trust containing a similar recital. (Pl.’s UMF Nos. 5-8.) On July 23, 2024, a registered process server served Defendant with a notice to quit, but Defendant remains in possession of the property. (Pl.’s UMF Nos. 9-10.) The present action was filed more than three days after the notice to quit was served. (Pl.’s UMF No. 11.)This evidence allows Plaintiff to show there is no triable issue of material fact as to its claim for unlawful detainer, and Defendant has failed to oppose the motion and create a triable issue. Accordingly, Plaintiff Oakhurst Income Fund I, LP’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication is GRANTED. Plaintiff Oakhurst Income Fund I, LP shall prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.
