Plaintiff alleges that on January 26, 2023, she entered into an agreement to buy the subject property from Defendant Joseph & Patricia Catallo Family Trust (“Trust”). After the agreement was signed, Trust entered into an amendment to an existing lease agreement with a tenant, Blush Wild Studio in violation of its agreement with Plaintiff. On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Trust that it had breached the agreement by failing to provide all written lease agreements and bank statements showing proof of rent payments as required under the agreement. On January 31, 2023, made a counter-offer for the property which Trust accepted. On February 13, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Trust that Plaintiff would seek injunctive relief for specific performance of the agreement because the property was in escrow with another buyer. On February 13, Trust’s counsel informed Plaintiff’s counsel that there was no second buyer and that it was willing to sell the property to Plaintiff. After the parties further disputed whether each party had provided all materials required under the agreement, Trust gave Plaintiff a deadline of February 24, 2023 to pay the purchase price, which at that point had been reduced to $490,000. Plaintiff filed this action and recorded a list pendens on February 27, 2023. On March 9, 2023, Trust informed Plaintiff that the property had been sold to another buyer.PROCEDURAL HISTORYOn February 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against Trust and First Team Real Estate.On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint.On September 21, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel filed this motion to be relieved as counsel.DISCUSSIONRonda Baldwin-Kennedy, Counsel for Plaintiff Jean Shir moves to be relieved as counsel.“The question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (2)) is one which lies within the sound discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case.’  [Citation.]”  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)  The court should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”  (Ramirez v. Sturdivant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires that the following be submitted in support of an attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel pursuant Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2): (1) a notice of motion and motion directed to the client (made on Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (Judicial Council Form, MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (Judicial Council Form, MC-052)); (3) a proof of service evidencing service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (Judicial Council Form, MC-053)).  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (a), (c), (d), (e).)Here, Counsel filed a Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC-051), Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC-053), and a Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC-052) on the appropriate forms, as outlined within California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivisions (a), (c), and (e). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (a), (c), (e).) The Court is satisfied that Counsel has a compelling reason to withdraw because of a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. (MC-052, Item #2.)Counsel served Plaintiff via mail at its last known address and confirmed the address was current through conversation at least 30 days before this motion was filed. (MC-052 Item #3b.) There are no other hearings set for this matter. There is a case management conference scheduled for the same date as the hearing on this motion. Trial has not yet been set. There is sufficient time for Plaintiff to secure new counsel. Plaintiff would not be prejudiced if this motion was granted.DATED: November 30, 2023 ________________________Hon.
