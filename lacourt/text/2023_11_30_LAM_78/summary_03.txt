And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Ronda Baldwin-Kennedy, counsel for plaintiff Jean Shir, will be granted. The motion was filed on September 21, 2023, and counsel has submitted the required documents, including a notice of motion, declaration, and proposed order. The court finds that counsel has a compelling reason to withdraw due to a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The court is satisfied that counsel has served plaintiff with the required notice and that there is sufficient time for plaintiff to secure new counsel. The court has scheduled a hearing to set a continued date and requires the moving party to provide notice.
