And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel the Defendant, Pomona Healthcare & Wellness Cener, LLC, to serve verified responses to special interrogatories, Set One. The Defendant failed to provide complete responses to the interrogatories, which seek information about the Plaintiff's care at the facility. The Judge finds that the information is relevant to the Plaintiff's claims of elder abuse and negligent hiring. The Defendant claims that an investigation is ongoing, but the Judge finds that it has been nearly a year since the original interrogatory responses were served, and the motion is granted. Sanctions of $2,310 are imposed against the Defendant, payable within 10 days.
