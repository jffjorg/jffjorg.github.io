```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the parties' responses to requests for production. The defendant, Suarez, intends to hold the plaintiff, Yu, to its limited response and will object to the introduction of any additional documents that are responsive to the requests. The plaintiff's counsel, Powell, provided a declaration with further responses attached, but it appears that Yu did not provide further responses to certain requests. The judge notes that the parties' obligations are governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210, which sets forth the requirements for responses to demands for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.
