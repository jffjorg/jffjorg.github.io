And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication. The ruling notes that the plaintiffs' memorandum of points and authorities does not discuss the fourth cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision or retention of an employee, and therefore the motion is denied with respect to this cause of action. The Judge also notes that it is difficult to determine from the plaintiffs' separate statement in support of the motion what evidence they cite to. The defendants had cited to the California Court of Appeal's decision in So v. Shin (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 671-672, which held that there is no bright line standard for judging outrageous conduct.
