[1]The Court notes
that Plaintiffs’ memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion
does not discuss the TAC’s fourth cause of action for negligent hiring,
supervision or retention of employee. Thus, to the extent Plaintiffs’ motion
for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication concerns the
fourth cause of action, it is denied as to this cause of action.  
 


[2]The Court notes
that this sentence is contained in paragraph 12 of the Williams Declaration. 


[3]The Court notes
that it is difficult to determine from Plaintiffs’ separate statement in
support of the motion what evidence Plaintiffs cite to. For instance,
Plaintiffs’ Undisputed Material Fact No. 5 cites to the evidence “Id. at 82:10-18.” Although not entirely clear, this
could refer to the deposition transcript of Mandi Martinez attached to the
Declaration of Leilani Jones filed in support of Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication. 


[4] Defendants cite to So v. Shin (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th
652, 671-672, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[t]here is no bright line
standard for judging outrageous conduct and…its generality hazards a
case-by-case appraisal of conduct filtered through the prism of the appraiser’s
values, sensitivity threshold, and standards of civility. The process evoked by
the test appears to be more intuitive than analytical…Thus, whether conduct is
outrageous is usually a question of fact.” (Internal quotations
and citations omitted.)
