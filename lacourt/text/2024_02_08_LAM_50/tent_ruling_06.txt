[1]The docket entry
describes this filing as an opposition to the motion to compel the pmk
deposition but GM’s opposition filed on January 26, 2024 asserts that “[t]his
Court should sustain GM’s objections to Request for Production Nos. 12, 18-21,
23-25, 30, 39, 51, 53, 64, 76, 81, 83-85, and 89 on the merits.” (Opp’n at p. 9:23-24.)
The opposition papers also list a hearing date of “July 26, 2023.” It thus
appears that such opposition papers may have been incorrectly filed.
