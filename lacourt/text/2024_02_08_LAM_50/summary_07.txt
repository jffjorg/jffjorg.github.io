And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff had requested a default judgment in the amount of $159,174.20, comprising damages, prejudgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. However, the court found several defects with the submitted default judgment package. First, the plaintiff failed to provide proof of exemption from the usury limitations of California Constitution Article XV, Section 1. Second, the total amount sought was not listed in the requests. Third, the plaintiff did not provide the original promissory note, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1806. The court will discuss with the plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
