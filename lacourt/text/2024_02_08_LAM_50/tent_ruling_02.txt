[1]Moreover, as to Request for Production Nos. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14, Suarez states that in
the reply “[r]ather than belabor these requests any further, Defendant intends
to hold Plaintiff to its limited response, and will object to Plaintiff
introducing into evidence any additional documents which are responsive to
these Requests.” (Reply at p. 3:19-21.) 


[2]Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.210,
subdivision (a), “[t]he party to whom a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling has been directed shall respond separately to
each item or category of item by any of the following: (1) A statement that the party will comply with the particular demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling by the date set for the
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling pursuant to paragraph (2) of
subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any related activities.
(2) A representation that the party lacks the ability to comply with
the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of a particular item
or category of item. (3) An objection to the particular demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling.” 


[3]The further responses attached as Exhibit “D” to
Suarez’s counsel’s declaration do not appear to show that Yu provided further
responses to Request for Production Nos. 16, 17, 18, or 19. (Powell Decl., ¶ 7,
Ex. D.)
