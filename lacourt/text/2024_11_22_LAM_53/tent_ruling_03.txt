  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for leave to file first
  amended complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Marlyn Jimenez        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Unopposed
Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint 
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.[1]

DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Marlyn Jimenez (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
granting her leave to file a First Amended Complaint to add a cause of action
for negligent hiring, retention, or supervision against defendant Rodrigo
Prieto (“Prieto”).  (Liberatore Decl., ¶¶
4-5, 12.) 
The court finds that (1) it is in furtherance of justice to allow
Plaintiff to amend her complaint to add a cause of action for negligent hiring,
retention, or supervision against Prieto, (2) defendant Prieto will not be
unduly prejudiced by this amendment because he will have seven months to
challenge the sufficiency and merits of this cause of action before trial, and
(3) the other named defendants will not be misled or prejudiced by this
amendment since Plaintiff seeks to add this cause of action only against
defendant Prieto.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§¿473, subd. (a); Mac v. Minassian (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 510, 519 [“‘
“California courts ‘have a policy of great liberality in allowing amendments at
any stage of the proceeding so as to dispose of cases upon their substantial
merits where the authorization does not prejudice the substantial rights of
others’ ” ’”].)  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s
motion.  
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Marlyn
Jimenez’s motion for leave to file First Amended Complaint.
            The court orders plaintiff Marlyn
Jimenez to file the First Amended Complaint in the form attached as Exhibit A
to the declaration of Anthony A. Liberatore (omitting the highlighted
markings), within 5 days of the date of this order.
            The court orders plaintiff Marlyn
Jimenez to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
