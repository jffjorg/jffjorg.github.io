And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the case and finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support a claim of fraud against the defendant. However, the plaintiff has alleged that the mortgage companies, Mortgage Assets Management LLC and PHH Mortgage Corporation, committed fraud and sold the subject property as a result. The court notes that the plaintiff has alleged that she substantially complied with the repayment of monies to the lender and tendered monies to an address that the lender knew did not accept mail. Therefore, the court is considering the possibility that the plaintiff may have complied with the tender requirement.
