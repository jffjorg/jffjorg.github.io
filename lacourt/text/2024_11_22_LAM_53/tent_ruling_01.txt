[tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion for judgment on the
  pleadings 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Paladar Capital
Investments, L.P. 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 
The court considered the moving and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion.[1]
The court notes that the reply papers reference a “belated opposition”
to this motion.  (Reply, pp. 2:2-4, 2:3:13-16.)  However, plaintiff Felisa Dee Richards did
not file any opposition papers with the court. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            The court grants defendant Paladar
Capital Investments, L.P.’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibit 3.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (c); Yvanova v.
New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924, n. 1 [trial court
properly took judicial notice of recorded documents].) 
            The court denies defendant Paladar Capital Investments,
L.P.’s remaining requests for judicial notice because those materials are not
relevant to the court’s ruling on this motion. 
(Malek Media Group LLC v. AXQG Corp. (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 817,
825 [“Any matter to be judicially noticed must be relevant to a material
issue”].) 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Paladar Capital Investments, L.P. (“Defendant”) moves the
court for an order granting its motion for judgment on the pleadings to the
19th cause of action for quiet title alleged in the First Amended Complaint
filed by plaintiff Felisa Dee Richards (“Plaintiff”).[2] 
The court grants Defendant’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings to the 19th cause of action for quiet title because it does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant since (1)
“‘[a]n element of a cause of action for quiet title is “[t]he adverse claims to
the title of the plaintiff against which a determination is sought[,]”’” and
(2) the facts of which the court has taken judicial notice show that Defendant sold
the subject property, such that Defendant does not have an adverse claim to
title to the property.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 438, subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii); Orcilla v. Big Sur, Inc. (2016) 244
Cal.App.4th 982, 1010 [internal citations omitted] [finding that the subject
“deed establishes that the Property was sold to [another party], such that none
of the Bank Defendants had an adverse claim to title to the Property”]; West
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 802 [finding that
the bank defendant’s argument that the quiet title cause of action had no merit
because the bank defendant no longer held title to the property “has merit”];
RJN Ex. 3, Grant Deed recorded July 29, 2022 [showing that Defendant granted to
Ammar Aldieri and Laura Hoxha the property at 28040 Concord Avenue, Castaic
Area, California, 91384]; FAC ¶¶ 1 [defining the “Real Property” to be the
property located at 28040 Concord Avenue, Castaic, California, 91384], 564
[requesting that title and possession of the Real Property be restored to
Plaintiff].)  
The burden is on the plaintiff
“to articulate how it could amend its pleading to render it sufficient.”¿ (Palm
Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th
268, 290.)¿ To satisfy that burden, a plaintiff “must show in what manner he
can amend his complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of
his pleading.”¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)  The court (1) notes that Plaintiff did not
file an opposition to this motion, and (2) finds that Plaintiff has not
articulated how she can amend her cause of action for quiet title to render it
sufficient against Defendant.  The court
therefore grants Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave
to amend.
ORDER
            The court grants defendant Paladar
Capital Investments, L.P.’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to
plaintiff Felisa Dee Richard’s 19th cause of action for quiet title without
leave to amend. 
             The court orders defendant Paladar Capital
Investments, L.P. to prepare, serve, and lodge a proposed judgment of dismissal
within 10 days of the date of this ruling.
            The court orders defendant Paladar
Capital Investments, L.P. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
