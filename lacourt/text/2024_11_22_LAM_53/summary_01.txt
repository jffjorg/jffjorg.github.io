And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the plaintiff's 19th cause of action for quiet title without leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiff did not articulate how to amend the cause of action to render it sufficient against the defendant. The defendant, Paladar Capital Investments, L.P., sold the subject property, which means it does not have an adverse claim to title to the property. The court also took judicial notice of a grant deed recorded in July 2022, which showed that the defendant sold the property. The plaintiff, Felisa Dee Richards, did not file an opposition to the motion and did not show how to amend the cause of action to make it sufficient.
