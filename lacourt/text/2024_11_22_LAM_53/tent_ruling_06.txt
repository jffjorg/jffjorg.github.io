[1] For
the reasons set forth below, the court finds that Plaintiff has not alleged
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for fraud against
Defendant.  However, Plaintiff has also
alleged that defendants Mortgage Assets Management LLC and PHH Mortgage
Corporation committed fraud, which resulted in the sale of the subject
property.  (Compl., ¶¶ 12, 25, 27, 29, 30,
36, 52 [alleging the following intentional misrepresentations made to
Plaintiff: (1) that she was in default of her obligations under the reverse
mortgage, (2) that she owed the lender $425,859.83, and (3) that they were
justified in placing the property up for auction].) 


[2] The
court notes that, while Plaintiff alleged that she is not required to tender
before maintaining this action (Compl., ¶ 12), she also alleged that she
“substantially complied with the repayment of monies to the lender; and
tendered monies to an address that PHH Mortgage knew that did not accept mail”
(Compl., ¶ 33), such that Plaintiff’s facts indicate that she may have complied
with the tender requirement.
