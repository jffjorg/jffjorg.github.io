ANALYSIS:
 
Defendant Veros Credit, LLC (“Defendant”) propounded Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Admission, Set One, on Plaintiff Tashika Durisseau (“Plaintiff”) on October 17,
2023. (Motions, Naples Decl., Exh. 1.) Following a meet and confer effort and
the continued lack of any response from Plaintiff, Defendant filed the instant
(1) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request
For Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One,
Admitted, and Request For Sanctions on January 2, 2024. To date, no opposition
has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motions to compel responses to interrogatories, and to deem
admissions admitted, are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.)
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to
compel initial responses or deem admissions admitted can be filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time
after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290; 2033.280.) Therefore, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff
to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without objections. The
Court also deems the requests for admission admitted against Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond to the requests also
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2033.280, 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the
amount sought is excessive under a lodestar calculation. The requests for
sanctions are granted against Plaintiff in the amount of $760.00 based on two
hours of attorney time billed at $320.00 an hour, plus $60.00 in costs per
motion. (Motions, Naples Decl., ¶5.) The sanctions are to be paid within 20
days of service of this order.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Veros Credit, LLC’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and for Monetary Sanctions; and (2) Motion
Deeming Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted and for Monetary Sanctions
are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF TASHIKA DURISSEAU IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES
WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
PLAINTIFF IS ALSO ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $760.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN
20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
