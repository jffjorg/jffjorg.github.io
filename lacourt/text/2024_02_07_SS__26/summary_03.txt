Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories and requests for admission, and orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses without objection within 20 days. The judge also deems the requests for admission admitted against the plaintiff. Furthermore, the judge imposes sanctions of $760.00 on the plaintiff for misuse of the discovery process, which must be paid within 20 days. The plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests constitutes a misuse of the discovery process, and the judge finds that the amount of sanctions sought is reasonable based on the lodestar calculation.
