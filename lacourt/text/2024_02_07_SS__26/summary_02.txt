And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Motion for Assignment Order filed by William P. Anderson, the Judgment Creditor, against Michelle Shocked, the Judgment Debtor. The Motion sought an assignment order for rent purportedly received by Judgment Debtor from a tenant who leases her real property. However, the Judge found that Judgment Creditor has not carried their burden of proof to demonstrate that the Court should issue an assignment order of rent. Specifically, Judgment Creditor failed to provide authenticated documents and sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Judgment Debtor owns the property and receives rental income. The Judge also noted that Judgment Creditor's previous evidence, including a declaration from a private investigator, was deemed inadmissible hearsay. As a result, the Motion for Assignment Order was denied.
