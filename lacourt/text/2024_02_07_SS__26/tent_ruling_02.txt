Anderson v. Shocked, et al.MOTION FOR
ASSIGNMENT ORDER(CCP § 708.510)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Judgment
Creditor William P. Anderson’s Motion for Assignment Order is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:  
 
Petitioner William P. Anderson (“Judgment Creditor”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award against Respondent Michelle Shocked (“Judgment Debtor”). Following the hearing on the Petition, judgment was
entered in favor of Judgment Creditor in the amount of $4,322.51 principal and
$1,380.83 interest. (Judgment, filed 02/28/22.) On June 21, 2023,
Judgment Creditor filed the instant Motion for Assignment Order. The Motion
came for hearing on September 14, 2023 and was continued for further briefing.
(Minute Order, 09/14/23.) Judgment Creditor filed a supplemental declaration on
October 16, 2023. The Motion was originally set for hearing on November 9, 2023
and continued with notice to November 27, 2023. (Minute Order, 11/09/23.)
Judgment Creditor filed supplemental papers on November 17, 2023. The hearing
on December 6, 2023, the Court again continued the matter to allow Judgment
Creditor to file supplemental papers. (Minute Order, 12/06/23.) Judgment
Creditor filed a supplemental declaration on January 25, 2024. To date, no
opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 708.510, subdivision
(a), the Court may order the judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor
or to an appointed receiver all or part of a right to payment due or to become
due. The types of payments that can be assigned include wages due from the
federal government if not subject to a withholding order, rents, commissions,
royalties, patent or copyright payments, and insurance policy loan value. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 708.510, subd. (a).)
 
Relevant factors the Court may take into consideration when
making an assignment order include the judgment debtor’s reasonable
requirements if they are a natural person, payments the judgment debtor is
required to make to satisfy other judgments and wage assignments, the amount
remaining due on the judgment, and the amount to be received in satisfaction of
the right to payment that may be assigned. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510, subd. (c).) Construing all the
applicable statutes together, the “assignment order” contemplated by Code of
Civil Procedure, section 708.510, et seq.
must include a court order that assigns a right to payment outright (not simply
an order directing the judgment debtor to do so).  
 
Discussion
 
As Judgment Creditor previously demonstrated, the judgment
remains wholly unsatisfied. (Motion, Anderson Decl., ¶¶2-3.) Judgment Creditor
seeks an assignment order for rent Judgment Debtor purportedly receives from a
tenant who leases her real property, located at 1850 Industrial Street, #709,
Los Angeles, California (“the Property”). (Motion, Anderson Decl., ¶5.)
Judgment Creditor submits a grant deed and title report demonstrating that
Judgment Debtor owns the Property. (Motion, Supp. Anderson Decl., Exhs. 2-3.)
The documents, however, are not authenticated. Judgment Creditor does not
indicate from where these documents were obtained or even that they are true
and correct copies. (See Evid. Code, § 1400.) Nor does the grant deed, dated
April 6, 2009, demonstrate that Judgment Debtor owns the Property currently. 
 
Even if the Court were to find that Judgment Debtor currently
owns the Property, no additional admissible evidence is provided to demonstrate
Judgment Debtor obtains rental income from the Property and from whom. The
Motion was previously supported by the declaration of a private investigator,
Jason Pontaza, who stated that they determined that Judgment Debtor rents the
Property to Sebastian Pourrat for $6,000.00 a month. (Motion, Pontaza Decl.,
¶4.) Pontaza declared that Pourrat is an officer of a company called Duclot La
Vinicole, LLC but it is not clear if the rent is paid personally by Pourrat or
the company. (Id. at ¶¶2, 4.) The Court previously ruled that this
information is inadmissible hearsay from the private investigator. (Minute
Orders, 11/27/23 and 12/06/23 [citing Evid. Code, § 1200].) It remains that
Judgment Creditor has not carried their burden of proof to demonstrate that the
Court should issue an assignment order of rent Judgment Debtor purportedly
receives from 1850 Industrial Street, #709, Los Angeles, California.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Judgment
Creditor William P. Anderson’s Motion for Assignment Order is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
