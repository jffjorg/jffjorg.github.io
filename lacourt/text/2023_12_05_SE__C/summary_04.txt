And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further discovery. The plaintiff, Genoveva Lozano, is seeking to compel Ford Motor Company to produce certain documents related to the sale of a 2019 Ford Explorer. The documents at issue include policies and procedures related to warranty claims, consumer complaints, and repurchases.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion in part, compelling Ford to produce documents related to requests 16, 19-29, and 31. These requests seek information on Ford's warranty claims policy and procedure manuals, policies and procedures for evaluating consumer complaints, and documents related to repurchases.

However, the judge has denied the plaintiff's motion as to request 24, which seeks all scripts and flowcharts used by Ford in handling consumer requests for repurchase or replacement. Ford has already agreed to produce its policies and procedures for its customer relationship center, which contain the flowcharts requested. The judge has also denied the motion as to request 24 because Ford has stated that it conducted a reasonable and diligent search and could not find any documentation relating to the scripts.

The judge has also imposed a monetary sanction on the plaintiff for making a frivolous motion, but has stayed the sanction pending the outcome of the motion.
