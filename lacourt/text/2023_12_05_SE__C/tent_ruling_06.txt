This lawsuit concerns
an alleged sexual abuse and harassment of Plaintiff by Defendant Scott Waln, a
teacher at Los Alisos Middle School, during the 2019-2020 school year.
 
On November 28, 2023, this Court entered a ruling granting
Defendant Norwalk/La Mirada Unified School District’s Motion to Compel Further
Documents.  In doing so, the court compelled
Plaintiff to produce the same documents requested in the instant motion.  As this Court has already found for
Defendant, it finds the instant motion MOOT. 
Moving party to give notice.
