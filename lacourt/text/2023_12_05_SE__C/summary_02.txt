Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nichelle Harton vs. Nancy J. Jacobs. The plaintiff, Nichelle Harton, had brought motions to compel responses to discovery requests that were served on the defendant, Nancy J. Jacobs, on May 24, 2023. The defendant failed to respond timely, and the plaintiff brought the motions to compel responses. The defendant subsequently served verified responses on August 1, 2023.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's requests for discovery are moot because the defendant has served verified responses. The judge also finds that the defendant's failure to provide timely responses was due to excusable neglect and that the defendant acted with substantial justification in opposing the plaintiff's motions. Therefore, no sanctions are imposed.

The judge notes that a reasonable request for an extension of time to respond to discovery requests should ordinarily be granted. The judge also reminds plaintiff's counsel that a reasonable request for an extension of time to respond to discovery requests should ordinarily be granted.
