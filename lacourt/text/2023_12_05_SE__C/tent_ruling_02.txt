Background
Plaintiff Nichelle Harton (“Plaintiff”), along with her
husband and children, lived in a single-family home owned by Defendant Nancy J.
Jacobs (“Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to properly maintain
the property, resulting in substandard living conditions.  The operative Second Amended Complaint brings
causes of action for (1) Violation of the Fair Employment and Housing; (2) Violation
of the Disabled Persons Act, (3) Violation of Civil Code Section 1942.4, (4) Breach
of the Implied Warranty of Habitability, (5) Negligence and (6) Negligent
Hiring, Supervision and Retention. 
On May 24, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Requests for
Production (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories
(Set One), and Requests for Admissions on Defendant. The deadline for Defendant
to respond was June 27, 2023. Defendant failed to serve timely responses.  Plaintiff’s motions followed.  
 
Discussion
 
A
party may make a demand for production of documents
and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand
is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents
is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting
requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030. A party may
propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the subject
matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).) 
 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to
respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed
to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd.
(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070,
subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
The party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion
to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).) 
 
Where
there has been no timely response to requests for admissions, a “requesting
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section 2023.010).” 
The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted
“unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
 
 
Here, Plaintiff served discovery requests upon Defendant on
May 24, 2023. (Belisle Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant was required to respond by June
27, 2023 and failed to do so. (Belisle Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) On June 29, 2023,
Plaintiff advised Defendant’s counsel that no responses had been received.  At Defendant’s request, Plaintiff provided
additional copies of the discovery.  As
of the date the motions were filed (July 14, 2023) Defendant had not served
responses. (Belisle Decl., ¶¶ 5-8.)
Defendant’s counsel asserts he first learned of the May 24
discovery requests on June 29 when he was contacted by Plaintiff’s counsel.
(Loeck Decl., ¶ 3-4.)  Neither he nor members
of his firm received the May 24 discovery requests.  He requested another copy from Plaintiff’s
counsel. (Loeck Decl., ¶ 3-4.) Defendant’s counsel advised Plaintiff that
Defendant would provide responses based upon the June 29 service date. (Loeck
Decl., ¶ 7.) Defendant served verified responses on August 1, 2023. (Loeck
Decl., ¶ 10.)  After he served the
responses, Defendant’s counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel to take the motions
off calendar as moot, but she refused. (Loeck Decl., ¶ 11.)  
The court determines
that Plaintiff’s requests for discovery are moot because Defendant served
verified responses before the hearing.  
 
Sanctions 
 
Misuse of the discovery process constituting conduct subject to sanctions
include “failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery”
and “failing to confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing
party or attorney in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally
any dispute concerning discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d) and
(i).) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).) All discovery motions require a meet and confer declaration stating
facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
 
Defendant submits a declaration by Randy Hill, President
and CEO of Sage Network, Inc., which provides IT services to defense counsel’s
firm. Mr. Hill conducted a search of any emails Defendant received from
Plaintiff’s counsel on or about May 24, 2023. (Hill Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.) Mr. Hill
discovered an email from Plaintiff’s counsel which was received on May 25,
2023, but it was sent directly to quarantine by Microsoft without being
forwarded to Defendant’s counsel. (Hill Decl., ¶¶ 14.)  
Based upon the forgoing, Defendant is relieved of the
waiver triggered by Defendant’s failure to provide timely discovery
responses.  The court finds that
Defendant’s failure to provide timely responses was due to excusable neglect.  Furthermore, the court finds that Defendant
acted with substantial justification in opposing Plaintiff’s motions.  Therefore, no sanctions are imposed.  Plaintiff’s counsel is reminded that a
reasonable request for an extension of time to respond to discovery requests,
such as the one made here by Defendant’s counsel, should ordinarily be
granted.
