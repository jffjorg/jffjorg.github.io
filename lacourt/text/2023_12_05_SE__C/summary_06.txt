And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motion by the defendant Norwalk/La Mirada Unified School District to compel the plaintiff to sign authorizations for release of records, or to exclude the plaintiff from claiming mental distress damages, is no longer relevant (MOOT) due to a previous ruling. The previous ruling compelled the plaintiff to produce the same documents requested in the instant motion. As a result, the motion is deemed MOOT and the moving party must give notice.
