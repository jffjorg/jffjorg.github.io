Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
Background
This is a lemon law action involving a purchase
of a 2019 Ford Explorer.
On January 23, 2023, Plaintiff sent Defendant
his first set of RFPs to better evaluate their claims and adequately prepare
for settlement or trial. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. A.) Generally, the requests at
issue in this motion include requests seeking Ford’s policies and procedures
related to its compliance with the Song-Beverly Act. (Ibid.) The demand set the
production of documents for thirty-days after the service of the RFPs. (Ibid.)
On February 24, 2023, Ford served its responses to Plaintiff’s requests, but
the responses were not verified. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. B.) On March 9, 2023,
Ford served verifications. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 4.)
On April 11, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the meet
and confer process by sending a letter to Ford that specified the deficiencies
in Ford’s responses. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. C.) Plaintiff also addressed the
protective order issue and stated that, in the interest of compromising,
Plaintiff would be agreeable to executing the Los Angeles Model Protective
Order. (Ibid.)
On April 24, 2023, Ford provided a response to
Plaintiff’s letter agreeing to provide supplemental responses. (Lopez Decl., ¶
7; Ex. D.) Ford also stated that it would file a motion for protective order
within 30 days. (Ibid.) On May 1, 2023, Ford served supplemental responses that
contained many of the same deficiencies raised by Plaintiff’s meet and confer
letter. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. E.) Ford later served verifications on June 20,
2023. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 9; Ex. F.)
Legal Standard
CCP § 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further answers to document requests if it finds that the response
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  The motion
shall be accompanied with a meet and confer declaration.  (CCP § 2031.310(b).)  
Meet and Confer
On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff sent a meet and
confer letter addressing the deficiencies in Ford’s supplemental responses.
(Lopez Decl., ¶ 9; Ex. G.) On June 30, 2023, Ford provided a response to
Plaintiff’s letter but stood by its responses. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 11; Ex. I.) Ford
again indicated that it was standing by its objections and would be filing a
motion for protective order. (Ibid.) Therefore, Plaintiff believes that the
parties are at an impasse and the motion is proper. (Ibid.)
The Court finds that the parties adequately met
and conferred.
Discussion
Requests
Nos. 16, 19-29, and 31
Plaintiffs
seek to compel further responses to Requests Nos. 16, 19-29, and 31.
·       
No.
16 seeks Ford’s warranty claims policy and procedure manuals from 2020 to the
present;
·       
Nos.
19-21 seek Ford’s policies and procedures for evaluating a consumer’s complaint
or request for a refund of money paid toward a vehicle, or determining whether
a vehicle is eligible for repurchase; 
·       
Nos.
22 and 23 seek all training materials regarding the handling of consumer
requests for a vehicle repurchase or determining whether a vehicle is eligible
for repurchase; 
·       
Nos.
25-29 seek Ford’s policies, procedures, and parameters for defining certain
terms in the context of determining a vehicle’s eligibility for repurchase;
·       
No.
31 seeks documents regarding Ford’s policies and procedures that its authorized
repair facilities should follow regarding customer requests for a refund of the
purchase price paid for a vehicle. 
Plaintiff
argues Defendant objected to each request and stated that it would not produce
any documents. The parties represent that they have met and conferred as to
Requests Nos.
16, 19-29, and 31and Defendant states it has offered to produce one or more
of the following: (1) Ford’s Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual, which
contains policy and procedure information regarding warranty repairs; (2)
policies and procedures for Ford’s Customer Relationship Center (“CRC”), which
handles communications from customers to Ford regarding vehicle concerns; (3)
and its RAV Policy & Procedure Manual, which contains policy or procedure
information about vehicle refunds and replacements, applicable to 2022.
The
court determines that Plaintiff’s discovery requests are within the proper
scope of discovery, but only for the years 2020 to the present.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Discovery is GRANTED in part as to Request Nos. 16, 19-29, and 31.
Request
No. 24
·       
No.
24 seeks all scripts and flow charts used by Ford in handling consumer requests
for repurchase or replacement.
Ford agreed to produce its policies and
procedures for Ford’s Customer Relationship Center (“CRC”), applicable to 2022,
which contain the flowcharts Plaintiff requested.
As to
the scripts, Defendant contends that it conducted a reasonable and diligent
search and could not find any documentation relating to the scripts. Accordingly,
Defendant
has properly responded to Nos. 24 because it stated that it conducted a
diligent search and no responsive documents ever existed.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Discovery is DENIED as to Request No. 24. 
 
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.300(d), 2031.310(h),
2033.290(d).) 
The Court finds that Defendant acted
with substantial justification.
