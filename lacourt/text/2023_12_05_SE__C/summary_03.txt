And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on Plaintiff Alfredo Duarte's Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant General Motors, LLC's Person Most Qualified (PMQ). The motion is granted in part and denied in part.

The judge has granted the motion to compel the deposition of the PMQ for categories 7-8, 10-13, 16-17, 18-19, 21-22, and 23-24, which relate to the nature and extent of correspondence regarding the powertrain and electrical defects, the nature of the defects, and the availability of repairs. However, the judge has limited the scope of these categories to information related to the 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 sold in California.

The judge has denied the motion to compel the deposition of the PMQ for category 20, which relates to Defendant's third-party dispute resolution program, as it is irrelevant to Plaintiff's claims.

The judge has also found that Defendant acted with substantial justification and has imposed no sanctions. The judge has ordered the parties to give notice of the ruling.

The ruling is subject to change after review and consideration of any objections.
