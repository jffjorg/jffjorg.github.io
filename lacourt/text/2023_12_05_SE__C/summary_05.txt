Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion for a protective order in part and denies it in part. The protective order is aimed at protecting the Defendant's confidential and proprietary information. The Judge finds that the Defendant has made a sufficient attempt to meet and confer with the Plaintiff, and that the proposed protective order is reasonable in its limitations on access to confidential information. The Judge grants the Defendant's proposed revisions to paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Model Protective Order, which restrict online access to confidential information and limit the use of confidential documents. However, the Judge denies the Defendant's proposed revision to paragraph 21, which would have required the return or destruction of confidential documents at the conclusion of the case.
