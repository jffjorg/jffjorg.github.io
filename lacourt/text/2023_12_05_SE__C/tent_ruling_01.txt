BACKGROUND
On September 3, 2018, Plaintiff Mendoza visited the Maywood
City Hall to speak with the Building and Planning Department to determine the
zoning on 4000 East Slauson Avenue property (hereinafter “property”) for the
proposed use of a Cannabis Testing Laboratory for his business LA Labs, Inc.
(SAC, ¶ 9.) The Cannabis Testing Laboratory, LA Labs, Inc., only would consist
of a testing laboratory and was not intended, nor would provide retail for
customers. (Id., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff was informed by a code officer that the
property qualified for the proposed use. (Id., ¶ 11.) Since the application
process requires an applicant to have a location prior to submitting the
application, Plaintiff signed for a lease. (Id., ¶ 13.)
After securing the lease, Plaintiff met with the Mayor and
other officials who demonstrated excitement about the project and allegedly
indicated support. (Id., ¶ 17.) Plaintiff contends the Planning Commission then
spread lies about the business and tried to get community members to come speak
against the company. (Id., ¶¶ 26-27.) Plaintiff alleges that people later
approached him asking for $350,000 to let the project continue at the behest of
the Mayor. (Id., ¶ 31.) Later the Planning Commission delivered a resolution of
denial. (Id., ¶ 38.)   
Due to defendant’s pre-textual denial, Mendoza has lost a
considerable amount of money and time, and his name was tarnished throughout
the City of Maywood due to the false representation made by defendants about
Mendoza, his character, and his business. Based on these facts, Plaintiff
asserted causes of action for: (1) Civil RICO; (2) Attempted Civil Extortion;
(3) Defamation, Slander Per Se; (4) IIED.
Defendants moved under CCP § 425.16 to strike the First,
Third, and Fourth Causes of Action.  On
April 18, 2023, the court struck only the Third Cause of Action.  The court found that Plaintiffs’ Third Cause
of Action for Defamation arose from protected activity under Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16, and that Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of
showing a probability of success on that cause of action. (Nguy Decl. ¶ 2; Ex.
1.) 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c), a prevailing defendant is
entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs associated with the motion. Under
CRC 3.1702 and CRC 8.104, a request for attorneys’ fees must be made within 60
days of service of the notice of entry of judgment. A defendant may only
recover fees and costs related to the motion to strike. (Lafayette
Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle Publishing Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379,
1383.) This includes fees associated with bringing the motion for fees. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1141 (“an award of fees may include not
only the fees incurred with respect to the underlying claim, but also the fees
incurred in enforcing the right to mandatory fees under Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16.”).) Additionally, “[a]ny
fee award must also include those incurred on appeal. [Citation.]” (Trapp v.
Naiman¿(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 113, 122.)¿ 
 
“A
trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar
figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the
case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the discretion of
the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such factors as the
nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and
expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court may also
consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative
work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) 
 
DISCUSSION 
Defendants
Hebert Marquez and Ricardo Lara seek attorney fees in the amount of $3,83.13,
one-third of the total amount of $11,514.40 they incurred for bringing the Anti-SLAPP Motion.   
Hourly
Rate 
 
“The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in
the community for similar work.”¿ (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The experienced trial judge is the best judge of the
value of professional services rendered in [her] court.” (Id.)¿ 
 
The
billing rate of defense counsel on this matter is $285.00 per hour. (Nguy Decl., ¶ 8.) 
 
The
Court finds that the hourly rate requested by the individual Defendants’ Counsel
is reasonable.  
 
Reasonable
Hours Incurred 
 
“A trial court assessing attorney fees begins
with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the
time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in
the presentation of the case.”¿ (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is
within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration
of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues,
the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The
court may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary
or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.)¿ 
 
Defense
counsel spent 38.9 hours in work preparing, filing, and arguing the Anti-SLAPP
Motion. (Nguy Decl., ¶ 5.) A summary of the billing
and the relevant invoices are attached as Exhibits 2.  Counsel billed 38.9 hours billed at a rate of
$285.00 per hour. In total, fees expended on the Anti-SLAPP motion were
$11,514.40. (Nguy Decl., ¶ 5.) 
Because the court struck only one of the three causes of action at issue
in their motion, Defendants’ request for attorney
fees is limited to $3,838.13, or one-third of their total fees.
 
The
Court finds that the hours spent on the Anti-SLAPP motion are reasonable. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court awards $3,838.13 in attorney’s fees.
