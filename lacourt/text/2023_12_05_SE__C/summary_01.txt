And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for attorney's fees brought by the individual defendants, Herber Marquez and Ricardo Lara, in the amount of $3,838.13. This amount is one-third of the total fees incurred by the defendants in bringing the anti-SLAPP motion. The Court finds that the hourly rate requested by the individual defendants' counsel, $285.00 per hour, is reasonable. The Court also finds that the hours spent on the anti-SLAPP motion, 38.9 hours, are reasonable. The defendants incurred a total of $11,514.40 in fees, but the Court's award is limited to $3,838.13 because only one of the three causes of action at issue in the motion was struck. The Court concludes that the award of attorney's fees is warranted based on the facts of the case and the applicable law.
