And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The plaintiff, Citizens of Humanity, LLC, is seeking to determine that it is not liable to the defendant, Nick Lacy, for any Labor Code violations. The defendant had filed administrative claims with the Labor Commissioner, alleging that Citizens of Humanity, LLC owed him $126,999 in waiting-time penalties. The parties had previously stipulated to continue the trial date, but also agreed that the previous deadlines for motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication would not be extended. The judge finds that the parties' stipulation is valid and enforceable, and therefore declines to hear the motion at this time. The judge's ruling does not express any opinion on the merits of the lawsuit.
