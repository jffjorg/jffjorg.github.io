And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Wind's motion to set aside the default judgment entered on July 27, 2023. The motion was filed on January 4, 2024, and is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which allows a party to seek relief from a judgment due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The judge found that Defendant Wind is not entitled to relief under this section because he failed to appear at trial and did not file trial documents. The judge also noted that Defendant Wind contributed to his own default by failing to timely seek counsel and alert the court and parties to his health issues.

Additionally, the judge denied Defendant Wind's alternative request to vacate the judgment under the court's inherent and equitable powers, as set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 128(a)(8). The judge found that Defendant Wind has failed to meet the time requirements for requesting a new trial, as set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 659, and is therefore time-barred from requesting a new trial.

The judge's ruling is based on the facts of the case, including the default judgment entered on July 27, 2023, and the failure of Defendant Wind to appear at trial and file trial documents. The judge's decision is in line with California case law, including Vandermoon v. Sanwong (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 315 and Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225.
