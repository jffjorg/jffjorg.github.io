And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispute between the parties, Hofer and Boladian, regarding a breach of a settlement agreement and an operating agreement (OA). The settlement agreement states that the prevailing party in any action to enforce its terms is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The OA also states that the prevailing party in any action for its breach is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The judge notes that Boladian performed work for ATS clients under ALG's malpractice insurance, and that Hofer eventually agreed to convert the company to an LLP at Boladian's insistence. The judge is considering the parties' intentions and facts, including the agreement to convert the company and the performance of work under ALG's malpractice insurance. The judge is weighing the disputes and acts, including the breach of agreement, and is considering the applicable laws, case citations, and statutes.
