ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“The party
against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object, by
demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the pleading on any one or
more of” various grounds listed in statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)
 
“When any ground for
objection to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer appears on the face
thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take
judicial notice, the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the
pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).)
 
“A demurrer to a
complaint or cross-complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or
cross-complaint or to any of the causes of action stated therein.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.50, subd. (a).)
 
“In reviewing the sufficiency
of a complaint against a general demurrer, we are guided by long-settled rules.
We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We also consider matters which may be judicially
noticed. Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,
reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318, citations and internal quotation marks omitted.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A. 
    The HOA’s Arguments on Demurrer
 
The Harden FACC contains causes of action
against the HOA for negligence and contract liability or indemnity. (Harden
FACC, pp. 5:24–25, 6:21–22.)
 
The HOA demurs to both of these causes of
action. (Demurrer, p. 9:131–16.) 
 
The HOA argues: (1) that the negligence cause
of action is barred by the statute of limitations; (2) that James Harden does
not state sufficient facts to constitute a negligence cause of action against
the HOA; (3) that James Harden lacks standing to sue the HOA; (4) that the
contract liability cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations; and
(5) that James Harden does not state sufficient facts to constitute a breach of
contract cause of action against the HOA. (Demurrer, pp. 5:17, 6:5–6, 7:22–23,
8:17–18.)
 
B. 
    Standing
 
1. 
    Legal Standard
 
“A party against whom
a cause of action has been asserted in a complaint or cross-complaint may file a
cross-complaint setting forth either or both of the following:
 
“(a) Any cause of action he has against any
of the parties who filed the complaint or cross-complaint against him. Nothing
in this subdivision authorizes the filing of a cross-complaint against the
plaintiff in an action commenced under Title 7 (commencing with Section
1230.010) of Part 3.
 
“(b) Any cause of action he has against a person alleged to
be liable thereon, whether or not such person is already a party to the action,
if the cause of action asserted in his cross-complaint (1) arises out of the
same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the
cause brought against him or (2) asserts a claim, right, or interest in the
property or controversy which is the subject of the cause brought against him.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 428.10.)
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
Here, James Harden has alleged that the HOA
acted or failed to act regarding the same occurrences that brought George
Santopietro’s suit against James Harden. (Harden FACC, ¶ 41.)  James Harden has standing to file a
cross-complaint against the HOA. (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.10, subd. (b).)
 
C. 
    Statutes of Limitations
 
“Civil actions,
without exception, can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this
title, after the cause of action shall have accrued, unless where, in special
cases, a different limitation is prescribed by statute.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
312.)
 
        However, the Harden
Cross-Complaint is in a special category.
 
“Although
ordinarily the statute of limitations will bar a cross-complaint in the same
fashion as if the defendant had brought an independent action, the rule is
different when the original complaint was filed before the statute of
limitations on the cross-complaint had elapsed. Such a cross-complaint need
only be subject-matter related to the plaintiff's complaint – i.e., arise out
of the same occurrence (see §§ 426.10, 428.10) – to relate back to the date of
filing the complaint for statute of limitation purposes.” (Sidney v. Super. Ct. (1988)
198 Cal.App.3d 710, 714, cleaned up.)
 
Here, the Harden Cross-Complaint is subject-matter
related to the occurrence in George Santopietro’s Complaint and his FAC — the
parties that allegedly occurred in August 2019 on George Santopietro’s real
property. Therefore, George Santopietro appears to have timely filed his
pleadings, and there does not appear to be any statute of limitations issue
with James Harden’s pleadings. 
 
D. 
    Negligence Cause of Action
 
1. 
    Legal Standard
 
In order to state
a claim for negligence, Plaintiff must allege the elements of (1) “the
existence of a legal duty of care,” (2) “breach of that duty,” and (3)
“proximate cause resulting in an injury.” (McIntyre v. Colonies-Pacific, LLC
(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.)
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
Here, James Harden alleges: (1) that the HOA
owed a duty to James Harden, who was subject to the HOA’s rules; (2) that the
HOA breached its rules, and thus its duty, in a variety of ways, including by
not telling James Harden about its entry rules; and (3) that James Harden was
directly harmed by this breach. (Harden FACC, ¶¶ 38–41.)
 
For the purposes of a demurrer, the Court
must assume the truth of the pleading. These allegations are sufficient to
withstand demur. 
 
The Court OVERRULES the Demurrer to the first
cause of action for negligence. 
 
E. 
    Breach of Contract and/or Contractual
Indemnity
 
1. 
    Legal Standard
 
a.  
    Breach of Contract
 
To state a cause of action for breach of
contract, a plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis
W. Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)
 
If a breach of contract claim “is based on
alleged breach of a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the
body of the complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and
incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) 
 
“In an action based on a written contract, a
plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise
language.” (Constr. Protection Servs., Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co.
(2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198–199.)
 
b.  
    Contractual Indemnity 
 
The
current case law regarding indemnity is best explained by the Supreme Court in Prince
v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1151, 1157–58.
 
“In general, indemnity refers to ‘the
obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has
incurred.’ (Rossmoor
Sanitation, Inc. v. Pylon, Inc. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 622, 628.) Historically, the obligation of
indemnity took three forms: (1) indemnity expressly provided for by contract
(express indemnity); (2) indemnity implied from a contract not specifically
mentioning indemnity (implied contractual indemnity); and (3) indemnity arising
from the equities of particular circumstances (traditional equitable
indemnity). (Ibid.; see PPG Industries, Inc. v. Transamerica Ins. Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 310, 318.)
 
“Although
the foregoing categories of indemnity were once regarded as distinct, we now
recognize there are only two basic types of indemnity:
express indemnity and equitable indemnity. (See Bay Development, Ltd. v. Superior Court (1990) 50 Cal.3d 1012, 1029–1030 & fn.
1 (Bay
Development).)
Though not extinguished, implied contractual indemnity is now viewed simply as
‘a form of equitable indemnity.’ (Id. at p. 1029; see E. L. White, Inc. v. City of Huntington Beach (1978) 21 Cal.3d 497, 506–507 (E. L. White).)
 
[¶]
 
“Express indemnity refers to an
obligation that arises ‘by virtue of express contractual language establishing
a duty in one party to save another harmless upon the occurrence of specified
circumstances.’ (Bay Development, supra, 50 Cal.3d at p. 1029.) Express indemnity
generally is not subject to equitable considerations or a joint legal
obligation to the injured party; rather, it is enforced in accordance with the
terms of the contracting parties' agreement. (Markley v. Beagle (1967) 66 Cal.2d 951, 961.) 
 
[¶]
 
“Unlike express indemnity, traditional equitable
indemnity requires no contractual relationship between an indemnitor and an
indemnitee. Such indemnity ‘is premised on a joint legal obligation to another
for damages,’ but it ‘does not invariably follow fault.’ (Western Steamship Lines, Inc. v. San Pedro
Peninsula Hospital (1994) 8 Cal.4th 100, 114 (Western Steamship).) Although traditional equitable indemnity once operated to
shift the entire loss upon the one bound to indemnify, the doctrine is now
subject to allocation of fault principles and comparative equitable
apportionment of loss. (Bay Development, supra, 50 Cal.3d at pp. 1029–1030, fn. 10; American Motorcycle Assn. v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 578, 591–598 (American Motorcycle).)”
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
Here, the Harden FACC pleads a cause of
action against the HOA for “contract liability or indemnity.” It is unclear
whether this is actually a cause of action for breach of contract or a cause of
action for contractual indemnity (i.e., express indemnity). James Harden does
not argue that implied indemnity (i.e., equitable indemnity) is at issue here.
 
        Just as with the Court’s
April 5, 2024 ruling regarding Defendant V.M. Rosich’s Demurrer, the Court
considers the contract at issue, which is titled “Vacation Rental Agreement.” 
 
First, the HOA is not a signatory to the
agreement.
 
Second, paragraph 17 of the Vacation Rental
Agreement deals with homeowners’ associations and others planned unit
developments. However, despite a box that was left to be checked if this
section applied and a line that left to be written on with the name of any relevant
homeowners’ association, the box was left unchecked, and no name was written on
the line. (See Complaint, Exh. A, ¶ 17.) Thus, the HOA was not expressly a part
of this contract. 
 
Finally, as with V.M. Rosich’s Demurrer, the
Court again notes that the only provision in the Vacation Rental Agreement
involving indemnity is paragraph 24.C., which states:
 
“Indemnity and Hold Harmless: Occupant agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Owner and Owner’s Representative from all
claims, disputes, litigation, judgments, costs and attorney fees resulting from
loss, damage or injury to Occupant, Occupant’s guests or licensees or their
personal property.”
 
The Court agrees with the HOA that James
Harden cannot sustain a cause of action for breach of contract and/or express
indemnity against the HOA on this contract. The Court has not been presented
with any evidence or allegation that the HOA is a signatory to and/or a
beneficiary of the contract. Indeed, intentionally leaving out the HOA when
paragraph 17 envisions its inclusion strongly indicates that the HOA was not
intended to be included in the contract in any manner. Furthermore, the
“Occupant” — whoever that was/were — is/are the ones who is/are the
party/parties that could be required to indemnify and hold harmless under the
indemnity clause, not the “Owner.”
 
        The
Court SUSTAINS the HOA’s Demurrer to the second cause of action for “contract liability
or indemnity,” without leave to amend the Harden FACC.  
 
III.    
Conclusion 
 
North Beverly Park Homeowners’
Association’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED in part. The Demurrer is SUSTAINED as to
the second cause of action for “contract liability of indemnity,” without leave
to amend the Harden FACC. The Demurrer is OVERRULED as to all else.
