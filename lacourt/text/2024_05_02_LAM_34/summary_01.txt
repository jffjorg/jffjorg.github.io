And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The North Beverly Park Homeowners' Association (HOA) filed a demurrer to the cross-complaint of James Harden, alleging that the cross-complaint fails to state a cause of action. The court found that the HOA's demurrer is sustained in part, specifically with respect to the second cause of action for "contract liability or indemnity," which is based on a vacation rental agreement. The court ruled that James Harden cannot sustain a cause of action for breach of contract and/or express indemnity against the HOA on this contract because the HOA is not a signatory to the agreement.
