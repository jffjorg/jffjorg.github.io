And here is a summary in English text:

The plaintiff, Ari Chazanas, filed a motion to set aside default and default judgment against the defendant, Vazgen Hakopian. The court denied the motion. Vazgen Hakopian argued that he was incapacitated due to a vehicle accident and did not receive notice of the motion for terminating sanctions. However, the court found that Vazgen Hakopian's arguments and evidence were not credible, and that he failed to participate in the litigation despite being able to do so. The court also found that Vazgen Hakopian did not take reasonable steps to participate in the litigation and intentionally avoided it. The court denied the motion because it lacked the discretion to grant relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
