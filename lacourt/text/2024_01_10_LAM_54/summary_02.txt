And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by the defendants, Moises Villasenor and Estela Villasenor, against the plaintiffs, Agustin Arias and Sandra Gomez. The demurrer challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint, specifically the ninth cause of action for violations of the California Lawful Remedies and Right to Cure Act (CLRA).

The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs may file a first amended complaint within 30 days of the ruling. The defendants must file and serve a response within 30 days thereafter.

The judge has ruled that the CLRA does not apply to real property leases, and that the claim is uncertain. The defendants had argued that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations because the plaintiffs did not plead the dates the claim accrued. However, the judge has held that the plaintiffs are not required to affirmatively allege a cause of action is not barred by the statute of limitations.

The judge has also held that the CLRA protects consumers from deceptive practices in transactions involving the sale or lease of goods or services, but that this does not apply to real property leases. The plaintiffs had alleged that the defendants engaged in deceptive practices by misrepresenting the habitability of the rental property, but the judge has held that this is insufficient to show that the CLRA is applicable.

Overall, the judge's ruling is that the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, and that the parties must comply with the time limits set forth in the ruling.
