Motion for Attorney’s Fees

individually and derivatively on behalf of Glendale Eye Medical Group
Responding Party: None

PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel
(or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
Plaintiff moves for an award of
attorney’s fees under Penal Code § 496(c). Following a bench trial,
the Court found in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on all causes of action,
including that for violation of Penal Code § 496(a), which prohibits theft of
property. Penal Code § 496(c) states, “any person who has been injured by a
violation of subdivision (a) or (b) may bring an action for three times the
amount of actual damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit,
and reasonable attorney's fees.”
 
Plaintiff requests $650,812.50 in attorney’s fees.  Plaintiff’s counsel, Alston & Bird LLP,
represents that 914.3 hours at hourly rates of $325.00 to $1,075.00 were spent to
prosecute this action. The Court finds these fees reasonable. This action
lasted approximately four years and included motion work, discovery, and trial.
Defendant has not opposed this motion to show why these fees should not be
granted.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
