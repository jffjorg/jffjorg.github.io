Summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication filed by the plaintiffs, Ibiere N. Seck and Seck Law, P.C., against the defendant, Brian T. Dunn, A Professional Law Corporation, and the Cochran Firm. The dispute revolves around a fee sharing agreement between the parties regarding the distribution of attorney's fees from a case called John Doe v. The Rock Corona, et al. The Cochran Firm contends that Seck falsely induced Morris to believe that the Doe matter was only at the firm for a short period and that Seck concealed her retention of Taylor & Ring from the Cochran Firm. The Court finds that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Seck fraudulently induced the Cochran Firm to enter into the agreement and denies summary adjudication on the breach of contract claim.
