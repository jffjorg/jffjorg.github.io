BACKGROUND
 
On September 6, 2022, Plaintiffs Carolina Esparza and Jennifer Rojas
filed a Complaint alleging violations of the Labor Code against Defendants Collazo
Chiropractic Inc., (CCI) and Dr. Jean Collazo, D.C. Before the Court is Plaintiff’s
motion to
Deem the Truth of the Matters in Request for Admissions Set 1 Admitted as
against Defendant Collazo Chiropractic, Inc., and Request for Monetary
Sanctions in the Amount of $1,876.02. 
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
                Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.250, provides,
in pertinent part, that “[w]ithin 30 days after service of the request for
admissions . . . the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the
original of the response to them on the requesting party.” Requests for
admission must be deemed admitted where no responses in substantial compliance are
served before the hearing. (CCP §2033.280(c).) 
 
            “[A] motion to have admission requests deemed admitted
may not be granted where the record establishes ... that (1) proposed responses
to the requests have been served prior to the hearing on the motion and (2)
such responses are in substantial compliance with the provisions of section
2033, subdivision (f)(1).” (Tobin v. Oris (1992) 3 Cal. App. 4th 814,
828, overruled on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.
4th 973, 983 n.12.) Courts evaluate tardy responses to requests for admissions
as a whole to determine whether they substantially comply with the code, and do
not evaluate each individual response. (St. Mary v. Sup. Ct. (2013) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 779-80.)
 
             Esparza states that on January 16, 2024,
Requests for Admission (Set 1) were propounded on CCI by overnight mail and
email; the deadline to respond was February 20, 2024. (Gomez Decl., ¶ 2-3.)
After no responses were served, Plaintiff’s counsel reached out to Defense
counsel and requested that responses be served without objections by March 1,
2024. (Gomez Decl., ¶ 4.) Responses were not served by that date.
 
            CCI states that
responses have now been served. The motion is moot. 
 
Even if discovery responses have been served, the Court may still award
sanctions. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 407.)  Plaintiff seeks sanctions and costs totaling $1,876.02.
The request is reasonable; the Court imposes sanctions against Defendant CCI in
the total amount of $1,876.02.
