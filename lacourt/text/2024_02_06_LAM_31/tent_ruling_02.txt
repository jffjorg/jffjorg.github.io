MOTION
FOR ATTORNEY FEES



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
David Lemesurier
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Ford
Motor Company
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On May 10, 2023, Plaintiff, David Lemesurier, filed this
action against Defendants, Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) and Sunrise Ford Fontana,
for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Civil Code § 1790, et
seq.  Ford filed an Answer to the
Complaint on August 8, 2023.¿ 
 
On November 1, 2023, Ford served an Offer to Compromise and
Acceptance Under Code of Civil Procedure section 998.¿ Plaintiff accepted the
998 Offer on December 4, 2023.  
 
On January 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs and concurrently filed a Memorandum of Costs.
 
Ford filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied.¿ 
 
II.        DISCUSSION AND LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Plaintiff seeks a
total award of $37,567.65, consisting of $36,098.00 in attorney fees and
$1,469.65 in costs.  
 
On December 4,
2023, the parties agreed to settle the matter.  (Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 22-24.)
The settlement provides for attorney fees by motion under Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d).  (Notice of Motion, p. ii.)
 
Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d) provides: 
(d) If the buyer
prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the
court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of
costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action. 
 
(Civ. Code, §
1794, subd. (d), emphasis added.) 
  
The parties do not
dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable
attorney fees as the prevailing party.  The only matter at issue is the
reasonableness of the fees requested. 
  
The determination
of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial
courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v.
Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1134.) “The
determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the
‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In
setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to
consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in
the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun v. AT&T Information
Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per
hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus.
(1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the
fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
 
The court has
broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award
which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a
prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.”  (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The court need not explain its calculation of
the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors
considered in arriving at the amount will suffice.  (Ventura v. ABM
Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.) 
 
1.     
Reasonable Hourly Rate 
 
Plaintiff retained
The Lemon Pros, LLP for this matter which involved work by attorneys Michael
Saeedian and Christopher Urner, billing at hourly rates of $695 and $525,
respectively.  (Saeedian Decl., ¶
11.)  Law clerk Jorge Acosta also billed a portion of the hours at $250
per hour. (Id.) 
 
Ford argues the hourly
billing rates for Plaintiff’s attorneys are excessive and unsupported. 
(Opp., pp. 4-5.)  In particular, Ford attacks Mr. Saaedian’s hourly
billing rate of $695 and requests that the court apply a blended rate of $250.  
 
Based upon general
prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area for this type of litigation, the court
finds the reasonable rate for attorney billing is as follows: for lodestar
purposes, the court will award a “blended” hourly rate of $500.00 per
hour.  (See, e.g., Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020)
48 Cal.App.5th 240, 256 [trial court has discretion to award a “blended hourly
rate” for attorney’s fees motion].)  The court further finds the
reasonable rate for support staff billing to be $200.00 per hour.  This
determination considers the complexity of the case, the quality of services
provided, and the attorneys’ experience. 
 
2.     
Number of Hours Reasonably Expended 
 
Plaintiff’s
records reflect a total of 78 hours billed. (Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 51, 52, Ex.
A.) Plaintiff’s counsel billed roughly 40 hours and a law clerk billed roughly
38 hours.  (Id.)
 
“[I]t is the
burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged
[within the moving party’s verified billing invoice], with a sufficient
argument and citations to evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed
are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”  (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)   
 
Ford objects to
Plaintiff’s counsel’s attempt to recover fees for administrative tasks
performed by a non-attorney.  (Opp., pp. 6-7.)  Ford also objects to the
amount of billing given that The Lemon Pros uses templates from prior cases for
preparing form discovery and meet and confer letters.  Ford requests a
reduction for administrative tasks and for tasks involving the use of form
documents.  This court agrees with many
of these observations.   
 
The court
appreciates that this case progressed towards trial.  Along the way,
Plaintiff served and responded to standard written discovery, and filed motions
to compel further responses which were ultimately not heard because the parties
agreed to settle the matter. (Saeedian Decl., Ex. A.) There was little law and
motion practice.  
 
Moreover, there
was nothing particularly complex or unique about this case.  The issues
involved were applicable to other consumers’ vehicles, thereby triggering
economies of scale in terms of Plaintiff’s counsel’s efficiency in litigating
this type of lemon law case.  As Plaintiff’s counsel law firm’s name suggests,
they specialize in lemon law cases.  Litigating this matter should not
have required more than slight factual modification to existing boilerplate. 
The court also notes this case settled less than seven months after it was
filed.
 
Considering these
facts, the court agrees that in some instances, the time quoted is excessive or
unreasonable under the circumstances.  
 
Based on the
foregoing, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the court finds
that the total amount of reasonable attorney’s fees in this case, using a
lodestar methodology, is $20,000.  This was calculated by (1) multiplying
the hourly rate of $500.00 by 30 hours out of 40 hours billed, which the court
deems to be the total amount of reasonable attorney’s fees expended in this
matter, and (2) multiplying the hourly rate of $200.00 by 25 hours out of 38
hours billed, which the court deems to be the total number of reasonable non-attorney
fees expended in this matter.    
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
Plaintiff is awarded attorney fees in the total sum of $20,000.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
