I.          INTRODUCTION

 
On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff, Giselle Maciel, filed a consumer
arbitration demand against Defendant CarMax Auto Superstores, Inc. (“CarMax”)
with JAMS.  On July 26, 2023, JAMS issued
to CarMax an invoice for payment of arbitration fees.  Payment was requested by August 26, 2023.  Plaintiff inquired whether CarMax had timely
paid the invoice.  On September 27, 2023,
JAMS confirmed they had not received payment from CarMax.  On September 30, 2023, Plaintiff notified JAMS
of her election to withdraw her case from arbitration and proceed in court
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1291.98(b)(1).  Thereafter, JAMS confirmed receipt of Plaintiff’s
request and closed its file on the arbitration.
 
On October 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against
CarMax in this court.
 
Plaintiff now moves for an order compelling CarMax to pay
Plaintiff’s arbitration fees and costs and award discovery sanctions pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1291.98 and 1281.99.
 
CarMax filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied. 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Attorney’s fees may be recovered as costs when authorized by
contract, statute, or law.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(10).) 
 
“In an employment or consumer arbitration that requires,
either expressly or through application of state or federal law or the rules of
the arbitration provider, the drafting party to pay certain fees and costs
before the arbitration can proceed, if the fees or costs to initiate an
arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due date the
drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in
default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel arbitration under Section
1281.2.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.97(a).)  “If the drafting party
materially breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default under
subdivision (a), the employer or consumer may do either of the following: (1)
[w]ithdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate
jurisdiction [or] (2) [c]ompel arbitration in which the drafting party shall
pay reasonable attorney’s fees and costs related to the arbitration.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1281.98(b)(1).)  “If the employee or consumer proceeds with
an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the court shall impose
sanctions on the drafting party in accordance with Section 1281.99.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.97(d).) 
 
Under Section 1281.99, “[t]he court shall impose a monetary
sanction against a drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration
agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1281.97 … by ordering the
drafting party to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and
costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a result of the material
breach.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.99(a).)  Evidence and terminating sanctions
are also available, in addition to monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§¿1281.99(b).) 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            It is undisputed JAMS did not receive timely payment of
arbitration fees from CarMax.  Instead,
CarMax resists Plaintiff’s motion by arguing: (1) CarMax timely issued and
mailed a check for arbitration fees, notwithstanding JAMS’s claimed non-receipt
of payment, (2) Plaintiff’s alleged costs and fees are excessive, and (3)
discovery sanctions should not be imposed because JAMS did not intentionally
fail to pay the arbitration fees.  The
court addresses each argument in turn.
 
1.     
Timely
Issued Payment
 
CarMax acknowledges Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.99
is strictly enforced.  Nevertheless, CarMax
argues attorney fees should not be awarded because section 1281.99 was not
enacted to address situations like this one, where the drafting party timely
sent payment which the arbitrator contends it did not receive. 
 
            Case law
does not support CarMax.  In Doe v.
Superior Court (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 346, petitioner Jane Doe sued real
parties in interest—Doe’s former employer and manager—arising from the
manager’s alleged sexual harassment and assault of Doe.  Real parties compelled the case to
arbitration.  September 1, 2022 was the
due date for real parties to pay arbitration fees and costs to the arbitrator.
Per Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98, real parties were required to make
payment by October 3 to avoid breaching the arbitration agreement.  The real parties opted to mail a check even
though payment could be submitted by credit card, electronic check, or wire
transfer.  The check arrived on October
5.  Petitioner moved to vacate the order
compelling arbitration for real parties’ failure to timely pay the arbitration
fees and costs.  The trial court denied
the motion.  Doe petitioned for writ of
mandate.  The Court of Appeal issued the
writ and stated, 
 
“we
strictly enforce the 30-day grace period in section 1281.98(a)(1) and
conclude fees and costs owed for a pending proceeding must be received by
the arbitrator within 30 days after the due date. We do not find that the
proverbial check in the mail constitutes payment and agree with petitioner
that real parties’ payment, received more than 30 days after the due date
established by the arbitrator, was untimely.”
 
(Doe, 95 Cal.App.5th at pp. 350-51, italics in
original.) 
 
            Doe’s clear
language is dispositive of two issues: (1) payment is timely only if the
arbitrator receives the payment within the statutory period of 30 days after
the due date; conversely, the issue date of the payment is irrelevant, and (2) CarMax
materially breached the arbitration agreement when JAMS did not receive payment
by the due date.  Accordingly, under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1291.99, subdivision (a), the court must impose a
monetary sanction against CarMax by ordering CarMax to pay Plaintiff’s
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs.
 
2.     
Reasonableness
of Attorney Fees 
 
Perhaps sensing this court must award fees and costs to
Plaintiff, CarMax next challenges the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s alleged
attorney fees.  And with good
reason.  Plaintiff requests a total award
of $13,915 in attorney fees for 33.1 hours billed by no less than five
attorneys and two paralegals.  CarMax
argues the fees are excessive considering this case is not complex nor does it involve
voluminous pleadings or correspondence.  
 
Plaintiff contends the court must award all attorneys’ fees
and costs associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding because the
court has no discretion in awarding monetary sanctions due to a material breach
of an arbitration agreement. Plaintiff’s argument runs contrary to the language
of the relevant statutes. 
 
CCP section 1281.98 provides, in relevant part, “If the
employee or consumer withdraws the claim from arbitration and proceeds in a
court of appropriate jurisdiction, … the employee or consumer may
bring a motion, or a separate action, to recover all attorney’s fees and all
costs associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98(c)(1), emphasis
added.)
 
CCP section 1281.99 further provides, “The court shall
impose a monetary sanction against a drafting party that materially breaches an
arbitration agreement …, by ordering the drafting party to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney's fees and costs, incurred by the employee or
consumer as a result of the material breach.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98(a), emphasis added.)
 
In other words, the trial court has discretion to determine
the reasonableness of a request for attorney’s fees. Further, for the reasons
that follow, the court finds Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees is
excessive.
 
            Legal
Principles Re Reasonableness of Attorney Fees
 
The determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is
within the sound discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000)
79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable
fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”¿ “[T]he lodestar is the
basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by
the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”¿ (Graciano
v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ In setting
the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the
rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community
for similar work.’”¿ (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993)
13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other
grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644,
664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove
reasonableness of the fees.¿ (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of
San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.)¿ 
¿ 
The court has broad discretion in determining the amount of
a reasonable attorney’s fee award which will not be overturned absent a
“manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.”¿ (Bernardi v. County
of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-94.)¿ The court need not
explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail;
identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice.¿ (Ventura
v. ABM Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)¿ 
 
Hourly Billing Rates 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel billed at hourly rates of $675, $585,
$525, $330, and $280.  Support staff
billed at hourly rates of $175 and $155. 
(Barry Decl., ¶ 8.) 
 
Based upon general prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area
for this type of litigation, the court finds the reasonable rate for attorney
billing is as follows: for lodestar purposes, the court will award a “blended”
hourly rate of $500.00 per hour.¿ (See, e.g., Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North
America, LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 256 [trial court has discretion to
award a “blended hourly rate” for attorney’s fees motion].)¿ The court further
finds the reasonable rate for support staff billing to be $150.00 per hour.¿
This determination considers the complexity of the case, the quality of
services provided, and the attorneys’ experience.¿ 
 
Number of Hours Reasonably Expended
 
Plaintiff’s counsel billed 33.1 hours.  (Barry Decl., ¶¶ 8, 9.)  The work performed is not identified. 
 
“[I]t is the burden of the challenging party to point to the
specific items challenged [within the moving party’s verified billing invoice],
with a sufficient argument and citations to evidence.¿ General arguments that
fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”¿ (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
CarMax objects to Plaintiff’s counsel’s attempt to recover
fees without any breakdown of billing or explanation of the hours allegedly
expended by various attorneys and staff.¿ (Opp., p. 3.)¿ Specifically, Plaintiff
does not describe what attorney Ahmed Yousef contributed to the case despite
billing 11.7 hours.  Plaintiff does not
address Mr. Yousef’s time in reply.
 
The court appreciates that Plaintiff demanded arbitration of
her claims.  The case was submitted to
arbitration then withdrawn soon after CarMax failed to make timely payment.¿ The
parties do not identify any discovery that has been propounded.  And beyond this motion, there has been no
motion practice.¿  
  
Considering these facts, the court agrees that in some
instances, the time quoted is excessive or unreasonable under the
circumstances.¿¿ 
¿ 
Based on the foregoing, and in view of the totality of the
circumstances, the court finds that the total amount of reasonable attorney’s
fees in this case, using a lodestar methodology, is $7,875.¿ This was
calculated by (1) multiplying the hourly rate of $500.00 by 15 hours, which the
court deems to be the total amount of reasonable attorney’s fees expended in
this matter, and (2) multiplying the hourly rate of $150.00 by 2.5 hours, which
the court deems to be the total number of reasonable non-attorney fees expended
in this matter.¿¿¿
 
3.     
¿ Discovery Sanctions
 
When a drafting party has materially breached an arbitration
agreement, the court may order an evidence sanction prohibiting the drafting
party from conducting discovery in the civil action unless the court finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿1281.99(b)(1).) 
 
Plaintiff requests an evidence sanction against CarMax.  An evidence sanction is not appropriate in
this situation.  Plaintiff, not CarMax, demanded
arbitration.  Plaintiff could have proceeded
to arbitration despite CarMax’s default if she wished.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §¿1281.98(b).) 
Instead, Plaintiff withdrew her case from arbitration, as is her right, and now
seeks to impair CarMax’s ability to defend against her claims while proceeding
in this forum.  CarMax did not timely pay
the arbitration fees.  However, CarMax
offers support that the payment was issued and mailed prior to the due
date.  (See Mondejar Decl., ¶ 3.)  Given this background, discovery sanctions
are not warranted.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            Plaintiff
is awarded attorney fees of $7,875.  The
request for discovery sanctions is DENIED. 

 
Counsel for Plaintiff to give notice.
