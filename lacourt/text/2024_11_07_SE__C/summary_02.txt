And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for reconsideration filed by the defendants, RECYCLED BASE MATERIALS, INC. and SECURITY PAVING COMPANY, INC. The defendants had moved to reconsider the court's July 10, 2024 order denying their motions for summary judgment and adjudication.

The judge has denied the motion for reconsideration, finding that the defendants failed to meet the statutory requirements for reconsideration under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008. The judge also found that the defendants' arguments were not based on new or different facts, law, or circumstances that could not have been discovered or presented earlier.

However, the judge has reconsidered, on its own motion, the portion of its July 10, 2024 order denying Defendant RECYCLED BASE MATERIALS, INC.'s Motion for Summary Judgment, or alternatively, Summary Adjudication. The judge has granted this motion, finding that the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine applies to this case and that the plaintiff's claim against RECYCLED BASE MATERIALS, INC. is barred.

The judge's ruling is subject to change after a hearing on November 7, 2024.
