as counsel of record for Kenneth Redding. This Court’s August 6, 2024 Order
states: “The attorney declaration demonstrates good cause of withdrawal based
on the death of the Defendant and the estate’s apparent unwillingness to
participate in the current litigation. On July 29, 2024, Counsel for Defendant
filed [a] Notice of Defendant Redding’s Death Certificate.” (08/06/24 Order)
 
On
November 5, 2024, Plaintiffs' Motion to Continue Trial and Related Dates was
denied without prejudice due to Plaintiff's failure to show compliance with
California's Probate Code pertaining to the continuation of claims against the
Decedent's estate. (See CCP 377.41.) 
 
Trial
is scheduled to begin on December 11, 2024. Plaintiff's Motion to Deem Request
for Admissions Admitted against Defendant Kenneth Redding is scheduled to be
heard after trial on March 13, 2025. 
 
Plaintiff
now moves ex parte to advance Plaintiff's Motion to Deem RFA's Admitted against
Defendant Kenneth Redding to be heard on a date prior to the December 11, 2024
trial date. 
 
Defendant
Kenneth Redding died on April 1, 2024. A defendant is not amenable to service
after death, and an action cannot proceed against a deceased defendant in the
absence of appointment of a representative or service of process on the
defendant's insurer. (See CCP  377.21; 377.31; 377.41.) When an action is
pending at the time of the defendant's death, the Court, on motion, shall allow
the action to continue against the personal representative of the defendant's
estate provided that the plaintiff has complied with the claims requirements of
the Probate Code. (CCP 377.41.) The claims requirements are set forth in
Probate Code 9370. If a claim is not filed in the probate proceedings and the
personal representative of the estate is not joined in the civil action, the
damages sought against the decedent are generally limited to any insurance
coverage that is available to the decedent. (See Prob. Code 554.) Here, no
motion has been filed to demonstrate that Plaintiff has complied or attempted
to comply with the creditor’s claim procedures to continue any claims against
Defendant Redding’s estate. Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application to Advance
Plaintiff's Motion to Deem RFA's Admitted against Defendant Kenneth Redding to
be heard on a date prior to the December 11, 2024 trial date is DENIED
without prejudice.
