And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motions of defendants Smooth Sailing Consulting, LLC, Darius Rutledge, and Jennifer Jane Sanchez to set aside the defaults entered against them. The court finds that the defaults were entered due to improper service of the summons and complaint, and that the defendants have shown sufficient grounds to warrant relief. The court also finds that the declarations of Jennifer Jane Sanchez and Darius Rutledge are sufficient to warrant relief.

The court has denied the motions to quash service of summons without prejudice. The court declines to rule on the motions to quash because the defendants were still in default when the motions were filed, and the court lost jurisdiction to address any action by the defaulted defendants other than a motion to vacate entry of default.

The court has ordered the defendants to file and serve answers or responsive pleadings within 5 days of the issuance of this order. The moving party is instructed to give notice to the other parties.
