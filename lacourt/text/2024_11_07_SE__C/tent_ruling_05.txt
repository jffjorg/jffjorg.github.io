#5
 
Alivia
Abreu, Esq.; Patricia Mamac; and the Wilshire Law Firm’s unopposed motion to
withdraw as counsel of record for Plaintiff KAREN KONIECZKA is GRANTED.  
 
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Oppositions filed as of November 4, 2024. 
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper
notice to the client at the last known residence or business address of the
client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
Counsel’s declarations indicate that there has been a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship. Where the issue (or conflict) is between the
lawyer and client(s), without implicating other parties, the court can rely on
counsel’s sworn declaration absent any reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed breakdown in attorney-client communications. It does not
appear that the Wilshire Law Firm’s continued representation would serve the
interests of justice. The motion to withdraw is GRANTED.
