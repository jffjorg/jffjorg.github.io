And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to compel arbitration and motion for stay filed by Rivera Sanatarium, Inc. and Kent Stephens. The motion was filed on June 7, 2024, in response to the complaint filed by Teresa Escalante (by and through her Successor in Interest, Maria Torres) on October 27, 2023.

The court found that the defendants did not act inconsistently with the right to arbitrate and that the arbitration agreement was not valid and binding. The court also found that Maria Torres did not have the authority to enter into the arbitration agreement on behalf of the Decedent.

The court noted that the General Power of Attorney granted Maria Torres authority to make financial management decisions, but not health care decisions. The court concluded that the defendants failed to meet their burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement and therefore denied the motion to compel arbitration.
