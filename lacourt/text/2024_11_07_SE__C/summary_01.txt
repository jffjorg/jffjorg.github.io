And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is denying the plaintiff's ex parte application to advance their motion to deem requests for admissions admitted against Defendant Kenneth Redding to a date prior to the December 11, 2024 trial date. The denial is without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff can re-file the application at a later time. The Judge's decision is based on the fact that Defendant Kenneth Redding died on April 1, 2024, and the plaintiff has not complied with California's Probate Code pertaining to the continuation of claims against the Decedent's estate. The Judge notes that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the claims requirements of the Probate Code means that the damages sought against the decedent are generally limited to any insurance coverage that is available to the decedent.
