And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to deposit the disputed settlement funds with the court and be discharged from liability. The plaintiffs, Arias Sanguinetti Wang & Team LLP and Law Offices of Hamed Yazdanpanah & Associates, represented Defendant Teketa Bellamy in a personal injury lawsuit, which resulted in a settlement of $35,000. After paying a Medicare lien, various medical providers and lienholders asserted competing claims on the remaining settlement funds. The plaintiffs move to deposit the disputed funds of $31,849.11 with the court and be discharged from liability. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated that the disputed funds should be deposited with the court and the plaintiffs discharged from liability. The judge directs the plaintiffs to deposit the disputed funds with the court within 20 days of the order and to file and serve proof of deposit. The funds will be held until further order of the court. The judge denies the plaintiffs' request for a restraining order.
