And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motions of defendants Luxe Development, Inc. and Oren Levy to set aside the defaults entered against them on August 20, 2024. The defaults were entered due to mistake, surprise, and/or excusable neglect by plaintiff's counsel, who surreptitiously took the defaults while the parties were engaged in settlement discussions. The judge finds that the defaults were entered without any understanding that pleadings need not be filed while negotiations are in process. The judge cites case law to support the decision, noting that the policy of the law is to have every litigated case tried on its merits and that any doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default. The judge orders the defendants to file a responsive pleading by December 20, 2024.
