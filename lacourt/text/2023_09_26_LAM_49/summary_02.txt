The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to seal portions of its motion for summary adjudication and certain documents referenced therein. The defendant, Testan Law, had sought to seal the documents in order to preserve the confidentiality and privilege of attorney-client communications and attorney work product. However, the court found that the defendant had failed to establish an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the records. The court also found that the defendant's proposal to seal the documents was not narrowly tailored and that the defendant had failed to demonstrate any other overriding interest that warrants a sealing order. The plaintiff, Mark Metzelar, had opposed the sealing order, arguing that the defendant had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest sufficient to override the strong presumption of public access to court records. The court has ordered the defendant to notify the court within 10 days as to what conditionally sealed documents, if any, may become unsealed in connection with the defendant's pending motion. If no such notification is timely received, the court will order that the conditionally sealed documents be stricken from the record and court file.
