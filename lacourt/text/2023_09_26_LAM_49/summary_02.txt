And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to seal portions of its motion for summary adjudication and certain documents referenced therein. The defendant, Testan Law, had sought to seal the documents in order to preserve the confidentiality and privilege of attorney-client communications and attorney work product. However, the court found that the defendant had failed to establish an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the records. The court also found that the defendant's proposal to seal the documents was not narrowly tailored and that the defendant had failed to demonstrate any other overriding interest that warrants a sealing order. The plaintiff, Mark Metzelar, had opposed the sealing order, arguing that the defendant had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest sufficient to override the strong presumption of public access to court records. The court has ordered the defendant to notify the court within 10 days as to what conditionally sealed documents, if any, may become unsealed in connection with the defendant's pending motion. If no such notification is timely received, the court will order that the conditionally sealed documents be stricken from the record and court file.

### English Summary
The tentative ruling for the case of Mark Metzelar vs. Testan Law, A Professional Corporation, involves a motion by the defendant to file portions of its Motion for Summary Adjudication and certain documents under seal. The defendant argues that this is necessary to preserve the confidentiality and privilege of attorney-client communications and attorney work product. However, the plaintiff opposes this motion, stating that the defendant has failed to demonstrate a compelling interest sufficient to override the strong presumption of public access to court records.

After reviewing the defendant's motion and accompanying documents, the court finds that the defendant has failed to establish an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the records. The court also determines that the proposed sealing is not narrowly tailored, as the defendant seeks to seal the entirety of its motion and accompanying documents, rather than only the specific portions that may be subject to a sealing order.

Therefore, the court denies the defendant's Motion to Seal. The defendant is required to notify the court within 10 days as to what conditionally sealed documents, if any, may become unsealed in connection to the defendant's pending motion. If no such notification is timely received, the court will order that the conditionally sealed documents be stricken from the record and court file, and such documents shall not be considered by the court.
