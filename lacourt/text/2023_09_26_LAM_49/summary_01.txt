##  Tentative Ruling Summary: Kurt Knutsson et al. v. Judith Salkow Shapiro et al. 

**Case Number:** 18STCV04752
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Dept:** 49

**People Involved:**

* **Plaintiffs:** Kurt Knutsson and Woojivas, Inc.
* **Defendants:** Judith Salkow Shapiro, APC, and San Pasqual Fiduciary Trust Company

**Nature of the Case:** Legal malpractice and fraud related to representation in a right of publicity case against KTLA and other television stations.

**Key Issues:**

* **Statute of Limitations:** The main dispute centers around whether the statute of limitations for legal malpractice has expired. 
* **Continuing Representation:** Plaintiffs argue that their attorney, Judith Shapiro, continued to represent them in the underlying case even after filing a notice of withdrawal, thereby extending the statute of limitations.

**Summary:**

This tentative ruling denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The Court finds that there are factual disputes regarding whether Shapiro's representation of Plaintiffs continued past the point where the statute of limitations would begin to run.

**Evidence Considered:**

*  Plaintiffs presented evidence of phone calls and emails between them and Shapiro after the notice of withdrawal, suggesting ongoing legal advice and strategy discussions.
*  Defendants argue that the notice of withdrawal, combined with Shapiro's communication explaining her reasons for withdrawing, should have signaled the end of representation.

**Court's Reasoning:**

*  The Court finds that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Shapiro continued to advise Plaintiffs on the underlying case until near her death.
*  The Court also notes that the statute of limitations may have been extended to November 13, 2018, due to holidays, allowing Plaintiffs to file their complaint on that day.

**Next Steps:**

* The case will proceed to trial unless the parties reach a settlement.


Let me know if you have any other questions.

```

English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment and alternative motion for summary adjudication. The issue is whether the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The court finds that there are triable issues of fact as to whether Shapiro continued to represent Knutsson after notice of withdrawal, and therefore, the court cannot grant summary judgment. The court also notes that even if Shapiro did not continue to represent Knutsson, the statute of limitations would have been tolled due to the continuing representation theory. The court concludes that the plaintiffs' claims are timely and denies the defendants' motions.
