And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant ARDI VIII International, LLC's motion for summary judgment in a negligence and premises liability case. The case involves a false alarm at Westfield Fashion Mall, which allegedly caused a commotion that led to the plaintiff, Sacha Agopian, falling from playground equipment. The judge found that ARDI failed to meet its initial burden to demonstrate an absence of a triable issue of fact regarding duty and causation. The judge also found that ARDI did not provide sufficient evidence to show that the false alarm did not cause the plaintiff's fall. As a result, the judge denied ARDI's motion for summary judgment and the case will proceed to trial.
