[1] Although
ARDI argues that “Plaintiff has not put forward any theory, let alone any
evidence, specifically explaining how ARDI’s conduct triggered the smoke
alarm,” it is defendant’s initial burden on summary judgment to show the
absence of a triable issue of fact. (Motion at p.7.) ARDI does not set forth
facts showing that Plaintiff lacks evidence or cannot reasonably obtain it.
(See Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 854.) In
addition, ARDI argues in its reply that under Plaintiff’s theory, “it would be
immaterial whether the alarm that sounded was a false alarm or a properly
triggered alarm – it would have been the sounding of the alarm, and not the
reason for the alarm, that matters.” (Reply at p. 3.) However, a false alarm
resulting in panic or commotion for no valid reason is different from a
properly triggered alarm that signals an emergency.


[2] Although
ARDI argues there are “alternative causation possibilities unrelated to
anything ARDI did or failed to do,” the function of the Court on summary
judgment is not to weigh the evidence or otherwise sit as a trier of fact.
(Motion at p. 9.)
