And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Plaintiffs' Counsel, Garabed Kamarian, to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in communication. The motion was filed without opposition. However, the Court denies the motion because Counsel failed to provide proof of service of the required papers to all parties who have appeared in the case, including Defendant. The Court notes that an attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and withdraw from a case is not absolute and that the decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the court's discretion. The Court also references various laws and regulations, including California Rules of Court 3.1362 and California Rule of Professional Conduct 3.700.
