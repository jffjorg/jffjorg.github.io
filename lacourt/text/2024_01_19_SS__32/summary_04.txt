Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena served on non-party Advanced Multispecialty Surgery Center (Advanced) by Defendants Randy George Cudworth, Del Amo Construction, Inc., and Enterprise FM Trust LSR. The subpoena sought treatment records for Plaintiff Ramon Mayoral. Although Advanced failed to produce the records, the motion is untimely because the 60-day deadline for filing the motion began on March 1, 2022, when the records were supposed to be produced. The Court finds that the defendants failed to show that a good faith meet and confer took place and that the motion was not made in bad faith or without substantial justification. As a result, the motion is denied, and the request for monetary sanctions is also denied.
