Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied SP Plus Corporation's motion for leave to file an amended cross-complaint to add a fourth cause of action, "Tort of Another", to recover attorney's fees against Destination Shuttle Services, LLC. The Court found that the proposed amendment would be futile, as there is no authority for extending the tort of another doctrine to a motor vehicle negligence action. The Court noted that the doctrine is limited to exceptional circumstances and that the motion was previously taken off calendar. The Court also considered the opposition by Destination Shuttle Services, LLC and found that it was not waived by the failure to oppose the initial motion. The Court concluded that SP Plus Corporation's claims are not exceptional circumstances and that the proposed amendment would not state a valid cause of action as a matter of law.
