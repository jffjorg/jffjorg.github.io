And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions to approve the compromise of pending actions of minors Romel Roque and Blake Capanna. The parties have agreed to settle all claims for a total amount of $15,500. However, the court denies the petitions due to several defects and omissions in the filings.

Specifically, the court notes that the petitioner failed to comply with the MC-350EX form, providing incomplete information on the settlement agreement. The court also finds that the petitioner did not provide a clear disposition of the settlement funds, nor did they specify the damages claimed by each party. Additionally, the court notes that the petitioner's guardian ad litem failed to mark all applicable boxes on the MC-350EX form.

The court orders the petitioner to cure all defects and provide additional information to support the settlement agreement. The petitioner must also provide an itemization of the specific expenses sought and specify the damages claimed by each party. If the petitioner fails to comply, the court may deny the petitions and require the parties to comply with the court's orders.

## Tentative Ruling Summary:  

**Case Number:** 19STCV38999
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023

    * Blake Capanna (age 12) 
* **Defendants:**  
    *  *Not named in provided text*

**Facts:**

* A settlement has been reached in an ongoing case (not specified) involving both Romel Roque and Blake Capanna.
* The total settlement amount is $15,500.
*  $14,000 is allocated to Roque, $1,500 to Capanna.

**Disputes:**

* The Court is reviewing petitions to approve the settlement for the minors.
* The petitions are deficient and require amendment.

**Judge's Concerns:**

* **Petitioner's Role:** The petitioner is listed as both parent and guardian ad litem for both minors.  This requires clarification on the MC-350EX forms.
* **Pending Action:** Both petitions state the claim is not subject to a pending action, but the underlying case is currently before the court. 
* **Injury Recovery:**  Roque's petition does not indicate if he has recovered from his injuries.
* **Expense Itemization:**  Both petitions lack detailed itemization of expenses, especially for Roque's $2,511.57 in "Costs (filing fees, etc.)".
* **Attorney's Fees:**  Inconsistent information regarding attorney's fees from both petitions.  The attorney may be seeking fees from both minors' portions, and this must be clarified.
* **Settlement Disbursement:**  Lack of clarity on how the settlement funds will be disbursed and where they will be held. Requests for blocked account funds need specific details.
* **Special Damages:** Attachment 12, listing special damages, is insufficient and does not meet the required criteria.


**Judge's Ruling:**

The Court has **denied** both petitions for the above-mentioned reasons.

**Next Steps:**

The petitioner must amend both petitions to address all the deficiencies noted by the Court.


**English Summary:**

The judge has tentatively decided to deny the petitions to approve the settlement for minors Romel Roque and Blake Capanna.  The petitions are incomplete and contain several inconsistencies. The judge needs more detailed information about the petitioner's role, the nature of the case, the expenses claimed, the attorney's fees, and the distribution of the settlement funds. The petitioner must amend the petitions to address these concerns before the judge can approve the settlement.
