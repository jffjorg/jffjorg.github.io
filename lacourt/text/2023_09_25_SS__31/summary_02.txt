Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petitions to approve the compromise of pending actions brought by Romel Roque and Blake Capanna, minors, and has denied the petitions without prejudice. The Court finds that the petitions are defective and must be amended to cure several defects. Specifically, the Court notes that the petitions fail to provide sufficient specificity in the claims, fail to provide itemization of expenses, and fail to clearly indicate the disposition of the settlement funds. The Court also notes that the settlement agreement is subject to a pending action and that the attorney's fees claimed are unclear. The moving party is ordered to give notice, and the petitions must be amended to address these defects before they can be reconsidered.
