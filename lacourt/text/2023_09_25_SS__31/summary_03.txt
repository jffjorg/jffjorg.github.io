Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively denied the application for default judgment filed by SAFECO INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA against CARLITO'S TOWING SERVICE. The Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the amount it paid for its insured's property damages in the principal amount of $25,425.55 and costs in the amount of $579. However, the Judge finds that the declaration provided by the Plaintiff's counsel, Nerrissa Dyett, is insufficient as it does not have personal knowledge of the damages suffered or authority to authenticate the documents attached in support of the claim. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects and warns that failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
