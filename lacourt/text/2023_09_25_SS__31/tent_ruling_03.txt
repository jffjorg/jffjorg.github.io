Plaintiff also seeks costs in the amount of $579. Plaintiff has properly dismissed all other parties in this action aside from Defendant Carlito’s Towing Service.    However, the application for default judgment filed on June 12, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:    Plaintiff must provide a declaration by a percipient witness with personal knowledge of the damages suffered or by an authorized custodian. Instead, Plaintiff provides the declaration of its counsel, Nerrissa Dyett. As Plaintiff’s attorney of record, counsel is necessarily not Plaintiff’s custodian of records, and therefore has insufficient knowledge of the alleged insurance benefits paid by Plaintiff to its insured, and insufficient authority to authenticate the documents attached in support thereof.   No later than ___________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ______________________.  Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
