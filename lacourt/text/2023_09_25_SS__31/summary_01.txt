```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or adjudication on all causes of action. The Judge found that Plaintiff failed to meet his burden to show that there are no triable issues of material fact as to the causes of action for negligence, premises liability, and intentional tort (assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress).

The Judge noted that the Plaintiff's complaint does not plead emotional distress in any manner, and therefore, the Court is unable to grant adjudication on a legal theory not actually pled. Additionally, the Judge found that the police and crime report, offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted, are inadmissible hearsay, and further, the unauthenticated medical and billing records are inadmissible.

The Judge also noted that the deemed admissions make it clear that the underlying lawsuit is for an intentional act as opposed to an unintentional act falling below the standard of care. Therefore, the Court is unable to grant summary judgment on the cause of action for negligence.

The Judge ordered Plaintiff to give notice, and parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number, and include the hearing date and time, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.

```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or adjudication on the three causes of action: negligence, premises liability, and intentional tort. The Judge found that the deemed admissions made by Defendant through Requests for Admission showed that the underlying lawsuit is for an intentional act, rather than an unintentional act, and therefore Plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment on the cause of action for negligence. The Judge also found that Plaintiff's third cause of action for intentional tort is not fully pled and therefore cannot be granted. Finally, the Judge noted that the supporting evidence referenced in Plaintiff's separate statement, aside from the RFAs deemed admitted, are inadmissible hearsay and therefore cannot be considered.

**Case Summary**

Case Number: 19STCV37719
Plaintiff: Michael Eric Anderson
Defendant: Hank Lachman aka Harry Davin Lachman
Judge: Hon. Michelle C. Kim
Court: Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Central District, Dept. 31

**Background**

The case involves a personal injury claim filed by Michael Eric Anderson against Hank Lachman aka Harry Davin Lachman. Anderson alleges that Lachman intentionally discharged a firearm at him, causing serious injury. Lachman's responses to the complaint include a general denial and affirmative defenses.

**Tentative Ruling**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or alternative adjudication. The motion is based on deemed admissions obtained through requests for admissions (RFAs). The judge has granted Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain documents, but denied the request for judicial notice of the truth of the matters contained in those documents.

**Analysis**

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the following grounds:

1. **Negligence**: There is insufficient evidence to support a claim of negligence against Lachman.
2. **Premises Liability**: There is no evidence that a dangerous condition of the property caused Anderson's injuries.
3. **Intentional Tort**: The third cause of action is defective and does not plead the essential elements of assault, battery, or intentional infliction of emotional distress.

**Conclusion**

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or alternative adjudication. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
