And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or adjudication on all causes of action. The Judge found that Plaintiff failed to meet his burden to show that there are no triable issues of material fact as to the causes of action for negligence, premises liability, and intentional tort (assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress).

The Judge noted that the Plaintiff's complaint does not plead emotional distress in any manner, and therefore, the Court is unable to grant adjudication on a legal theory not actually pled. Additionally, the Judge found that the police and crime report, offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted, are inadmissible hearsay, and further, the unauthenticated medical and billing records are inadmissible.

The Judge also noted that the deemed admissions make it clear that the underlying lawsuit is for an intentional act as opposed to an unintentional act falling below the standard of care. Therefore, the Court is unable to grant summary judgment on the cause of action for negligence.

The Judge ordered Plaintiff to give notice, and parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number, and include the hearing date and time, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.
