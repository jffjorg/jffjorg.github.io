  Case Number:  19STCV37719    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  MICHAEL ERIC ANDERSON, Plaintiff(s),  vs.  HANK LACHMAN aka HARRY DAVIN LACHMAN, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 19STCV37719  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND/OR ADJUDICATION  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  September 25, 2023  I. Background Plaintiff Michael Eric Anderson (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Hank Lachman (“Defendant”) for injuries Plaintiff sustained after Defendant intentionally discharged a firearm at Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges he was shot twice in the arm. Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), utilizing a Judicial Council Form, sets forth three causes of action for negligence, premises liability, and “intentional tort.” Plaintiff filed two amendments to complaint, naming the same Defendant, Hank Lachman aka Harry Davin Lachman, as Doe 1.  Plaintiff now moves for summary judgment or in the alternative summary adjudication.  Any opposition to the motion was due on or before September 11, 2023. (CCP § 437c(b)(2).) To date, no opposition has been filed.¿¿  II. Request for Judicial Notice Plaintiff requests the Court take judicial notice of: (1) The Court’s July 22, 2022 order granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Request for Admissions (“RFAs”) admitted, (2) the Court’s July 22, 2022 tentative ruling of Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem RFAs admitted, (3) the existence, contents, and exhibits of Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem RFAs admitted, and (4) the existence, contents, and exhibits regarding Plaintiff’s Notice of Ruling on the Motion to Deem RFAs admitted. Requests 1, 3, and 4 are granted only to the extent as to the existence of the documents, but not to the contents or the truth of the matters therein. [Judges cannot take judicial notice of hearsay statements asserted in court filings, but can take judicial notice of the existence of such documents.  Johnson & Johnson v. Sup. Ct. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 768;  Williams v. Wraxall (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 120, 130 n. 7  (judges may take judicial notice of the existence of court documents, “but cannot take judicial notice of the truth of hearsay statements in decisions or court files, including pleadings, affidavits, testimony, or statements of fact.”).] Request 2 is denied.    III. Motion for Summary Judgment   Legal Standard A party seeking summary judgment has the burden of producing evidentiary facts sufficient to entitle him/her to judgment as a matter of law.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c).)  The moving party must make an affirmative showing that they are entitled to judgment irrespective of whether or not the opposing party files an opposition.  (Villa v. McFerren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 742-743.)  Thus, “the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519 (citing Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.).  When a plaintiff seeks summary judgment, the plaintiff must produce admissible evidence on each element of each cause of action on which judgment is sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(1).)  The moving party’s “affidavits must cite evidentiary facts, not legal conclusions or ‘ultimate’ facts” and the courts must construe the evidence in support of the opposing party, resolving any doubts in favor of the opposing party.  (Hayman v. Block (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 629, 639; Scalf, 128¿Cal.App.4th at 1519; Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) “¿[A] motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.¿” (¿¿Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c)¿¿.) The moving party bears the initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact. (¿¿Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850¿¿.) If the moving party carries this burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to make a prima facie showing that a triable issue of material fact exists. (¿¿Ibid.¿¿) Courts “¿liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.¿” (¿¿Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389¿¿.)   A plaintiff moving for summary judgment must show that there is no defense to any of the asserted causes of action and do so by proving each element of the cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (a)(1), (p)(1).) A party may move for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative defenses, one or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty, if that party contends that the cause of action has no merit or that there is no affirmative defense thereto, or that there is no merit to an affirmative defense as to any cause of action, or both, or that there is no merit to a claim for damages, as specified in Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that one or more defendants either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs. A motion for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty. (CCP § 437c(f)(1).) Plaintiff’s complaint serves to frame the scope of the issues which must be addressed in the summary judgment motion.  (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-82.)    Discussion Plaintiff’s motion is based primarily on the deemed admissions. (Min. Order, July 22, 2022.) “[A] deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial fiat, that a nonresponding party has responded to the requests by admitting the truth of all matters contained therein.”  (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979.)  Requests for admissions “differs fundamentally from the other five discovery tools (depositions, interrogatories, inspection demands, medical examinations, and expert witness exchanges) . . . [because] admission requests seek to eliminate the need for proof: ‘The purpose of the admissions procedure . . . is to limit the triable issues and spare the parties the burden and expense of litigating undisputed issues.’  Sometimes, the admissions obtained will even leave the party making them vulnerable to summary judgment.”  [Citations.]  Matters that are admitted or deemed admitted through RFA discovery devices are conclusively established in the litigation and are not subject to being contested through contrary evidence.  [Citation.]”  (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 775.) As framed by the pleadings, Plaintiff alleges that on September 12, 2019, Defendant shot Plaintiff twice in the arm, and Plaintiff sustained serious injury as a result. Plaintiff pleads in the alternative that Defendant “negligently discharged a firearm at Plaintiff” (Compl. at p. 4) and Defendant “intentionally discharged a firearm at Plaintiff” (Compl. at p. 6.). On February 10, 2020, Defendant filed his Answer to the FAC, asserting his general denial and affirmative defenses. On July 22, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to deem the matters within Requests for Admission (Set One) admitted.  (Min. Order, July 22, 2022.)  Plaintiff is therefore deemed to have admitted the following: (1) Plaintiff was living with Defendant on Defendant’s property at 8001 Winsford Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90045; (2) On September 12, 2019, Defendant shot Plaintiff in his left arm; (3) Defendant placed a pillow over the gun he shot Plaintiff with; (4) on September 12, 2019, James Copeland (“Copeland”) was Defendant’s neighbor at 8007 Winsford Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90045; (5) Copeland drove Plaintiff and Defendant to the hospital after Defendant shot Plaintiff; (6) Defendant wrote a post-it note to Plaintiff while Plaintiff was in the hospital in September 2019 and gave it to Plaintiff; (7) In October 2019, Defendant was arrested for shooting Plaintiff; and (8) Defendant instructed Defendant’s friend “Vince” to destroy the gun Defendant shot Plaintiff with.   1. First Cause of Action - Negligence  The elements of a negligence cause of action are the existence of a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury. “ ‘In most cases, courts have fixed no standard of care for tort liability more precise than that of a reasonably prudent person under like circumstances.’ This is because ‘[e]ach case presents different conditions and situations. What would be ordinary care in one case might be negligence in another.’ ” (Coyle v. Historic Mission Inn Corp. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 627, 639-640, internal citation omitted.) Plaintiff pled in the alternative both negligence and an intentional tort under the same facts. Generally, complainants may plead, in the alternative, inconsistent facts or theories. (Crowley v. Katleman (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 666, 690;  Adams v. Paul (1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 593.) While Plaintiff may allege two or more causes of action which are inconsistent with each other in the pleading, Plaintiff is not entitled to recover under both theories on a motion for summary judgment, especially when the elements are legally distinct and contradictory to each other. Complaint allegations are not evidence, because pleadings are merely formal allegations. (San Diego Police Officers Assn. v. City of San Diego (1994) 29 Cal. App. 4th 1736, 1744;  Cassady v. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP (2006) 145 Cal. App. 4th 220, 241.) The deemed admissions make it clear that the underlying lawsuit is for an intentional act as opposed to an unintentional act falling below the standard of care. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to meet Plaintiff’s moving burden to show he is entitled to judgment as to the cause of action for negligence.  Accordingly, adjudication as to the cause of action for negligence is DENIED.    2. Second Cause of Action - Premises Liability The elements of a premises liability and negligence cause of action are the same: duty, breach, causation and damages.  (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)  “The owner of premises is under a duty to exercise ordinary care in the management of such premises in order to avoid exposing persons to an unreasonable risk of harm.  A failure to fulfill this duty is negligence.”  (Brooks v. Eugene Burger Management Corp. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1619; Annocki v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.)  “[B]efore liability may be thrust on a landlord for a third party's injury due to a dangerous condition on the land, the plaintiff must show that the landlord had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition in question, plus the right and ability to cure the condition.’” (Stone v. Center Trost Retail Properties, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 608, 612.) Plaintiff’s operative FAC alleges Defendant negligently owned, maintained, managed and operated the premises. Plaintiff also contends Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord. However, there is no evidence that a dangerous condition of the property caused Plaintiff damages. Plaintiff’s allegations make it clear that Plaintiff’s suit against Defendant is premised upon the intentional act of Defendant shooting Plaintiff twice in the arm. Plaintiff provides no support that any condition of the property supports a cause of action for premises liability. Therefore, adjudication as to the cause of action for premises liability is DENIED.    3. Third Cause of Action – “Intentional Tort” Plaintiff’s motion contends the third cause of action is for (1) Assault, (2) Battery, and (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (“IIED”). However, Plaintiff’s third cause of action does not identify which intentional tort Plaintiff brings against Defendant, and it appears that Plaintiff is now contending that there are three sub causes of action contained within the third “intentional tort” cause of action of the FAC. For summary judgment purposes, issues framed by complaints and answers, which are to be addressed, may include even those pled defectively, yet intelligibly, although not theories completely missing from pleadings. (Physicians Comm. For Responsible Medicine v. McDonald's Corp. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 554, 568  (“the issues framed by the pleadings are the only issues a motion for summary judgment must address.”);  FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 382-383;  Jordan-Lyon Prods., ITD., v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472;   Bostrom v. County of San Bernardino (1995) 35 Cal. App. 4th 1654, 1663;  580 Folsom Assocs. v. Prometheus Dev. Co. (1990)  223 Cal. App. 3d 1, 14, 18 (burden to address theories “reasonably contemplated by the opponent's pleading”);  Melican v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2007) 151 Cal. App. 4th 168, 182 (not requiring party to negate an unstated claim).) Therefore, the Court turns to the allegations to determine whether Plaintiff’s theories were present in Plaintiff’s defective pleading.  The FAC’s third cause of action provides the following: Defendant intentionally discharged a firearm at Plaintiff on or about September 12, 2019, and as a result Plaintiff was shot twice in the arm; Plaintiff sustained a serious injury as a result; Defendant’s act is considered a felony; Plaintiff is informed and believed Defendant was angry at Plaintiff at the time when the firearm was discharged. (Compl. at p. 6.)  Assault and Battery “The elements of a cause of action for assault are: (1) the defendant acted with intent to cause harmful or offensive contact, or threatened to touch the plaintiff in a harmful or offensive manner; (2) the plaintiff reasonably believed he was about to be touched in a harmful or offensive manner or it reasonably appeared to the plaintiff that the defendant was about to carry out the threat; (3) the plaintiff did not consent to the defendant’s conduct; (4) the plaintiff was harmed; and (5) the defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff’s harm”  (Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 879, 890; see also Kiseskey v. Carpe’ters’ Trust for So. Cal. (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 222, 232 [“The tort of assault is complete when the anticipation of harm occurs.”].)    The elements of a civil battery are (1) the defendant intentionally did an act which resulted in a harmful or offensive contact with the plaintiff's person, (2) the plaintiff did not consent to the contact, and (3) the harmful or offensive contact caused damage to the plaintiff.  (Fluharty v. Fluharty (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 484, 497.)    Generally, complaints must contain ultimate facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles  (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550;  Berger v. Cal. Ins. Guar. Ass’n (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 989, 1006;   Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82 Cal. App. 4th 592, 606.) The difference between conclusions and ultimate facts is not clear, but involves matters of degree, and a determination whether the complaint apprises defendants of the bases. (Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exch. (2005) 132 Cal. App. 4th 1076, 1099 (citing, e.g., Perkins v. Sup. Ct. (1981) 117 Cal. App. 3d 1, 6).)  Notably missing from the allegations as to the purported sub causes of action for assault and battery is that Plaintiff did not consent to Defendant’s conduct. This is an essential element to the causes of action for assault and battery. Accordingly, the Court is unable to grant Plaintiff’s motion on an unspecific third cause of action with legal theories not fully pled. Furthermore, the Court notes the supporting evidence referenced in Plaintiff’s separate statement, aside from the RFAs deemed admitted, are inadmissible hearsay. When a plaintiff seeks summary judgment, the plaintiff must produce admissible evidence on each element of each cause of action on which judgment is sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(1).) The police and crime report, offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted, are inadmissible hearsay. Further, the unauthenticated medical and billing records are inadmissible.   IIED The elements of a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress are (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant, (2) intention to cause or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress, (3) severe emotional suffering, and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress.  (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 617.) Plaintiff’s FAC does not plead emotional distress in any manner. For similar reasons as above, the Court is unable to grant adjudication on a legal theory not actually pled.   Therefore, adjudication as to the third cause of action for “intentional tort,” whether it be assault, battery or IIED, is DENIED.   IV.
