Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to reopen discovery to gather more information about a plaintiff's surgery. The plaintiff, Katherine Vargas-Moreno, underwent surgery on September 14, 2023, but the defendants did not know about it until September 21, 2023. The defendants argue that they need this information to assess damages and prognosis, and that they will be at a disadvantage without it. The judge agrees, concluding that the defendants have shown good cause for reopening discovery. The judge orders that the defendants complete their discovery by August 15, 2024, and that the parties file their revised joint lists of trial exhibits and witnesses by August 30, 2024. The judge notes that the parties should address the impact of the new information on the life care plan and expert testimony.
