 Case Number:  23AHCV02079    Hearing Date:   June 3, 2024    Dept:  P On the Court's own motion, the June 3, 2024 hearing date is vacated and Plaintiff's motions to compel are continued to June 18, 2024, which is the date of the case management conference. Plaintiff has filed three motions
to compel initial discovery, one motion as to Defendant Julia Zhu, one as to
Defendant UCAR LA Inc. and one as to Defendant Fantastic Garden LLC.  However, each motion improperly seeks to compel different
types of discovery in a singular motion. This circumvents paying proper filing
fees and is not allowed. (CCP § 1003, GC § 70617.)  (See also Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, [8:1140.1] at 8F-60 (The Rutter Group 2011) ["Motions to compel compliance with separate discovery requests ordinarily should be filed separately."]) Plaintiff is advised to avoid this practice in the future.Plaintiff must pay the filing fees for 6 additional motions and show proof of such payment at the time of hearing on these motions.  However, addressing the merits, had these motions been properly brought (the Court also notes that as of May 30, 2024 at 11:30 AM, they are unopposed), the Court likely would have granted the motions in their entirety and imposed sanctions.Therefore, the Court orders the parties to meet and confer and resolve these outstanding discovery matters prior to the case management conference.  The Court reminds the parties that civil discovery is intended to be a self-executing system with minimal judicial intervention.The clerk is to give notice.Dated 5/30/24 Jared D.
