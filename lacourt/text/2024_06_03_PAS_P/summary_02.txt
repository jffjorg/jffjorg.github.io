And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Jared D. Moses vacates the scheduled hearing date of June 3, 2024, and continues the Plaintiff's motions to compel to June 18, 2024, which is the date of the case management conference. The Plaintiff has filed three motions to compel initial discovery against different defendants, but each motion improperly seeks to compel different types of discovery in a single motion. The court finds that this circumvents paying proper filing fees and is not allowed. The Plaintiff is advised to avoid this practice in the future and must pay the filing fees for 6 additional motions and show proof of payment at the hearing. The court notes that had the motions been properly brought, it would have granted the motions in their entirety and imposed sanctions. The court orders the parties to meet and confer to resolve outstanding discovery matters prior to the case management conference.
