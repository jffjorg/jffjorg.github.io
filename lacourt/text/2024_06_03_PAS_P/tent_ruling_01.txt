  Case Number:  21GDCV00328    Hearing Date:   June 3, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEESI.        INTRODUCTION  
This
is an action for release of a mechanic’s lien.
The complaint was tried by way of default on January
10, 2024. The cross-complaint was struck on October 30, 2023. Plaintiff Gilbert
Acosta now moves for an order fixing Plaintiffs’ fee award. 
This
motion was filed March 8, 2024. It is unopposed.
The motion is granted and fees are awarded in the
amount requested. 
          
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. §1033.5(a)(1) provides for attorney fees as
costs when provided for by contract, statute, or law. Whoever prevails on a
petition to release property from a mechanic’s lien is entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees. (Civ. Code § 8488(c).)
           Civ. Code §1717 (a)
provides in part that “reasonable attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the court
and shall be an element of the costs of suit.”
          PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084
contains the Supreme Court’s explanation of how fees are to be determined. It
states that Civ. Code §1717, “reflects the legislative purpose ‘to establish
uniform treatment of fee recoveries in actions on contracts containing attorney
fee provisions.’ (Citation.) Consistent with that purpose, the trial court has
broad authority to determine the amount of a reasonable fee.” Id. at
1095. PLCM teaches that fees are to be determined by calculating the
“‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.” (Ibid.)         
 
III.     ANALYSIS
A. Prevailing Party 
Here, Acosta argues that Plaintiffs (Acostas) are entitled
to attorney’s fees. He urges “Acosta is the prevailing party in this matter as
he obtained a judgment in his favor for the petition to remove Alpine
Plastering’s mechanic’s lien. Moreover, Acosta is also the prevailing party as
to the First Amended Cross-Complaint as the Court ordered it stricken on
October 30, 2023.” (Motion p. 5: 18-21.) Defendant’s default was entered by the
Court on January 10, 2024. (1/10/24 Minute Order.) The cross-complaint was
stricken in its entirety on October 30, 2023. (10/30/23 Minute Order.) As the
complaint concerned the release of a mechanic’s lien and default judgment was
entered against Defendant and in favor of the Acostas, Plaintiffs are entitled
to their attorney fees.
As
Plaintiffs are the prevailing party in this action, they are the prevailing
party in terms of CCP 1717. As such, they are entitled to attorney fees.
 
B.
Reasonableness of Fees
The
analysis of reasonableness of attorney fee awards considers “the nature of the
litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required and skills
employed in handling the litigation, the attention given, the success of the
attorney’s efforts, his learning, his age, and his experience in the particular
type of work demanded…” (Berry v. Chaplin (1946) 74 Cal.App.2d 669,
678-679, citations omitted.) There is no requirement that billing records be
provided to a trial court in connection with a motion for fees pursuant to
contract. The declaration of counsel as to the hours spent on this litigation
and the hourly rates charged for such time is all that is required. “[T]here is
no legal requirement that an attorney supply billing statements to support a
claim for attorney fees.” (Mardirossian & Associates, Inc. v. Ersoff
(2007) 135 Cal.App.4th 257, 269.) “[T]here is no legal requirement that such
statements be offered in evidence. An attorney’s testimony as to the number of
hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even
in the absence of detailed time records.” (Steiny & Co., Inc. v.
California Electric Supply Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293.) 
Here, the declaration of Plaintiffs’ counsel, Ton Nu, provides
a sufficient basis for the fee request. (Nu Declaration.) Nu provides
backgrounds on the attorneys who billed on this case, Jillian Reyes, and himself.
(Nu Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.) Attached to the motion are the billing records. (Exh. 3). 
          The Court has examined the evidence presented by Plaintiffs
and makes the following findings: the rates requested are reasonable and 615.6
hours is a reasonable amount of time spent, given the length of this case (5 years).
As such, the Court GRANTS the motion for attorney fees in the amount of $30,037.00.
The Court also grants the request for $6,628.64 in costs. (See Nu Decl. ¶ 12.)
           The Court awards $30,037.00
in attorney fees and $6,628.64 in costs, for a total of $36,665.64.
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Plaintiff Gilbert Acosta’s motion for attorney fees is
granted.
Plaintiffs’ counsel to give
notice of this order. 
Attorney
fees and costs of $36,665.64 are awarded.
