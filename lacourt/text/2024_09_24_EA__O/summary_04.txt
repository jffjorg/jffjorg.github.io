And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses an objection to a motion filed by the Plaintiff. The motion was filed on 9/11, which is 9 court days before the hearing. The Defendant argues that the motion is untimely because the opposition was sent via mail and carries an additional five days' notice. The Judge finds that the objection is not a reply as it does not address the points raised in opposition and therefore overlooks the untimeliness. The Judge also notes that the Defendant's failure to address the merits of the opposition and lack of prejudice by considering the opposition support the court's decision. The Judge is also considering a proposed cross-complaint by the Defendant, which alleges that he never received the loan amount and that he discussed with Tuyet, the other party, that he did not intend to go forward with the loan agreement and that Tuyet orally agreed to cancel the agreement. The Judge has not yet made a final decision on the motion and will do so at the hearing.
