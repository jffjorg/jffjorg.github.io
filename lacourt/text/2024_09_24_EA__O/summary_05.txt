```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The denial is based on several reasons: first, the plaintiff has failed to comply with the requirements for default judgment set forth in California Rules of Court Rule 3.1800. Second, the plaintiff has not submitted a default judgment request on a CIV-100 form, which is necessary to determine the amount of damages being sought. Third, the court has not been provided with any evidence to support the plaintiff's claim for damages, which appears to exceed one million dollars. The judge is requiring the plaintiff to submit additional evidence and to comply with the default judgment application requirements before the application can be reconsidered.
