```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs. The defendant seeks to assert causes of action for fraud, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and declaratory relief against the plaintiffs, who are contradicting themselves by stating that the loan amount is $488,000 when the original loan amount was actually $168,445. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to plead these causes of action earlier was due to oversight and that the defendant acted in good faith. The judge notes that the legislative mandate is to encourage trial on the merits whenever possible, and that the court has only a "modicum of discretion" in denying leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint. Therefore, the judge is granting the defendant's motion.
