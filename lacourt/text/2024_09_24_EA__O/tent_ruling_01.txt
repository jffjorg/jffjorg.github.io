  Case Number:  22PSCV00883    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
MOTION TO ADOPT VALUE PURSUANT TO THE
UNIFORM PARTITION OF HEIRS PROPERTY ACT is GRANTED.[1]
 
Background
 
This is a
real property case. Plaintiff EDWARD CHAPPELL alleges the following against
Defendants LILLIAN CHAPPELL (“Lillian”)[2]and
MARTIN CHAPPELL (“Martin”): Plaintiff and Lillian were married, and Martin is
their son. Defendant Martin resides with Plaintiff and is committing waste.
Plaintiff seeks partition by sale because Defendants refuses to buy out
Plaintiff's interest in the real property. (Complaint p. 3.)[3]

 
On August 18,
2022, Plaintiff filed the instant action for partition.
 
On October
12, 2022, Defendant Martin filed his answer.
 
On October
23, 2023, Defendant filed a MOTION TO APPOINT APPRAISER PURSUANT TO UNIFORM
PARTITION OF HEIRS PROPERTY ACT AND TO APPOINT REFEREE TO DETERMINE OFFSETS
AFTER THE APPRAISAL IS OBTAINED, which the court granted on 1/25/24. 
 
On May 22,
2024, the parties filed a ‘Stipulation Regarding Referee’s Authority to
Consider Offsets.’
 
On August 2,
2024, the instant motion was filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Previously, Martin sought to buy
out Plaintiff’s interest and have a referee appointed to determine offsets. The
court on 1/25/24 determined that the subject property was “heirs property” and
appointed an appraiser to value the property. Further, pursuant to the Heirs
Act, the court determined that Defendant may buy Plaintiff’s interest. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 874.317(a), emphasis added.) 
 
Now, the parties are before the
court as on February 22, 2024, Martin filed his Notice of Filing Verified
Appraisal, which appraisal valued the Property at $890,000. Martin requests
that the court adopt this value of the Property for Martin’s buyout purposes
under the Heirs Act and include in its Order that the Parties are entitled to
offsets and contribution based on an accounting of all costs, expenses, and
capital expenditures related to the Property, which is currently under
consideration by the court-appointed referee. 
 
Absent an opposition, the court
grants the motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted.
