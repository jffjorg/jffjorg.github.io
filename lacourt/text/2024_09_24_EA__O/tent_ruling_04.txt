[1] The contract was entered in Vietnam and a certified
translator has translated the notarized written agreement which is attached as
Exhibit A to the complaint. 
 


[2] The objection is not a reply as it does not
address the points raised in opposition. Defendants argue that even though the
motion was filed on 9/11, which is 9 court days before the hearing, it is
untimely by four days because the opposition was sent via mail, which carries
an additional five days’ notice. Considering (i) the technicality, (ii) the
opposition was not grossly untimely, (iii) Defendant’s failure to address the
merits of the opposition, and (iv) the lack of prejudice by considering the
opposition, the court overlooks the untimeliness. Lastly, it is unclear
how the failure to file a timely opposition warrants sanctions and attorney
fees against Plaintiffs. (Defendants’ Objection p. 3:4-8.) 
 


[3] A review of the proposed cross-complaint provides
more detail than presented in the motion. Defendant alleges that he never
received the loan amount. In fact, Defendant discussed with Tuyet that he did
not intend on going forward with the loan agreement and that Tuyet orally
agreed that the loan agreement would be cancelled. (Motion, Ex. B, p. 35 of 74
of PDF [Proposed Cross-Complaint, p. 4].)
