And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to adopt the value of the property, which has been appraised at $890,000. The motion was filed by the defendant, Martin Chappell, who seeks to buy out the plaintiff's interest in the property. The plaintiff, Edward Chappell, had alleged that Martin was committing waste and refusing to buy out his interest. The judge had previously appointed an appraiser to value the property and a referee to determine offsets. The parties had also filed a stipulation regarding the referee's authority. The judge has determined that the property is "heirs property" and that Martin may buy out the plaintiff's interest. The judge has granted the motion and ordered that the parties are entitled to offsets and contribution based on an accounting of all costs, expenses, and capital expenditures related to the property.
