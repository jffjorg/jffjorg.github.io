MOTION FOR
AN ORDER SEEKING LEAVE OF THE COURT TO FILE CROSS-COMPLAINT AGAINST PLAINTIFFS
is GRANTED. 
 
Background
 
This is a contracts case. Plaintiffs Tuyet Bach Ma Luong and
Vinh Q. Luong allege the following against Defendant Thanh Thi Kim Thach: In
June 2018, the parties entered into an agreement wherein Plaintiffs loaned
Defendant $488,000.00; repayment was due by June 5, 2021. Defendant refuses to
pay back the money.[1]
 
On June 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed suit for: 1.    
Breach of Contract 2.    
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing On July 31, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.
 
On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff (who was pro per at the time
of filing the answer) filed a Substitution of Attorney naming Roman Vu as
counsel.
 
On August 16, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion.
 
On September 11, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition.
 
On September 16, 2024, Defendant filed an ‘Objection to
Plaintiff’s Untimely Opposition to Defendant’s Motion for Leave of Court to
File Cross-Complaint Against Plaintiffs.’[2]
 
Legal Standard
 
Generally, a party must file
a cross-complaint against any of the parties who filed the complaint or
cross-complaint against him or her before or at the same time as the answer to
the complaint or cross-complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50(a).) Defendant's cross-complaint is compulsory if the cause of action “arises out of
the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as
the cause of action … in [the] complaint.”
Code Civ. Proc., § 426.10(c).) Causes
of action arise out of the “same transaction or
occurrence” if the factual or legal issues are logically related. They need not be identical. (ZF Micro Devices, Inc. v.
TAT Capital Partners, Ltd. (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 69; Heshejin v. Rostami (2020)
54 Cal.App.5th 984, 993-994.) The term ‘transaction’ is to be broadly construed
(Ibid.) 
 
The court may grant leave to
file a cross-complaint if the failure to plead a cause of action was the result
of oversight, inadvertence, mistake, neglect, or other cause. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 426.50.) “The
court, after notice to the adverse party, shall grant, upon such terms
as may be just to the parties, leave to amend the pleading, or to file the
cross-complaint, to assert such cause if the party who failed to plead the
cause acted in good faith. This subdivision shall be liberally construed to
avoid forfeiture of causes of action.” (Id, emphasis added) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves for leave to file a cross-complaint on the
grounds that Plaintiffs are contradicting themselves by stating that the loan
amount is $488,000 when the original loan amount is $168,445. (Motion p. 3.)
With that, Defendant seeks to assert the following causes of action (COAs)
against Plaintiffs: Fraud, Intentional Misrepresentation, Negligent
Misrepresentation, and Declaratory Relief.[3]
Defendant did not assert the COAs earlier because Defendant was pro per.
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue the motion is untimely
because (1) a pro per status does not absolve a defendant of her responsibility
to comply with court procedures and (2) it took Defense Counsel about 9 months
to file the cross-complaint. 
 
Here, while Plaintiffs’ arguments are valid, they
are not strong enough to overcome the near lack of discretion this court has on
such motions. Courts at best have only a “modicum of discretion” in
denying leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint. (Gherman v. Colburn (1977) 72
Cal.App.3d 544, 559.) Should the court deny the motion to file a
cross-complaint, it must be supported by “substantial evidence” (Silver
Orgs. V. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 99), evidence which is “of
ponderable legal significance, …reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid
value.” (Ibid, quoting Bowers v. Bernards (1984) 150 Cal.App.3d
870, 873.) The legislative mandate is clear: “[t]he
objective, of course, is to encourage trial on the merits whenever
possible.” (Foot’s Transfer & Storage Co. v. Superior Court (1980)
114 Cal.App.3d 897, 901.) And here, there is no showing of bad faith. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted.
