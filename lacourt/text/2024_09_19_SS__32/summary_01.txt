And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Cross-Defendant PDQ Manufacturing, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication against Veritiv's express indemnification and declaratory relief causes of action. The judge found that PDQ has met its initial burden to demonstrate the absence of a triable issue of fact, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Veritiv, Veritiv has not raised a triable issue of material fact that Plaintiff's "act or omission" is covered by the indemnity agreement. The judge also found that there is no "actual controversy" and the declaratory relief cause of action similarly fails. The judge granted summary judgment in favor of PDQ and ordered that a proposed judgment be served and filed within 10 days.
