And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a fraudulent transfer action related to a stipulated judgment in BC457138. On December 7, 2021, the court overruled the demurrer to the plaintiff's second cause of action but sustained the demurrer as to the sixth cause of action for accounting, with 20 days' leave to amend. On December 27, 2021, the plaintiff filed a notice stating that they would not file a second amended complaint to cure deficiencies found by the court. As a result, the defendant moved to dismiss the plaintiff's accounting claim and enter judgment on that claim pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 581(f)(2). The judge denied the motion because, by its plain language, Code Civ. Proc. § 581(f)(2) relates to dismissing the entirety of a complaint against a particular defendant, and the plaintiff's accounting claim has been forfeited against the defendant. The judge encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative or appear remotely through LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
