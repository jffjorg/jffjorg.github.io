English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in an employment action where the Court compelled the matter to arbitration on June 2, 2023. The plaintiff, Garland Adrian Goff, seeks to vacate the stay and withdraw from arbitration because the defendant, American Guard Services, Inc., failed to timely pay arbitration fees. The defense counsel argues that the failure was inadvertent due to an unexpected cancer illness diagnosis and treatment. The Court finds that the failure to pay fees resulted in a material breach of the arbitration agreement, waiving the defendant's right to compel arbitration. As a result, the plaintiff has a right to reinstate the action. The plaintiff also seeks $3,960 in sanctions, which the Court reduces to $750 due to the circumstances surrounding defense counsel's health. The motion to vacate the stay and withdraw from arbitration is granted.
