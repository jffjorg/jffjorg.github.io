And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services to file a cross-complaint against Huina Allyson Huang, the interpreter who assisted in the adoption process. The plaintiff, Dan Ma, had given up her child for adoption through the defendant, but later sought to rescind the agreement and was refused. The defendant now seeks indemnity and related claims against the interpreter. The judge is granting the motion, as there is no opposition, and notes that the decision to grant permission to file a permissive cross-complaint rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.
