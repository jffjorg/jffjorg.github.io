And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for reconsideration filed by Defendants Bag Fund, Inc. and Jason Lynn. The motion seeks to reconsider the Court's order granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff Narek Aroutynyan. The Court finds that there is no new fact that would warrant reconsideration of the summary judgment orders. The motion relies on a clerical error in the judgment, which was an issue that could have been addressed earlier. The Court also notes that the motion is untimely and that the moving party failed to provide evidence to support its claims. The Court denies the motion and will not continue the hearing pending the outcome of a related case. The Court's decision is based on its discretion to manage the court calendar and to minimize delay and unnecessary expense.
