 Case Number:  21STCV40818    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion Of Plaintiff For Order To Charge
Judgment Debtor Michael Schneider’s Interest In Secret Sauce Group LLC.
SCOTT GOLDSTONE (“Judgment Creditor”) filed this
motion for an order to charge the membership interest of the Judgment Debtor
MICHAEL SCHNEIDER in SECRET SAUCE GROUP LLC, with payment of the unpaid balance
of the judgment entered in this action, and to direct any money or property due
to the Judgment Debtor to be paid directly to the Judgment Creditor until the
amount remaining due on the judgment, plus accrued interest and post judgment
costs, is paid in full.  On 1/22/24,
Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition as to the instant motion.
Judgment Creditor brings this motion pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure Section 708.310 through 708.320 and Corporations Code
Section 17705.03. Together, these code sections provide the Court with authority
to grant the relief sought by Judgment Creditor. Judgment Debtor holds a 50%
economic interest in Secret Sauce, LLC. The Court therefore grants the motion
and will sign the proposed order submitted by Judgment Creditor.
