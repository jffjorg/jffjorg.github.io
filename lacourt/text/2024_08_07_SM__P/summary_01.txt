And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Elat Supermarket, Inc. The motion is denied.

The judge finds that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether the placement of storage bins and cargo pallets in the alley by Elat constitutes a dangerous condition and whether Elat had actual or constructive notice of that condition. The judge also finds that there is a question of material fact as to whether the obstructions placed in the alley by Elat were a causal factor in the accident and plaintiff's resulting injuries.

The judge notes that Elat has failed to establish that it did not own or manage the premises and that it had no actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition. The judge also finds that plaintiff has presented evidence that Elat's placement of obstructions in the alley created a hazardous condition that prevented pedestrians from walking safely in the alley.

The judge concludes that a trial is necessary to resolve the issues of fact and that Elat's motion for summary judgment is denied.
