And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the plaintiff, Michael William Wilson, to the affirmative defenses raised by the defendant, Clayton Damian Fischer, in his answer to the first amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to recover damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident that occurred on July 21, 2022. The defendant, who was employed by Southwark Metal Manufacturing at the time of the accident, alleges that he was driving under the influence of alcohol and that the plaintiff's injuries were caused by the fault of others.

The judge found that the defendant's affirmative defenses, including fault of others, severability, and the Howell doctrine, were sufficient and not uncertain. The judge also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the answer was filed in bad faith. As a result, the judge OVERRULED the demurrer to the first, second, and third affirmative defenses.

The judge ordered the moving party to give notice and directed the parties to send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative ruling. The judge also noted that if the parties do not submit on the tentative ruling and do not appear at the hearing, the court may adopt the tentative ruling as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
