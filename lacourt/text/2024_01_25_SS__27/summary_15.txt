And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied the Quagletti Defendants' motion to amend their Cross-Complaint to add a cause of action for express indemnity. The motion fails to comply with the requirements set forth in Rule 3.1324 of the California Rules of Court, including the failure to provide a proposed amended pleading, a declaration specifying the effect of the amendments, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge finds that the motion is not properly supported and therefore denies it without prejudice. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
