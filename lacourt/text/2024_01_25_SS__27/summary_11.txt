And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel Plaintiff Anglor Lashawn Hendley to undergo an independent medical examination with orthopedic surgeon Dr. Steven Nagelberg. The motion was filed by Defendant Sean Francis O'Connor, who has demanded the examination three times. The judge grants the motion, ordering Plaintiff to appear for the examination within 20 days of receipt of notice. The judge also grants O'Connor's request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her former attorney, Jorge Ledezma Flores, in the amount of $2,000. The sanction is reduced from the original request of $2,400 due to the relatively simple nature of the discovery issue. The judge orders Plaintiff's former attorney to pay the sanction within 30 days. The case will proceed to a hearing on January 25, 2024, unless the parties indicate that they intend to submit on the tentative ruling.
