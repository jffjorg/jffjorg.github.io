[1] Rule
8.1115(e) of California Rules of Court requires that “[a]ny citation to the
Court of Appeal opinion must also note the grant of review and any
subsequent action by the Supreme Court.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
8.1115(e)(1)) (Underline added.) Furthermore, the same rule provision also
provides that a published opinion, while pending the review of the Supreme
Court, “has no binding or precedential effect, and may be cited for potentially
persuasive value only.” (Ibid.)
