And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), to deem the truth of all matters specified in its first set of Requests for Admissions (RFAs) as admitted. The motion was unopposed.

The court finds that LACMTA propounded the RFAs to the plaintiff, Jermaine Alverez Martin, and that the plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests. Therefore, the court grants the motion and deems the truth of all matters specified in the RFAs as admitted.

The court also awards LACMTA reasonable monetary sanctions in the amount of $750 against the plaintiff for failing to respond to the RFAs. However, the court finds that LACMTA's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel of record is improper because it does not identify the specific attorney or law firm against whom the sanction is sought.

The court orders the plaintiff to pay the monetary sanctions within 30 days of the date of notice of this order.
