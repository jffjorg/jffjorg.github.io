On January 25, 2021, Plaintiff Hedyeh
Hamedanizadeh filed this trip and fall action against Defendants. On December 14,
2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel Defendant Glenoaks Business
Park’s responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and to deem the truth of
the matters specified in Request for Admissions, Set Two. The motions are
unopposed.
Compel Responses
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve
timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on
privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).)  Unlike a motion to
compel further responses, a motion to
compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the propounding
party has no meet and confer obligations. 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 404.)
Here, Plaintiff served the subject
discovery on Defendant on November 6, 2023. Defendant has not responded. (Graves
Decl., ¶¶3-4.) Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED. 
Deem Admitted
Where a party fails to timely respond
to a request for admission, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party
who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court
grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently
served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to
respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds.
(a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall grant a
motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff served the subject discovery
on Defendant on November 6, 2023. Defendant has not responded or opposed the
motion. (Graves Decl., ¶¶3-4.) Accordingly, the motion to deem admitted is
GRANTED. 
Monetary Sanctions
Where the court grants a motion to
compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)  Where a party fails to provide a
timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff request sanctions in the
amount of $811.65 per motion. As Defendant has not responded to discovery or
opposed the motion, sanctions are warranted. Sanctions are granted in the
reduced amount of $1200 total for both motions against Defendant and its
counsel of record, jointly and severally.
Moving party to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
