      CASE NO.: 19STCV22817
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO BIFURCATE
 
 
Dept.
  27
1:30
  p.m.
January
  24, 2024



 
          Under the
Personal Injury Court system, this case will be tried by a Court other than the
instant Court.  The trial Court rules on
motions in limine and motions to bifurcate. 
Defendant’s motion is similarly a motion which should be ruled on by the
judge who will preside over trial in this matter.  Thus, Defendants’ motion is denied without
prejudice.
          Defendant is
instructed to renew this motion with the trial judge.
 
Moving party to give notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
Dated
this 25th day of January 2024
