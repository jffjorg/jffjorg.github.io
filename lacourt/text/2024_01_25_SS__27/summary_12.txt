And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel initial responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, and requests for production. The plaintiff's motions are granted in part and denied in part.

The judge orders the defendant to respond to the form interrogatories and special interrogatories without objection within 20 days. The motion to compel responses to requests for production is denied without prejudice.

The judge also orders sanctions in the amount of $1260 against the defendant for failing to respond to the interrogatories. The court finds that the defendant acted without substantial justification and that the imposition of sanctions is justified.

The judge notes that the defendant has failed to provide responses to the interrogatories and requests for production, and that the plaintiff's right to discovery has been prejudiced as a result. The judge concludes that the defendant's failure to respond is a misuse of the discovery process and that sanctions are appropriate.

The judge will consider any submissions from the parties and may adopt the tentative ruling as the final order if no one appears at the hearing to argue the matter.
