Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to continue the trial date and all related dates. The case involves a motor vehicle collision that occurred on June 13, 2018, and the plaintiff, Andreh Gibson, sued the defendants, Yadira Blocker and Abelina Blocker, on June 12, 2020. The defendants moved to continue the trial date, citing the need for additional discovery to adequately evaluate the plaintiff's claim and prepare their case. The Judge agreed that a continuance is necessary, considering the proximity of the current trial date, the reasonableness of the length of continuance requested, and the lack of opposition from the plaintiff. The Judge also noted that the defendants' motion is supported by a stipulation signed by both parties agreeing to a continuance.
