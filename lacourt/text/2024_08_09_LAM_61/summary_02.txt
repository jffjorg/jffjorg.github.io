**Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Essex Management Corporation's demurrer and motion to strike portions of the Complaint. The demurrer is sustained as to the eleventh cause of action for FEHA housing discrimination, with leave to amend. The motion to strike is granted as to the prayer for punitive damages in connection with the breach of contract claim, without leave to amend, and as to the prayer for investigative costs and attorney fees in connection with the negligence claim, with leave to amend. The motion is otherwise denied.

**Key Points:**

* The demurrer is sustained as to the eleventh cause of action for FEHA housing discrimination because the complaint does not allege facts that are legally sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
* The motion to strike is granted as to the prayer for punitive damages in connection with the breach of contract claim because punitive damages are not available for contract claims.
* The motion to strike is granted as to the prayer for investigative costs and attorney fees in connection with the negligence claim because the plaintiff has not alleged any agreement or statute that would entitle him to attorney fees on this claim.
* The motion is otherwise denied, and the plaintiff is given leave to amend the complaint to cure any defects.
