 Case Number:  24STCV06089    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  61 HUGO MARTINEZ, AN INDIVIDUAL vs FITNESS INTERNATIONAL, LLC., A BUSINESS ENTITYTENTATIVEThe present motions pertain to attorney Raymond Ghermezian, counsel for Plaintiff Hugo Martinez. The declaration that Ghermezian provides with the motion states there have been irreconcilable differences of opinion between Plaintiff and counsel, leading to a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Ghermezian states “certain significant issues surfaced related to the prosecution of this case, which to date remain unresolved.” (Ghermezian Decl. at p. 1.) The motion includes a proof of service and a proposed order, albeit without listing the four motions to compel set for hearing August 27, 2024, which were filed before the present motion. No trial date has been set. Insufficient time exists between the proposed withdrawal and the upcoming motions. Granting the motion would cause undue prejudice to the client. Thus, Raymond Ghermezian Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Hugo Martinez is CONTINUED to August 27, 2024.Attorney Ghermezian to give notice to parties and client within three days of this Order, and file Notice of Ruling with the court.
