Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The present motion pertains to attorney Raymond Ghermezian's request to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiff Hugo Martinez. The declaration submitted by Ghermezian states that there have been irreconcilable differences of opinion between the Plaintiff and counsel, leading to a breakdown of their attorney-client relationship. Ghermezian claims that significant issues remain unresolved regarding the prosecution of the case.

The Judge finds that granting the motion would cause undue prejudice to the client, given the insufficient time between the proposed withdrawal and the upcoming motions to compel, set for hearing on August 27, 2024. Therefore, the Judge CONTINUES the motion to August 27, 2024. Attorney Ghermezian is directed to give notice to parties and client within three days of this Order and file a Notice of Ruling with the court.
