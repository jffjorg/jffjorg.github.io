And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the demurrers filed by cross-defendant Jacob David Smith to the second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action alleged by cross-complainant Chancie Elizabeth Ann Meehan. The judge has ruled that Smith's demurrers to the second and third causes of action (trespass and equitable easement) are overruled, but has sustained Smith's demurrers to the fourth and fifth causes of action (prescriptive easement and adverse possession) with 20 days' leave to amend. The judge has determined that Meehan has alleged sufficient facts to support her claims for trespass and equitable easement, but that she has not alleged sufficient facts to support her claims for prescriptive easement and adverse possession.
