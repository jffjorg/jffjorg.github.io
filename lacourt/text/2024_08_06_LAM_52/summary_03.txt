The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Charlotte Duh (plaintiff) versus Angie Chou (defendant). The case involves a default judgment, where the clerk entered a default on April 24, 2024, for Angie Chou's failure to respond to the complaint. However, Charlotte Duh has not filed a request for default judgment within the 45-day time frame allowed by California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h).
