 Case Number:  23STCV27751    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment
Plaintiff Charlotte Duh filed a complaint against
defendant Angie Chou.  The clerk entered
Chou’s default on April 24, 2024.  Plaintiff
has not filed a request for court judgment by default.  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h) provides, “When a default is entered, the party who requested the
entry of default must obtain a default judgment against the defaulting party
within 45 days after the default was entered, unless the court has granted an
extension of time.  The court may issue
an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if that party fails
to obtain entry of judgment against a defaulting party or to request an
extension of time to apply for a default judgment within that time.”
            The
clerk entered defendant’s default more than 45 days ago.  The court will set an order to show cause re:
why plaintiff should not pay $100 in
sanctions under rule 3.110(h). 
            The order to show cause re: default
judgment is hereby continued to October
3, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The court hereby sets an order to show cause re: why
plaintiff should not pay $100 in
