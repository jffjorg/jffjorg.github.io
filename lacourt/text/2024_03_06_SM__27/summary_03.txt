And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's Motion to Enforce Settlement. The case involves a car accident that occurred on July 28, 2022, and a Settlement Agreement was executed between the Defendants and Plaintiff Daniel Munoz on June 9, 2023. However, the Agreement is signed only by the Plaintiff, and the Defendants' signatures are missing. The Court found that the Settlement Agreement is not enforceable under CCP ยง 664.6 because it is not signed by all parties to the agreement. The Judge cited several legal precedents, including Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002), to support the ruling. The Plaintiff's counsel is required to file the required minors' compromise on behalf of the Plaintiff, and the Defendant's Motion to Enforce Settlement is denied.
