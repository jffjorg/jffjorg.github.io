```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date from March 7, 2024, to September 9, 2024. The plaintiff argues that the new counsel requires additional time to prepare for trial and that the ongoing nature of the plaintiff's condition necessitates further examination to fully evaluate the damages. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has had over two and a half years to conduct discovery and that the motion comes just weeks before the trial date, which prejudices the defendant. The court also finds that the plaintiff's argument for the necessity of further examination of the plaintiff's condition is unpersuasive. Instead, the court grants the parties an additional 30 days to prepare for trial and continues the trial date to April 8, 2024, with the FSC rescheduled to March 27, 2024.
