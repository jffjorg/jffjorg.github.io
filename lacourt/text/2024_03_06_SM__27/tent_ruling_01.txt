PETITION TO APPROVE
  COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR 


Evelyn Steinberg, age
  3




RULING: 


GRANTED



  
TENTATIVE  
  
The
Court waives the requirement for personal appearance by Claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel is permitted to participate via telephone or video
conference.
Upon
consideration of the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action
concerning Evelyn Steinberg, a minor aged 3, the Court grants the application
for the reasons outlined below: On November 11, 2024, a minute order was issued
regarding Plaintiff’s Petition to Confirm Minor's Compromise but denied the
request for several reasons: 1. The settlement terms listed in Item 10 were
incomplete. 2. Attachment 11b(3) failed to adequately describe the
circumstances and impact of Petitioner’s claim and its resolution on the
proposed compromise detailed in the current petition. 3. The absence of a
written fee agreement, required as Attachment 17a. 4. The discrepancy in the
amount stated at Item 15, which should be $4,746.66 instead of $5,625.
The
present petition addressed and rectified these issues. After reviewing the
Petitioner’s Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise, the Court deems the
settlement to be reasonable and, accordingly, approves and GRANTS the petition.
THE COURT SETS AN OSC RE PROOF OF DEPOSIT RECEIPT for Evelyn
Steinberg PUT on June 6, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 27. No appearance is
required if the deposit receipt is filed prior to the hearing.
