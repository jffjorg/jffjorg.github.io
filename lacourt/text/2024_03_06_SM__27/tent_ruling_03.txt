Background
 
This
case involves a car accident filed on July 28, 2022, where plaintiffs Vanessa
Munoz, Guillermina Vazquez Munoz, and minors Daniel Munoz and Damian Munoz,
represented by their Guardian Ad Litem Vanessa Munoz, filed against Defendants
Javier Meraz, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc.
On June 9, 2023, a Settlement Agreement was executed between Defendants and
Plaintiff Daniel Munoz, a minor, through his Guardian ad Litem Vanessa Munoz,
as detailed in Exhibit A of the Declaration of Todd G. Lezon ("Lezon
Decl.") ¶ 2. Despite having a fully executed settlement agreement,
Plaintiff's counsel has not filed the required minors' compromise as stipulated
in the AGREEMENT. Consequently, Defendant now moves the court to enforce the
settlement and requests the Court to order Plaintiff's counsel to file the
necessary minors' compromise on behalf of Plaintiff.
 
Motion to Enforce Settlement
 
CCP § 664.6 states: “If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence
of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part
thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of
the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement.” 
 
Strict compliance with the statutory requirements
is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement agreement under this
statute.  (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman
Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)  To enforce a
written settlement agreement under CCP section 664.6, the following three
elements must be met: (1) the parties must have come to a meeting of the minds
on all material points; (2) there must be a writing that contains the material
terms of the agreement; and (3) the writing must be signed by the parties. 
(Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793,
797-98.) 
 
CCP § 664.6 “require[s] the signatures of the
parties seeking to enforce the agreement under [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 664.6 and against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced.”  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) 
CCP § 664.6’s “requirement of a ‘writing signed by the parties’ must be read to
apply to all parties bringing the section 664.6 motion and against whom the
motion is directed.”  (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 299, 306; see Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman
Const., Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 35-37 [“A written settlement
agreement is not enforceable under section 664.6 unless it is signed by all of
the parties to the agreement, not merely the parties against whom the agreement
is sought to be enforced.”].)  “A procedure in which a settlement is
evidenced by one writing signed by both sides minimizes the possibility of …
dispute[s] and legitimizes the summary nature of the section 664.6
procedure.”  (Robertson v. Chen (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1290,
1293.)   
 
Analysis
and Conclusion
 
The
Court examined the settlement agreement in question. It is signed only by
Plaintiff. Defendants’ signatures are missing. “A written settlement agreement
is not enforceable under section 664.6 unless it is signed by all of the
parties to the agreement, not merely the parties against whom the agreement is
sought to be enforced.” (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman
Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37 (Sully-Miller).) Thus, the
present motion is DENIED.
