And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has scheduled a hearing for October 24, 2024, to consider the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Robert Ackermann on behalf of six plaintiffs. The motion will be continued unless the defendant waives notice. The judge notes that the moving counsel has complied with the procedural requirements to be relieved as counsel, but the proofs of service do not indicate whether the forms were served on the opposing parties. The judge also notes that there may be some prejudice to the clients where the moving counsel seeks to withdraw four months prior to the trial date, but concludes that the prejudice is minimal. The judge directs the moving party to file proof of service of the moving papers upon the defendants at least five days prior to the next hearing.
