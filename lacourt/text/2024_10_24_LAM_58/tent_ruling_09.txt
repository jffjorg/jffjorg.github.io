 
Background
            
On March 1,
2022, Plaintiff Nydia McFadden (“Plaintiff”) initiated a consumer arbitration with
Defendant Public Storage, a Maryland association and Does 1–10 (“Defendant”) before
Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), pursuant to the
arbitration clause contained in Plaintiff’s August 2021 rental agreement (“Agreement”)
with Defendant. Plaintiff’s case arises from the
alleged theft of Plaintiff’s property from a storage unit at the Public Storage
facility located at 5548 Arrow Highway in Montclair, California. Plaintiff paid the $250.00 fee to initiate the
arbitration proceedings and all other fees were to be borne by Defendant to
maintain the arbitration.
 
On August
24, 2023, JAMS issued a Notice of Hearing to counsel for all parties and an
invoice in the amount of $27,000 for a hearing deposit required by Judge White
to proceed with the arbitration.
 
On October
4, 2023, after thirty days elapsed without Defendant paying the hearing
deposit, Plaintiff’s counsel filed her Notice of Withdrawal From Arbitration by
Claimant with JAMS, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 1281.97.
 
On May 16,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant Public Storage, a Maryland
association and Does 1–10 (“Defendant”) alleging three causes of action for:
(1) Fraud, (2) Breach of Contract and (3) Negligence related to the storage
unit break-in and resulting property damage.
 
On June 5,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs related to
the failed consumer arbitration proceedings. On July 15, 2024, Defendant filed
an opposition, and on September 30, 2024 it filed another opposition. On
October 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
On August
28, 2024, the Court issued a ruling finding that this Court has jurisdiction
over the issue of whether Plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure, section 1281.98 and that Plaintiff is entitled to such
fees. Further, the Court held the hourly rates charged by Plaintiff’s counsel were
reasonable but continued the hearing on the motion for attorney fees as to the
amount of fees, instructing Plaintiff to submit a supplemental declaration that
includes unredacted billing records for the Court to assess the reasonableness
of the amount of time spent. On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel of
record filed supplemental declarations showing unredacted billing records. On
September 30, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
            Here, it appears that Public Storage failed to pay the fees
for initiating the arbitration rather than fees imposed during the pendency of
the arbitration. Therefore the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97
rather than section 1281.98 apply. For present purposes, however, the attorney
fees provisions are basically the same because they both require sanctions
under section 1281.99.
 
“In an employment
or consumer arbitration that requires, either expressly or through application
of state or federal law or the rules of the arbitration provider, the drafting
party to pay certain fees and costs before the arbitration can proceed, if the
fees or costs to initiate an arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days
after the due date the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration
agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel
arbitration under Section 1281.2..” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.97(a).) 
“If the drafting party materially breaches the arbitration agreement and
is in default under subdivision (a), the employee or consumer may do either of
the following: (1) [w]ithdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in a court
of appropriate jurisdiction….” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 1281.97(b)(1).)  “If the employee or consumer proceeds with an action in a
court of appropriate jurisdiction, the court shall impose sanctions on the
drafting party in accordance with Section 1281.99.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 1281.97(d).)
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1281.99, attorney’s fees resulting from the material
breach are mandated: “The court shall impose a monetary sanction against a
drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration agreement pursuant to
subdivision (a) of Section 1281.97 … by ordering the drafting party to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the
employee or consumer as a result of the material breach.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.99(a).)  Other types of sanctions are also available,
in addition to monetary sanctions.  (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 1281.99(b).)
 
As the
Court of Appeal noted in Gallo v. Wood Ranch USA, Inc. (2022) 81
Cal.App.5th 621, the Legislature sought to curtail and penalize the
delay caused by businesses that impose arbitration in their contracts, but fail
to pay the fees to begin the process. “In enacting section 1281.97 and 1281.99,
the California Legislature was aiming to solve a very specific problem –
namely, the ‘procedural limbo and delay’ that consumers and employees face when
they are ‘forced to submit to mandatory arbitration to resolve a[]…dispute,’
and the business or company that pushed the case into an arbitral forum then ‘stalls
or obstructs the arbitration proceeding by refusing to pay the required fees.’
[citation to legislative history].” (Id. at p. 634.)
 
Because
the Legislature has fashioned in section 1281.99 a “sanction” as one method of encouraging
prompt initiation of the arbitration process, the Court concludes that the amount
of the sanction should be appropriate to deter the conduct being addressed. (See
Musaelian v. Adams (2009) 45 Cal.4th 512, 519 [sanction
should be “sufficient to deter repetition of [the sanctionable] conduct”
(discussion Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7)].) The Court considers attorney’s fees
incurred as a result of the material breach to encompass all fees for legal
services rendered for initiation and preparation for the arbitration that the consumer,
relying on the initiation of arbitration, reasonably undertakes, including
communication with the client, witnesses, opposing party, and arbitrator, reviewing
rules and agreements, conducting research, discovery and preparation of motions,
arguments, and testimony. If such expenses are not compensated, individuals may
squander considerable resources needlessly, while the party that drafted the
arbitration provision “stalls or obstructs the arbitration proceeding.” (Gallo,
supra, at p. 634.) There is no undue hardship on the business that fails to
pay required fees.  The statute gives
clear and generous deadlines for doing so. The business can avoid the sanction
by following the rules of the arbitral forum that it chooses.
 
Reasonableness of
Time Spent
 
The Court begins this inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the
“lodestar figure may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement]
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.)
Relevant multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) No specific findings reflecting the
court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are required; the record need only
show that the attorney’s fees were awarded according to the “lodestar” or
“touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d
1344, 1349.) The Court has broad discretion to determine the amount of a
reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned absent a
“manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of
Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-94.) A
negative modifier is appropriate¿when duplicative work is performed. (Thayer
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)
 
A verified fee bill is “prima facie evidence the costs,
expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred, and when they are
properly challenged the burden of proof shifts to the party claiming them as
costs.” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence.¿ (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins.
Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿ General arguments that
fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.¿ (Ibid.)
 
Discussion

 
In its August 28, 2024 Order, the Court ruled
that the claimed hourly rates by Plaintiff’s counsel are reasonable. Accordingly,
the Court limits its analysis to whether, in light of Plaintiff’s supplementary
declarations, the amount of time spent by Plaintiff’s counsel is reasonable.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel argues the amount of time
billed for this consumer arbitration is reasonable, as supported by the
unredacted billing records for the time incurred to litigate this matter in
arbitration. (Coate Decl., Exh. 2; Plotkin Decl., Exh. 3.) These billing
records include time spent by both attorneys Coate and Plotkin, totalling 136
hours and $71,400 in attorneys’ fees. (Coate Decl., Exh. 2; Plotkin Decl., Exh.
3.) Plaintiff’s counsel removed 2.5 hours of billed time, which remained
redacted, reducing the total requested fee award by this amount. (Coate Decl. ¶
6; Plotkin Decl., ¶ 4.) Defendant argues in opposition that this case involved
very limited discovery, including no written discovery and two depositions per
side that had not yet taken place prior to Plaintiff bringing her action in
court, and specifies the duplicative work by Plaintiff’s attorneys in
litigating this matter in court. (Opp. 4:10–7:18.)
 
The Court reviewed every entry in the bills submitted by Plaintiff’s
counsel.  The Court finds that nearly all
of them reflect legal services associated with the arbitration proceeding.  The Court deducts a total of 0.6 hours from
the bill of Mr. Plotkin for May 26, 2022 and June 1, 2022. These entries deal
with mediation; it is not evident to the Court that these expenses were
incurred as a result of the material breach. 
 
The Court concludes that the following hours incurred by Plaintiff’s
counsel were reasonable and necessary:
 
Mr. Plotkin:                71
hours    x    $525    =          $37,275
Mr. Coate:                   64.4
hours x    $525    =          $33,810
 
Total Attorneys’ fees                                                   $71,085
 
Arbitration Costs                                                            $ 250
 
Total fees and costs                                                   $71,335
            
Conclusion
 
            For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Nydia McFadden’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is granted in the amount of $71,335.   Defendant Public Storage shall pay to Plaintiff’s
counsel this sum on or before November 25, 2024.
