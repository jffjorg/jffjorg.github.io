And here's a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant Johnny Gill's motion to quash service of summons. The Plaintiff, Dwell California Real Estate & Investment, Inc., filed a proof of service indicating that the Defendant was served with a summons and complaint on September 10, 2024. However, the Defendant disputes this and provides video footage and declarations that show that the service was improper. The Judge finds that the Defendant has rebutted the presumption of proper personal service and that the Plaintiff has failed to establish, by a preponderance of evidence, the facts necessary for the Court to assert jurisdiction over the Defendant. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's proof of service does not comply with the Code of Civil Procedure, section 415.20, which requires a showing of reasonable diligence to personally serve the Defendant and subsequent mailing of the summons and complaint to the Defendant's dwelling place or usual place of abode to establish jurisdiction through substituted service. Therefore, the Court grants the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons.
