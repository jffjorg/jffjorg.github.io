Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion filed by Jennifer Rozdzielski, counsel for defendant Jacob Deutsch, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed. The Court notes that Counsel has not received communication from the client since prior to a case management conference and the client has refused to comply with requests for necessary documents. The Court finds that the motion complies with the Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4), which allows a lawyer to withdraw from representation when the client's actions make it unreasonably difficult to carry out the representation effectively. The Court continues the hearing to January 28, 2025 to enable Counsel to serve the moving papers and file proof of service.
