OPPOSING PARTY


Plaintiff
  Sally Maslon



 
BACKGROUND
 
On November 11, 2022, Plaintiff Sally Maslon (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants Hans Overturf (“Overturf”) and Sisu Holding Company,
Inc. (“Sisu”) for (1) breach of fiduciary duty (2) financial elder abuse, (3)
undue influence, (4) breach of oral contract, and (5) negligence. 
 
Overturf was allegedly Plaintiff’s financial planner, money manager,
option trader, crypto currency trader, and a stock, equity, commodity, and
securities investor. (Complaint ¶ 2.) Plaintiff claims Overturf mismanaged her
money, causing her to lose approximately $252,000. (Id. at ¶¶ 5-13.) 
 
On May 9, 2023, the Court entered default against Overturf. On June
26, 2023, Overturf filed a motion to set aside the default on the grounds that
he has not resided at the Eureka, California service address since 2015, when
he moved to Switzerland. On July 24, 2023, the Court denied Overturf’s motion
to set aside the default on the grounds that Overturf’s declaration lacked
credibility in light of the contrary evidence Plaintiff provided demonstrating
that Overturf resided at the Eureka address at the time of service. 
 
Thereafter, the Court entered default judgment against Overturf on
January 23, 2024, and issued a writ of execution on the same date.  Overturf moved again to set aside the default
and the default judgment, which the Court denied on June 5, 2024.  
 
Overturf subsequently moved to stay enforcement of the judgment
pending appeal, which the Court denied on August 22, 2024.
 
Overturf appealed the judgment, which the appellate court dismissed
due to default on September 5, 2024.  Overturf
now moves this Court for an order reinstating his appeal.  Plaintiff opposes the motion and Overturf
replies.
 
ANALYSIS
 
            As Plaintiff points out in the
opposition, Overturf has not provided any authority granting this Court
jurisdiction or authority to reinstate Plaintiff’s appeal.  
 
            In reply, Overturf clarifies that he
improperly filed his motion in this Court, but has since filed it with the
Court of Appeal, and “no further action is required by this Court regarding the
Motion to Reinstate Appeal.”
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court denies Overturf’s motion to reinstate appeal, as
this Court lacks jurisdiction or authority to rule on it.  
 
The Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of the Court’s
ruling.
