MOTION
 
This case arises from a business dispute.  On October 5, 2022, Plaintiffs Marc Ching and
Modern V LLC (“Plaintiffs”) filed a verified complaint against Defendant and
Cross-Complainant Miriam Janousek (“Defendant”) alleging three causes of action
for (1) intentional misrepresentation, (2) negligence, and (3) breach of
fiduciary duty, stemming from allegations that Defendant, acting as Plaintiffs’
real estate agent, provided Plaintiffs with the incorrect address of a former
BurgerIM restaurant location where Plaintiffs sought to open their own
restaurant, causing Plaintiffs to unwittingly sign a five-year lease for a
location at which the Health Department had not approved a restaurant to
operate.
 
Defendant cross-complained against Cross-Defendants Marina Brokerage
Partners, Inc. dba Keller Williams Marina Del Rey (“KW”) and Rick Dergen
(“Dergen”) (together, “Cross-Defendants”), alleging four causes of action for
(1) indemnity; (2) breach of contract; (3) fraud; and (4) negligent
supervision, pertaining to their errors and omissions coverage clause in the written
agent contract between Defendant and KW. 

 
Defendant now moves to compel further responses and production from KW
as to Requests for Production of Documents, set 1 (“RPD”), numbers 5, 6, 13-15,
19, 20, 22-27, and 33-36 and from Dergen as to RPD numbers 5, 6, and 14-27
(“RPD”).  Both motions are unopposed.
 
PROCEDURAL
REQUIREMENTS
 
            Timeliness of Motions
 
            A notice of motion to compel further
responses must be given within 45 days of the service of the responses, or any
supplemental responses, or on or before any specific later date to which the
parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (c).)
Failure to file such a motion within this time period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel further responses to interrogatories or requests for
production of documents. (Ibid.)
 
            In support of the Motion, Defendant
has provided the Declaration of Thomasin K. Bernhardt, which indicates that Cross-Defendants
were each served with a copy of the RFP electronically and by mail on January
4, 2024.  (Ex. A to Bernhardt Decl.)  Cross-Defendants provided written responses
on February 27, 2024.  (Bernhardt Decl. ¶
4 and Ex. B.)  On April 5, Cross-Defendants’
prior counsel, Ari Markow, agreed in writing to extend Defendant’s motion to
compel deadline to May 15, 2024. 
(Bernhardt Decl. ¶ 5 and Ex. D.)  On
May 14, 2024, Markow extended Defendant’s deadline to May 29, 2024; on May 28
it was extended again to June 12; on June 12 it was extended again to July 12;
on July 11 it was extended to July 18; and on July 15 it was extended to August
22.  (Ex. F to Bernhardt Decl.)
 
            Defendant timely filed both motions
on August 22, 2024.
            
            Separate Statement
 
            California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 requires that any motion involving the content of
discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the
response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for why an order
compelling further responses is warranted.
 
            Defendant
has provided a separate statement with respect to the RPD as to KW and Dergen in
compliance with the Rules of Court.
 
ANALYSIS    
 
1.     RPD
 
“The purpose of the discovery rules is to enhance the truth-seeking
function of the litigation process and eliminate trial strategies that focus on
gamesmanship and surprise.  In other
words, the discovery process is designed to make a trial less a game of
blindman's bluff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts
disclosed to the fullest practicable extent.” 
(Juarez v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc.
(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 377, 389 [cleaned up].)  

 
            Where a party objects, or responds
inadequately, to discovery requests, a motion lies to compel further responses,
and that party has the burden to justify the objections or inadequate
responses. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)
[motion to compel further responses lies “[o]n receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection”].)  “A trial
court's determination of a motion to compel discovery is reviewed for abuse of
discretion.  However, when the facts
asserted in support of and in opposition to the motion are in conflict, the
trial court's factual findings will be upheld if they are supported by
substantial evidence.” (Costco Wholesale
Corp. v. Superior Court (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733 [cleaned up].) 
 
            With
respect to demands for inspection of documents or other items, the Discovery
Act provides as follows:
 
The party to whom a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling has been directed shall respond separately to
each item or category of item by any of the following:  (1) A statement that the party will comply
with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling by the
date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any related
activities.  (2) A representation that
the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling of a particular item or category of item.  (3) An objection to the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)  “A
representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search
and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand.
This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is because
the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been
lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.230.)

Dergen
served objections as to all of the above requests.  (See Defendant’s Separate Statement in
Support of the Dergen motion.)   
 
            In general, once Defendant has moved
to compel further responses, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the
objections.  Because Cross-Defendants
failed to oppose the motions, they have failed to satisfy that burden.
 
            Notwithstanding, some of the
requests to KW appear, on their face, to be in violation of third-party privacy
rights.  For example, RPD Nos. 13-14 and
27 apparently seek all supervisory and employment agreement records for Dominic
Trott, a third party whose connection to the litigation Defendant has not
explained.  Similarly, RPD No. 20
apparently seeks all of KW’s employment records for all brokers associated with
any Keller Williams entity.
 
            Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s
unopposed motions to compel further responses to the requested RPD.  However, to the extent Cross-Defendants
intend to withhold documents the disclosure of which would violate third party
privacy rights, Cross-Defendants shall provide a code-compliant privilege log.  Similarly, to the extent Cross-Defendants
intend to withhold documents as protected by the attorney-client privilege
and/or attorney work product doctrine, Cross-Defendants shall provide a
code-compliant privilege log.  
            
            To the extent
Defendant seeks to compel a further production, such a request is
premature, as the Court cannot discern whether and to what extent any such
documents exist to produce until Cross-Defendants have provided further,
code-compliant responses.
 
2.    
Monetary Sanctions
 
            A trial court may sanction a party
for engaging in the misuse of discovery, which includes: failure to respond or
submit to an authorized method of discovery; making an evasive response to
discovery; making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious
objection to discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without
substantial justification, a motion to compel or to limit discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)
 
In addition, Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (h)
provides: “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”
 
            Here, the Court finds that the RPD
is clearly relevant to the litigation, and that there is no substantial
justification for Cross-Defendants to have misused the discovery process by
serving objections to which they have not justified in asserting.  
 
            Accordingly, the Court grants in
part Defendant’s requests for monetary sanctions against KW and Dergen in the
amount of $1700.00, each.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the Court
grants Defendant’s motion to compel further responses to RPD, and orders Cross-Defendants
to serve further verified code-compliant responses to the RPD within 10 days of
notice of the Court’s orders.  The Court
denies as premature Defendant’s motion to the extent it seeks to compel a
further production.  
 
Further, the Court grants in part Defendant’s requests for monetary sanctions,
and orders Cross-Defendants KW and Dergen to pay Defendant sanctions in the
amount of $1700.00, each,  by and through
counsel for Defendant, within 10 days of notice of the Court’s orders.   
 
            Defendant shall provide notice of
the Court’s orders and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
