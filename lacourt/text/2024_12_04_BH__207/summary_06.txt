And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the subpoena issued by the plaintiff, Sam Karawia, is defective on its face and therefore cannot be enforced. The subpoena requires the respondent, Caitlin Hart, to attend a deposition in New York, which is more than 150 miles from her residence. The judge also found that the notary's statement does not indicate that the person serving the subpoena swore the truth of the statement under penalty of perjury, as required by California law.

The judge denied the petition to compel compliance with the subpoena and for sanctions, finding that the respondent was substantially justified in not responding to the subpoena. The court also found that the subpoena's procedural defects waived any objections that the respondent may have had to it.

The judge ordered that the petitioner provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
