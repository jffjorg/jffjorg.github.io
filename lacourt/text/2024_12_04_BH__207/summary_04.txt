And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the defendant's motion to reinstate his appeal. The defendant, Hans Overturf, had appealed a default judgment entered against him by the court, but the appeal was dismissed due to default. Overturf now seeks to reinstate his appeal, but the judge found that the court lacks jurisdiction or authority to grant this motion. The judge noted that Overturf had not provided any authority supporting his request to reinstate the appeal. The judge also pointed out that Overturf had previously stated that the motion to reinstate appeal would not be filed with this court, but rather with the Court of Appeal. Therefore, the judge denied the motion to reinstate the appeal.
