And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorneys' fees filed by the defendants, Morteza Farzadmehr and Shahla Farzadmehr Delijani, in a case involving a dispute over the location of a Ficus tree on the property line between the plaintiff, Noshin Khobian, and the defendants.

The Court finds that the defendants are generally entitled to attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.420, but reduces the fees by the entries identified by the Court. The Court does not find that the plaintiff's denials of the defendants' requests for admission were made in good faith based on the information available at the time they were made.

The Court also finds that the defendants may not recover fees incurred on certain activities, including researching/drafting the demurrer, efforts to withdraw as counsel, researching/preparing the defendants' cross-complaint, and certain "Zoom call" entries.

The Court sets a deadline for the defendants to file and serve a proposed order in conformance with the ruling, and for the plaintiff to file and serve any objections to the proposed order.
