     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant county of los angeles’
  demurrer to third amended complaint




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff Alma
Rosa Hernandez filed this action against Defendants County of Los Angeles
(erroneously sued as Los Angeles County High Desert Regional Health Center) and
SEIU Local 721. The complaint was labeled as one for discrimination and
violation of labor/union rights. However, the complaint contained no factual
allegations. Instead, the complaint merely attached prior complaints filed with
the Civil Rights Department and Labor Commissioner’s Office. On August 21,
2023, the Court sustained the County’s demurrer with leave to amend. 
Plaintiff filed her First Amended
Complaint on September 8, 2023. On November 15, 2023, the Court sustained the
County’s demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend, finding that the FAC
contained no facts beyond conclusory statements that Plaintiff was
discriminated against. On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Second Amended
Complaint. On February 9, 2024, the Court sustained the County’s demurrer to
the SAC with leave to amend, finding that Plaintiff failed to allege
administrative exhaustion and failed to include a prayer for relief.
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
operative Third Amended Complaint. On April 9, 2024, the County filed the
instant demurrer to the TAC. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.  
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff’s TAC alleges that the
California Constitution grants citizens due process and equal protection and
prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of a protected
characteristic. Plaintiff alleges that employees of public agencies in California
may file suit in state court for violation of their constitutional rights.
Plaintiff alleges that a discriminatory law or practice may be deemed
unconstitutional under the “strict scrutiny” standard. Plaintiff concludes her
complaint with the general statement that protections, rights, and remedies are
available under California law. 
            The TAC merely contains a summary of
law with no factual allegations demonstrating any legal violation or unlawful
discrimination. There are no allegations regarding any actions by Defendant or
any harm to Plaintiff. As the Court held previously, “Plaintiff cannot plead a
cause of action by merely citing different laws.” (Nov. 15, 2023 Order re
Demurrer 3:3-4.) Furthermore, the defect with the SAC was that it failed to
allege administrative exhaustion or include a prayer for relief. (Feb. 9, 2024
Order re Demurrer 3:16-4:3.) Plaintiff fails to address this defect in the TAC.
Plaintiff does not articulate how the complaint can be amended to properly
state a cause of action, and after four attempts, it is clear that Plaintiff is
unable to do so. Therefore, leave to amend is not warranted. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant County of Los Angeles’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
