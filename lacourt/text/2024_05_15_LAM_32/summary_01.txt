This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County High Desert Regional Health Center, to the plaintiff's third amended complaint. The plaintiff, Alma Rosa Hernandez, alleges discrimination and violation of labor/union rights. The complaint contains no factual allegations and merely attaches prior complaints filed with the Civil Rights Department and Labor Commissioner's Office. The Court has previously sustained the defendant's demurrers to the plaintiff's previous amended complaints, finding that the complaints lacked factual allegations and failed to allege administrative exhaustion and include a prayer for relief. In this tentative ruling, the Court sustains the defendant's demurrer to the third amended complaint without leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action. The Court concludes that the plaintiff is unable to plead a cause of action and is unable to articulate how the complaint can be amended to properly state a cause of action.
