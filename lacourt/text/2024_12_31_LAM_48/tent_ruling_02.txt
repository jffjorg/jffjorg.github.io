On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff Diana Lands Nathanson
filed a motion to compel Defendant Alexander Gervasi aka Sacha Gervasi’s
responses to Request for Production, Set Three. On September
17, 2024, Plaintiff Diana Lands Nathanson filed a motion to compel Defendant
Alexander Gervasi aka Sacha Gervasi’s responses to Request for Inspection. 
Meet
and Confer
Before
bringing a motion to compel further responses to any discovery request, the
moving party is required to make efforts to meet and confer in good faith and
must submit a declaration attesting to those efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2031.310(b)(2), 2030.300(b), 2033.290(b).) “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.) Plaintiff provides a meet and confer declaration for
both motions. (Yeghiayan Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. B.)
45-Day
Time Limit
Notice
of a motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of service
of the verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
parties have agreed in writing. (CCP §§ 2030.300(c), 2033.290(c).) If such notice
is not given, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (Id.)
Here,
on April 2, 2024, Gervasi served responses to the Requests for Production of
Documents and Requests for Inspection. (Yeghiayan Decl., ¶ 8-9, Exhs. B, D.) After
multiple extensions, the notices for the motions to compel were to be filed by September
13, 2024. (Yeghiayan Decl., ¶¶ 21.) However, Plaintiff filed the motions four
days late on September 17, 2024. 
When
there is a delay in service, “it is incumbent upon plaintiff to establish
reasonable or excusable delay in service.” (Hilliard v. Lobley¿(1989)
216 Cal.App.3d 638, 642.) Once plaintiff establishes excusable delay, courts
may consider other factors, such as any prejudice or insufferable harm to a
defendant from the delay in service. (Putnam v. Clague¿(1992) 3
Cal.App.4th 542, 549; Board of Supervisors v. Superior Court (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 830, 848-849.)  
Plaintiff’s
Counsel states that the delay in service and lack of personal service was due
to Counsel’s excusable neglect. (Reply, Yeghiayan Decl., ¶¶ 4-8.) However,
to prevent any prejudice to Defendant, Plaintiff’s Counsel served an amended
notice rescheduling the hearing to provide Defendant Gervasi with additional
time to submit any supplemental opposition. 
The
Court agrees and finds that Counsel’s mistake was reasonable or excusable,
given the hearing was rescheduled and Defendant failed to provide any evidence
showing how he was prejudiced. The Court also finds that Defendant was subject
to little to no prejudice from the four day delay.
Accordingly,
the Court considers the merits of Plaintiff’s motions. 
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents - Requests
Nos. 52-65
A
propounding party may move for an order compelling further responses to
interrogatories if the responding party produced an evasive or incomplete
answer or a meritless or overly general objection in response to an
interrogatory. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a).) A motion to compel further
responses to interrogatories lies where the party to whom the interrogatories
were directed gave responses deemed improper by the propounding party; e.g.,
objections, or evasive or incomplete answers. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300.)
The moving party must also include reasons why further answers should be
ordered: legal or factual arguments why the answers given were incomplete or
nonresponsive, or the objections invalid. (California Rules of Court, rule
3.1020(c).) “The statement of reasons is required to help the judge prepare for
the hearing. But this does not change the burden of persuasion at the hearing-i.e.,
the responding party still has the burden of justifying at the hearing each
objection raised to discovery.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Pro.
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2011) ¶ 8:1157, 8:1179.)
The
disputed requests are as follows: 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 52: All DOCUMENTS and/or COMMUNICATIONS RELATING TO the
LANDS IME, including but not limited to, the LANDS IME being emailed to third
parties.
REQUEST

FOR PRODUCTION NO. 65: All direct messages exchanged through any software
application, including but not limited to, text messages, WhatsApp messages,
iMessages, social media messaging, or any other messaging service, RELATING TO
LANDS.
Plaintiff
argues that (1) the discovery at issue relates directly to Lands’ contentions
in the Complaint in this action; (2) Gervasi’s responses to
the RFP, Set Three are inadequate, incomplete, and evasive; and (3) Gervasi
has without substantial justification refused to produce certain documents,
asserted meritless objections and withheld production of documents in response
to the RFP, Set Three; and (4) good cause exists for the production of the
documents demanded. (Not. of Mot. at p. 1.)
In
opposition, Defendant argues that the requests are overbroad in both time and
scope under the Court’s November 2023 Ruling. Specifically, Requests Nos. 53-65
seek Gervasi’s communications with various third parties about Plaintiff
without limitation. (Opp. at p. 8.) Defendant further argues that Plaintiff’s RFP
No. 52 fails to seek relevant information discoverable at this time. 
As
to Requests Nos. 53-65, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s requests are grossly
overbroad because they are not restricted to a certain time period. The Court is
inclined to grant the requests with a limitation of time and scope surrounding
the alleged sexual assaults to a year before and a year after the alleged
sexual assaults. For instance, Plaintiff showed good cause in the requests
because she notes that any messages Defendant sent to third parties prior to
any of the assaults stating that he was going to commit such acts, that
information would go to Defendant’s mental state in committing the assaults.
Thus, the Requests Nos. 53-65 are GRANTED IN PART. 
As
to Request No. 52, Defendant unilaterally limited the response to Request No.
52 when he stated that “Responding Party has conducted a reasonably diligent
search for communications emailing the Lands IME to third parties after the
date that Lands requested it be treated as Highly Confidential under the
Protective Order in this matter. Responding Party located no responsive
documents and he reasonably believes that no such responsive documents ever
existed.” (emphasis added.) (Response to Sep. Statement at p. 2.) Defendant
failed to cite to any legal authority showing that agreeing to a Protective
Order would limit discovery to only communications after the date the parties entered
into the Protective Order. Thus, the Court also GRANTS the motion as to Request
No. 52.
The
motion is GRANTED IN PART.  Within 30
days, Defendant is ordered to provide further responses to Requests Nos. 52-65.
However, as to Requests Nos. 53-65, the requests are limited to a year before
and a year after the alleged sexual assaults. 
 
Requests
for Inspection (RFI) Nos. 1 & 2
A
party may demand to inspect, copy, test, or sample electronically stored information
in the possession, custody, or control of the party on whom demand is made.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010, subd. (d).)  Upon receipt of a response, the demanding party
may move to compel a further response if a statement of compliance with the demand
is incomplete; a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive; or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  The demanding party must set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) 
RFI
No. 1. seeks to inspect Defendant Gervasi’s devices for communications relating
to Lands from 2016 through present, and RFI, No.2 seeks to inspect Gervasi’s
devices for communications relating to the Complaint. Defendant Gervasi objected
on multiple grounds: including but not limited to, the attorney-client
privilege, relevancy, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and oppressive. However,
Plaintiff later agreed to limit the requests to one year before and one year
after the alleged sexual assaults. (Separate Statement at p. 3.) 
As
to any privilege objections, Defendant may file a privilege log and a
protective order has already been agreed to. Moreover, Defendant failed to
provide any evidence showing that the requests would be unduly burdensome
except for the broadness of the requests.
Thus,
the Court limits the scope of the inspections to one year before and one year
after the alleged sexual assaults. 
The
motion is GRANTED IN PART.  Within 60
days, Defendant must permit inspection of his devices (as defined by the
Request for Inspection) for messages relating to (1) Plaintiff’s allegations
that Defendant assaulted, falsely imprisoned, inappropriately touched, and/or
made sexual advances towards her on July 9, 2021, and January 3, 2022; and/or
(2) any damages Plaintiff claims that she suffered in this action as a result
of any conduct by Defendant.
Monetary
Sanctions
Code
of Civil Procedure Section 2031.320(b) provides, in pertinent part, that “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes . . .
a motion to compel compliance with a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Code of 2023.10(h)
further provides that it is a misuse of the discovery process to “ make[] . .
., unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel . .
. discovery.”
Plaintiff
Lands requests sanctions against Defendant Gervasi and his counsel in the
amount of $4,876.65 for each motion. (Yeghiayan Decl., ¶ 37.) Defendant Gervasi
requests sanctions in the amount of $4,770 be awarded against Plaintiff Lands
and her counsel for each motion. (Elsea Decl., ¶ 28.) However, the Court finds
sanctions are unwarranted because the motions were granted in part. Thus,
sanctions would be unjust. 
The
Court DENIES both parties’ requests for sanctions.  
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
