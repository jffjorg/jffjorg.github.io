On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff
Roula Oglii (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative first amended complaint against
Defendants Commerce Hyundai, Inc., Rajan Malhotra, Rakesh Malhotra, and Does 1
to 30 for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. 
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants have failed to pay Plaintiff monthly profits pursuant
to a Management Fee and Compensation Agreement. 
On
December 26, 2023, Defendant Commerce Hyundai, Inc. dba Commerce Mitsubishi
(“Defendant”) served Plaintiff with the first set of Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, Request for Production, and Request for Admissions.
(Mayville Jr. Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff failed to provide timely responses.
Defendant then provided multiple extensions. 
Plaintiff provided verified responses on May 15, 2024. (Id., ¶
14, Exh. E.) The parties attempted to meet and confer, during which Plaintiff
requested multiple extensions to provide further responses; the parties also
agreed to extend the deadline to file a motion to compel further to July 23,
2024. (Id., ¶¶ 17-19.) However, no discovery was served on July 23,
2024.
On
September 5, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel Steven J. Barkin (“Barkin”) filed a
notice of disbarment, indicating he was unable to act as attorney since July
24, 2024. However, it appears Defendant’s counsel and Barkin continued to agree
to extensions during this time. Defendant’s counsel asserts Barkin informed him
of his disbarment on August 1, 2024. (See Mayville Decl., ¶ 21.) The parties
then agreed on an extension to September 20, 2024. On September 10, 2024,
Defendant sent Plaintiff a letter requesting responses. (Id. ¶ 24, Exh.
J.) After hearing no responses, Defendant sent Plaintiff an email of the letter
on September 18, 2024. (Id., ¶ 26.) 
On
September 19, 2024, Plaintiff agreed to extend the motion deadline to October
4, 2024. (Mayville Decl., ¶ 27.) Plaintiff then agreed to multiple extensions,
with the last being due November 8, 2024. (Id., ¶ 31-37.) 
On
November 8, 2024, Defendant filed four separate motions to compel further
responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for
Production, and Request for Admissions. Each motion also includes a request for
sanctions.
Since
then, Plaintiff has not appeared with new counsel. Defendant asserts the
deadline to file the instant motions was continued to allow Plaintiff more time
to find counsel. Plaintiff has received notice of these motions via mail.
Nevertheless, no opposition has been filed. 

 
 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES
A
party may move to compel a further response to interrogatories if the demanding
party deems an answer to be evasive or incomplete, if an exercise of the option
to produce documents is unwarranted or inadequate, or if objection is without
merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
For
Form Rog. No. 1.1, Plaintiff provided no response. Plaintiff must respond. 
For
Form Rog. No. 2.11(b), Plaintiff responded to sub part (a), but not sub part
(b). Therefore, the response is incomplete. 
For
Form Rog. No. 9.2, Plaintiff provided no response. Therefore, it is incomplete.

For
Form Rog. No. 12.1, Plaintiff responded that “Investigation and discovery are continuing”
for each subpart. Plaintiff must state whether she lacks personal knowledge,
and that a reasonable and good faith effort has been made to obtain the
information. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (c).) 
For
Form Rog. Nos. 12.2, 12.6, 13.1, 14.2, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4. 50.5, and 50.6
Plaintiff provided no response. Therefore, they are incomplete. 
For
Form Rog. No. 15.1, Plaintiff did not respond to subparts (b) or (c).
Therefore, it is incomplete. 
Accordingly,
the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
numbers 1.1, 2.11, 9.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.6, 13.1, 14.2, 15.1, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3,
50.4, 50.5, and 50.6 is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide supplemental
responses, without objections, within 21 days. 

 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
            For Special Rog No. 9, Plaintiff did not state the value of
assets that constitute her financial net worth. Therefore, the response is
incomplete. 
            The
responses to Special Rog Nos. 13, 17, and 22 are incomplete since it fails to
provide any more detail. 
            There
is no response to Special Rog No. 20. 
            Accordingly, the motion to compel
further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 9, 13,17, 20,
and 22 are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide supplemental responses,
without objections, within 21 days.  
 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION
A
party may move to compel a further response to a demand for production of
documents if the demanding party deems that the statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete; the representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or an objection in the response is without
merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  The
motion must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(b)(1).) 
For
Request Nos. 1, 3 Plaintiff failed to provide the documents within 7 days,
contrary to her assertion in the response. Therefore, the motion is granted. 
For
Request No. 4, Plaintiff failed to timely respond to the discovery. Therefore,
objections are waived. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide supplemental responses,
without objections, within 21 days.  
 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS
A
party may move to compel a further response to requests for admission if the
demanding party deems an answer to be evasive or incomplete, if an exercise of
the option to produce documents is unwarranted or inadequate, or if objection
is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd.
(a).) 
Request
Nos. 5 and 7 fail to state that a reasonable inquiry has been made under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.220(c). Therefore, the motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff
is ordered to provide supplemental responses, without objections, within 21
days.  
SANCTIONS
Each
of the four motions includes a request for sanctions for $3,750 per motion,
representing a $260 hourly rate, plus the $60 filing fee per motion. Given the
quality of the motions, and lack of opposition, the Court finds that the amount
requested is excessive. 
Therefore, the Court awards
Defendant sanctions for all four motions in the total sum of $2,320 (two hours
of attorney time, plus the filing fee, for each motion) against Plaintiff.  Plaintiff is ordered to pay these sanctions
to counsel for Defendant within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  Parties intending
to appear are encouraged to appear remotely and should be prepared to comply with
Dept. 48’s new requirement that those attending court in person wear a surgical
or N95 or KN95 mask.
