And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons filed by 3M Purification, S. DE R.L. DE C.V. The plaintiff, Berokhiim, failed to effect proper service on the defendant, a Mexican entity, and the court finds that the service of summons was ineffective. The court notes that the plaintiff relied on a local subsidiary of the defendant, 3M Purification Inc. (3MPI), as the "general manager in this State" and argued that service on 3MPI's agent is sufficient. However, the court finds that there is no evidence that 3MPI has any relationship with the defendant, and therefore, service on 3MPI's agent would not result in notice to the defendant. The court grants the motion to quash service of summons and requires the plaintiff to re-serve the defendant with proper service of process.
