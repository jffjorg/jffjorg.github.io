And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc., moves to compel the defendant, Aram Construction Company, to provide initial responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff also requests sanctions against the defendant and its counsel, F. Michael Sabzevar, in the amount of $1,560.00 for the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred by the plaintiff.

The defendant failed to timely respond to the discovery requests, and the plaintiff served the discovery on June 13, 2024. In opposition, the defendant's counsel filed a declaration blaming himself for not responding to the Request for Admission, Set One, but did not address the requests for production of documents (RPDs) or form interrogatories (FROGs).

The court grants the motion to compel as to the RPDs, set one, and orders the defendant to provide responses within 10 days. The court also grants mandatory sanctions in the reduced total amount of $2,180.00 against the defendant and its counsel, to be paid to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days.
