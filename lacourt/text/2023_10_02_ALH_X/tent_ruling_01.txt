             This case arises out of Plaintiff Jamie Zhao’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that
Defendant A-May Investment, LLC (“Defendant”) failed to repay under a
promissory note. Plaintiff filed this complaint on January 31, 2022, alleging
that Defendant owed $663,786.22 in unpaid principal, $39,156.72 in unpaid late
fees, and accrued interest. Plaintiff alleges two causes of action for (1)
breach of contract and (2) common counts.

is ordered to provide responses without objections to Defendant’s requests for
the production of documents and form interrogatories within 10 days of the date
of this order.
 
            Defendant’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling a response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc. section
2030.290, subd. (b).) The same applies to a party that fails to respond to a
request for document production. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.300, subd. (b).)

Investment, LLC (“Defendant”) moves for an order compelling Plaintiff Jamie
Zhao to provide discovery responses to its requests for the production of
documents and form interrogatories. Defendant provides that it served its form
interrogatories on March 17, 2023. (Liang Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant provides it served its
requests for production on June 6, 2023. (Liang RFP Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant
provides the parties agreed to extend the deadline for Plaintiff to respond to
August 6, 2023. (Id. ¶ 3.) However, Defendant provides that Plaintiff
failed to timely respond and has not provided discovery responses as of the
filing of the present motions. (Id. ¶¶
4-5.)

demonstrated it served Plaintiff with discovery requests, but Plaintiff failed
to provide any response.
