RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendant demurrers to Plaintiff’s
second amended complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Gustavo V.
Garcia’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that he is the sole owner of property located at
8239 Bleeker Ave., Rosemead, California (“Subject Property”). Plaintiff alleges
his son, Defendant Gustavo Garcia Jr. (“Defendant”), is incorrectly claiming an
interest in the Subject Property. Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”)
on April 7, 2023, alleging four causes of action for (1) fraud, (2) quiet title,
and (3) accounting.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
             
            Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s first and second causes of action is OVERRULED..
 
            Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s third cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.
Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Additionally, a special
demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is uncertain,
ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code
Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford
Neighborhood Assn. v. City of San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180,
1191.) A demurrer based
on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the
pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            On
March 22, 2023, this court granted Defendant’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings on the grounds that Plaintiff’s claims were barred by the statute of
limitations and failed to state a claim. On April 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
SAC alleging three causes of action. 
 
            First
Cause of Action for Fraud
 
            Defendant
demurrers to Plaintiff’s first cause of action for fraud. 
 
“The elements of fraud, which give
rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false
representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or
‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Beckwith v. Dahl (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 1039, 1060, citations omitted.
 
“Fraud is required to be pleaded
with specificity.” (People ex rel. Harris v. Rizzo (2013) 214
Cal.App.4th 921, 947.) “Fraud allegations must be pled with more detail than
other causes of action. The facts constituting the fraud, including every
element of the cause of action, must be alleged factually and specifically. The
objectives are to give the defendant notice of definite charges which can be
intelligently met, and to permit the court to determine whether, on the facts pleaded,
there is any foundation, prima facie at least, for the charge of fraud.” (Apollo
Capital Fund, LLC v. Roth Capital Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226,
240, internal quotation marks omitted.)
 
            In
Plaintiff’s SAC, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant made various representations
that he would transfer the property to Plaintiff. (SAC ¶ 6.) Defendant specifically alleges that on
September 8, 2020, September 9, 2020, and August 29, 2020, Defendant stated his
intent to transfer the property to Plaintiff. (Ibid.) Plaintiff alleges
he justifiably relied on Defendant’s statements and paid various expenses
related to the property and refrained from suing Defendant. (Id. ¶ 8.)
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s representations were false, and Defendant
had no intent to fulfill his promises. 
 
“ ‘It is hornbook law that an
actionable misrepresentation must be made about past or existing facts;
statements regarding future events are merely deemed opinions.’ ” (Neu-Visions
Sports, Inc. v. Soren/McAdams/Bartells (2000) 86 Cal.App.4th 303, 309-310.)
“ ‘The only circumstances under which a future promise may form the basis
of a fraud claim is where the plaintiff can allege facts that the promisor
made a promise with no intent of performing.’ Indeed, the nature of promissory
fraud is that it is a promise of future performance
with no present intent to actually perform.” (Miles v. Deutsche Bank
National Trust Co. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402-403.) 
 
            As
alleged, Plaintiff only claims that Defendant made promises regarding future
events. However, in his SAC, Plaintiff adds additional details regarding the
specific representations that were made. Further, because Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant made promises regarding future events without the intent to perform
the promises, Plaintiff has alleged a cause of action for promissory fraud. 
 
            Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s first cause of action for fraud is overruled.
 
            Second
Cause of Action for Quiet Title
 
            Plaintiff
once again alleges a cause of action for quiet title regarding the subject
property. Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to state a claim.
 
            To state a claim for quiet title, Plaintiffs must allege
(1) a description of the property, (2) plaintiff’s title as to which a
determination is sought, (3) adverse claims to the title, (4) the date as of
which the determination is sought, and (5) a prayer for the determination of
the title. (Code Civ. Proc. § 761.020.) 
 
            Plaintiff
provides a description of the property. (SAC ¶ 17.) Plaintiff provides the
basis of his title to be fraud. (Id. ¶¶ 19-23.) Plaintiff alleges
adverse claims. (Id. ¶ 24-29.) Plaintiff also alleges the date of
determination sought and the prayer for the determination of title (Id. ¶
29.) Plaintiff’s claims are sufficient to allege a cause of action for quiet
title. 
 
            Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s second cause of action for quiet title is overruled.
 
            Third
Cause of Action for Accounting
 
            Defendant
demurrers to Plaintiff’s third cause of action for accounting. 
 
            “An action for an accounting has two
elements: (1) ‘that a relationship exists between the plaintiff and defendant
that requires an accounting” and (2) “that some balance is due the plaintiff
that can only be ascertained by an accounting.’ ” (Sass v. Cohen (2020)
10 Cal.5th 861, 869.) 
 
            Here Plaintiff has not alleged
either a relationship to create the basis for a cause of action for accounting or
outstanding balance. Plaintiff’s third cause of action for accounting fails to
state a claim. Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s third cause of action is
sustained without leave to amend. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s first and second causes of action is OVERRULED.  Defendant is ordered to file an ANSWER within
10 days.
 
            Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s third cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend.
