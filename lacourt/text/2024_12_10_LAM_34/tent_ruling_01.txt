1.              
Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFAs
 
Legal
Standard
 
            “On
receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the party requesting
admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party
deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
request is evasive or incomplete[;] (2) An objection to a particular request is
without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a)(1)–(2).)
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff moves to compel 555
Ocean to provide further responses to Requests for Admission No. 2 and No. 5 in
Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One. (Motion
to Compel Further Responses to RFAs, at p. 4.) Plaintiff argues
that 555 Ocean’s responses to RFAs Nos. 2 and 5 are evasive and incomplete. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff propounded the following RFAs on 555 Ocean: 
 
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 2
 
            Admit that 555 Ocean is the fee
owner of the real property described in Exhibit “C” to the Second Amended
Complaint (“555 Ocean Property”). 
 
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 5 
 
            Admit that a driveway ramp from
Linden Avenue to the Subterranean Parking Lot (“Driveway Ramp”) was constructed
on the Ocean Linden Property. 
 
            Plaintiff contends that 555 Ocean
responded to RFA No. 2 stating that: “555 admits that it owns certain of the
real property [sic] located at 555 E. Ocean Long Beach, California (“555 Ocean
Property”).” (Ibid.) Plaintiff argues that 555 Ocean’s response to RFA
No. 2 is evasive and incomplete as 555 Ocean does not want to admit that it
owns the 555 Ocean Property described in Plaintiff’s SAC. (Id., at p. 5.)
 
            Plaintiff also contends that 555
Ocean responded to RFA No. 5 stating that: “555 admits that there are two
driveway ramps at 555 Ocean, including one from Linden Avenue.” (Ibid.) Plaintiff
argues that 555 Ocean gave an evasive and incomplete answer to avoid admitting
that the driveway ramp from Linden Avenue to the subterranean parking lot under
555 Ocean’s midrise office project was constructed on the Ocean Linden property
as alleged in Plaintiff’s SAC. (Id., at p. 6.)
 
            In opposition, 555 Ocean argues that
Plaintiff failed to comply with the court’s order to schedule an Informal
Discovery Conference and failed to provide a separate statement as part of its
motion as required by California Rules of Court 3.1345. (Opp., at p. 2.) 555
Ocean also argues that it intends to supplement its response to RFA No. 5. (Id.,
at p. 3.) 555 Ocean contends that in regard to RFA No. 2, 555 Ocean agrees to
provide a declaration of its general partner’s CEO attaching the correct
description of the property. (Ibid.) As such, 555 Ocean argues that
these supplemental responses moots Plaintiff’s motion. (Ibid.)
 
            Plaintiff has not filed a reply to
555 Ocean’s opposition. 
 
            The court finds that Plaintiff’s
concerns regarding 555 Ocean’s responses to RFAs Nos. 2 and 5 have been
addressed by 555 Ocean’s supplemental responses. In its Reply, Plaintiff contends
that 555 Ocean’s supplemental responses are not code complaint. However, the
court disagrees. 
 
2.              
Motion to Compel Compliance and Production of
Documents
 
Legal
Standard
“The party to whom a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed shall
respond separately to each item or category of item by any of the following: 
“(1) A statement that the
party will comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing,
or sampling by the date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling
pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any
related activities. 
“(2) A representation
that the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling of a particular item or category of item. 
“(3) An objection to the
particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).) 
“If a party filing a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling under
Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails
to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that
party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling compliance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).) 
“Except as provided in
subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand, unless
it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (b).)
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff moves to compel
compliance with 555 Ocean’s agreement to produce documents and compel production
of documents in response to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.
(Motion to Compel Compliance and RPDs, at p. 4.) Plaintiff contends that on
June 30, 2024, Plaintiff served its RPDs on 555 Ocean. (Ibid.) 555 Ocean
then responded to the RPDs on August 2, 2024. (Ibid.) The parties met
and conferred regarding Plaintiff’s concerns with 555 Ocean’s responses to RFPs
Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 23, 24, 25, 26, 33, 34, 36, 38, and 39
believing that 555 Ocean has additional responsive documents. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff contends that Plaintiff has not received any additional documents
from 555 Ocean. (Ibid.) 
 
            In opposition, 555 Ocean argues that
Plaintiff failed to comply with the court’s order to schedule an Informal
Discovery Conference and failed to provide a separate statement as part of its
motion as required by California Rules of Court 3.1345. (Opp., at p. 2.) 555
Ocean also contends that it will produce any additional responsive documents to
Plaintiff’s RPDs Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 23, 24, 25, 26, 38, and 39 after
a reasonable and diligent search of its records prior to the date for the
hearing on this matter. (Id., at p. 3.) As such, 555 Ocean argues that
Plaintiff’s motion is moot as to those RPDs. (Ibid.)
 
            The court finds that Plaintiff’s
concerns regarding 555 Ocean’s responsive documents to RPDs Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8,
11, 13, 15, 23, 24, 25, 26, 38, and 39 have been addressed by 555 Ocean’s
supplemental search and responses. Plaintiff’s motion is moot as to RPDs Nos.
4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 23, 24, 25, 26, 38, and 39. The court will focus on the
remaining RPDs. 
 
            Plaintiff argues that RPDs Nos. 12,
14, 17, 33, 34, and 36 are relevant to one or more of its causes of action in
Plaintiff’s SAC. (Motion to Compel Compliance and RPDs, at p. 7.) Plaintiff
propounded the following RPDs on 555 Ocean: 
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 12: 
            All Documents concerning, referring
to or mentioning that Ocean Linden did or did not consent to the Assignment and
Assumption of Leases referred to in Paragraph 56 of the Second Amended
Complaint.
 
            As to RPD No. 12, Plaintiff argues
that 555 Ocean responded that it does not contend that Plaintiff expressly
consented to the assignment and assumption of leases. (Id., at p. 8.) During
the meet and confer process, Plaintiff clarified to 555 Ocean that Plaintiff’s
RPD requested all documents regarding whether Plaintiff expressly and impliedly
consented to said assignment. (Ibid.) Thus, Plaintiff argues that 555
Ocean must also produce any documents showing whether Plaintiff impliedly
consented, which 555 Ocean did not. (Ibid.) 
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 14:
            All Documents concerning, referring
to or mentioning that Ocean Linden did or did not consent to the $10,000,000
Deed of Trust.
 
            As to RPD No. 14, Plaintiff argues
that 555 Ocean responded that it does not contend that Plaintiff expressly
consented to the Deed of Trust. (Id., at p. 9.) Plaintiff contends that
555 Ocean should also produce any documents showing whether Plaintiff impliedly
consented. (Ibid.)
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 17: 
            All Documents concerning, referring
to or mentioning that Ocean Linden did or did not consent to the Assignment of
Rentals referred to in Paragraph 65 of the Second Amended Complaint.
 
            As to RPD No. 17, Plaintiff argues
that 555 Ocean responded that it does not contend that Plaintiff expressly
consented to the Assignment of Rentals. (Ibid.) Plaintiff contends that
555 Ocean should also produce any documents showing whether Plaintiff impliedly
consented. (Ibid.)
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 33:
            All Documents concerning, referring
to or mentioning change by 555 Ocean of the use of any or all of the space in
the 555 Building, including without limitation change of office space to residential
space.
 
            As to RPD No. 33, Plaintiff argues
that 555 Ocean responded stating that it did not have documents in response to
the RPD. (Id., at p. 10.) However, Plaintiff argues that it is unlikely
that 555 Ocean did not have any internal communications regarding the documents
requested. (Ibid.)
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 34:
            All Documents concerning, referring
to or mentioning the current dollar value of the 555 Property.
 
            As to RPD No. 34, Plaintiff argues
that 555 Ocean objected to RPD No. 34 on the grounds that it is irrelevant,
overly broad, unduly burdensome, and seeks confidential information. (Id.,
at p. 11.) However, Plaintiff argues that as 555 Ocean asserted a balancing of
the hardships defense to Plaintiff’s claims that 555 Ocean encroached onto
Plaintiff’s property, then a value of 555 Ocean’s property is necessary to
calculate the hardships. (Ibid.)
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 36: 
            All Documents concerning, referring
to or mentioning the current amount of the debt secured by the $10,000,000 Deed
of Trust.
 
            As to RPD No. 36, Plaintiff argues
that these documents are also necessary and relevant to calculate the hardship
555 Ocean would suffer if it removes or relocates the encroaching improvements.
(Ibid.)
 
            In opposition, 555 Ocean argues that
Plaintiff has not met its burden in showing good cause to justify the discovery
sought as Plaintiff has not properly addressed all of 555 Ocean’s objections to
its requests. (Opp., at pp. 3-4.) As to RPDs Nos. 12, 14, and 17, 555 Ocean
argues that Plaintiff’s requests are designed to prove a negative, that
Plaintiff did not consent, and as such 555 Ocean cannot be required to
reasonably and diligently search for the absence of documents. (Ibid.) As
to RPDs Nos. 33, 34, and 36, 555 Ocean argues that Plaintiff seeks all
documents “concerning, referring to, or mentioning” the change in use of the
space in 555 Ocean, the current value of 55 Ocean’s property, and the current
amount of debt secured by the Deed of Trust. (Ibid.) As such, 555 Ocean
contends that these request are overly broad and Plaintiff fails to show good
cause justifying their overly broad request. (Ibid.) 
 
            Plaintiff has not filed a reply to
555 Ocean’s opposition.
             The court agrees that further
responses here would be appropriate as to RPDs Nos. 12, 14, 17, 33, 34, and 36.
It appears that 555 Ocean can provide responses to the discovery requests but
has concerns regarding the scope of the RPDs. These RPDs appear relevant and reasonable
to request. However, in the interest of efficiency, the parties are ordered to
meet and confer regarding RPDs Nos. 12, 14, 17, 33, 34, and 36 in order to narrowly-tailor
the scope of the documents requested.
 
This
Motion will be continued.
 
3.              
Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted 
 
Legal
Standard
 
When a party fails to serve a timely response to
a request for admission, the party propounding the request for admission may
move for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.280, subd.
(b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response waives any objection,
including one based on privilege or work product. (Id., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to
whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section  2033.220. It is mandatory that
the court impose a monetary sanction… on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff moves to deem Request
for Admissions, Set Two, Nos. 26 through 60, admitted against 555 Ocean on the
grounds that 555 Ocean responses to RFA Nos. 26 to 60 are identical and state:
“555 does not have sufficient information to admit or deny this request because
555 has not yet conducted its own survey to verify the accuracy of plaintiff’s
survey.” (Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted, at pp. 5-6; Brunsten Decl., ¶ 8, Exh.
D.) Plaintiff argues that 555 Ocean’s responses do not comply with CCP §
2033.220(c). (Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted, at pp. 6.)
 
            In opposition, 555 Ocean argues that
Plaintiff failed to comply with the court’s order to schedule an Informal
Discovery Conference. (Opp., 2.) Additionally, 555 Ocean contends that its
forthcoming amended responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs will moot its motion. (Ibid.)
555 Ocean contends to supplement its responses to state that: “A reasonable inquiry
has been made and the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient
to enable 555 Ocean to admit the matter.” (Id., at p. 3; Avazian Decl., Exh.
1.) 555 Ocean argues that this supplemental response will comply with CCP §
2033.220(c). (Id., at p. 3.) 
 
            In reply, Plaintiff argues that if
the court determines that an Informal Discovery Conference should be conducted,
then Plaintiff contends that the IDC should take place immediately before the
hearing on the matter. (Reply, at p. 2.) Plaintiff also argues that 555 Oceans
supplemental responses do not moot Plaintiff’s motion since 555 Ocean had a
choice whether or not to obtain its own survey that would allow it to verify
the accuracy of Plaintiff’s survey allowing them to answer to Plaintiff’s RFAs.
(Id., at pp. 3-4.) As such, Plaintiff contends that 555 Ocean’s
responses are insufficient and the court should deem the RFAs admitted. 
 
            The court finds that 555 Ocean’s amended
responses to RFAs Nos. 26 through 60 are code-compliant according to C.C.P.
section 2033.220(c), which states: “If a responding party gives lack of
information or knowledge as a reason for a failure to admit all or part of a
request for admission, that party shall state in the answer that a reasonable
inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been made, and that
the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that
party to admit the matter.” (C.C.P. § 2033.220(c).) As such, Plaintiff’s motion
is denied.
