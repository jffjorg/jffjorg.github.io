On April 24, 2024, the court granted Curbio’s
Stipulation and Order for Leave to Amend Complaint. 
 
On May 20, 2024, Curbio filed its First Amended

Legal Standard
 
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subd. (a).) 
 
“Section
664.6 was enacted to provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a
settlement contract without the need for a new lawsuit.” (Weddington Prod.,
Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.) In deciding motions made
under Section 664.6, judges “must determine whether the parties entered into a
valid and binding settlement.” (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.) 
 
Discussion
 
            Curbio contends that on September 4, 2024, the parties
agreed to settle this case and entered into a Settlement Agreement providing
that O’Mally would pay Curbio the sum of $162,500.00, within three (3) days of
full execution of the Settlement Agreement. (Motion, at p. 3.) Curbio provides
a copy of the Settlement Agreement. (Id., Exh. A.) Curbio’s counsel declares
that O’Mally has not fulfilled its obligations under the Settlement Agreement and
has engaged in a campaign to avoid his obligations. (Williams Decl., ¶¶ 2, 5.) Curbio
also contends that O’Mally’s counsel has failed to respond to communications
from Curbio after O’Mally failed to make payment. (Motion, at p. 3.) Curbio also
argues that the Settlement Agreement allows for the recovery of attorney’s fees.
(Id., at p. 5.) 
 
            In opposition, O’Mally contends that at the time the
parties entered into the Settlement Agreement, O’Mally believed that he had
obtained a loan to pay the settlement in full. (Opp., at p. 3; O’Mally Decl., ¶
5.) However, the loan commitment was revoked as O’Mally could not timely
satisfy the requirements of the lender. (O’Mally Decl., ¶ 5.) O’Mally declares
that he currently has a loan commitment for sufficient funds to pay the
settlement amount. (Id., ¶ 6.) However, O’Mally requires time for the
loan documents to be drafted and for escrow to open. (Ibid.) As such,
O’Mally request a continuance on the hearing of this motion for thirty (30)
days, on or after January 13, 2025. (Id., ¶ 8.)
 
Based
on the foregoing, it appears that O’Mally will complete performance under the
Settlement Agreement by obtaining a loan for the settlement amount. The court
thus continues the hearing on this motion to January 15, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. The
parties are to file declarations on or before January 10, 2025, informing the
court whether O’Mally has obtained a loan to pay the settlement agreement
and/or has fulfilled its terms. If performance under the Settlement Agreement
has not been completed by that date, the court is inclined to grant the motion.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Curbio, Inc.’s Motion to Enforce Settlement is CONTINUED.
