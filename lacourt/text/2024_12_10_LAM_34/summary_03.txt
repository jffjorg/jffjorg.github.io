And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to strike the fifth cause of action for fraud in the inducement from the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff had included this cause of action in the caption of the complaint, but failed to plead it in the body of the complaint. The plaintiff later filed a Notice of Errata to correct the mistake, but the judge finds that this does not moot the motion. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to file an amended complaint that incorporates the changes listed in the Notice of Errata.
