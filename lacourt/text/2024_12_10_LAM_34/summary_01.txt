And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on three motions filed by Plaintiff Ocean Linden LLC. The first motion, to compel further responses to requests for admissions, is moot because 555 Ocean, L.P. has already provided supplemental responses that address the concerns raised by the Plaintiff. The second motion, to compel compliance with agreement to produce documents, is also moot as to certain requests for production, but the court grants the motion in part as to other requests. The third motion, to deem requests for admissions admitted, is denied because 555 Ocean, L.P.'s amended responses to the requests are code-compliant.

The court also orders the parties to meet and confer regarding certain requests for production to narrow the scope of the documents requested. The court emphasizes the importance of the parties following the court's orders and meeting and conferring to resolve disputes in a timely and efficient manner.
