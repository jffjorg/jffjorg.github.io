 
BACKGROUND
 
On December
13, 2023, Plaintiffs Ken O’Brien and Stacey O’Brien (“Plaintiffs”) filed a
complaint against Defendant Fundamental LA (“Defendant”) and Does 1-30. The
causes of action in the body of the complaint are: (1) declaratory relief; and
(2) recission. 
 
On or
about August 8, 2023, Plaintiffs began discussions with Defendant to provide
catering services for their daughter Blake’s wedding on November 25, 2023.
(Compl. ¶ 5.) Defendant claims that a contract was signed, but Plaintiffs argue
that the signature process did not comply with California’s electronic
signature laws. (Id. ¶ 6.) Specifically, Plaintiffs assert they never
approved the Terms and Conditions (T&C) nor were they made aware of them. (Id.)

 
Plaintiffs
believed they were agreeing to pay a flat $2,500 gratuity and were unaware of a
nearly $20,000 penalty detailed in the T&C. (Compl. ¶ 7.) They made an
$11,724.58 deposit but later learned the T&C required full payment if the
event was canceled within 90 days. (Id. ¶ 8.) Blake informed Defendant
of a reduced guest list on September 4, 2023, but Defendant insisted on full
payment despite incurring no costs for the event. (Id. ¶¶ 9-10.) 
 
Defendant
refused to negotiate and demanded the full contract amount of $19,991.94. (Compl.
¶ 10.) Plaintiffs contend that the monetary provisions of the T&C are
unenforceable penalties under California law, as they are not reasonably
related to actual damages. (Id. ¶¶ 10-13.) Therefore, the
plaintiffs seek the return of their deposit. (Id. ¶ 13.) 
 
Now, Defendant moves for judgment
on the pleadings as to Plaintiffs’ causes of action for declaratory relief and
recission.
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§86(a)(7), the Court on its own motion reclassifies this case as an Unlimited
Civil Case. 
 
 Plaintiffs are ordered to pay the
reclassification fees within twenty (20) days of this Court’s order.
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice and to attach a copy
of the Court's Tentative Ruling, as an exhibit “A” to said notice, as the final
order of the Court.
