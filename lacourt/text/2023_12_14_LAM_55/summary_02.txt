And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to reset the filing date of complaint. The motion is granted, and the Complaint is deemed filed on February 2, 2023. The Judge notes that the Clerk initially rejected the filing because the initial complaint was incorrectly captioned as an amended complaint, but this is a minor deficiency that was not prejudicial to any defendant. The Judge cites several California Appellate Cases to support the decision, stating that the Clerk has a ministerial duty to file documents in compliance with court rules, even if they contain defects. The Judge finds good cause to grant the motion and deems the Complaint filed on February 2, 2023.
