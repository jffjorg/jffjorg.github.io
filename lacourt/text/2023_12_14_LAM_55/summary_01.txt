And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is subject to change based on further argument and evidence. The ruling addresses the demurrer filed by the defendants, which challenges the plaintiff's claims.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges breach of lease. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of alter ego are sufficient to support the claim.

The judge has also overruled the demurrer to the second and third causes of action, which allege violations of Civil Code §3439 and fraudulent transfer in violation of Civil Code §3439.04(A)(2)(A). The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent intent and transfer are sufficient to support the claims.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which alleges an open book account. The judge found that the claim is a common count, which is not subject to demurrer.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, which alleges an account stated. The judge found that the claim is also a common count, which is not subject to demurrer.

Finally, the judge has overruled the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, which alleges unjust enrichment. The judge found that the claim is cognizable and that the defendants' argument that it is not is without merit.

The judge will consider further argument and evidence before making a final ruling in the case.
