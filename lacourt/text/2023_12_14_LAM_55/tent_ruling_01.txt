  Case Number:  23STCV04460    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Demurrer of Defendants to First Amended Complaint.
 
The demurrer is overruled.  Twenty days to answer. 
 
 
On 5/9/23, 1147 S. BEVERLY DRIVE ASSOCIATES, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against FUNNY BUSINESS, INC., and
MARTIN H. CALLNER (“Defendants”) alleging that the entity defendant failed to
pay all amounts due under a commercial lease of 1147 South Beverly Drive,
Second Floor, Los Angeles, and the individual defendant is an alter ego of the
entity lessor.
The causes of action are: 1)
For Breach of Lease; 2) Violation of Civil Code §3439; 3) Fraudulent Transfer in
Violation of Civil Code §3439.04(A)(2)(A); 4) Open Book Account; 5) Account
Stated; and 6) Unjust Enrichment.
 
Defendants demur to each claim of the First Amended
Complaint.  Plaintiff opposes the
demurrer. 
1) Breach of Lease.  
Defendants contend that the alter ego allegations are
not sufficiently alleged to support contract liability of the noncontracting
individual defendant, such that there is a misjoinder.  
To allege alter ego, plaintiffs must plead a unity of
interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the corporation
and individuals do not exist, and that an inequity will result if the corporate
entity is treated as the sole actor. Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co.
(1994) 25 Cal. App. 4th 1269, 1285. Plaintiffs can sufficiently allege (1) a
unity of interest, by alleging a corporation was inadequately capitalized,
failed to abide by corporate formalities, and was used by the defendant only as
a shell and conduit, and (2) an adherence to a separate corporation existence
that would promote injustice or lead to inequitable results, by alleging the
use of a corporation to avoid payment obligations.   A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best
Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 696-97.  “To recover on an alter ego theory, a
plaintiff need not use the words ‘alter ego,’ but must allege sufficient facts
to show a unity of interest and ownership, and an unjust result if the
corporation is treated as the sole actor.”  Leek v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal. App. 4th
399, 415 (noting a complete absence of such allegations).  Cf.  Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 235 (sufficiently alleged defendant dominated and
controlled, a unity of interest and ownership existed, a mere shell and
conduit, inadequately capitalized, failed to abide by formalities of corporate
existence, used assets as own, and recognizing separate existence would promote
injustice).  Other authorities excuse any
pleading requirements of alter ego.  As
to contract-based claims, the alter ego doctrine is sufficiently alleged by an
allegation that defendant made the contract involved.  Los Angeles Cemetery Assoc. v. Sup. Ct.
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 492, 494.  “The
alter ego issue is ordinarily raised by the pleadings…. Nonetheless, even when
not pleaded, that issue may be resolved at trial….”  Hennessey’s Tavern v. Am. Air Filter Co.
(1988) 204 Cal. App. 3d 1351, 1358.
"Demurrers on the ground of misjoinder lie only
when the defect appears on the face of the complaint or matters judicially
noticed..." and demurring parties are prejudiced.   Royal
Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Ranger Ins. Co. (2002) 100 Cal. App. 4th 193,
198.  
The Court concludes that the alter ego allegations in
the FAC are significantly more detailed than the typical complaint, and sufficiently
address the elements in accordance with case law (see, e.g., FAC, ¶¶ 4-9).  Contrary to Defendants’ contention, the FAC
adequately alleges that treating the entity defendant as separate from the
individual defendant would promote an injustice because it would allow the
entity defendant to avoid its financial obligations to Plaintiff. (Id., ¶
9(p).) Moreover, some authorities have held that alter ego requires no
allegations in support, as set forth above. The demurrer to the first cause of
action therefore is overruled.    
 
2) Violation of Civil
Code §3439; and 3) Fraudulent Transfer in Violation of Civil Code
§3439.04(A)(2)(A).
An action under Civil Code Section 3439.04 lies “for
the fraudulent transfer of the debtor’s property with the intent to ‘hinder,
delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor’ (Civ. Code, § 3439.04, subd. (a))….”
  Snapp & Assocs. Ins. Services,
Inc. v. Robertson (2002) 96 Cal. App. 4th 884, 891,  disapproved
on other grounds by  Aryeh v.
Canon Bus. Sols., Inc. (2013) 55 Cal. 4th 1185, 1196.
The elements of the claim are: 

Transfer made
     or obligation incurred by a debtor;
with actual
     intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of debtor;
without
     receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or
     obligation; 

debtor was engaged or was about to engage in a
      business or a transaction for which remaining assets were unreasonably
      small in relation to the business or transaction;  or
intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should
      have believed that debtor would incur, debts beyond ability to pay as
      they became due; and

injury to the
     creditor.

 
Civ. C. §§3439.04(a), 3439.05.  See
also Filip v. Bucurenciu (2005) 129 Cal. App. 4th 825, 834  ("There is no minimum number of factors
that must be present before the scales tip in favor of finding of actual intent
to defraud.");  Kirkeby v. Sup.
Ct. (2004) 33 Cal. 4th 642, 651 (fraudulent transfer was sufficiently
alleged based on defendant’s transfer of property with the intent to defraud,
hinder or delay creditors in collection); Annod Corp. v. Hamilton &
Samuels (2002) 100 Cal. App. 4th 1286, 1298 (proof of fraudulent intent in
conveyances often is inferenced from the surrounding circumstances).
 
Defendants claim the second and third causes of action
fail because instead of alleging causation, the FAC merely states that
Plaintiff “has been damaged…or will suffer damages” (FAC at p. 7, lines 17-19
and p. 8 lines 22-25). The Court rejects this argument. As to the Second and
Third Causes of Action, all the elements set forth above are alleged, with the
Second focusing upon fraudulent intent, and the Third emphasizing transfers for
no consideration with knowledge of inability to pay debts.  The final element of injury is alleged,
including by Defendants’ removal of the ability to pay the debt allegedly owed
under the subject lease. (FAC, ¶ 9.) The demurrer to these causes of action is
overruled.
4) Open Book Account.
The elements of a claim for open book account are: 

Detailed
     statement which constitutes the principal record of one or more
     transactions between a debtor and a creditor arising out of a contract or
     some fiduciary relation;
shows
     the debits and credits in connection therewith, and against whom and in
     favor of whom entries are made;
entered
     in the regular course of business as conducted by such creditor or
     fiduciary;
kept
     in a reasonably permanent form and manner; 
     and
in
     a bound book, on a sheet or sheets fastened in a book or to backing but
     detachable therefrom, on a card or cards of a permanent character, or is
     kept in any other reasonably permanent form and manner.

CCP §337a; Tsemetzin v. Coast Federal Savings &
Loan Assn. (1997) 57 Cal. App. 4th 1334, 1343.
Defendants correctly note that the subject complaint does
not allege the existence of a book and that the book kept a detailed statement
of debit/credits in the regular course of business, but instead alleged an
amount due. Although the FAC fails to allege a detailed, permanent account of
transactions, debits and credits, the claim is a common count as to which
demurrers do not lie where the underlying claims are well alleged, as here.  “[A] common count, by long continued practice
is not subject to attack by general demurrer or by a special demurrer for
uncertainty.”  Auckland v. Conlin
(1928) 203 Cal. 776, 778.  Accord 
Smith v. Bentson (1932) 127 Cal. App. Supp. 789, 791.  “When a common count is used as an
alternative way of seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause of
action, and is based on the same facts, the common count is demurrable if the
cause of action is demurrable."  Berryman
v. Merit Property Management, Inc. 
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1560. As discussed above, the breach of
contract claim survives demurrer and so the open book claim does as well. 
While Defendants assert that common counts are
unavailable where an express contract is a basis of the case, an express
contract does not necessarily bar a common count.  A common count is proper notwithstanding that
it relates to an original transaction involving an express or implied
contract.  Utility Audit Co. v. City
of L. A. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 950, 958. 
The demurrer is overruled with respect to the fourth cause of action.
5) Account Stated. 
The elements of a claim for account stated are: 

An account
     statement of indebtedness between the parties;
the balance or
     sum due;
the time of the
     statement;
the place of
     the statement;
the debt was found,
     or the debtor expressly or impliedly promised to pay the amount.

 
Truestone, Inc. v. Simi West Industrial Park II (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 715, 725.  
 
Defendants contend that the fifth cause of action for
account stated fails to allege that Defendant agreed the amount claimed by
Plaintiff was the correct amount owed, or that Defendant promised to pay the
same (see FAC p. 9 lines 20-26).  But like
the analysis above, regarding the claim for Open Book Account, this Cause of
Action for Account Stated fails to allege an agreed statement of indebtedness,
but a demurrer does not lie as to common counts, and the express lease is no
bar.
6) Unjust Enrichment.
Defendants assert that unjust enrichment is not a
cognizable cause of action  (dem.,
9:11-17). Plaintiff is correct that there is a split of authority on this issue
and the Second District of the Court of Appeal recognizes the claim.
Where there is a split of authority, trial courts have
discretion to choose between the decisions. 
Auto Equity Sales, Inc. 
v.  Sup.  Ct.  (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456.  Where there is a split of authority, “[a]s a
practical matter, a superior court ordinarily will follow an appellate opinion
emanating from its own district even though it is not bound to do so.”  McCallum v. McCallum  (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 308, 316 n.4.
Here, the Court exercises its discretion to follow the
line of authority supporting the cause of action.
 
Conclusion
The demurrer is overruled, as to each claim, as
analyzed above.
