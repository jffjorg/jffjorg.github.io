Discussion

 
Defendant has
issued twelve subpoenas to Plaintiff’s medical providers--Complete Balance
Chiropractic, Integrated Injury Specialists, Shin Imaging Center, Placentia
Surgery Center, HealthyU Clinics, and Aquila Medical Management
Services--requesting any and all Plaintiff’s medical records and bills without
limitation as to time or body parts at issue. 
 
Plaintiff
seeks an order modifying the subpoenas to the following:
 
Any and all medical records within the last 10 years from the date of
incident, May 27, 2023, for body parts related to his neck, chest, back
(especially lower back radiating to left buttock, right thigh – front, left
leg, bilateral foot and left toes), bilateral shoulders (especially right),
right arm, and cognitive injuries such as headaches and double vision. (Motion
pp. 5-6.) 
 
The party seeking the constitutionally protected information has the
burden of establishing that the information sought is directly relevant to the
claims. (Tylo v.
Superior Court (1997)
55 Cal. App. 4th 1379,1387.) Defendant argues the subpoenas are properly
tailored because Plaintiff indicates in discovery that he “Plaintiff reserves
the right to supplement or amend this response at a later date.” (Opp. p. 3,
citing form interrogatory 6.2.) The court is unpersuaded that such language
warrants discovery as to Plaintiff’s entire medical history. As noted in Reply,
should additional claimed body parts later be identified, Defendant can bring a
subsequent motion. 
 
To the extent
that Defendant relies upon Slagle v. Superior Court (1989) 211
Cal.App.3d 1309 to support his position that the subpoenas are reasonably
calculated, that case actually supports Plaintiff. For one, Slagle involved
Evidence Code section 999, an exception to the physician-patient privilege.
That aside, in Slagle, the plaintiff made clear on his motion to quash that he was not seeking to recover for
any injury to his eyes such that the patient-litigant exception body
part at issue was the plaintiff’s eye, as someone
had overheard the plaintiff tell the doctor on the day of the accident that he
was blind in both eyes six months prior to the accident. (Id. at p.
1312.) Notwithstanding the court’s holding, the court observed that if the
medical records will irrelevant information relevant to the condition of his
eyesight at the time of the accident, “he may request an in camera inspection
of the records to segregate the irrelevant information.” (Id. at
p. 1315, emphasis added.) This suggests that records are to be with limitation,
not without limitation. 
 
As for the
timeliness argument,
Defendant argues that motion is untimely by two days because the subpoenas in
question were issued on July 26, 2024, with a production date of August 26,
2024. A motion to quash is typically filed
before the time for production. (See, e.g., Code Civ.
Proc., § 1985.3, subd. (g)).) However, as noted in Reply, the court has authority
to consider the motion even if brought after the date for production. (See
Motion p. 6 citing Slagle, supra, 211 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1312-1313; see
also In re R.R. (2010) 187 Cal. App. 4th 1264, 1278; Mancinelli
v. Siewak (2009) No. D051591, 2009 WL 924274, at *4.) Moreover, as noted in
the motion and reply and otherwise unaddressed in opposition, Defendant has
e-served everything prior to the subpoenas (and the parties have an e-service
agreement), which provided Plaintiff with less time for Plaintiff to review the
subpoenas. Therefore, the court declines to deny the motion based on timeliness
grounds. 
 
As for
monetary sanctions,
C.C.P. § 1987.2 states that, “(a) [e]xcept as specified in subdivision (c), in
making an order pursuant to motion made under subdivision (c) of Section 1987
or under Section 1987.1, the court may in its discretion award the amount of
the reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion, including
reasonable attorney’s fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed
in bad faith or without substantial justification or that one or more of the
requirements of the subpoena was oppressive.” Though this court generally
refrains from imposing monetary sanctions, the fact that the subpoenas were so overbroad
suggest sanctions are appropriate. Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of
$2,000.00 against Defendants and their Counsel of record. Utilizing a Lodestar
approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the court finds the
hourly rate and hours expended on the matter reasonable.[1]
It is unclear whether the $2,000 includes the filing fees, but should Plaintiff
seek those costs, the court will award an addition $75.80. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is granted as well as monetary sanctions.
