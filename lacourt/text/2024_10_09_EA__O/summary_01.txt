And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Alfonso Rojas Villa, has filed a motion to quash twelve subpoenas issued by the defendant, Huihui Dong, seeking medical records and bills from various medical providers. The plaintiff seeks to modify the subpoenas to only request records related to his neck, chest, back, shoulders, arm, and cognitive injuries. The defendant argues that the subpoenas are properly tailored and that the motion is untimely. The court finds that the subpoenas are overbroad and that the motion is not untimely. The court grants the motion to quash and orders the defendant to modify the subpoenas. Additionally, the court awards monetary sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $2,000.00, which includes reasonable attorney's fees and expenses.
