And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Petitioner, Pauline Der Mesrobian Yacoubian, is granted relief from the claim presentation requirement of Government Code section 945.4. The Petitioner tripped and fell on an uneven dirt sidewalk, and submitted a claim with the City of Pasadena, which was rejected. She then discovered the incident was outside of Pasadena and within the County of Los Angeles, and submitted a claim to LA County, which was also rejected. The Petitioner's application to present a late claim was denied by LA County. The Judge finds that the Petitioner's failure to present a claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and that she has met the requirements of Government Code section 946.6, subdivision (c)(1).
