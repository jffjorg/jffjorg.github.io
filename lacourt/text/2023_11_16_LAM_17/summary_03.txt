The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiffs to provide initial responses to discovery and to have the defendant's requests for admission (RFAs) deemed admitted. The plaintiffs did not oppose the motion and have not provided a substantial justification for their failure to timely respond to discovery. As a result, the defendant is awarded $2,100.00 in sanctions, to be paid jointly and severally with counsel. The judge also orders that the RFAs be deemed admitted.
