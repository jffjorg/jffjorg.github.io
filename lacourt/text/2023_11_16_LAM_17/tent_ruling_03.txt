 Hearing
  Date:  November 16, 2023




 
Defendant’s
motions to compel are GRANTED, and its motion to have its RFAs deemed admitted
is GRANTED. Each Plaintiff is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel,

            On
10/7/2021, Ariel Williamson Maule and 32 other members of the Iota Sweethearts,
Inc. (collectively, Plaintiffs) initiated this action against the Iota
Sweethearts, Inc. (IOTA or Defendant). On 12/1/2021, Plaintiffs filed a first
amended complaint (FAC), alleging: (1) violation of California Corporations
Code section 5341; and (2) violation of California Corporations Code section
5222. 
 
            Now,
Defendant moves to compel all Plaintiffs to provide initial responses to its
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demands for Production.
Defendant also move to have its Requests for Admission (RFAs) deemed admitted.
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
served the subject discovery on 8/4/2023. As such, responses were due on
9/7/2023. To date, no responses have been received. 
 
            Plaintiffs
did not oppose this motion and thus have not offered any substantial
justification for their failure to timely respond to discovery. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motions to compel are granted, and its RFAs are
deemed admitted. Each Plaintiff is sanctioned, jointly and severally with
counsel, $2,100.00. ($350/hr x 2 hr x 3 motions= $2,100.)
 
 
It is so ordered.
