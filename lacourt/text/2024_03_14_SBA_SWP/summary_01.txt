Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for trial setting preference. The plaintiff, Gwendy Ketting, seeks a preference due to her health condition, which she claims raises substantial medical doubt about her survival beyond six months. The plaintiff's counsel submits medical records and a declaration attesting to her condition, but the defendant raises hearsay objections to the evidence. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not submitted clear and convincing evidence of her condition and prognosis, and therefore denies the motion. The plaintiff has failed to meet her burden of showing she is entitled to a discretionary grant of preference under Section 36(b) of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
