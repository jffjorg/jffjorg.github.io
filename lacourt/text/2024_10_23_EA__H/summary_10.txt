And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the implications of a 2009 amendment to Government Code § 905, which exempted claims of childhood sexual abuse from the requirement to present a written claim for damages to a public entity before suing. The amendment was made prospective, applying only to claims arising from conduct occurring on or after January 1, 2009. However, a subsequent amendment (AB 218) made the changes retroactive, applying to any action commenced on or after the date of enactment, as well as to any pending actions. The judge notes that this amendment did not create a liability against the state for past acts of negligence, but rather exempted certain claims from the claim presentation requirement. The judge is considering the implications of this amendment in the context of several court cases, including Bourn, Conlin, Powell, and Heron v. Riley.
