And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the City of El Monte's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which sought to dismiss the plaintiff's claim alleging childhood sexual assault and abuse by a youth baseball league coach in 1981. The City argued that the plaintiff's claim is barred because he failed to submit a government tort claim in 1981-1982, as required by the Tort Claims Act. However, the judge found that Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218), which revived certain childhood sexual abuse claims, including the plaintiff's, did not create new substantive liability, but rather waived a condition of the state's consent to suit. The judge also found that the claim presentation requirement was not an aspect of the underlying substantive liability, but rather an obstacle to recovery imposed by the state. As a result, the judge concluded that AB 218 provides relief to a disadvantaged group of persons (childhood sex assault victims) and serves a public purpose, making the expenditures not a gift within the meaning of the gift clause.
