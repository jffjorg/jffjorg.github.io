And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling discusses the applicability of retroactive legislation to childhood sexual abuse claims. The judge notes that prior to January 1, 2009, a written claim was required for damages, but effective January 1, 2009, the legislature exempted childhood sexual abuse claims. The judge then discusses several cases where retroactive legislation was used to appropriate funds or pay fees to individuals who had previously suffered no legal claim against a public entity. The judge concludes that the changes made to Government Code § 915 by AB 218 are retroactive and apply to any action commenced on or after the date of enactment, as well as to any action filed before the date of enactment and still pending on that date. The judge's ruling is intended to address the dispute over the applicability of retroactive legislation to childhood sexual abuse claims.
