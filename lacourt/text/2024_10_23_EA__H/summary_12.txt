And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the applicability of retroactive legislation to existing claims. The legislature previously exempted childhood sexual abuse claims from the claim presentation requirement for public entities, but only for claims arising from conduct occurring on or after January 1, 2009. However, the judge notes that the exemption was made retroactive by AB 218, which eliminated the retroactivity limitation and added subdivision (p). The judge is also considering the District's argument on misjoinder, which claims that the plaintiff improperly joined three distinct claims into one complaint. The judge notes that while the District only cited to subsection (e) of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 in its notice of demurrer, it did state that the plaintiff's claims were improperly joined. The judge is therefore considering whether the plaintiff's claims are valid and whether the District's argument on misjoinder is valid.
