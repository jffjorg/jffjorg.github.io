English-text summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Covina Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) in response to the complaint filed by Jane CVE Doe. The complaint alleges that Jane was sexually harassed, assaulted, and abused by a teacher at South Hills High School, and that the CVUSD was negligent in failing to prevent these acts. The Judge sustains the demurrer to the eighth cause of action (sexual harassment) without leave to amend, overrules the demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action (negligent failure to warn and intentional infliction of emotional distress), and grants the motion to strike paragraphs 30-38 of the complaint. The Judge finds that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action for negligent failure to warn and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and that the allegations in paragraphs 30-38 of the complaint are immaterial and irrelevant.
