And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Pomona Unified School District's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion was based on the argument that the plaintiff's claim is barred because she did not submit a timely government tort claim and that any subsequent legislation purporting to remove the claim requirement would constitute an unconstitutional gift of public funds. However, the judge disagrees with this argument and holds that AB 218, which amended Code of Civil Procedure § 340.1 to extend the time for filing claims for childhood sexual assault, did not create new substantive liability, but instead waived a condition the state had imposed on its consent to suit. The judge notes that the case of West Contra Costa Unified School District v. The Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 1243 is relevant to this issue, as it held that AB 218 did not create new substantive liability, but instead waived a condition the state had imposed on its consent to suit. The judge also notes that the District's arguments are unpersuasive, citing cases such as Bourn v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal. 321, Conlin v. Board of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal. 17, and Powell v. Phelan (1903) 138 Cal. 271, in which violations of the gift clause were found.
