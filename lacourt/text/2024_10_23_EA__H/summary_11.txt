**Significant Statements**
```
- "At the outset, the Court observes that, days after the District filed the instant demurrer, the First District Court of Appeal issued its decision in West Contra Costa, where it expressly determined that 'AB 218 did not create new 'substantive liability' for the underlying alleged wrongful conduct, but instead, simply waived a condition the state had imposed on its consent to suit.'"
- "The Court agrees with the West Contra Costa court that 'AB 218 imposes no new substantive liability under Chapman's gift clause analysis.'"
- "The Court sustains the District's demurrer on the basis of misjoinder."
- "In light of the Court's ruling on the demurrer, the District's motion to strike is denied as moot."
