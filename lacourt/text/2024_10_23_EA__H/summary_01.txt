And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Anakin Mark Privitera's motion for reconsideration of the September 23, 2024 order denying his Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The motion was not timely served, but the court has overlooked this deficiency because the plaintiff opposed the motion on its merits. The court finds that Privitera's motion fails to articulate any new or different facts, circumstances, or law warranting reconsideration of the ruling. The court also declines to entertain the plaintiff's request for relief.
