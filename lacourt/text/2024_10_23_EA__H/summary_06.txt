And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling considers the plaintiff's original complaint filed on November 21, 2022, and the changes made to Government Code § 905 exempting childhood sexual abuse claims from the claim presentation requirement. The Judge notes that prior to January 1, 2009, a plaintiff was required to present a written claim for damages to a public entity before suing, but this requirement was amended to exempt childhood sexual abuse claims. The amendment was made retroactive, applying to any action commenced on or after the date of enactment and to any action filed before the date of enactment and still pending on that date.

The Judge also references several cases, including Bourn, Conlin, Powell, and Heron v. Riley, which involve the payment of damages and the application of retroactive statute changes. The Judge rejects the defendant's gift clause challenge, finding that the Legislature has not attempted to create a liability against the state for past acts of negligence.

The Judge's tentative ruling indicates that the plaintiff's childhood sexual abuse claim is exempt from the claim presentation requirement and is subject to the retroactive changes made to the statute. The Judge's decision is subject to further consideration and may be modified or vacated before the final ruling is issued.
