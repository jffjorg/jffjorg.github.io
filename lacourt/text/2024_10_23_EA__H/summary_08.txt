And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving the District's potential liability for its employees' sexual misconduct. The District argues that it cannot be held vicariously liable for its employees' actions, but the Court notes that a public school district may be vicariously liable under section 815.2. The judge is also considering the legislature's amendment to Government Code § 905, which exempted claims of childhood sexual abuse from the claim presentation requirement. The judge will determine the District's liability for its employees' sexual misconduct and apply the correct laws and statutes to the case.
