CASE:                                Destinie Gabrielle Neal v. Panrose Corporation, Inc., et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV06570
 





















 
MOTION
TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES, DEPOSITION, REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION TO BE DEEMED
ADMITTED, SANCTIONS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Panrose Corporation, Inc. and Harvey Plotnik
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
On August 29, 2023, Defendants, Panrose Corporation, Inc.
and Harvey Plotnik, filed this motions: 
(1) to compel Plaintiff, Destinie Gabrielle Neal, to provide discovery
responses to Defendants’ Special Interrogatories, Set One, Request for
Production of Documents, Set Two, and Form Interrogatories, Set Three; (2) to
deem Defendants’ Requests for Admission, Set Two, admitted against Plaintiff;
and (3) to compel Plaintiff to appear for deposition.  Plaintiff is currently self-represented.   
 
Defendants’ motion is procedurally improper.  Defendants seek an order covering multiple
forms of discovery.  Separate
reservations and separate motions are required.  Each motion should address the relief sought
for each separate type of discovery request.    
 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion is DENIED without
prejudice.  Defendants are directed to
reserve separate hearing dates and file separate motions (5 total) for the
at-issue discovery.
 
Moving party to give notice.
