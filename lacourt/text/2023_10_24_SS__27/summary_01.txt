Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff, Leonard Graham, to attend medical examinations with Dr. Clayton Lau, a urologist, and Dr. Marc A. Cohen, a forensic psychiatrist. The plaintiff was attacked at the defendants' property and sustained injuries, including a traumatic brain injury and erectile dysfunction. The defendants argue that Dr. Cohen is qualified to diagnose the plaintiff's alleged traumatic brain injury, while the plaintiff argues that Dr. Cohen is not qualified because he is not a neurologist or neuropsychologist.

The judge has granted the motion as to the medical examination with Dr. Cohen, finding that he is qualified to assess the plaintiff's claims of traumatic brain injury. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to appear for a medical examination with Dr. Cohen on November 1, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. at 333 S. Beverly Drive, Suite 200, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
