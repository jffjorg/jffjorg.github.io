[1] Plaintiff did not file an
opposition to Defendant’s motion to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set Two.  A failure to
oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.54(c).)


[2] While the Court is cognizant that
Plaintiff is self-represented, the Court must still abide by the discovery
rules.  (See, e.g., Nwosu v. Uba (2004)
122 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1247, [self-represented litigants are “
‘treated like any other party and [are] entitled to the same, but no
greater consideration than other litigants and attorneys.’ [Citation.]”].)
