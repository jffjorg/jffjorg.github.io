And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions to compel responses to discovery and has ruled on each of them. Defendant Churchill Condominium Association's motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two, and Demand for Inspection and Production of Documents, Set Two, are granted. Plaintiff Galina Kopelev is ordered to provide responses to these discovery requests within 30 days. Defendant's motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, is also granted. Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant's further responses to Plaintiff's First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents, and Requests for Admission is denied because it was filed untimely. The Court finds that Plaintiff failed to serve responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two, and that Defendant is entitled to an order directing Plaintiff to provide those responses. The Court also finds that Plaintiff's objections lack merit and that the 45-day deadline has passed, depriving the Court of jurisdiction to rule on Plaintiff's motion.
