And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Juana Melgoza v. The Vons Companies, Inc. et al. The defendant has filed a motion to compel the plaintiff to submit to a defense medical examination, and the plaintiff has filed an opposition. The judge has granted the motion, ordering the plaintiff to appear for a medical examination with Dr. Kevin Ehrhart on November 8, 2023 at 3:30 p.m.

The judge has also ordered the plaintiff and her counsel to pay sanctions in the sum of $2,810 to the defendant, by and through its counsel, within 30 days of the date of this order. The judge has noted that the plaintiff's counsel did not meet their burden of showing that they did not counsel the discovery abuse, and therefore, sanctions are imposed against both the plaintiff and her counsel.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2024.020, 2024.050, 2032.220, 2023.030, 2030.290, and 2031.300, as well as the case of Kwan Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57.
