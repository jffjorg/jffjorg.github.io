And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise. The Petitioner, Carlos Valdez, has agreed to settle the claims of his minor daughter, Nadya Valdez, against the Defendants, Jazmine Desarae Minor and Rosa Dilia Barrahona, for a lump sum of $27,500. The Court has previously noted defects in the Petition, including incomplete proposed orders and an incorrect settlement amount. However, the Petitioner has cured these defects and the Court finds the settlement amount and request for attorney's fees to be fair and reasonable. The Court has also approved the amended Petition and Form MC-355, which specifies that the settlement funds be deposited in a blocked account opened in the legal name of the Petitioner as parent of the Claimant. The Court sets an OSC re: Proof of Deposit (minor – Nadya Valdez) for December 15, 2023, and requires the Petitioner to give notice.
