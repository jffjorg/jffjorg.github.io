And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to compel discovery responses, deem requests for admission admitted, and compel deposition, without prejudice. The motion is procedurally improper because it seeks an order covering multiple forms of discovery, and separate reservations and motions are required for each type of discovery request. The defendants are directed to file separate motions for each type of discovery request, and notice is given to the moving party.
