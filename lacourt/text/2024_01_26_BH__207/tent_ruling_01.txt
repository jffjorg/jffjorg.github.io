PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
            Main
Case & Cross-Complaints – SC127147
 
This case began on February 28,
2017, when Plaintiff Advanced Geosolutions, Inc. (“AGI”) brought suit against
Defendant Western National Builders (“WNB”) and AMLI 4242 Via Marina LLC
(“AMLI”).  Defendant Fidelity and Deposit
Company of Maryland (“Fidelity”) was added as a defendant on November 15, 2023.
 
AMLI cross-complained against AMLI
and AGI on May 30, 2017, adding Cross-Defendant True Line Railing (“True Line”)
to the action via Roe amendment on August 18, 2021, but True Line’s motion to
dismiss for failure to serve within three years was granted on January 18,
2022.
 
WNB also cross-complained against
AGI on May 31, 2017, and added the following Cross-Defendants via Roe
Amendments on November 14, 2018: Boudreau Pipeline (“Boudreau”), David Evans
and Associates dba Hall & Foreman, Hall & Foreman (“Hall &
Foreman”), Geotechnical Professionals (“Geotechnical”), and R3 Contractors
(“R3”).  WNB added True Line as another
Cross-Defendant via Roe Amendment on August 17, 2021, but True Line was
voluntarily dismissed on March 10, 2022. 
Fidelity was added as a cross-defendant on August 5, 2022 via the filing
of the second amended cross-complaint. 
Griffin Dewatering was added as a cross-defendant via Roe Amendment on
October 23, 2023.
 
Additional cross-complaints were
also brought by:
 
1.     
Geotechnical against AGI on February 5, 2019
2.     
Boudreau against Geotechnical on February 7, 2019
(replacing Geotechnical with WNB by amended cross-complaint on September 11,
2019, and adding Griffin Dewatering via Moe Amendment on June 20, 2023)
3.     
R3 against WNB on March 8, 2019 (adding Griffin
Dewatering via Moe Amendment on August 30, 2021)
4.     
R3 against AGI on April 23, 2019
5.     
Griffin Dewatering against MOES 1 through 100 on
February 14, 2022 
6.     
True Line against WNB on November 21, 2023  
 
Rockwell Drywell Case &
Cross-Complaints – 21STCV20436
 
On June 1, 2021, Rockwell Drywall filed
suit against WNB and AMLI, adding Fidelity as a defendant on July 22,
2022.  Rockwell voluntarily dismissed its
complaint on December 1, 2023.
 
Despite Rockwell’s voluntarily
dismissal, there are still two active cross-complaints within the Rockwell
matter.  WNB cross-complained against
AMLI, adding True Line via Roe Amendment on February 1, 2022, and Railcraft
International Inc. dba Railcraft USA, Inc. (“Railcraft”) via Roe Amendment on
September 25, 2023.  
 
AMLI also cross-complained against
WNB within the Rockwell matter.

Cross-Complaint – 21SMCV01426 and 22SMCV01315
 
On August 25, 2021, Mon Arc Group,
Inc. dba VanKirk Electric (“Mon Arc”) brought suit against WNB and AMLI,
(deleting AMLI and adding Fidelity as a defendant on July 21, 2022)
(21SMCV01426).  AMLI cross-complained
against WNB on October 1, 2021.
 
On August 9, 2022, Regency
Enterprises, Inc. dba Regency Lighting (“Regency”) brought suit against WNB (22SMCV01315).

Relation/Consolidation
 
The Court ordered case numbers
SC127147 (main case), 21STCV29165 (LDI), 21STCV28298 (Pacific Carpets),
21STCV20436 (Rockwell), 21SMCV01309 (Royal), 21SMCV01426 (Mon Arc), 21SMCV01351
(Silverline), 21SMCV01488 (Dino’s), 22SMCV00161 (Jem), and 22SMCV00159 (Hale
Glass) consolidated for discovery only. 
(See May 19, 2022 Minute Order.)
 
Three cases have been related, but
not yet consolidated: 22SMCV00819 (Sound-Crete), 22STCV25157 (Lonestar),
and 22SMCV01315 (Regency).
 
SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ RESPECTIVE POSITIONS
 
WNB requests that all cases be
consolidated for discovery and case management purposes, but that the cases be
severed/bifurcated for trial as follows: the lead case and sewer claims shall
be tried first after a 90-day continuance to allow the parties to complete
expert depositions before trial.  Then,
the railing claims should be tried separately via the Rockwell case, the
emergency lighting claims should be tried separately, and the mechanics lien
collection cases should be tried separately from the sewer claims, the railing claims,
and the emergency lighting claims.
 
Boudreaux does not oppose
bifurcation/severance of the railing issues, but primarily seeks a trial
continuance of at least 90 days.
 
AMLI also requests that the
disputes be grouped into four bifurcated trials: (1) sewer; (2) railings; (3)
emergency lighting; and (4) subcontractor claims, but explicitly requests that
the sewer claims be tried first, followed by the railings and/or emergency
lighting trials, under the theory that once it becomes clear that WNB’s
liability exceeds the amount of the retention, the mechanic’s lien cases should
resolve easily, as the only issue will be the amount of payment from WNB to
each subcontractor, potentially avoiding mechanic’s lien trials altogether.
 
Six subcontractors with mechanic’s
lien/collection cases oppose consolidation, instead seeking a resolution of
their claims which are otherwise unrelated to the sewer, railing, or emergency
lighting claims: Jem, Hale, Dino’s, Royal, Mon Arc, and Sound-Crete.  Regency Lighting also takes the position that
its case is a simple collection case, however Regency Lighting’s claims appear
related to the emergency lighting issues.
 
Railcraft’s primary concern is that
the railing claims are relatively new and require more time to prepare for
trial, including completion of non-expert and expert discovery.
 
AGI does not oppose a trial
continuance, so long as there is a commensurate agreement to extend the five
year deadline, however AGI opposes severing Railcraft’s claims, because AGI
wants to ensure that Railcraft and the other railing and lighting defendants
pay their fair share of AMLI’s consequential damages.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Court’s Authority re
Consolidation/Bifurcation
 
Code of Civil Procedure Section 598
provides:
 
The court may, when
the convenience of witnesses, the ends of justice, or the economy and
efficiency of handling the litigation would be promoted thereby, on motion of a
party, after notice and hearing, make an order, no later than the close of
pretrial conference in cases in which such pretrial conference is to be held,
or, in other cases, no later than 30 days before the trial date, that the trial
of any issue or any part thereof shall precede the trial of any other issue or
any part thereof in the case, except for special defenses which may be tried
first pursuant to Sections 597 and 597.5. The court, on its own motion, may
make such an order at any time.
 
Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure section
1048 provides:
 
(a) When actions
involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may
order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
 
(b) The court, in
furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will
be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause
of action, including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any
separate issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the
right of trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state
or of the United States.
 
Per Local Rule 3.3, subdivision
(g), “Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same
department.  A motion to consolidate two
or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different
departments, have been related into a single department, or if the cases were
already assigned to that department.” 
(Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1).)  Once the Court relates the cases, the Court
may consolidate the actions and order a joint trial on matters that “involve[e]
a common question of law or fact.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).)
 
Here, the Court makes its ruling
only as to those cases that have already been related and are currently pending
in Department 207.  
 
5-Year Deadline
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 583.310 requires “[a]n action shall be brought to trial
within five years after the action is commenced against the defendant.”
 
In computing the
time within which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article,
there shall be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions
existed:
 
(a)   The
jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended.
 
(b)  
Prosecution or trial of the action was stayed or
enjoined.
 
(c)  
Bringing the action to trial, for any other reason, was
impossible, impracticable, or futile.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.340.)
 
The parties may extend the time within
which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article by the
following means:
 
(a)  
By written stipulation. 
The stipulation need not be filed but, if it is not filed, the
stipulation shall be brought to the attention of the court if relevant to a
motion for dismissal.
 
(b)  
By oral agreement made in open court, if entered in the
minutes of the court or a transcript is made.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.330.)
 
On July 24, 2020, the Court signed
Case Management Order #1, pursuant to which discovery was phased and the
parties then involved in the litigation (AGI, AMLI, WNB, R3, Hall &
Foreman, Geotechnical, and Boudreau) purported to stipulate to extend the
five-year deadline to bring cases to trial by the time from the date of the
first Case Management Order to the date Phase II of discovery begins, however,
the version of the stipulation submitted to (and signed by) the Court is not
signed by any of the parties.  
 
The Court notes that a partial stay
of discovery is insufficient to extend the five-year deadline pursuant to
subdivision (b).  (See Warner Bros.
Entertainment Inc. v. Superior Court (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 243, 255.)
 
On June 7, 2022, the Court signed
the parties’ signed stipulation and case management order, which again
contained a clause waiving the five-year deadline for the period of time from
the enactment of the first Case Management Order to the enactment of the second
Case Management Order.  It was signed by
AGI, AMLI, WNB, Hall & Foreman, Geotechnical, Boudreau, R-3, Hale Glass,
Jem, Royal, Rockwell, Pacific, LDI, Griffin Dewatering, Dino’s, Silverline, and
True Line.
 
Further, Emergency Order 10 extends
the five-year deadline by an additional six months, to cases that were ongoing
during the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted court operations.
 
The parties have slightly differing
calculations for the current 5-year deadline. 
Western National and Boudreau believe the deadline is July 9, 2024.  (See WNB’s Notice of Partial Joinder at p. 4;
Boudreau’s Notice of Limited Joinder at p. 2.) 
By contrast, AGI contends the deadline is July 11, 2024.  (See AGI’s Opposition at p. 7.) 
 
The original complaint was filed on
February 28, 2017.  Therefore, by
operation of the original 5-year rule, to bring the case to trial “within five
years,” the case was required to be brought to trial on or before February 27,
2022.  That period was extended by an
additional 6 months by virtue of Emergency Order 10, making the new deadline
August 27, 2022.  Then, by stipulation of
the parties, the deadline was further extended by the 683 days between July 24,
2020 when CMO # 1 was entered and June 7, 2022, when CMO # 2 was entered
(including July 24, 2020, but excluding June 7, 2022), making the current deadline
to bring the case to trial July 10, 2024.  
 
Without the parties stipulating to
extend the 5-year deadline, the Court finds the current deadline to be determinative
as to when the various claims shall be tried, especially the sewer claims.
 
Consequential Damages
 
The Court finds AGI’s consequential
damages argument for postponing the mechanic’s lien cases unrelated to the
sewer, railing, or emergency lighting claims until all other claims have first
been resolved to be unavailing.  As the
Court has previously held, the subcontractors are generally entitled to speedy
payment of their valid claims, and AMLI and WNB may not withhold such payments
based solely on the dispute between them. 
(See Aug 10, 2023 Minute Order [granting summary judgment in favor of
Silverline and summary adjudication in favor of Pacific].)  Moreover, an allocation of the consequential
damages would need to occur regardless of whether the trials are severed and
phased or held together.  The Court sees
no reason why proportionate consequential damages cannot be tried separately.
 
However, as a practical matter,
especially in light of the impending five-year deadline regarding the sewer claims,
as well as the fact that the trial related to the sewer claims may be designated
long-cause, the Court and parties must tend to the matter of setting the
sewer-related claims for trial first.
 
Consolidation
 
The Court also notes that the three
cases that have been related, but not yet consolidated, 22SMCV00819 (Sound-Crete),
22STCV25157 (Lonestar), and 22SMCV01315 (Regency).  
 
As such, on the Court’s own motion,
these actions shall be consolidated with SC127147 for discovery and case
management purposes only under Code of Civil Procedure section 1048.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Having reviewed the parties’
respective positions, the Court determines that judicial economy will be best
served by structuring the cases as follows:
 
·        
The sewer claims, along with the associated mechanic’s
liens, (“Sewer Claims”) shall be severed and consolidated for trial as set on
March 11, 2024 with a Final Status Conference set on February 23, 2024.  
 
Due to the practical concerns with referring
the Sewer Claims for a long cause trial to Department 1, the Court cannot
further continue the current trial date and ensure that the case will be
brought to trial prior to the current 5-year deadline of July 10, 2024.  
 
In preparation for the Final Status
Conference, parties shall comply with the Long Cause Trial Guidelines.  All trial related papers in conformance with
the Long Cause Trial Guidelines shall be filed no later than five (5) court days
before the Final Status Conference.  Upon
confirmation that the parties have complied with the Long Cause Trial
Guidelines and the Court’s determination that Sewer and Lighting Claims are
ready for trial, the Court will order the parties to file a “Notice of Long
Cause Submission to Department 1,” and lodge a courtesy copy of the notice
directly in Department 1 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse (Supervising Judge
Michelle Williams Court).  Thereafter,
Department 1 will set a non-appearance case review to determine if parties have
complied with the Long Cause Trial Guidelines and are ready for the long cause
trial. 
 
·        
The railing claims, along with the associated
mechanic’s liens, (“Railing Claims”) shall be severed and consolidated for
trial.  The Court sets a Trial Setting
Conference regarding the Railing Claims on March 1, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in
Department 207.  Parties associated with
the Railing Claims shall meet and confer, and prepare a joint report regarding
trial readiness, including detailed information regarding the status of
discovery and the time estimate for a jury trial.  The joint report shall be filed with the
Court on or before February 23, 2024.  
 
·        
The emergency lighting claims, along with the
associated mechanic’s liens, (“Lighting Claims”) shall be bifurcated and
consolidated for trial.  The Court sets a
Trial Setting Conference regarding the Lighting Claims on March 1, 2024 at 8:30
A.M. in Department 207.  Parties
associated such mechanic’s liens shall meet and confer, and prepare a joint
report regarding trial readiness, including detailed information regarding the
status of discovery and the time estimate for a jury trial.  The joint report shall be filed with the
Court on or before February 23, 2024.
 
·        
All other mechanic’s liens (not associated
with the Sewer, Lighting or Railing claims) shall be severed and
consolidated for trial.  The Court sets a
Trial Setting Conference regarding such mechanic’s liens on March 1, 2024 at
8:30 A.M. in Department 207.  Parties
associated such mechanic’s liens shall meet and confer, and prepare a joint
report regarding trial readiness including detailed information regarding the
status of discovery and the time estimate for a jury trial.  The joint report shall be filed with the
Court on or before February 23, 2024.  
 
With respect to the Railing and
Lighting Claims, the Court anticipates, subject to further consideration,  that the deadline(s) for non-expert and expert
discovery shall correspond with the new trial date(s) when set at the upcoming trial
setting conferences.  
 
With respect to all other claims
and mechanic’s liens, the discovery deadline set forth in the operative Case
Management Order stands.  
 
            Counsel for
AGI shall provide notice of the Court’s orders.
