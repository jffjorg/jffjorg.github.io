And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Treehouse Publishing, LLC's demurrer to the complaint, but only in part and without leave to amend. The Court has also taken judicial notice that Music Publishing Accelerator, LLC (MPA) is a suspended corporation and therefore cannot defend itself in this litigation or bring a demurrer. The Court has sustained the demurrer to the claims against Treehouse Publishing, LLC because they were added without leave of court. The Court has overruled the demurrer to the claims against MPA because it cannot defend itself. The Court has given Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint, but the Plaintiff has not shown a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
