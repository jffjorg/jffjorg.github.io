Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion to vacate the judgment in a forcible entry and forcible detainer case. The Defendant's motion is unopposed as of June 10, 2024. The Court finds that the 180-day rule applies to the Defendant's motion, and since the notice of entry of judgment was mailed on February 27, 2024, the Defendant's motion is timely. The Court also finds that the Defendant's argument that Plaintiff labeled the Defendant's residence as vacant prior to initiating legal proceedings against her does not constitute an incorrect or erroneous legal basis for the decision. Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion to vacate the judgment.
