TENTATIVE RULING
 
     
I.         
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
   
II.         
Defendant’s motion to strike portions of complaint is MOOT. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Background
This
is a PAGA action. Plaintiff sues for minimum wage violations, overtime
violations, rest break violations, meal break violations, untimely wages during
employment, untimely wages at separation, failure to reimburse expenses, wage
statement violations, and recordkeeping violations. 
 
Defendant demurs to the
complaint on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action and it is uncertain. Defendant also moves to strike certain allegations.

Legal Standard  
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30,
subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.”  (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.)  The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law. . .”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525 (Berkley).)  
 
“In the construction of
a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the
parties.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452; see
also Stevens v. Super. Ct.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601.)  “When a
court evaluates a complaint, the plaintiff is entitled to reasonable inferences
from the facts pled.”  (Duval v. Board of Trustees (2001)
93 Cal.App.4th 902, 906.)  
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendant satisfied the
meet-and-confer requirements. (Decl. Vazquez, ¶¶ 5,6, Ex. D; Code. Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.41, subd. (a).) 

 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant requests judicial
notice of the following: (1) February 16, 2022, letter from Plaintiff Jose
Morales’s counsel to Labor and Workforce Development Agency; (2) Judge Maren
Nelson’s April 7, 2022 Notice of Complex Case Designation and Order in the
matter of Morales v. Rose Meat Services, Inc., Case No. 22STCV05975; (3)
relevant excerpts from Jose Morales’ deposition transcript. The Court will
address them in order. 
 
Documents whose contents are alleged in a
complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which are not
physically attached to the pleading, may be considered. (See Sarkisov v. StoneMor Partners, L.P., No. C 13-04834
WHA, 2014 WL 1340762, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 3, 2014) Plaintiff referred to the February
16, 2022 letter in the complaint and the parties do not dispute its
authenticity. (Compl., ¶ 62.) Thus, the Court grants the request. 


A
court may take judicial notice that certain documents were filed in prior
litigation, or that certain factual findings were made, but generally may not
take judicial notice of the contents of those filings, or of the factual
findings themselves. (See, e.g., Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.
(2010) 181 Cal. App.4th 471, 483-484.) Thus, the Court takes judicial
notice of the filing of Judge Maren Nelson’s April 17, 2022, notice, but not its
contents. 
 
Courts can take judicial notice of matters upon demurrer when there
is not or cannot be a factual dispute concerning that which is sought to be
judicially noticed. (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage
(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 375.) Applying this rule, the Court can accept the
truth of the facts stated in Plaintiff’s deposition only to the extent they
were not or could not be disputed. In the opposing papers, Plaintiff asserts
that his dates of employment are not subject to judicial notice but does not
say why or cite to any supporting authority. Therefore, the Court grants
judicial notice of portions of Plaintiff’s deposition transcript, including the
end date of Plaintiff’s employment. (Morales Deposition, p. 17:14-19.) 
 
Discussion 
 
Defendant demurs to the complaint on the grounds
that the PAGA action is barred by the one-year statute of limitations under
Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (a). Defendant further demurs
on the grounds that Plaintiff lacks standing. Defendant also demurs on the
grounds that the PAGA notice is invalid. 
 
PAGA claims are subject
to the one-year statute of limitations applicable to penalty claims under Code
of Civil Procedure section 340. Under Section 2699.3, subd. (a)(2)(A), an
employee must wait 65 days following notice to the LWDA and the employer before
filing a civil lawsuit unless LWDA provides notice it does not intend to
investigate the alleged violations sooner. This 65-day period tolls the
one-year statute of limitations in some cases. (Lab. Code 2699.3, subd. (d); Hutcheson
v. Super. Ct. (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 932, 939.) Thus, plaintiffs have up to
one year and 65 days after an alleged violation to file a PAGA lawsuit. 
 
The time for employee to
file a claim against the employer under PAGA for alleged Labor Code violations
occurring during employment or upon discharge begins to run from the date
employee’s employment was terminated. (Code Civ. Proc., § 340, subd. (a); Brown
v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 824, 839.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s
employment ended on February 2, 2022. (RJN, Ex. C.) Plaintiff filed the civil
lawsuit on June 26, 2023. This is past one year and 65 days after the alleged
violation occurred. Thus, Plaintiff’s lawsuit is untimely. 
 
“Leave to amend should be denied where the
facts are not in dispute and the nature of the claim is clear, but no liability
exists under substantive law.” (Lawrence
v. Bank of America (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 431, 436.) 
 
The Court sustains the
demurrer without leave to amend. 
 
Because the statute of
limitations bars Plaintiff’s claims and Plaintiff does not allege any defenses,
the Court will not adjudicate the other issues. 
 
          Uncertainty
 
Demurrers for uncertainty are strictly
construed, because discovery can be used for clarification, and apply where
defendants cannot reasonably determine what issues or claims are stated. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Weil & Brown, Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2021) ¶¶7:85-7:86.)  While Defendant’s
Notice of Demurrer and Demurrer refer to the complaint being uncertain,
Defendant submits no argument supporting this assertion, and the Court will not
sustain the demurrer on grounds of uncertainty. 
 
Motion to Strike
Defendant
moves to strike certain allegations complaint. The Court may strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter in a pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) 
Because the Court sustained the demurrer
without leave to amend, the motion to strike is MOOT.
