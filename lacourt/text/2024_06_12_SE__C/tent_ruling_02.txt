 Case Number:  21STCV07600    Hearing Date:   June 12, 2024    Dept:  C KHOSHROZEH DENTAL, et al. v. S&P LEE INVESTMENT, et al.  CASE NO.:  21STCV07600 HEARING:   6/12/24 @ 10:30 A.M. #6 TENTATIVE RULING   Defendant VII Commercial Corporation’s Motion  for Summary Judgment is DENIED. Moving Party to give NOTICE.   Defendant VII Commercial Corporation moves for summary  judgment as to the first and second causes of action in the complaint. The Court’s initial tentative ruling was to  deny the motion because the Court denied a previous motion for summary judgment/summary  adjudication by Defendant VII Commercial Corporation on October 24, 2023.  The Court has reconsidered its tentative  ruling upon reviewing Nieto v. Blue Shield of California Life & Health  Ins. Co. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 60, 72 (trial court properly  exercised its discretion to hear second motion for summary judgment which  addressed issue not raised in prior motion). The instant motion for summary  judgment raises issues relating subrogation under the commercial lease  agreement, whereas the prior motion raised issues of duty and causation.  The Court, on its own motion, continues the  hearing in order to address the merits of the motion.   Accordingly, Defendant VII Commercial Corporation’s  motion for summary judgment is CONTINUED to September 18, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in  Dept. SE-C.  The parties are not foreclosed  from seeking a continuance of trial (currently scheduled for August 22, 2024)  in Dept. SE-F.   Moving party to give notice.
