TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant College
Hospital, Inc. dba College Hospital Cerritos’ Motion to Compel Further
Deposition Testimony is DENIED. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.

 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff
Jane Doe claims she was prematurely discharged from a hospital facility,
College Hospital, Inc., and abandoned to be homeless, causing her physical, mental,
and emotional damage. She sues for the following causes of action: (1)
Dependent Adult Abuse & Neglect; (2) Professional Negligence; (3) Unfair
Business Practices; (4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (5)
Breach of Fiduciary Duty. 
 
On
March 30, 2022, Defendant deposed Plaintiff. (Decl. McGrath, ¶ 5.) 
 
On
March 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. 
 
On
December 21, 2023, Defendant continued Plaintiff’s deposition. (Decl. McGrath,
¶ 9.) 
 
Defendant
moves to compel Plaintiff to produce documents it requested as part of Plaintiff’s
December 21, 2023, deposition. 
 
Timeliness
 
The
motion to compel must be “made no later than 60 days after the completion of
the record of the deposition.” (Code Civ. Pro., § 2025.480(b).) 
 
Sixty
days after the completion of the December 21, 2023, deposition is February 19,
2024. Defendant filed the instant motion on February 26, 2024. Thus, Defendant
is untimely. Nevertheless, the Court will consider the merits of the motion. 
 
Separate Statement
 
Motions
to compel deposition answers must be accompanied by a separate statement
containing the requests and the responses, verbatim, as well as reasons why a
further response is warranted. (California Rule of Court, rule 3.1345(a).) The
separate statement must also be complete in itself; no extrinsic materials may
be incorporated by reference. (California Rule of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)
 
Here, Defendant included a separate statement.

 
Meet and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (b).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 states that a meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion. 
 
The
parties adequately met and conferred. (Decl. McGrath, ¶¶ 11-14.) 
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480
permits a party to seek a motion to compel deposition answers where a deponent
fails to answer any question or produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent's control. The court shall
order the production or answer to be given if it determines that the matter
sought is subject to discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (i).) 
 
A motion
to compel production of documents described in a deposition notice must be
accompanied by a showing of “good cause.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).) “Good cause” has been construed liberally in the past: justification
for discovery is found where specific
facts show the documents are necessary for effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. (Associated Brewers Dist. Co., Inc. v. Super. Ct.
(Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co.) (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 587.) 
 
Defendant argues that because Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint after Defendant deposed her, Plaintiff should produce more documents.
In the separate statement, Defendant states that Plaintiff neither objected to
the deposition notice nor produced responsive documents.  Defendant states no other good cause for
production of documents.  
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the document requests at
issue here are duplicative because they were already litigated on May 21, 2024,
in conjunction with Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request
for Production of Documents (Set Two), which the Court granted in part.  
 
The Court finds that Defendant has not shown good cause for a
further order for production of the requested documents or a third deposition
of Plaintiff.  
 
Based on the above, the motion is DENIED.
