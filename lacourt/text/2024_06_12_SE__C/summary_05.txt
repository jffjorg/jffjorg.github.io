```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendants argued that the default judgment was void due to improper service of the summons and complaint. However, the judge found that the service was proper and complied with applicable statutory requirements. The defendants also argued that they were not aware of the ongoing litigation, but the judge did not find any evidence to support this claim. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the defendants' actions were not taken in bad faith.
