TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant
Heri Steven Franco, Heri G. Franco, and Edith G. Morales’s Motion to Set Aside
Default is DENIED. Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Defendant
Heri Steven Franco agreed to sell Plaintiff a 2017 Honda Civil SI, but
Defendant delivered a 2006 Honda Civic instead. Defendant delivered the vehicle
to Plaintiff at his home. Defendant Edith G. Morales and Heri G. Franco are the
co-owners of Defendant’s home. 
 
Plaintiff
sues for the following: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of Implied Covenant
of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Conversion; and (4) Intentional
Misrepresentation.   
 
On
October 25, 2023, default was entered against defendant Edith G. Morales. On
November 13, 2023, default was entered against defendants Heri Steven Franco
and Heri G. Franco. 
 
On
April 14, 2024, Defendant applied ex parte to set aside default based on
Code of Civil Procedure sections 473, subdivisions (b) and (d) and equitable
relief.  Defendant also submitted a Proposed Answer.
 The motion was continued to today’s
date.  
 
Discussion
 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b) states: 
 
The court may, upon any
terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable
time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.  
 
The
purpose of mandatory relief is to alleviate the hardship on parties who lose
their day in court due to an inexcusable failure to act by their attorneys. (Rodriguez v. Brill
(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 715, 723.) “Section 473 is often applied liberally where
the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the
motion will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted. [Citations.] In such
situations ‘very slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting
aside the default.’ [Citations.] [¶] Moreover, because the law strongly favors
trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 473 must be
resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.” (Fasuyi v.
Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 695.)
 
Here, default was entered on October 25, 2023
and November 13, 2023 and Defendant’s ex parte application to set aside default
was filed on April 14, 2024, well within the six-month time period specified in
CCP § 473.  Hence, the motion is
timely.  
 
As to the merits, Defendants have not submitted
evidence that the default was entered against them because of their
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Defendants submitted a
declaration from their counsel, but it does not say anything about mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
Thus,
the Court denies the motion on this ground. 
 
          Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (d)
 
A party may move to set aside a void judgment
under section 473, subdivision (d). A default judgment entered against a
defendant who was not served in the manner prescribed by statute is void. (Dill
v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)
“Under section 473, subdivision (d), the court may set aside a default
judgment which is valid on its face, but void, as a matter of law, due to
improper service.” (Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540,
544.) 
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff did not
properly serve defendant Heri G. Franco, who was served by substitute service. 
 
When serving individuals, personal service must first be attempted
before serving via substitute service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) “If a
copy of the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be
personally delivered to the person to be served ..., a summons may be served by
leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person's dwelling house ...
in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently
in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing address ...
who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy
of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the
person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were
left.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) 
 
The burden is on the plaintiff to show that the
summons and complaint “cannot with reasonable diligence be personally
delivered” to the individual defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b); Evartt
v. Super. Ct. (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 795, 801.) Two or three attempts to
personally serve a defendant at a proper place ordinarily qualifies as
“‘reasonable diligence.’” (Am. Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199
Cal. App. 4th 383, 389.) Courts defer to factual findings on disputed evidence
so long as those findings are supported by substantial evidence. (First
American Title Ins. Co. (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 37, 42.)
 
Based on the affidavit included as part of proof
of service submitted, Plaintiff tried to personally serve defendants on
September 13, 2023, September 16, 2023, and September 19, 2023. (Decl. Verjan.)
Thus, the summons and complaint could not be personally delivered with
reasonable diligence. 
 
A filed proof of service creates a rebuttable
presumption that service was proper if it complies with applicable statutory
requirements. (Pacifica First Nat., Inc. v. Abekasis (2020) 50
Cal.App.5th 654, 656.) This presumption applies to motions to set aside
judgment for improper service. (Ibid.) The burden then shifts to
Defendants to prove otherwise. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff filed proof of service stating that
on September 21, 2023, his process server served Edith G. Morales at Heri G.
Franco’s residence and that on September 25, 2023, he mailed a copy of the
summons and complaint to Heri G. Franco at her residence. The Court finds that
the service complied with applicable statutory requirements. (Code Civ. Proc., §
415.20, subd. (b).)
 
Defendants argue that Heri G. Franco died on
May 12, 2017, but they submit no evidence of this. 
 
Thus, substitute service was proper. 
 
The Court denies the motion on these grounds. 
 
Equitable Relief
 
Equitable
relief from judgments or dismissals is available only upon a showing of
extrinsic factors. (Advanced Bldg. Maint. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund
(1996) 49 Cal. App. 4th 1388, 1395.) Extrinsic fraud includes where a party has
been deprived of the opportunity to present a claim or defense, such as through
the lack of notice. (Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126
Cal.App.4th 1294, 1300.) Extrinsic mistake is the excusable neglect of the
defaulting party to appear and present his claim or defense, which results in
an unjust judgment, without a fair adversary hearing. (Manson, Iver &
York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 47.)
 
Defendants
do not argue either extrinsic fraud or extrinsic mistake, but rather the merits
of their case, the fact that the Court advised them to retain an attorney, and that
they retained one.  
 
Thus, the Court denies the motion on this
ground.   
 
          Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. A
court may order a party to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's
fees, “incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics, made in bad
faith, that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff
argues that Defendants were properly served with the summons and complaint or
else they would not have appeared at the case management conference on January
8, 2024. Plaintiff also argues that that they knowingly and intentionally
failed to respond to the complaint and have intentionally failed to obtain
legal counsel within a reasonable time despite the Court’s instruction to do
so. Plaintiff further argues that Defendants acted in bad faith in delaying the
ongoing litigation by waiting to file the instant motion the day before the
hearing for default. Based on all this, Defendants argue that this shows that
Defendants’ representations that they were not aware of the ongoing litigation
is false. 
 
The
Court does not find that Defendants stated they were not aware of the ongoing
litigation. 
 
Thus,
the request for sanctions is denied.
