Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The court also denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff, Quennie Yu, alleges that the defendant, American Honda Motor Company, Inc., fraudulently induced her to purchase a 2022 Honda Odyssey and concealed defects in the vehicle's sensory system. The court found that the plaintiff's complaint adequately pleaded a cause of action for fraud and concealment. The court also rejected the defendant's argument that the economic loss rule bars the plaintiff's claim. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change before the final hearing on June 12, 2024.
