And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Rose Meat Services, Inc., sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Jose Morales, had filed a PAGA action alleging various labor code violations. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and was uncertain. The court found that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the one-year statute of limitations for PAGA claims. The judge also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents and portions of the plaintiff's deposition transcript. The motion to strike certain allegations from the complaint was deemed MOOT since the demurrer was sustained.
