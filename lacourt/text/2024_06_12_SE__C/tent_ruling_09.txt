TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant Victoria Tejeda’s Motion to Vacate Judgment is DENIED.
 
Clerk to give NOTICE.
 
The motion is unopposed as of June 10, 2024. 
 
Background
This is a case for forcible entry and
forcible detainer. 
 
On January 2, 2024, the Defendant answered
the complaint. 
 
On February 27, 2024, the Court tried the case
and entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff the same day. 
 
On May 15, 2024, Defendant moved to vacate
the judgment.   
 
Timing
 
The time to file a motion to vacate a judgment is
jurisdictional and cannot be extended due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or excusable neglect. (Conservatorship of Townsend (2014) 231
Cal.App.4th 691.)
 
The moving party must file and serve the
notice of motion either: (1) “After the decision is rendered and before the entry of judgment”; or (2) “Within 15 days of the date of
mailing notice of entry of judgment by the clerk of the court … or service upon
him or her by any party of written notice of entry of judgment, or within 180
days after the entry of judgment, whichever is earliest.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 663a, subd. (a)(1), (2).) The clerk’s
notice of entry of judgment must affirmatively state it was given upon order by
the court or under section 664.5. (Simgel Co., Inc. v. Jaguar Land Rover North
America, LLC (2020)
55 Cal.App.5th 305, 314-315.) 
 
On February 27, 2024, the court clerk mailed
the notice of entry of judgment. It did not affirmatively state it was given “upon order by
the court,” or “under section 664.5.” The form served by the
clerk is a Los Angeles Superior Court multi-purpose form used for notice of
entry of judgment or dismissal or other order. In the lower right-hand
corner, in tiny font, there are references to section 664.5, section 1013a (on proof of service
by mail), and two court rules (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.104 on the time to appeal
and another rule that has been repealed). However, the citation to section 664.5 may reflect instances
where notice of entry of judgment by the clerk is mandatory. Because the notice does not
affirmatively state it was given “upon order of the court,” or “under section 664.5,” or anything similar, and
because the record nowhere reflects that the court ordered the clerk to serve
notice of entry of judgment, the Court cannot assume the court did so.
 
Thus, the 180-day rule
applies. One hundred and eighty days after entry of judgment is August 25,
2024. Hence, Defendant is timely. 
 
Vacate Judgment
 
Section 663 provides two
grounds for vacating a judgment: 
 
(1)
Incorrect or erroneous legal basis for the decision, not consistent with or not supported by the facts; and in such case when the judgment is set
aside, the statement of decision shall be amended and corrected.
(2)
A judgment or decree not consistent with or not supported by the
special verdict.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has labeled her
residence as vacant prior to initiating legal proceedings against her.
Defendant submits as evidence documents and correspondence from the United
States Postal Service. But Defendant cannot introduce new evidence post-trial.
She can only argue an incorrect or erroneous legal basis for the decision. 
 
Because this was a bench trial, there was no
special verdict. 
 
Thus, the Court DENIES the motion.
