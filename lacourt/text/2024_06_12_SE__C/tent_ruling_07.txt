Morfin, et al. vs Nautilus Hyosung America, Inc., et al., Case No. 23NWCV03427
This is a
personal injury action based on a motor vehicle accident. 
Plaintiff Henry
Morfin moves ex pate for a motion to set aside dismissal pursuant to CCP §
473(d). 
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
Plaintiff
contends he will be irreparably harmed as this will result in significant delay
in obtaining a trial date and Plaintiff’s ability to move the case towards
resolution. 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff Henry Morfin’s Ex Parte Application to Set Aside Dismissal is
GRANTED. The hearing for the Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is specifically set
for Tuesday, August 27, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C.  
The ex parte
application is deemed to be the moving papers.  Opposition and Reply
briefs shall be filed within the time period prescribed by CCP § 1005. 
Counsel is advised that the Court typically requires litigants to file noticed
motions after first making a reservation on the Court’s reservation
system.  A party may then seek ex parte relief if necessary.  
Moving party to
give notice.
