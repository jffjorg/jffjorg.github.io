And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel further deposition testimony by plaintiff Jane Doe. The defendant's motion was filed on February 26, 2024, which is 7 days late, but the court will consider the merits of the motion. The defendant continues to argue that plaintiff failed to produce responsive documents during her deposition on December 21, 2023. However, the court finds that the defendant has not shown good cause for a further order for production of the requested documents or a third deposition of plaintiff. The court also notes that the document requests at issue are duplicative and were already litigated in a previous motion.
