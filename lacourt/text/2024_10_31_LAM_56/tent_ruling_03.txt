Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant
PACIFICO EXPRESS LLC (“Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
CYSA EXPRESS INC. (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving and
opposition papers.  No reply has been
filed.  Any reply was required to have been
filed and served at least five court days prior to the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
 
BACKGROUND
             On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint (“Complaint”) against Defendant asserting the following causes of
action: (1) breach of contract; (2) quantum meruit; (3) open book account; (4)
account stated; and (5) unjust enrichment.
            Defendant has not filed a responsive
pleading to the Complaint.  On December
11, 2023, default was entered against Defendant.  On February 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Request for Entry of Judgment in view of Defendant’s default.  Default judgment was entered against
Defendant on February 9, 2024.
 
            On
July 24, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default and Default
Judgment (the “Motion”).  Plaintiff filed
an opposition on October 18, 2024.  No
reply has been filed.
 
DISCUSSION
            The court is empowered to relieve a
party or their legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against them through their mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
excusable neglect.  (CCP § 473, subd.
(b).)  Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.  (Id.)  The law favors a trial on the merits and
courts therefore liberally construe section 473.  (Bonzer v. City of Huntington Park (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1477.)  Doubts in
applying section 473 are
resolved in favor
of the party seeking relief from default.  (Id. at 1478.)
 
            In support of the Motion,
Defendant’s CEO, Juan Mosquera, declares that he mistakenly believed that Karla
Waymire, the attorney representing him in another case (in which Plaintiff is a
defendant), would also handle this current case.  (Declaration of Juan Mosquera, ¶¶ 4-5.)
Mosquera further explains that when he learned that Waymire would not be handling
this matter, he began searching for legal counsel.  However, he encountered difficulties in
finding an attorney due to a language barrier.  (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.)  Mosquera states that as of June 3, 2024, he
has retained Osuna & Dotson Law Firm as counsel.  (Id., ¶ 9.)   
 
            The Court finds that Defendant has
adequately shown that its failure to respond to the Complaint was the result of
Mosquera’s mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect.  In addition, the Motion is timely filed
within six months of the entry of default, and is accompanied by a copy of the
answer proposed to be filed.  
 
            Plaintiff asserts in its opposition
that it incurred fees and costs in obtaining the default judgment in the amount
of $864, and has now incurred an additional $600 in fees and costs in opposing
the Motion (1.5 hrs. at $400 per hour) and anticipates another $200.00 in fees
to appear at the hearing on the Motion (.5 hr. at $400/hr.), for a total of $1,664.00.  (Declaration of Gloria Medel, ¶¶ 11-12.)  While under CCP § 473(b), “[t]court shall,
whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing
counsel or parties”, the provision does not apply when the affidavit of fault
is by a party rather than by the attorney.  This provision is intended to
relieve the innocent client of the burden of the attorney’s fault and to impose
the burden on the erring attorney (Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling,
Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 839.)  The Court also declines to impose a
discretionary penalty under CCP 473(c) in view of Mosquera’s mistaken belief and/or
innocent reliance that an attorney was handling the case.
 
RULING
The
Court, therefore, GRANTS the Motion and ORDERS that the default and default
judgment entered against Defendant be vacated.  Defendant is ORDERED to file a responsive
pleading to the Complaint within twenty days of this order.  The Court
will hold a case management conference on November 14, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in
this department. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 31st day of October 2024
