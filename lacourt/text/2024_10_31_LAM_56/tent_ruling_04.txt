[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:

TO COMPLAINT

Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
CARLY CUCCO (“Plaintiff”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a complaint (“Complaint”) asserting the following causes of action: (1)
breach of governing documents; (2) negligence; (3) nuisance; (4) trespass; (5)
violation of Corporations Code section 7510; and (6) declaratory relief.  Defendant Hayworth Villas Homeowners’
Association (“Defendant”) filed an answer (“Answer”) on May 1, 2024.  
 
            On
July 5, 2024, Plaintiff the instant Demurrer to Defendant Hayworth Villas Homeowners’
Association’s Answer to Complaint (the “Demurrer”).
 
            On
October 18, 2024, Defendant filed its First Amended Answer to the Complaint.
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 472(a) states that “[a] party may
amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the
answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion
to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the
amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or
motion to strike.”
 
“[A]n amendatory pleading supersedes the original
one, which ceases to perform any function as a pleading.”  (JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal. App.
4th 468, 477, citing Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) 3 Cal.3d
875, 884.)  If an amended complaint is
filed, the demurrer is taken off calendar as moot. (People ex rel.
Strathmann v. Acacia Research Corp. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 487, 505-06; Sylmar
Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 1049, 1054.)  This principle
is similarly applicable to answers.
 
Accordingly, since the Demurrer is directed to the now
superseded Answer, the Demurrer is MOOT. 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 31st day of October 2024
