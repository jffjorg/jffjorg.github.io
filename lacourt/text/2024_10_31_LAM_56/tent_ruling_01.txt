MOVING PARTY: Defendant LOS ANGELES
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (“LAUSD” or “Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:
(1) Plaintiffs A.C. and M.M.; and (2) Plaintiffs J.G., A.Z., B.W. and J.C.
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            These consolidated actions involve
minor Plaintiffs who have sued LAUSD based on allegations of sexual abuse
perpetrated by Defendant Daniel Ayon (“Ayon”), who was employed as a staff
coordinator in the Beyond the Bell after-school program attended by Plaintiffs
at Amestoy Elementary School in Gardena, California.
 
            The
case is currently set for trial on November 12, 2024.  
 
On August 21, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant Motion to Continue Trial and the Discovery Cut-Off Dates, or, in the
Alternative, to Stay This Matter Until the Conclusion of the Underlying
Criminal Matter (the “Motion”).  On
October 18, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their respective oppositions to the Motion,
and Defendant filed a reply on October 24, 2024.  
 
DISCUSSION
“Continuances are granted only on an affirmative
showing of good cause requiring a continuance.”  (In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 814, 823.) A trial court has broad discretion in
considering a request for a trial continuance. (Pham v. Nguyen (1997) 54
Cal.App.4th 11, 13-18.)  California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1332 sets forth grounds for continuance and factors for the
Court to consider in ruling on a motion to continue trial. 
 
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases,
the dates assigned for trial are firm. All parties and their counsel must
regard the date set for trial as certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(a).)  Therefore, “continuances of trials are
disfavored.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)¿ 
 
Defendant brings this Motion due to the purported unavailability
of Ayon, a key witness, and its consequent inability to obtain Ayon’s important
deposition testimony.  Defendant is
requesting a continuance until after Ayon’s criminal case is resolved.  Additionally, Defendant cites the
unavailability of lead trial counsel due to conflicting schedules as further
grounds for the continuance.
 
Initially,
the Court notes that this action was initiated in July 2019, and more than five
years have passed since then.  According
to Code Civ. Proc. § 583.310, an action must be brought to trial within five
years after it is filed against the defendant.  Supreme Court Emergency Rule 10(a) extends
this period of time for this case by six months, such that the case must be
brought to trial by January of 2025.  The
Court also notes that there have been a total of six continuances granted in
this case.  Moreover, there is no
specific timeline for the conclusion of Ayon's criminal case, the duration of
the continuance requested is similarly unclear. 
Therefore, it would be unjust to require Plaintiffs to wait indefinitely
before their case can be heard.  
 
In
deciding whether to grant a continuance, among the factors set out by the California
Rules of Court for this Court to consider include: (1) whether there was any previous
continuance or delay of trial due to any party; (2) the length of the
continuance requested; (3) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer;
(4) whether the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting; and (5)
whether the interests of justice are best served by a continuance.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).
 
            The aforementioned circumstances in
this case weigh in favor of denying another trial continuance pursuant to Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332.  The Court
therefore finds that any further delay in this case would be an injustice to Plaintiffs,
and no further continuance is warranted. 
 


 
RULING
            Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties

hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
