On November 18, 2021, Plaintiffs Dr. Payam Vahedifar  and Shadi Vahedifar (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint  alleging causes of  action for: (1) violation of California Civil Code, Section 1950.5; (2)  statutory fraud or deceit; (3) intentional misrepresentation; (4) negligent misrepresentation;  (5) fraudulent concealment; (6) negligence; (7) negligence per se; (8) conversion;  (9) breach of fiduciary duty; (10) breach of contract; (11) breach of the  implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (12) violation of California  Business and Professions Code, Section 17200, et seq.; (13) intentional  infliction of emotional distress; (14) negligent infliction of emotional  distress; (15) unjust enrichment and restitution; (16) intentional interference  with contractual relations; and (17) conspiracy to breach contract and to  interfere with contractual relations.   On  February 7, 2022, the Paya Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against  Plaintiffs and ROES 1-100, alleging causes of action for (1) negligence,  (2) conversion; and (3) violations of California contracting license laws.  Also, on February 7, 2022, the Paya  Defendants filed an Answer to the Complaint.   On  May 22, 2023, the Paya Defendants filed and served an Amendment to the  Cross-Complaint, which identified Krebs as Roe 1.     On  March 18, 2024, Krebs filed an Answer to the Cross-Complaint.   On  March 22, 2024, the Paya Defendants filed and served a demurrer to each affirmative  defense set forth in the Answer of Krebs to the Cross Complaint filed by the  Paya Defendants.               On June 4, 2024, the Court issued a  Minute Order sustaining the demurrer of the Paya Defendants to the first  through twenty-fifth affirmative defenses in the Answer filed by Krebs with 20  days leave to amend.               On June 13, 2024, Krebs filed his  First Amended Answer to the Paya Defendants’ Cross-Complaint (“FAA”).                 On June 20, 2024, the Paya  Defendants filed the present demurrer  to Krebs’ FAA (the “Demurrer”).  On  October 17, 2024, Krebs filed an opposition to the Demurrer, and the Paya  Defendants filed a reply on October 21, 2024.   MEET AND CONFER               The Paya Defendants state that they cannot  possibly engage in any meaningful meet and confer as required under Code Civ.  Proc. §430.41, subdivision (a) because they did not receive the served FAA  until Friday, June 21, 2024.  The Court  will not overrule the Demurrer based on the lack of meet and confer discussions.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4)  [An insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds to overrule or sustain  a demurrer.].)  The Court, however,  reminds the parties of the need to comply with the requirements of the Code of  Civil Procedure.   DISCUSSION Legal  Standard Where pleadings are  defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer.  (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d  257, 262.) When considering a demurrer, a court reads the allegations stated in  the challenged pleading liberally and in context, and “treat[s] the demurrer as  admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions  or conclusions of fact or law.”  (Serrano  v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)    A demurrer to an answer may  be appropriate if “[t]he answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a  defense [or] [t]he answer is uncertain.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subds. (a), (b).)    Ultimate facts are generally  sufficient, rather than evidentiary matters or legal conclusions.  (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42  Cal.4th 531, 550.)     Even where a defense is  defectively pled, it may be allowed if the answer gives sufficient notice to  enable the plaintiff to prepare to meet the defense, in part because defenses  not pled are waived.  (Harris v. City  of Santa Monica, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 240.)   Here, Krebs asserted 25  affirmative defenses in his FAA.  The  Paya Defendants demur to each of the affirmative defenses, based on the ground  that all the defenses fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense and  are therefore uncertain. While the evidentiary facts  alleged in the FAA are sparse, the cardinal rule of pleading is that only the  ultimate facts need to be alleged.   (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 719.)  The “ ‘distinction between conclusions of law  and ultimate facts is not at all clear and involves at most a matter of degree.  [Citations.] For example, the courts have permitted allegations which obviously  included conclusions of law and have termed them “ultimate facts” or  “conclusions of fact.”’”  (Perkins v.  Superior Court (1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 1, 6.)      Most importantly, the  sufficiency of an answer depends on the complaint to which it purports to  answer.  (South Shore Land Co. v.  Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733.)   Even where an answer is entirely bare of facts, it is read with  reference to the facts alleged in the complaint or cross-complaint.  Thus, the Paya Defendants’ contention that each  of the identified affirmative defenses fails to state facts in support thereof is  not, strictly speaking, correct.   The Court has reviewed the FAA  and finds that it fairly apprises the Paya Defendants of the alleged  affirmative defenses.  As pled, the  defenses are sufficient to withstand demurrer.   (Khoury v. Maly’s of California Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,  616 [“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint  is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under  modern discovery procedures.”].)  Any  uncertainty as to the facts underlying Krebs’ affirmative defenses can be  clarified in discovery; specifically, the Paya Defendants can propound Form  Interrogatory 15.1 on Krebs for further details.    Unverified affirmative  defenses, by their nature, are necessarily asserted at the beginning of the  case and out of an abundance of caution because the failure to assert an  affirmative defense may constitute a waiver and cannot always be pled in  detail.  (Vitkievicz v. Valverde  (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1306, 1314; Code Civ. Proc., §430.80 (a).)   RULING Accordingly, the Demurrer is  overruled in its entirety.   Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.               Parties  who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at  SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court  website at www.lacourt.org.  If the  department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the  hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.   Dated this 31st day of October 2024                     Hon.
