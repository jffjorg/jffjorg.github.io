And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to continue the trial and discovery cut-off dates in this case, or in the alternative, to stay the matter until the conclusion of the underlying criminal matter. The motion is based on the unavailability of the key witness, Daniel Ayon, and the lead trial counsel due to conflicting schedules.

The Court has weighed the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, and has determined that any further delay in this case would be an injustice to the plaintiffs. The Court has also considered the fact that the case has been delayed six times previously and that there is no specific timeline for the conclusion of Ayon's criminal case.

Based on these factors, the Court has denied the motion and has ordered the LAUSD to give notice of this ruling. The Court has also directed the parties who intend to submit on this tentative to send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
