Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the First Amended Answer to Cross-Complaint (FAA) filed by Krebs and has determined that it fairly apprises the Paya Defendants of the alleged affirmative defenses. The judge has also considered the demurrer filed by the Paya Defendants to each of the affirmative defenses in the FAA and has found that the demurrer is without merit. The judge has ruled that the FAA is sufficient to withstand demurrer and has overruled the demurrer in its entirety. The judge has also reminded the parties of the need to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure regarding meet and confer procedures.
