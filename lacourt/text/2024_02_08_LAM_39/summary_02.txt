Here is a brief summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the case and has ruled that the Plaintiff's breach of contract claim is invalid because the alleged oral agreement for fee splitting does not comply with Rule 1.5.1 of the California Rules of Professional Conduct. The Judge has also ruled that the Plaintiff's attempt to equitably estop the Defendants from relying on the rule is unsuccessful because the Plaintiff did not act negligently and did not allege any facts suggesting that the Defendants made any misrepresentations or falsely promised to make her a partner. The Judge has sustained the Defendants' demurrer and has ordered that they may lodge a judgment if necessary.
