And here is the summary in English text:

In the case of Steve Javidzad et al. v. Adler Construction, Inc. et al., the court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion for terminating sanctions. The plaintiffs, Steve Javidzad and Laleh Javidzad, filed a wrongful eviction lawsuit against the defendants, Eric Adler, Adler Construction, Inc., and Adler Ventures, Inc. The defendants allege that the plaintiffs stopped making rental payments in December 2019 and then falsely claimed not to be able to pay the rent due to the pandemic.

The defendants have moved for terminating sanctions, citing the plaintiffs' failure to provide responsive documents or serve code-compliant responses. The court has previously ordered the plaintiffs to provide responsive documents and pay monetary sanctions, but they have not complied. The court has considered whether lesser sanctions would facilitate the plaintiffs' compliance, but has determined that terminating sanctions are necessary to remedy the prejudice caused by the defendants' failure to obtain necessary discovery.

The court orders that the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions be granted, and that the plaintiffs' complaint be dismissed with prejudice. The court also orders that the plaintiffs' answer to the defendants' cross-complaint be stricken, and that the defendants seek entry of default and submit a default judgment packet within a certain timeframe. The court will hold an Order to Show Cause hearing on March 12, 2024, to determine why monetary sanctions should not be imposed against the defendants and/or their counsel for any failure to comply with this order.
