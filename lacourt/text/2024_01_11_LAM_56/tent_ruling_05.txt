[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE
  ORDER
 
Date: January 11, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m. 
Dept. 56
Jury Trial: January 29, 2024
 



 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendants Ayal Frist and Alan Golombeck (collectively, “Moving
Defendants”)
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.  
 
BACKGROUND       
The currently operative second amended complaint
(the “SAC”) alleges: (1) breach of contract (count 1); (2) breach of contract
(count 2); (3) breach of fiduciary duty; (4) breach of guaranty; (5)
conversion; (6) negligent misrepresentation; and (7) fraud and concealment; and
(8) civil theft under Penal Code section 496.
            
            On
October 10, 2023, Moving Defendants filed a motion for protective order (the
“Motion”) that seeks an order extending the time for them to submit responses
to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production (“RFPs”).[1]  The Motion also requests monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff and its counsel.
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
            Plaintiff’s objections to the evidence submitted in
support of the reply papers are SUSTAINED. 
(See Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537.) 
 
DISCUSSION
Under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 2031.060, subdivision (a), when an inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling of documents, tangible things, places, or
electronically stored information has been demanded, the party to whom the
demand has been directed, and any other party or affected person, may promptly
move for a protective order.  (CCP §
2031.060, subd. (a).)  The court, for
good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party
or other natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance,
embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.  (CCP § 2061.060, subd. (b).)  Where a party must resort to the courts, the
burden is on the party seeking the protective order to show good cause for
whatever order is sought.  (Nativi v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 261, 318.)  In law and
motion practice, factual evidence is provided to the court by way of
declarations.  (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th
216, 224.)  
 
Plaintiff
served Moving Defendants with the RFPs on September 14, 2023.  (Declaration of Robert W. Hirsh (“Hirsh
Decl.”) ¶¶ 8-9, Exhibits A-B.)  Moving
Defendants are both observant orthodox Jews and do not work from the period
starting on Rosh Hashanah, which fell on September 15, 2023 through the end of
Simchas Torah on October 8, 2023.  (See
Declaration of Alan Golombeck (“Golombeck Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-4; Declaration
of Ayal Frist (“Frist Decl.”) ¶¶ 4-5.) 
On September 20, 2023, Moving Defendants’ counsel wrote to Plaintiff’s
counsel to request an extension to submit responses and a trial extension.  (Hirsh Decl. ¶ 13. Exhibit C.)  Plaintiff’s counsel did not agree to
stipulate to an extension.  (See Hirsh
Decl. ¶¶ 14-15.)
 
Given
that the date of the requested extended deadline has passed, the Court finds
that the Motion is MOOT.  Moving
Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions is DENIED. 
 
 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
 
 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
        Dated this 11th day of January 2024
