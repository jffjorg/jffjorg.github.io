And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to strike portions of the complaint (SAC) relating to punitive damages filed by the moving defendants. The SAC alleges that the defendants failed to address habitability issues during the tenancy, including severe rodent and pest infestations, deteriorating fixtures, and faulty electrical wiring, despite repeated notices. The judge finds that the SAC sufficiently alleges conduct that may entitle the plaintiffs to recover punitive damages. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to strike.
