Here is a written summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions: a motion for leave to serve Charles Krebs by publication and a motion for determination of good faith settlement. The motion for leave to serve Krebs by publication is granted, as the Paya Defendants have demonstrated their inability to serve Krebs despite their efforts. The motion for determination of good faith settlement is also granted, as the S & A Defendants have entered into a settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs that provides for payment of $76,000 in exchange for dismissal of the claims. The Court finds that the settlement agreement was entered into in good faith, as the settlement amount is reasonable and the parties engaged in arms-length settlement negotiations.
