And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to disqualify counsel and two other motions. The motion to disqualify counsel is denied, and the motion to permit service by publication is granted. The motion for determination of good faith settlement is also granted. The judge found that the settlement agreement between the S & A Defendants and Plaintiffs was entered into in good faith and therefore approved the settlement. The judge also found that the Paya Defendants were unable to serve Cross-Defendant Charles Krebs by personal service or mail and therefore granted their motion to serve him by publication. The ruling is subject to change based on any objections filed by the parties.
