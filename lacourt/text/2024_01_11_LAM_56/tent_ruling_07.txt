MOVING PARTY: Defendant Comfort at
Home (“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
 
            The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges 16 causes
of action arising out of an employment relationship. 
 
On November
27, 2023, Moving Defendant filed: (1) a motion to compel further responses to
Requests for Production, Set One (the “RFP Motion”); (2) a motion to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One (the “FROG Motion”); and (3)
a motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One (the
“SPROG Motion”) (collectively, the “Motions”).[1]
 
DISCUSSION
As a preliminary matter, the Court
finds that the meet and confer requirement has been met for all the Motions. 
 
RFP Motion
Under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 2031.310, subdivision (c), a motion to compel
further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents may be
brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate,
evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (CCP § 2031.310,
subd. (c).)  A motion to compel further
production must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the inspection demand. 
(See CCP § 2031.310 subd. (b)(1); Calcor Space Facility, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 234-35.)  To establish good cause, a discovery
proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action
and explain how the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove
that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the
fact.  (Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)  
 
Moving
Defendant served the discovery requests at issue in the Motions on August 3,
2023.  (Declaration of Smbat Mamyan
(“Mamyan Decl.” ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff provided
responses on October 9, 2023.  (Mamyan
Decl. ¶ 5.)  Moving Defendant’s counsel
sent Plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter detailing Moving Defendant’s
concerns with the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s responses on November 10,
2023.  (Mamyan Decl. ¶ 7, Exhibit
C.)  Moving Defendant’s counsel sent a
follow-up email on November 16, 2023, and had not received a response when the
Motions were filed.  (See Mmyan
Decl. ¶¶ 9-10, Exhibit D.)  
 
            The
Court finds that the RFP Motion fails to set forth facts that demonstrate good
cause justifying the discovery of the documents sought by the RFPs.  The Court therefore DENIES the RFP Motion.
 
Interrogatories Motions
Under CCP section 2030.300, on receipt
of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) an answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete; (2) an exercise of the option to produce documents under CCP
section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate; or (3) an objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.  (CCP § 2030.300,
subd. (a).)  
 
If only a part of an interrogatory is
objectionable, the remainder of the interrogatory shall be answered; and if an
objection is made to an interrogatory or to a part of an interrogatory, the
specific ground for the objection shall be set forth clearly in the response,
and if an objection is based on a claim of privilege then the particular
privilege invoked shall be clearly stated. 
(CCP § 2030.240, subds. (a)-(b).) 
The burden is on the party responding to discovery to justify his or her
objections to such discovery.  (Coy v.
Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.)  
 
The Court agrees with Moving Defendant
that Plaintiff’s interrogatory responses consist of sweeping objections and
finds that Plaintiff has not justified her objections. 
 
With respect to the SPROG Motion,
Moving Defendant served over 57 SPROGs.  Generally,
a party may only propound to another party thirty-five (35) specially prepared
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the action.  (CCP § 2030.030, subd. (a).) Subject to
the right of the responding party to seek a protective order, a party who
attaches a supporting declaration for additional discovery under CCP section
2030.050 may propound a greater number of specially prepared interrogatories to
another party if this greater number is warranted because of any of the
following:
 
(1)   The
complexity or the quantity of the existing and potential issues in the
particular case.
(2)   The
financial burden on a party entailed in conducting the discovery by oral
deposition.
(3)    The expedience of using this method of
discovery to provide to the responding party the opportunity to conduct an
inquiry, investigation, or search of files or records to supply the information
sought.
 
(CCP § 2030.040,
subd. (a).) 
 
 
A party who propounds more than 35 specially
prepared interrogatories shall attach a supporting declaration which
substantially addresses why the number of questions is warranted under CCP
section 2030.040.  (See CCP §
2030.050.)  The example declaration
provided in CCP section 2030.050 provides that a party should “state each
factor described in Section 2030.040 that is relied on, as well as the reasons
why any factor relied on is applicable to the instant lawsuit.”  (See id.)  If the responding party seeks a
protective order on the ground that the number of specially prepared
interrogatories is unwarranted, the propounding party shall have the burden of
justifying the number of these interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.040, subd. (b).) 
 
The Court observes that Moving Defendant’s
SPROGs include a CCP section 2030.050 declaration that accounts for the
additional requests.  Plaintiff’s SPROG
responses do not cite to CCP section 2030.030; nor has Plaintiff sought a
protective order.  Under the
circumstances, the Court finds that Moving Defendant’s CCP section 2030.050
declaration is sufficient to justify the additional special interrogatories. 
 
In light of the foregoing, the Court GRANTS
the SPROG and FROG Motions.  Plaintiff is
ordered to provide supplemental, code-compliant responses within 20 days of the
date of this order.
 
Monetary Sanctions
Moving Defendant requests $5,660 in monetary
sanctions in connection with each Motion. 
(See Mamyan Decl. ¶ 11.) 
This amount represents: (1) eight hours preparing the meet and confer
letter and drafting the moving papers at a rate of $400 per hour; (2) an
anticipated 2 hours to review the opposition papers and draft reply papers; and
(3) a $60 filing fee.  (Id.)
 
The Court declines to issue sanctions in
connection with the RFP Motion.  With
respect to the SPROG and FROG Motion, the Court grants Moving Defendant
reasonable monetary sanctions in the total amount of $2,520, which represents
six hours preparing the FROG and SPROG Motions collectively and responding to
opposition papers at a rate of $400 per hour, and a $60 filing fee for each
Motion.  (Moran v. Oso Valley Greenbelt Assn. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029,
1034.)  Plaintiff and counsel are
responsible for paying this amount within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
       Dated this 11th day of January 2024
