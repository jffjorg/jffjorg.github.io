And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to strike Defendant's answer. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Perla Mageno, alleging that Defendant Pei Wei Asian Diner, LLC is a corporation that cannot self-represent. The Court previously granted defense counsel's motion to be relieved, but the relief was ineffective because the order was not signed by the Court. The Court has revised the proposed order and continued the hearing to October 10, 2024, to give defense counsel an opportunity to serve the signed order and file proof of service. Defense counsel is ordered to serve the signed order and file proof of service. The Court will continue to review the motion to strike at the next hearing.
