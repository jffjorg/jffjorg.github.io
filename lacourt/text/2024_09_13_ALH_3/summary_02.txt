The motion is moot because the plaintiffs have filed a request for dismissal of the same cause of action. Therefore, the judge has decided not to consider the motion further. The judge reminds the parties that they must email the court to indicate their intention to submit on the tentative ruling if they do not plan to attend the hearing. The hearing is scheduled for September 13, 2024.
