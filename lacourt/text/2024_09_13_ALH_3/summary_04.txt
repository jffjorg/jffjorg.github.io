The Judge has found that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. Since trial has not yet been set and a trial setting conference is scheduled for December 10, 2024, the Judge has determined that no prejudice will result from granting the motion. The Court has granted the unopposed motion to be relieved, and the motion is effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the signed Order on Form MC-053 on the defendant and all parties who have appeared.
