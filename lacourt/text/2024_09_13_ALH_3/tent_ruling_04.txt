Camron Ali Dowlatshahi moves for an
order relieving them as counsel of record for defendant Kreation Juicery, Inc.
(“Defendant”). Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request
for withdrawal should be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) Trial in this matter is not yet set and that a trial
setting conference is scheduled for December 10, 2024. Therefore, no prejudice
will result from granting this motion and the Court GRANTS this unopposed
motion to be relieved. The motion is effective upon filing a proof of service
showing service of the signed Order on Form MC-053 on Defendant and all parties
who have appeared. 
Dated this 13th day of September,
2024
