Defendants MILESTONE EQUIPMENT COMPANY LLC and MILESTONE
CHASSIS COMPANY LLC’s Motion to Quash Deposition Notice is GRANTED. The
Request to Stay Deposition and/or for Motion for Protective Order is MOOT.
 
Moving Party to give Notice.
 
Defendants MILESTONE EQUIPMENT COMPANY LLC and MILESTONE
CHASSIS COMPANY LLC (collectively “Defendants”) move for an order quashing the
Notice of Continued Deposition of Eric Anderson and Request for Production of
Documents issued by Plaintiffs; for an Order staying the Deposition; and for a
Protective Order on the grounds that the Notice of Deposition seeks the
deposition of a nonresident witness and that this deposition is unnecessary and
burdensome. 
 
“(a) Unless the court orders otherwise under section
2025.620, the deposition of a natural person, whether or not a party to the
action, shall be taken at a place that is, at the option of the party giving
notice of the deposition, either within 75 miles of the deponents residence, or
within the county where the action is pending and within 150 miles of the
deponent’s residence.” (CCP §2025.250(a).) 
 
Plaintiffs maintain that the deposition of Eric Anderson is
relevant and necessary to this action. However, it is undisputed that Eric
Anderson is not a resident of the State of California, and that the Notice of
Deposition requires the in-person deposition of Eric Anderson in Long Beach,
CA. (Waldron Decl., Ex. B.) 
 
“A witness… is not obliged to attend as a witness before any
court, judge, justice or any other officer, unless the witness is a resident
within the state at the time of service.” (CCP §1989.) CCP §1989 prevents this
Court from making an order compelling a non-resident witness to appear for a
deposition in California. (Toyota Motor Corp. v. Sup. Ct. (2011) 197
Cal.App.4th 1107, 1113-1114.) 
 
The Motion to Quash is GRANTED. The Request to Stay and
Request for Protective Order is MOOT. 
 
The request for monetary sanctions is DENIED as it does not
appear as though Plaintiffs were aware of Mr. Anderson’s non-residency status
at the time the Notice of Deposition was served.
