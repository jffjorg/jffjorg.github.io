Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the Complaint. The demurrer to the fifth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) is overruled, as the Complaint alleges sufficient facts to support claims for IIED. The motion to strike punitive damages is denied, as the Complaint pleads sufficient facts to support a recovery of punitive damages. The Judge also notes that the conduct alleged must be "so extreme and outrageous as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community" in order to constitute IIED.
