And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing on the Defendant's Demurrer to the Plaintiff's Complaint to August 15, 2024. The Plaintiff filed a Notice of Errata on June 26, 2024, which appears to be an attempt to amend the original complaint. Although the Plaintiff did not follow the proper procedure for amending the complaint, the Judge grants the Plaintiff leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) in the interests of judicial efficiency and in light of California's liberal policy on amendments. The Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the FAC within 5 days of the Court's issuance of this Order. If the FAC is timely filed and served, the Demurrer will be taken off-calendar as moot on the continued hearing date.
