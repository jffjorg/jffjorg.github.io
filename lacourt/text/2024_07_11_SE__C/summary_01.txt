And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Quash Deposition Notice filed by defendants MILESTONE EQUIPMENT COMPANY LLC and MILESTONE CHASSIS COMPANY LLC. The motion is granted, meaning that the Notice of Continued Deposition of Eric Anderson and Request for Production of Documents issued by the plaintiff, CARGO EXPRESS GROUP, INC., is quashed. The request to stay the deposition and for a protective order is moot, as the deposition cannot proceed.

The judge ruled that CCP §1989 prevents ordering a non-resident witness, such as Eric Anderson, to appear for a deposition in California. The plaintiff's intention to depose Eric Anderson was deemed unnecessary and burdensome.

The request for monetary sanctions is denied, as it appears that the plaintiff was not aware of Eric Anderson's non-residency status at the time the Notice of Deposition was served.
