 Case Number:  22NWCV01760    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  C HAYNIE v. AMERICAN
HONDA MOTOR CO., INC. 
CASE
NO.:  22NWCV01760
HEARING:  07/11/24
 
#7
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories (set one) is GRANTED in part and
DENIED in part. 
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
This lemon law action
was filed on December 29, 2022. Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Special Interrogatories (set one). 
In the Joint Statement filed on July 2, 2024, the
parties state: “Plaintiffs agree to withdraw its Request for Numbers 24-25. The
remaining items at issue are Request Numbers 10-11, 31, and 42. AHM’s Counsel
will discuss with AHM whether further responses will be provided to these
requests. If further responses will be provided prior to the hearing date,
Plaintiffs will withdraw their motion.” (JS 07/02/24.) 
 
To date, nothing has been filed with this Court to
indicate whether further responses were provided/will be provided, or whether
AHM’s Counsel has discussed with it’s client whether further responses will be
provided.  
 
SI No. 10
asks AHM to state all facts supporting its contention that the vehicle does not
qualify for a repurchase. SI no. 11 asks AHM to state all facts supporting its
contention that it acted in good faith when not repurchasing the Subject
Vehicle. In response, AHM responded that it would produce responsive documents.
This is non-responsive. AHM is obligated to respond to SI’s, as phrased.
Plaintiffs should not be required to sort through various documents in order to
find the answers to SI 10 and 11. 
 
SI No. 31
seeks policies and procedures for proactively complying with the Song-Beverly
Act in California by offering a repurchase of a qualifying vehicle without a
consumer request to do so. Defendant’s internal policies
regarding when to repurchase a vehicle are relevant to this action. (See Oregel
v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1104-1105.)
 
The Motion is GRANTED
as to SI Nos. 10, 11 and 31. Defendant is ORDERED to produce further responses by no
later than 10 days of the date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date
may be extended by agreement of the parties.
 
 
SI No 42
asks AHM to state all facts to support its contention that it maintains a
qualified third-party dispute resolution process in California. AHM answers
that “AHM offers its customers alternative dispute resolution through its
participation in a program independently administered by the National Center
for Dispute Settlement.”  This response
is sufficient, and no further response is warranted. The Motion is DENIED as to
SI No. 42. 
 
Given the
mixed ruling, and the fact that the parties resolved many issues through
further meet and confer efforts, the requests for sanctions are DENIED.
