Eric.
O. Ibisi and the Law Offices of Eric O. Ibisi’s unopposed motion to withdraw as
counsel of record for Plaintiff MASIAH SMITH, a minor through her GAL JALIA
STEPHENS is GRANTED.  
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Opposition filed as of July 9, 2024.   
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper
notice to the client at the last known residence or business address of the
client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
Counsel’s declaration indicates that there has been a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship. Where the issue (or conflict) is between the
lawyer and client(s), without implicating other parties, the court can rely on
counsel’s sworn declaration absent any reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed breakdown in attorney-client communications. It does not
appear that Attorney Ibisi’s continued representation would serve the interests
of justice. The motion to withdraw is GRANTED.
