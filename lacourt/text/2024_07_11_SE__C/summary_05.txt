And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Idalia Espinoza Del Cid's Motion to Set Aside Dismissal without prejudice. The dismissal was due to Plaintiff's Counsel's failure to appear for a Case Management Conference and OSC Re: Dismissal of the Entire Action. The plaintiff's motion was denied because they failed to attach a copy of a proposed pleading or amended complaint to the motion, as required by CCP §473(b). The judge notes that the terms of the code are mandatory and compliance is not optional.
