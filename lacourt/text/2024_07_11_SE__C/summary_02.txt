And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories (SI) in a lemon law action filed on December 29, 2022. The parties have been in dispute over SI Nos. 10, 11, and 31, which seek information about the defendant's (American Honda Motor Co., Inc.) contention that the vehicle does not qualify for a repurchase and its process for proactively complying with the Song-Beverly Act in California. The judge grants the motion as to SI Nos. 10 and 11, ordering the defendant to produce further responses by no later than 10 days from the date of the order. However, the judge denies the motion as to SI No. 42, which seeks information about the defendant's third-party dispute resolution process in California, finding that the defendant's response was sufficient. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions, citing the mixed ruling and the parties' further meet and confer efforts.
