And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling held that the demurrer to the first through fifth causes of action as to Defendant Tyde is sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer to the third cause of action is also sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer to the first and second causes of action is overruled. The demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action is overruled. The demurrer to the sixth cause of action is also overruled.

The Court noted that Attorney Omar Gastelum's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff GIA DEVELOPMENT, LLC was granted on January 16, 2024.

The Plaintiff, GIA DEVELOPMENT, LLC, alleged that the Defendant, SC REALTY HOLDINGS II LLC, failed to clear title and breached the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Plaintiff also alleged that the Defendant, TOORAK CAPITAL PARTNERS, LLC, recorded an Assignment of Deed of Trust, which created a cloud on title.

The Court found that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to withstand demurrer for the causes of action for breach of contract, specific performance, fraud, accounting, declaratory relief, and tortious interference with contract. However, the Court sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for fraud, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to plead fraud with specificity.

The Court overruled the demurrer to the first and second causes of action for breach of contract and specific performance, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to state a claim. The Court also overruled the demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action for accounting and declaratory relief, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to state a claim. Finally, the Court overruled the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for tortious interference with contract, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to state a claim.
