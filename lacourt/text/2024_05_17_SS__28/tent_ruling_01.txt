LEGAL STANDARD 

Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 provides: 
“(a) In any
case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries, any
defendant may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff, if both of the
following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The
examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful,
protracted, or intrusive. 
“(2) The
examination is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the residence of the
examinee. 
“(b) A
defendant may make a demand under this article without leave of court after
that defendant has been served or has appeared in the action, whichever occurs
first. 
“(c) A demand
under subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if
any, of the physician who will perform the examination. 
“(d) A
physical examination demanded under subdivision (a) shall be scheduled for a
date that is at least 30 days after service of the demand. On motion of the
party demanding the examination, the court may shorten this time. 
“(e) The
defendant shall serve a copy of the demand under subdivision (a) on the
plaintiff and on all other parties who have appeared in the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.240 provides: 
“(a) If a
plaintiff to whom a demand for a physical examination under this article is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, that plaintiff waives any
objection to the demand. The court, on motion, may relieve that plaintiff from
this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: 
“(1) The
plaintiff has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Section 2032.230. 
“(2) The
plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The defendant may move for an order compelling response
and compliance with a demand for a physical examination. 
“(c) The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel response and compliance with
a demand for a physical examination, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(d) If a
plaintiff then fails to obey the order compelling response and compliance, the
court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240.) 

DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant negligently operated his motor vehicle, causing it to
collide with Plaintiff’s motor vehicle and severely injuring Plaintiff.  Plaintiff seeks general and special damages. 
On
November 30, 2023, Defendant served a demand for Plaintiff’s independent medical
examination.  The examination,
by Dr. Patrick Hsieh, was scheduled for January 4, 2024. Plaintiff did not
object to the examination. 
Plaintiff
failed to appear at January 4, 2024 examination. Plaintiff’s counsel did not
respond to Defendant’s counsel’s meet and confer emails.  Defendant now moves to compel Plaintiff to attend
an examination. 
The
Court grants the motion and orders Plaintiff to attend an independent medical
examination with Dr. Patrick Hsieh on May
29, 2024, at 5:30 p.m., at 1450 San
Pablo Street, #5400, in Los Angeles, California 90033. 
Defendant
requests sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to appear at the January 4,
2024 examination.  Code of Civil
Procedure section 2032.240 authorizes an award of sanctions against “against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel response and compliance with a demand for a physical examination . . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (c).)
 Plaintiff
did not make or oppose a motion to compel a demand for a physical examination.  Therefore, sanctions are not available under
this statute.         
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary
sanctions may not be imposed based solely on [the statute]. Monetary sanctions
may be imposed only if authorized by some other provision of the Discovery
Act.” (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court
may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the extent
authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or other
provision of this title”]; City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers,
LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504, review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with
order permitting citation of opinion for its persuasive value and to establish
the existence of a conflict in authority that would “allow trial courts to
exercise discretion . . . to choose between sides of any such conflict”.) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  “ ‘Rules of court have the force of law and
are as binding as procedural statutes as long as they are not inconsistent with
statutory or constitutional law.’ ” (Fidelity National Home Warranty Company
Cases (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 812, 842, fn. 41, quoting In re I.V.
(2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 249, 256.) 
Interpreting rule 3.1348(a) to authorize an award of sanctions on the
motion to compel Plaintiff’s independent medical examination would be
inconsistent with Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.240, subdivision (c).) 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS in part Defendant
Jill Renner’s motion to compel Plaintiff Henry Martinez to attend an independent
medical examination.  The Court orders Plaintiff
Henry Martinez to attend an independent medical examination with Dr. Patrick
Hsieh, a member of the American Board of Neurological Surgery, on May 29, 2024,
at 5:30 p.m., at 1450 San Pablo Street, #5400, in Los Angeles, California 90033. 
          The Court DENIES Defendant
Jill Renner’s request for monetary sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
