Here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering a dispute over jurisdiction in a case involving TBC Brand Defendants, Linglong, and Horizon. The court is reviewing the parties' motions and oppositions to determine whether it has personal jurisdiction over the defendants. The court is considering the defendants' arguments that they did not purposefully avail themselves of the jurisdiction of the forum state. The court is also reviewing the parties' exhibits and declarations, including a declaration from Shi that all CrossWind tires manufactured before September 2014 were manufactured in China. The court notes that it may need to be better apprised of the facts regarding the sale and distribution of the tires. The court will hear from the parties to clarify certain issues before making a final ruling.
