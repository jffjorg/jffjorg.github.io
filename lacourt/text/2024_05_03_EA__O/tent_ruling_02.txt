[1] According to the
complaint, Shandong is a foreign corporation; Linglong (the American affiliate
of Shandong) is a Ohio corporation with its principal place of business (PPB)
in Ohio who “engag[es] in the business of manufacturing and packaging certain
products, including automobile tires, for sale to and for use by members of the
general public;” TBC Brand Defendants (both the LLC and Corporation) are
Delaware corporations headquartered in Florida who “engag[e] in the
manufacturing and packaging of certain products, including automobile tires,
for sale to and for use by members of the general public;” Horizon is a
California corporation with a with a principal place of business located in
4818 4th Street, Irwindale, CA 91706 that is “engaged in the business of
importing, shipping, selling and distributing tires, including the SUBJECT
TIRE.” (See generally Complaint pp. 3-4.) 
 


[2] Daimler AG. v. Bauman (2014)
571 U.S. 117, 137-138 [Court emphasized that Goodyear did not hold that a corporation may be subject
to general jurisdiction only in a
forum where it is incorporated or has its principal place of business; The Court
suggested there might be “exceptional case[s]” in which a corporation’s
operations in a forum other than its place of incorporation and principal place
of business are “so substantial and of such a nature as to render the
corporation at home in that State.”]; see also Vons, supra,14 Cal.4th at pp. 445-446 [general jurisdiction is
proper when “a defendant's contacts with the forum are so wide-ranging that
they take the place of physical presence in the forum as a basis for
jurisdiction.”].) 
 


[3] See TBC Opp. p. 5:13-14; Linglong Opp.,
Header A [“The Court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction….”].
 


[4] As
applied to these facts, the decedent is not a resident of California and did
not suffer harm in California. 
 


[5] Here,
the injury did not take place in California. 


[6] “[P]urposeful availment exists whenever the defendant
purposefully and voluntarily directs its activities toward the forum state in
an effort to obtain a benefit from that state.” (Snowney v. Harrah’s
Entertainment, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1054, 1067.)
 


[7] This second prong is largely contested by Defendants’
motions. 
 


[8] Plaintiff contends
that the “jurisdictional findings of the district court in the Virginia Action
do not constitute evidence in the current action nor do they have preclusive
effect.” (TBC Opp. p. 3:16-17.) While the Virginia Action’s findings may not have
a preclusive effect because the Virginia Action assessed the issue of whether Virginia,
not California, has personal jurisdiction over Defendants, an admission
to a court forbids consideration of contrary evidence. (TBC Reply, p.
3:1-5, citing Valerio v. Andrew Youngquist Constr. (2002)103 Cal. App.
4th 1264, 1271 (2002) [“[A]n admission in the pleadings forbids the
consideration of contrary evidence.”]; Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.
App. 4th 175, 187 [judicial admission prevents a party from later relitigating
the same issue].) 
 


[9] Horizon sued Linglong in 2015 in California and then
on Linglong sued Horizon in Ohio. (See Plaintiff’s Opp. to Linglong Motion pp.
6-9 [discussion of the litigation].) 
 


[10] Plaintiff provides
evidence that TBC Brands is one of the largest distributors of private brand
tires in North America. It is a wholesale supplier to independent reginal tire
retailers and distributors throughout the United States and internationally. (Plaintiff’s
TBC Opp. p. 3, see also Nelson Decl. Ex. 2 [TBC Brand’s website].) In Reply,
Defendants maintain that TBC Corporate and TBC Brands are separate corporate
entities such that Plaintiff is improperly conflating between the two. 
 


[11] According to Shi’s
declaration, all CrossWind tires manufactured through September 2014 were
manufactured exclusively in China. After September 2014, certain tires were
manufactured by Shangdong in Thailand. 
 


[12] Based on a holistic
reading of the declaration, the court presumes that Horizon bought Crosswind
tires manufactured after September 2014. 
 


[13] Perhaps the court needs to be
better apprised of the facts, but if the Tire was manufactured at the latest by
September 6, 2014 and tires manufactured in September 2014, which would include
the Tire, were only sold and distributed in China, it is unclear
how even Horizon would have been able to purchase this tire from Shandong
(unless Horizon purchased the tire in China, which it doesn’t appear to be so).
(See TBC Reply p. 5:3-4 [“If Plaintiff wants to inquire into what happened to
the Tire after it was sold in China, he can pursue such information from
Horizon in discovery.”].) The court will hear from the parties to clarify this
point.
