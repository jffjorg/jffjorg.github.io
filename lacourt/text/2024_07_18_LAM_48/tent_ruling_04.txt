  CASE NO.: 23STCV20484
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO AMEND
  JUDGMENT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 18, 2024



 
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association filed this action against Defendant Daniel
Ray Gonzalez as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Robert Kim Gonzales.
On
May 28, 2024, the Court entered default judgment.
On
June 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to amend the judgment nunc pro tunc “so
that the Judgment Debtor’s name can be corrected.”  (Motion at p. 1.)
Counsel
declares that “[i]t has come to [her] attention that due to clerical error ‘individually
and’ was left out of Defendant’s name.”  (Ramirez-Browning
Decl. ¶ 3.)  The Estate has no funds because
they were transferred to Gonzalez as personal representative.  (Ramirez-Browning Decl. ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff contends that Gonzalez is personally
responsible for the debts and should be included as an individual in the judgment
so Plaintiff can pursue collection of the judgment.  (Ramirez-Browning Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)
 
 
 
The
Complaint does allege that Gonzalez “is sued in his individual capacity, and also
as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Robert Kim Gonzales.”  (Complaint ¶ 2.)  However, nowhere else was Gonzalez named in his
individual capacity.  The Complaint’s caption
identifies the Defendants as “DANIEL RAY GONZALEZ, as Personal Representative of
ROBERT KIM GONZALES, Deceased, and DOES 1-20.” 
Accordingly, summons issued for “DANIEL RAY GONZALEZ, as Personal Representative
of ROBERT KIM GONZALES, Deceased, and DOES 1-20.”  Plaintiff applied for service via publication
and later filed a Proof of Publication that gave notice to “DANIEL RAY GONZALEZ,
as Personal Representative of ROBERT KIM GONZALES, Deceased, and DOES 1-20.”
Gonzalez
was sued only as personal representative of the Estate.  Gonzalez was never sued or served in his individual
capacity.  Adding him to the judgment in his
individual capacity is not a correction of a mere clerical error—it is the addition
of an entirely new defendant.  “[A] trial
court’s authority to amend its judgment nunc pro tunc is limited to correcting clerical
errors in the judgment.”  (Nellie Gail
Ranch Owners Assn. v. McMullin (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 982, 1009.)  Plaintiff may still be able to amend the judgment
in other ways, such as by adding an alter ego of the original judgment debtor, but
a nunc pro tunc amendment is not appropriate when this amendment is more than a
mere clerical error.
Accordingly,
the motion to amend judgment is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
