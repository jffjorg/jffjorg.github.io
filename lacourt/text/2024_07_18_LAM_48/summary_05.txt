And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) to dismiss the second amended complaint (SAC) filed by Janus Capital Group Inc., Janus Management Holdings Corporation, and VS Holdings Inc. (Plaintiffs).

The FTB argued that the SAC is facially time-barred because it was filed too late, and that the Plaintiffs did not properly state their claim for refund. However, the judge found that the SAC is not facially time-barred and that the Plaintiffs did properly state their claim for refund.

The judge also addressed the FTB's argument that the Plaintiffs may not bring separate causes of action for declaratory relief. The FTB argued that the SAC must be incorporated into the tax refund causes of action, but the judge found that the SAC is a proper claim for declaratory relief about future relief, not about outstanding tax assessments or validity of outstanding taxes.

Overall, the judge has overruled the FTB's demurrer and ordered the FTB to file an answer within 10 days.
