And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the unopposed motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Tara Aleagha, counsel of record for Defendant Mindful Values. The motion is based on the fact that Mindful Values has decided to cease operations and dissolve its business, and the company's director has informed counsel that they do not want to retain counsel. The judge notes that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. However, the judge also notes that a corporation cannot represent itself in court, so an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel is scheduled for October 18, 2024, at which time Mindful Values must retain new counsel or the court will strike its answer and place it in default.
