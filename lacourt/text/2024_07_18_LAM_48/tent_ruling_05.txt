[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 18, 2024



 
On February 22, 2024, Plaintiffs
Janus Capital Group Inc., Janus Management Holdings Corporation, and VS Holdings
Inc. filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”) against Defendant California Franchise
Tax Board.
On
February 28, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer.
The
Court does not consider the exhibits filed with Defendant’s Demurrer or Plaintiffs’
Opposition.  “Because a demurrer challenges
defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside the pleading
that are subject to judicial notice.”  (Arce
ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471,
556.)
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
A.        Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Not Facially Time
Barred (First and Second Causes of Action).
Defendant
argues that the statute of limitations expired with respect to Plaintiffs’ 2013,
2014, and 2015 tax years.  (Demurrer at p.
6.)
“‘In
order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect
must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough
that the complaint shows that the action may be barred.’”  (Geneva Towers Ltd. Partnership v. City of
San Francisco (2003) 29 Cal.4th 769, 781.)
A
taxpayer has four years from the date that the tax return was due to file a claim
for refund, which states the specific reasons why the taxpayer should receive a
refund.  (Rev. & Tax. Code, § 19306.)
Plaintiffs
allege that the Franchise Tax Board failed to comply with the requirements of the
Administrative Procedures Act when it adopted Code of Regulations section 25137-14.  (SAC ¶ 17.) 
For the tax years at issue, Plaintiffs “sourced its service receipts to the
location of the shareholders of those purchasers, pursuant to regulation CCR § 25137-14,
instead of sourcing those receipts to the actual location of those purchasers, as
required by the statute.  CRTC § 25136.”  (SAC ¶ 24.) 
The first and second causes of action allege that section 25137-14 is invalid
because FTB did not comply with the APA when the special industry regulation was
promulgated in 2007.   (SAC ¶ 36.)  Even if it was valid when promulgated, it became
invalid after the amendment of section 25136 in 2013.  (SAC ¶ 49.) 
On October 11, 2018, Plaintiffs timely and properly filed a claim for refund
with the Franchise Tax Board “on the grounds that [they] were entitled to correctly
source their service receipts to the location of its actual purchasers pursuant
to [Revenue and Taxation Code section] 25136. 
(SAC ¶ 26.)
The
parties agree that the claim for refund was timely filed for all tax years.  (SAC ¶ 23; Opposition at p. 7.)  However, Defendant argues that the claim does
not state the specific reasons why the taxpayer should receive a refund, according
to the allegations in the first and second causes of action.  (Demurrer at pp. 7-8; see Rev. & Tax. Code,
§ 19306.)
Defendant
relies on extrinsic evidence, which the Court cannot consider on demurrer.  Even so, Plaintiffs’ allegation of a claim based
“on the grounds that Janus was entitled to correctly source its service receipts
to the location of its actual purchasers pursuant to CRTC § 25136” is sufficient.  (SAC ¶ 26.) 
“[A] taxpayer need not expressly raise a contention in order to meet the
statutory exhaustion requirements.  Where
the contention is intertwined with contentions expressly raised in the refund claim,
courts may consider that contention even though the claim did not explicitly raise
it.”  (Preston v. State Bd. of Equalization
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 197, 206.)  In order to
support their contentions within the refund claim (that section 25136 governs the
sourcing of receipts), Plaintiffs will necessarily need to argue the bases for sections
25137-14’s invalidity.  The contentions raised
in the SAC are intertwined with the alleged contentions raised in Plaintiffs’ refund
claim.
The
demurrer to the first and second causes of action is overruled.
B.        Plaintiffs May Bring Causes of Action
for Declaratory Relief (First and Second Causes of Action).
Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs may not bring separate causes of action for declaratory relief,
and the first and second causes of action must be incorporated into the tax refund
causes of action.  (Demurrer at p. 9.)  “[D]eclaratory relief claims brought by taxpayers
with outstanding tax assessments are not exempt from [California Constitution Article
13,] section 32’s ‘pay first’ rule, even if brought pursuant to [Government Code]
section 11350.”  (California Department
of Tax and Fee Administration v. Superior Court (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 922, 933.)  “[T]he sole legal avenue for resolving tax disputes
is a postpayment refund action.  A taxpayer
may not go into court and obtain adjudication of the validity of a tax which is
due but not yet paid.”  (State Bd. of Equalization
v. Superior Court (1985) 39 Cal.3d 633, 638.)
Plaintiffs
allege, and Defendant concedes, that Plaintiffs timely paid taxes and filed their
claims.  (SAC ¶ 23; Demurrer at p. 3.)  Plaintiffs are not seeking to adjudicate the validity
of an unpaid tax.  Instead, Plaintiffs seek
a declaration about the validity of the regulations and the proper method of assessing
future taxes.  (SAC ¶¶ 42-44, 65-67.)  These are proper claims for declaratory relief
about future relief, not about outstanding tax assessments or validity of outstanding
taxes.
The
demurrer to the first and second causes of action is overruled.
C.        Conclusion
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant is ordered
to file an answer within 10 days.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j).)
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
