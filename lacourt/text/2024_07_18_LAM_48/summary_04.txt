```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to include the defendant, Daniel Ray Gonzalez, in his individual capacity is denied. The judge finds that the amendment is not a correction of a clerical error, but rather the addition of a new defendant, which is beyond the court's authority to amend a judgment nunc pro tunc. The plaintiff had previously sued the defendant only as the personal representative of the estate of Robert Kim Gonzales, and the defendant was never sued or served in his individual capacity. The judge notes that the plaintiff may still be able to amend the judgment in other ways, such as by adding an alter ego of the original judgment debtor, but a nunc pro tunc amendment is not appropriate in this case.
