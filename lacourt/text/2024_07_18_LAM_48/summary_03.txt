Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests from the Defendant. The Judge found that the Plaintiff did not comply with the court's procedures for submitting a joint statement and that the Plaintiff did not act diligently in seeking to compel further responses. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's separate statement was boilerplate and did not set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought. As a result, the motion to compel further responses is denied.
