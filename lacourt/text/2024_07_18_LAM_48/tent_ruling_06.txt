  CASE NO.: 23STCV29725
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 18, 2024



 
Tara
Aleagha, counsel of record for Defendant Mindful Values, seeks to be relieved as
counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that
Defendant has decided to cease operations and dissolve the business.  Defendant’s director informed counsel that they
do not want to retain counsel, making it impractical and burdensome for counsel
to continue the representation.  No party
opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
generally complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until March 10, 2025, and there is
no prejudice to Defendant.
Neither
the declaration nor the proposed order includes all future hearings dates.  The proposed order also does not include Defendant’s
current or last known address and telephone number.  Counsel must submit a revised and complete proposed
order before the hearing, or the Court will deny the motion without prejudice.
Subject
to the submission of a revised and complete proposed order, the unopposed motion
to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of service showing service
of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on Mindful Values and all parties
who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Mindful Values is scheduled for October 18, 2024 at 8:30
a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Long
Spring Freight LLC must retain new counsel by that date or the Court will strike
its answer and place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 18th day of July 2024
