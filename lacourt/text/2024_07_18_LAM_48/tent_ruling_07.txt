Plaintiffs Luis Larraburu and Genevieve Bianchi.
On

DEMURRER, MOTION TO STRIKE,
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
On
May 14, 2024, Defendants filed an omnibus demurrer and motion to strike.
On
July 11, 2024, the Court denied without prejudice a motion to appoint Amanda Grabowski
as successor-in-interest for Plaintiff Blake Grabowski, who is now deceased.
Part
of Defendants’ Reply contends that Plaintiffs’ counsel cannot oppose the motions
on behalf of Grabowski.  (Reply at pp. 7-8.)  Instead of considering the omnibus motions unopposed
by Grabowski, the Court will continue the hearings until a time when Grabowski’s
successor-in-interest has substituted into the case.
The
Demurrer and Motion to Strike are CONTINUED to ___________________.
An
Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal of Plaintiff Blake Grabowski’s Complaint for Failure
to Substitute Successor-in-Interest is scheduled for [same date as Demurrer and
Motion to Strike].
The
Case Management Conference is CONTINUED to [same date].
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
