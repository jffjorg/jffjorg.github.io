And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action (Lis Pendens) recorded against the property located at 1905 East Rogers Street, Long Beach, CA. The plaintiff, Marco Joseph Valdez, filed a lawsuit against the defendants, Home Approval Direct Inc. and Alexander Kim, seeking cancellation of the deed and quiet title. However, the plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion to expunge the Lis Pendens and did not provide any evidence to support his claims. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not met the burden of establishing the probable validity of his claims and that the Lis Pendens should be expunged.
