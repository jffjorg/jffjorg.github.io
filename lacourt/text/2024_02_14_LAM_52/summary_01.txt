And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the defendants: (1) a motion to compel the deposition of Jeff Voorheis, an expert witness for the plaintiffs, and (2) an order to show cause re: transfer to limited jurisdiction. The court has denied the motion to compel deposition, finding it to be untimely and that the defendants do not have the right to conduct expert discovery at this late stage in the proceedings. The court has also denied the order to show cause re: transfer to limited jurisdiction, finding that the action does not meet the criteria for classification as a limited civil case. The court has ruled that the action will not be transferred to limited jurisdiction and that the plaintiffs will not be required to show cause why the action should not be transferred. The court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and relevant case law.
