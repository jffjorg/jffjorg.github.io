And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to enforce deposition subpoenas against Shegun Olora and Pure-R-Space, Inc. filed by Defendants Raymond Bell and Dorothy Bell. The Judge denies the motion, finding that the deposition subpoenas are defective because they do not specify a place for the deponents to appear. The Judge notes that Zoom is not a "place" for deposition, and that the certificates of non-appearance also fail to identify a place. The Judge also finds that there is no proof of personal service on the deponents. The Judge cites various California laws and rules, including the Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court, in support of the ruling.
