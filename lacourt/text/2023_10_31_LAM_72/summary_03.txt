The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's claims for hostile work environment and failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, and retaliation are valid, but has sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's wrongful termination in violation of FEHA claim without leave to amend. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's retaliation claim with leave to amend, and has sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's claim for violation of Labor Code section 6310 with leave to amend.

The judge has found that the plaintiff has adequately alleged that she suffered harassment and discrimination on the basis of her national origin, and has held that the defendant failed to prevent harassment and discrimination in the workplace. The judge has also found that the defendant retaliated against the plaintiff, but has not sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
