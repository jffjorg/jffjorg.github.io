special damages, $50,000.00 in general damages, $12,745.20 in interest, and $1,380,75
in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default
judgment 
“[With
exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter
Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following must be included in the documents
filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's
claim; 
“(2)  Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A declaration of nonmilitary status for each
defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
“(6)  A proposed form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported
by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request for attorney fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause
of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
requests prejudgment interest of 10% on $37,668.00 from the “date of loss” on
June 9, 2020.  According to Plaintiff,
$37,668 represents “his economic damages and costs in bringing this action.”  (Declaration of Interest Calculation in
Support of Default Judgement.) Plaintiff does not, however, explain the legal
basis for his request for prejudgment interest. 
Plaintiff
has not shown that 7051 Sunset failed to accept an offer under Code of Civil
Procedure section 998 and Plaintiff then obtained a more favorable
judgment.  (See Civ. Code, § 3291.)  In that event, prejudgment interest would run
from the date of the offer.  Plaintiff also
has not shown that his damages were “certain, or capable of being made certain
by calculation” (Civ. Code, § 3287, subd. (a)) on the “date of loss.”  Plaintiff should either remove the request for prejudgment interest or explain why the Court is authorized to grant it. 
In
addition, the application does not explain the basis for Plaintiff’s request
for $50,000.00 in special damages. 
Plaintiff’s statement of damages listed $36,517.24 as his medical
expenses to date.  As noted, Plaintiff asserts
that $37,668 is “his economic damages and costs in bringing this action.”  (Declaration of Interest Calculation in
Support of Default Judgement.)  Plaintiff’s
declaration filed March 15, 2024 states that his total medical specials are $37,668.  (Declaration of Plaintiff DaJuan Gross in Support
of Request for Entry of Default Against Defendant 7051 Sunset Boulevard, LLC ¶
5.)  Plaintiff has not provided evidence
of future medical expenses. 
The
Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Dajuan Gross’s
application for default judgment filed on March 12,
2024 without prejudice. 
The
Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Resubmit Default
Judgment Packet on May 20, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring
Street Courthouse. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
