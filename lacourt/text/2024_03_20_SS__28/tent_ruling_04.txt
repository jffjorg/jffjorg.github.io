On

Defendant of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents
on July 29, 2023.  Plaintiff filed
amended proofs of service on September 27, 2023 and November 13, 2023. 
On
November 17, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on
March 20, 2024. 
On
February 29, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
21st Century Insurance Company asks the Court to enter a default judgment
against Defendant Pedro Santa Cruz and award Plaintiff $108,172.93, consisting
of $106,924.54 as the demand of the complaint, $742.14 in prejudgment interest, and $506.25 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default
judgment 
“[With
exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter
Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following must be included in the documents
filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's
claim; 
“(2)  Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A declaration of nonmilitary status for each
defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
“(6)  A proposed form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported
by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request for attorney fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause
of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.)  A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
seeks reimbursement of the amount it paid to its insured in property damages and
uninsured motorist bodily injury benefits as the result of Defendant’s
negligence.  Plaintiff has provided
evidence supporting its payment of $6,924.54 for the insured’s property
damages.  However, Plaintiff has provided
no evidence showing that its payment of $100,000.00 to the insured was based on
the insured’s reasonably incurred medical expenses. 
The
Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff 21st Century Insurance Company’s application for default
judgment filed on February 26, 2024 without
prejudice. 
The
Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Resubmit Default
Judgment Packet on May 20, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring
Street Courthouse. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
