And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding the dismissal of a case due to the plaintiff's failure to bring the case to trial within the required five-year period. The case was originally filed on April 11, 2018, and was dismissed on October 11, 2019. However, the dismissal was later vacated on November 20, 2019. Considering the six-month extension due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the court finds that the case is subject to the mandatory dismissal provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.360. As a result, the case is dismissed with prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff cannot refile the case.
