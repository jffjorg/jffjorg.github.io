And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment against Pedro Santa Cruz, and rules as follows. The plaintiff, 21st Century Insurance Company, seeks a default judgment and reimbursement for the amount it paid to its insured due to the defendant's negligence. The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the plaintiff has provided evidence to support its payment of $6,924.54 for property damages, but has not provided evidence to support its payment of $100,000.00 to the insured for medical expenses. Therefore, the court denies the application for default judgment without prejudice. The court sets an order to show cause regarding dismissal for failure to resubmit the default judgment packet on May 20, 2024.
