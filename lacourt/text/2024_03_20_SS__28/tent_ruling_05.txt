 Case Number:  BC702305    Hearing Date:   March 20, 2024    Dept:  28 On
January 25, 2024, the Court scheduled an order to show cause hearing on March
20, 2024 regarding dismissal of this case due to Plaintiff’s failure to bring
the case to trial within five years under Code of Civil Procedure section
583.310. 
Plaintiff
filed the complaint on April 11, 2018. 
The Court dismissed the action on October 11, 2019 and vacated the
dismissal on November 20, 2019.
In
light of this chronology, and considering the six-month extension resulting
from the COVID-pandemic, the Court finds that the case is subject to the mandatory
dismissal provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.360.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 583.360; see Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.310.)  The Court
dismisses the case with prejudice.
