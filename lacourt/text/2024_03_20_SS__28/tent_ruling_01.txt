  Case Number:  21STCV35153    Hearing Date:   March 20, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
September 23, 2021, Plaintiff Michelle French (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Hseuh Lee Chang (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for negligence
(including negligence per se). 
On
October 18, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service
of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on
Defendant on October 15, 2021. The statement of damages lists $5,000,000 in
general damages, “[m]edical and incidental expenses according to proof,” and
“[l]oss of [e]arnings and earning capacity according to proof.” 
On
January 3, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
February 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on
March 20, 2024. 
On
February 20, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants with prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
PARTY’S REQUEST         
Plaintiff
Michelle French asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant
Hseuh Lee Chang and award Plaintiff $5,000,000.00 in general damages and either
$4,383.35 or $4,145.06 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default
judgment 
“[With
exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter
Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following must be included in the documents
filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's
claim; 
“(2)  Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A declaration of nonmilitary status for each
defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
“(6)  A proposed form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported
by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request for attorney fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause
of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice
Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361
[trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.)  A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258, p.
5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
           Plaintiff has
provided evidence that she has experienced, and will continue to experience, significant
pain, suffering, and emotional distress due Defendant’s negligence.  As a result, Plaintiff is entitled to an
award of general damages.  The Court
concludes, however, that the evidence does not support a general damage award
of $5,000,000.00. 
Plaintiff’s
CIV-100 form includes two different cost amounts.  Section 2 of the form requests $4,383.35 in
costs while Section 7 requests $4,145.06 in costs.  Plaintiff should revise the form to make the
requests consistent. 
The
CIV-100 form requests $1,100.00 in costs for “investigation.”  Plaintiff should provide additional
information about this cost item because the Court must determine if it is
recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1003.5.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1003.5, subd. (b)(2)
[investigation expenses in preparing case for trial are not allowable as costs
except when expressly authorized by law].) 
The
Court denies the application without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Michelle French’s application for default judgment filed on February 16, 2024 without prejudice. 
The
Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Resubmit Default
Judgment Packet on May 20, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring
Street Courthouse. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
