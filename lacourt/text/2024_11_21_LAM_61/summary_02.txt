And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Robert Luna's motion for a protective order, preventing Plaintiff from taking his deposition until leave of court or unless Defendant agrees to the deposition. The judge found that Defendant has shown good cause for the protective order, as he is an apex employee at the head of a large law enforcement body and has no personal knowledge relevant to the case. The judge also noted that Plaintiff has not shown efforts to discover the same relevant information by less intrusive means, such as interrogatories or organizational deposition. The judge relied on the apex-employee doctrine, which balances the convenience of deposing high-ranking officials with the need to avoid unduly burdening them. The judge declined to rule on Defendant's new arguments for wider relief, which were not advanced in the original motion.
