And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Cookies Creative Consulting & Promotions, Inc.'s motion to extend the stay of proceedings in this case until January 1, 2025. The stay was initially granted on October 11, 2023, pending the resolution of pending arbitration between Cookies and third-party contractors. The stay was lifted on July 1, 2024, but was extended again to November 21, 2024, at the behest of Cookies. The judge found that a short extension of the stay is warranted to allow the arbitration to proceed to its conclusion, as the merits hearing is imminent and lifting the stay at this juncture would prejudice the defendants. The judge noted that the plaintiff has not articulated any prejudice resulting from the further stay, and therefore granted the motion.
