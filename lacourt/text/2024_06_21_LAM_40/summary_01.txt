Here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants in response to the plaintiffs' first amended complaint. The court sustains the demurrer as to the first cause of action, alleging elder abuse, with leave to amend. The court also overrules the demurrer as to the second cause of action, alleging negligence. The court grants the motion to strike the elder abuse prayer from the complaint, with leave to amend. The ruling is based on the allegations in the complaint, which state that Sulma was hospitalized at Lakewood Regional Medical Center (LRMC) for 37 days and that Robert, her husband, witnessed her mistreatment and neglect by LRMC staff. The court finds that the defendants' demurrer is sustained as to the first cause of action because the allegations do not show a failure to provide custodial care, but rather a negligent exposure to COVID-19 and delayed custodial care. The court overrules the demurrer as to the second cause of action because the allegations state a claim for negligence. The court grants the motion to strike the elder abuse prayer because it is irrelevant in light of the court's ruling sustaining the demurrer as to the first cause of action.
