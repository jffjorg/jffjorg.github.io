And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Daniel E. Kelly's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The motion is granted in part and denied in part. The Court finds that Plaintiff meets the procedural requirements for leave to amend, including providing a clean copy of the proposed amended pleading, a redline copy showing the differences from the original pleading, and a declaration from counsel. The Court also finds that the proposed amended pleading does not show fatal defects and that the allegations regarding Plaintiff's alleged interest in Kellytoy Worldwide Inc. stock are sufficient. However, the Court denies Plaintiff's request to add Bernald Golditch as a defendant, as the parties do not dispute that he has passed away. The Court orders Plaintiff to file the First Amended Complaint, removing Bernald Golditch as a defendant, within seven days of this ruling.
