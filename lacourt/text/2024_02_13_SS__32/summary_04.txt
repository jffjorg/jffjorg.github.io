And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the applications of Richard E. Norman and R. Martin Weber, Jr. to appear as counsel pro hac vice in the case. The applications were denied due to failures to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40, including the lack of proof of service by mail on all parties and the State Bar of California. The Court notes that Norman and Weber failed to declare regular engagement in substantial business, professional, or other activities in California, which is a requirement under the rule. The Court orders that the Plaintiffs provide notice of the ruling to all parties by February 14, 2024, and file a proof of service of such.
