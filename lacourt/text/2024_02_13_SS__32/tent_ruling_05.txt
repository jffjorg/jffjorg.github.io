MOTION
 
On June 29, 2023, Plaintiff Eduardo Saldana (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Cool Kicks CA LLC, Cool Kicks LLC, Lux Parking Systems,
Inc., Danny Habtemariam, Adeel Shams, Levon Poduryan, and Does 1 to 25 for assault,
battery, and negligence. 
 
Defendant Lux Parking Systems, Inc. (“Defendant”) now demurs to the first
cause of action in the complaint for assault and battery. Defendant also moves
to strike the prayer for punitive damages. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to
test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. 
It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the
opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter
of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is that his complaint set
forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision and with
sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and
extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149,
156-157.) 
 
On demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to
“determine whether or not the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a
cause of action under any legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.) Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
            Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
According to the Declaration of Christian
Kernkamp, Defendant met and conferred by telephone with counsel for Plaintiff
regarding the demurrer and motion to strike. Therefore, the meet and confer
requirement has been satisfied. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Assault and Battery
 
The
essential elements of a cause of action for assault are: (1) defendant acted
with intent to cause harmful or offensive contact, or threatened to touch
plaintiff in a harmful or offensive manner; (2) plaintiff reasonably believed
[he or] she was about to be touched in a harmful or offensive manner or it
reasonably appeared to plaintiff that defendant was about to carry out the
threat; (3) plaintiff did not consent to defendant’s conduct; (4) plaintiff was
harmed; and (5) defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing
plaintiff’s harm.” (So v. Shin (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 668-669.) “The essential elements of a cause of action
for battery are: (1) defendant touched plaintiff, or caused plaintiff to be
touched, with the intent to harm or offend plaintiff; (2) plaintiff did not
consent to the touching; (3) plaintiff was harmed or offended by defendant’s
conduct; and (4) a reasonable person in plaintiff’s position would have been
offended by the touching.” (Id. at 669.) 
 
An
employer is vicariously liable for an employee’s tort under the doctrine of respondeat
superior if the tort was committed within the scope of the employment.¿ (See Montague
v. AMN Healthcare, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1515, 1520.)
 
Here,
the complaint alleges that on June 23, 2022, Plaintiff was “approached by a COOL KICKS/LUX
PARKING Valet Attendant Employee.” (Complaint ¶ 16.) “Upon information and
belief, and without any justification, Defendant Employee began violently
attacking Plaintiff. Upon information and belief, Defendant Employee punched
Plaintiff’s face approximately 4-5 times with a closed fist. (Id.¶ 18–19.)
 
While Plaintiff’s complaint alleges facts that he was repeatedly
punched by Defendant’s employee, there are no facts that the employee was acting
in the scope of employment with Defendant at the time. Therefore, the demurrer
to the first cause of action is sustained with leave to amend.[1] 
 
Motion
to Strike
 
California law authorizes a party’s motion to strike matter from an
opposing party’s pleading if it is irrelevant, false, or improper. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 435; 436(a).) Motions may also target pleadings or parts of pleadings
which are not filed or drawn in conformity with applicable laws, rules or
orders. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(b).) A motion to strike is used to address
defects that appear on the face of a pleading or from judicially noticed matter
but that are not grounds for a demurrer. (Pierson v Sharp Memorial Hospital
(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 340, 342.)
 
Punitive damages may be imposed where it is proven by clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) “Malice” is conduct intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1).) “‘Punitive damages are proper only when the
tortious conduct rises to levels of extreme indifference to the plaintiff’s
rights, a level which decent citizens should not have to tolerate.’
[Citation.]” (Lackner v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1210.)
 
“As amended to include [despicable], the [Civil Code section 3294]
plainly indicates that absent an intent to injure the plaintiff, ‘malice’
requires more than a ‘willful and conscious’ disregard of the plaintiffs’
interests. The additional component of ‘despicable conduct’ must be found.” (College
Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 725.) (emphasis
added.) The statute’s reference to despicable conduct represents a “new
substantive limitation on punitive damage awards.” (Ibid.) Despicable conduct
is “conduct which is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or
loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent
people. Such conduct has been described as ‘having the character of outrage
frequently associated with crime.’” (Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co.
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1287.) Further, “[t]here must be evidence that
defendant acted with knowledge of the probable dangerous consequences to
plaintiff’s interests and deliberately failed to avoid these consequences.” (Flyer’s
Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title Ins. Co. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
1149, 1155.)
 
A motion to strike punitive damages is properly granted where a
plaintiff does not state a prima facie claim for punitive damages, including
allegations that defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. (Turman
v. Turning Point of Cent. California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
“Mere negligence, even gross negligence, is not sufficient to justify such an
award” for punitive damages. (Kendall Yacht Corp. v. United California Bank
(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 949, 958.) Moreover, conclusory allegations are not
sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. (Brousseau v. Jarrett
(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.) Lastly, “[t]he mere allegation an intentional tort was committed
is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages.  Not only must
there be circumstances of oppression, fraud, or malice, but facts must be
alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves v. Superior Court
(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166.) 
 
When seeking damages from an employer, an employer is not liable for
punitive damages arising from an employee’s actions pursuant to Civil Code
section 3294(a) unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of
the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights
or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which
the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice. (Civ. Code § 3294(b).) With respect to a corporate employer, the
advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act
of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or
managing agent of the corporation. (Id.)¿
 
Defendant moves to strike paragraph 29 of the complaint and the prayer
for punitive damages (Complaint, page 6, paragraph F). The motion to strike
paragraph 29 is moot since the demurrer for the first cause of action was
sustained. 
 
Turning to the second cause of action for negligence, Plaintiff alleges
that “a substantial factor that contributed to the beating and injuries
sustained by Plaintiff was Defendant LUX PARKING SYSTEMS, INC.’s negligent
hiring and supervision of its agent and employees (and Defendant Does].”
(Complaint ¶ 33, 35.) 
 
Here, since Defendant is a corporate employer, Plaintiff must allege facts
that an officer, director, or managing agent of Defendant had advance knowledge
of the employee’s unfitness and employed him with a conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others, or that it ratified the wrongful conduct.  Since there are no such facts in the
Complaint, the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages is granted with
leave to amend. 
 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court sustains Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s first
cause of action for battery/assault with leave to amend. Any amended complaint
must be filed within 30 days.
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to strike the prayer for punitive
damages with leave to amend.  
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
