And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to reopen discovery for a limited purpose. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Phillip Bernard and Antoinette Bernard, who were hit by a golf ball and suffered a brain injury. They seek to reopen discovery for the purpose of obtaining updated treatment records from their treating physician, Dr. Steven Storage. Defendant Bing H. “Keni” Huang opposes the motion, arguing that the proposed discovery is unnecessary and will cause undue delay.

The court finds that the motion was filed in good faith and that the information is relevant and necessary for trial. The court also finds that the parties have attempted to resolve the matter through meet and confer. The court grants the motion and orders the parties to meet and confer promptly to complete all discovery by the current trial date.
