Significant Statements:
  - "Plaintiffs have met their prima facie burden that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the liquids used by Defendants at the Car Wash caused slippery substances to drip or flow into the streets, such that it proximately caused or contributed to the incident."
  - "Defendants have not met their burden that there is no triable issue of material fact as to whether they deposited substances onto the road."
  - "Plaintiffs have submitted sufficient circumstantial evidence that the condition of liquids spilling from wet cars coming out of the Car Wash may have created a slippery condition for vehicles, and that this condition existed for years prior to the incident such that Defendants should have discovered and remedied the condition."
