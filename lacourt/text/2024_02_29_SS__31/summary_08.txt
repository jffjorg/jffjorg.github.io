And here is the summary in English text:

The Court is issuing a tentative ruling regarding a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action of a minor, Angel Dominguez. The petition is denied due to several defects. First, the petition is not properly expedited, as it exceeds the $50,000 limit. Second, the petition lacks a written retainer fee agreement. Third, the petition uses outdated forms. The Court instructs the Petitioner to file a new petition using the correct forms and providing all necessary attachments. The Petitioner must also provide a copy of the written retainer fee agreement. The Court excuses the personal appearance of the Claimant and guardian ad litem, and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The Case will be continued to a later date, and the Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
