And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motion to compel discovery responses from the plaintiff, Elio Vallecillo Rivera, to the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA). The plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to LACMTA's request for production of documents (RPDs) despite receiving multiple requests and extensions. The court finds that LACMTA properly served the discovery requests and that the plaintiff failed to provide timely responses, warranting an order compelling responses. The court also awards sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $500, which includes $1,000 in attorney's fees and $250 per hour for preparing the motion and appearing at the hearing. The court orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to LACMTA's RPDs within 15 days and to pay the sanctions within the same timeframe.
