And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Macy's to compel a second physical examination of plaintiff Armand Ramirez. The plaintiff had previously been examined by orthopedist Ronald Kvitne, M.D. in November 2022, but Macy's argues that Dr. Kvitne does not specialize in spine issues and that a second examination by a spine specialist is necessary. The judge notes that the proposed examination with spine surgeon Mark J. Spoonamore is duplicative of a proposed examination with neurosurgeon Paul Kaloostian, and that either Dr. Spoonamore or Dr. Kaloostian can conduct the examination, but not both. The judge will hear arguments on this issue at the hearing on February 29, 2024, and may adjust the ruling accordingly.
