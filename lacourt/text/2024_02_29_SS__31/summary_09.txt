Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Felix Interiano's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint (SAC) alleging that he was an employee of the defendants, G.T.O. Auto Glass Corporation, Francisco Almanza, and Emilio Rojas Almanza, when he was allegedly injured on their property. The judge found that the amendment would be a material change to Plaintiff's theory of liability against the defendants and would prejudice them, as it would require a delay in trial for further discovery. The judge also denied the defendants' motion to continue trial, as the basis for the motion was no longer relevant since the motion to amend the complaint was denied.
