And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel responses to discovery requests. The defendant, Christopher Blakney, propounded supplemental interrogatories on October 9, 2023, but the plaintiff, Daniel Romero Garcia, failed to respond. Despite being served with a request for responses, the plaintiff has not provided any answers. The defendant has moved the court for an order compelling the plaintiff to provide responses to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions. As no opposition has been filed, the court has granted the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to the defendant's supplemental interrogatory within 15 days. The court has also imposed sanctions of $455.34 against the plaintiff and their attorney, jointly and severally, to be paid within 15 days. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if they intend to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court by February 29, 2024.
