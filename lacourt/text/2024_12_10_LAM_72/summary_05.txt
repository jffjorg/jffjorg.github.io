And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike the request for exemplary (punitive) damages in a complaint filed by Jennifer Kleinschmidt against Vista Del Pacifico Properties, LLC. The complaint alleges that the defendant's negligence and breach of contract led to a ceiling collapse in Kleinschmidt's home, causing physical and emotional injuries, and that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences but failed to take corrective measures. The Judge denies the motion to strike, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to state a claim for punitive damages under California Civil Code section 3294. The Judge notes that the pleadings are similar to those in Penner v. Falk (1984), which allowed a punitive damages claim to stand. The Judge concludes that the defendant's attempted distinctions are not persuasive, and that the plaintiff's allegations meet the clear and convincing standard required for a punitive damages claim.
