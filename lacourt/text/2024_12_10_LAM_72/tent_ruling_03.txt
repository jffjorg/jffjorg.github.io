The Court denies the request for sanctions.
 
Background
 
This is a construction contract case. The following facts
are taken from the allegations of the FAC, which the Court accepts as true for
the purposes of the demurrer.
 
Plaintiff alleges that he is a general contractor with a C33
license and a license number of 1088199 with the City of Los Angeles, the
County of Los Angeles. Plaintiff alleges that he maintained his license from at
least the period of December 5, 2023 to March 31, 2024. (SAC ¶ 5.) Plaintiff
attaches an exhibit to the SAC indicating that his license was set to expire on
March 31, 2024. (Complaint, Unnumbered Exhibit.) Plaintiff alleges that his
license subsequently expired and was inactive for one to two months before
Plaintiff renewed it. (SAC ¶ 5, Exhibit.)
 
On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff entered into a written
agreement whereby Plaintiff agreed to remodel Defendants’ home in exchange for
$315,000.00, including labor and materials.
 
Defendants paid Plaintiff a total of $200,000.00 in
installment payments.
 
Plaintiff alleges that he completed 80 percent of the
construction, leaving only 20 percent of the construction to be completed.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants owe him the remaining $115,000.00 under the
agreement.
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Go said, in the presence of
other workers, that Plaintiff’s work was like a “dog shit” and that it
“deserves to be demolished with a hammer”. (SAC ¶ 11.) Plaintiff alleges that
he has lost business income as a result of Go’s statements.
 
Plaintiff alleges that Kim owned a large dog. Plaintiff
alleges that, while Kim was away from her home that was being remodeled, she
asked Plaintiff to feed the dog. Plaintiff alleges that, while feeding the dog,
he was suddenly bitten on his left thigh, causing injuries which required
medical treatment and caused disfigurement.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on May 17, 2024. 
 
On May 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”).
 
On August 29, 2024, the Court sustained Defendants’ demurrer
to the FAC with leave to amend.
 
The operative Complaint is now the SAC against Defendants,
which raises claims for (1) breach of contract; (2) slander per se; and (3) dog
bit statute, Civil Code, section 3342.
 
Defendants demurred to the SAC on November 1, 2024.
Plaintiff filed an opposition and Defendants filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
Breach of Contract – First Claim
 
To state a cause of action for
breach of contract, a plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of
the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)
51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)

 
If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of
a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the
complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated
by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman
& Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances, a
plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its
precise language.” (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.)
 
“To protect the public, the Contractors' State License Law
(CSLL; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7000 et seq.) imposes strict and harsh
penalties for a contractor's failure to maintain proper licensure. Among other
things, the CSLL states a general rule that, regardless of the merits of the
claim, a contractor may not maintain any action, legal or equitable, to recover
compensation for ‘the performance of any act or contract’ unless he or she was
duly licensed ‘at all times during the performance of that act or contract.’ ”
(MW Erectors, Inc. v. Niederhauser Ornamental & Metal Works Co., Inc.
(2005) 36 Cal.4th 412, 418, quoting Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7031, subd. (a).))
 
In their demurrer to the FAC, Defendants provide a Verified
Certificate of Non-Licensed Status for Steven Youngsuk Yun dba Lohi General
Construction, which is judicially noticeable as a public record. The
certificate indicates that no record was found to indicate that Plaintiff was
licensed as a California contractor under the laws administered by the
Contractors State License Board for the period of January 1, 2022 to July 9,
2024.
 
Plaintiff alleges that he entered into the contract that
gives rise to this case on December 5, 2023. Plaintiff alleges that he
maintained his license from at least the period of December 5, 2023 to March
31, 2024. (SAC ¶ 5.) Plaintiff attaches an exhibit to the SAC indicating that a
license for a company called “Lohi Contruction Inc.” was set to expire on March
31, 2024. (Complaint, Exhibit.) Plaintiff alleges that his license subsequently
expired and was inactive for one to two months before Plaintiff renewed it.
(SAC ¶ 5, Exhibit.)  
 
The entity which Plaintiff claims to have been licensed,
however, is not the plaintiff in this action. 
The plaintiff here is “Steven Yun, d/b/a Lohi General
Construction.”  Plaintiff asserts that
the licensed entity was a company called “Lohi Construction, Inc.”  Because the plaintiff in this action was
admittedly not licensed, the Court sustains the demurrer without leave to
amend.
 
Slander Per Se – Second Claim
 
“The elements of a defamation claim are (1) a publication
that is (2) false, (3) defamatory, (4) unprivileged, and (5) has a natural
tendency to injure or causes special damage. The defamatory statement must
specifically refer to, or be of and concerning, the plaintiff.” (John Doe 2 v. Superior Court (2016) 1
Cal.App.5th 1300, 1312 [quotation marks and citation omitted].)
 
            Defamatory statements can be either
libel or slander. (Civ. Code, § 44.) Libel is written communication that is
false, that is not protected by any privilege, and that exposes a person to contempt
or ridicule or certain other reputational injuries. (Civ. Code §45.) Slander is
a false unprivileged oral communication attributing to a person specific
misdeeds or certain unfavorable characteristics or qualities or uttering
certain other derogatory statements regarding a person, such as one which by
natural consequence causes actual damage. (Civ. Code § 46.)

 
            “A
slander that falls within the first four subdivisions of Civil Code section 46
is slander per se and require no proof of actual damages.” (Regalia v. The
Nethercutt Collection (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 361, 367.) A statement is
slander per se if it:
 
“1.
Charges any person with crime, or with having been indicted, convicted, or
punished for crime;
 
2.
Imputes in him the present existence of an infectious, contagious, or loathsome
disease;
 
3.
Tends directly to injure him in respect to his office, profession, trade or
business, either by imputing to him general disqualification in those respects
which the office or other occupation peculiarly requires, or by imputing
something with reference to his office, profession, trade, or business that has
a natural tendency to lessen its profits; [or]
 
4. Imputes to
him impotence or a want of chastity[.]”
 
(Civ. Code, § 46.)
 
            “Because
the statement must contain a provable falsehood, courts distinguish between
statements of fact and statements of opinion for purposes of defamation
liability. Although statements of fact may be actionable as libel, statements
of opinion are constitutionally protected.” (McGarry v. University of San
Diego (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 97, 112.) 
“Determining whether a particular communication is actionable can be
difficult, and ‘what constitutes a statement of fact in one context may be
treated as a statement of opinion in another, , 
in light of the nature and content of the communication taken as a
whole.”  (Sumit Bank v. Rogers (2012)
206 Cal.App.4th 669, 698, quoting Gregory v. McDonnell Douglas Corp.(1976)
17 Cal.3d 596, 601.)  Courts must apply
“a totality of the circumstances test pursuant to which we consider both the
language of the statement itself and the context in which it is made.”  (Summit Bank 206 Cal.App.4th at p.
696.)
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Go said, in the presence of
other workers, that Plaintiff’s work was like a “dog shit” and that it
“deserves to be demolished with a hammer”. (SAC ¶ 11.) Plaintiff alleges that
he has lost business income as a result of Go’s statements.
 
Defendants argue that Go’s statements were not factual
statements. The Court cannot determine this issue at the pleading stage but
must consider both the language and the context in which it is made.  Depending on the context, a  reasonable person could conclude that Go’s
statements were meant to convey that Plaintiff’s work was of bad quality. Go’s
alleged statements would tend to injure Plaintiff in respect to his profession
or trade.  Defendants  have not presented the Court with any case
law in which similar statements denigrating the quality of a laborer’s
workmanship is protected opinion.
 
The Court therefore overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
Sanctions
 
The Court does not grant sanctions.
