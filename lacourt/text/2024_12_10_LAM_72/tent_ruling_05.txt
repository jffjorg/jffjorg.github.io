  Number:  6



 
 
 
On September 30, 2024, Defendant Vista Del
Pacifico Properties, LLC (“Defendant”) filed a motion to strike the request for
exemplary (punitive) damages in the complaint filed by Plaintiff Jennifer
Kleinschmidt (“Plaintiff”).  
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion.
 
Background
 
            Plaintiff’s complaint, filed June 27, 2024, alleges
causes of action for (1) premises liability, (2) negligence, (3) breach of
contract, and (4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing.
 
            Plaintiff
alleges that she was at home, recovering from surgery for a brain tumor, when
her ceiling crashed without warning in on top of her.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 5-6.)  Plaintiff alleges that she suffered physical
and emotional injuries, and that she had to get rid of most of her belongings
as they were broken or rendered useless by being coated with dust and
detritus.  (Id. at ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff was forced from her home for more
than a week for repairs.  (Id. at ¶ 8.)
 
Legal Standard
 
The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for
a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper
matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. § 436.)
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by
way of judicial notice. (Id. § 437.)
California
Civil Code section 3294 authorizes the recovery of punitive damages “[i]n an
action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence
that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice . . .
.”  (Civ. Code § 3294(a), emphasis
added.) “Malice” is defined as conduct intended to cause injury to a person or
despicable conduct carried on with a willful and conscious disregard for the
rights or safety of others. (Turman v.
Turning Point of Cent. Cal., Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
“Oppression” means despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust
hardship, in conscious disregard of the person’s rights. (Ibid.) “Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or
concealment of a material fact known by defendant, with intent to deprive a
person of property, rights or otherwise cause injury. (Ibid.) Conclusory allegations, devoid of any factual assertions,
are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted with oppression,
fraud or malice. (Smith v. Superior Court
(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.)  
Here, Plaintiff requests “Exemplary
damages, in an amount to be determined at trial, sufficient to punish
Defendants and deter Defendants and other members of the public from engaging
in such conduct in the future.” 
(Complaint, p. 7.)  Defendant
moves to strike this request.
 
Discussion
 
In order to state a claim
for punitive damages, a plaintiff must allege facts that establish, by clear
and convincing evidence, that the defendant has engaged in oppression, fraud or
malice that constitutes despicable conduct. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a); Stewart
v. Truck Ins. Exchange (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 468, 482). Conclusory
allegations that seek punitive damages are improper; rather a plaintiff must
allege specific facts that meet the clear and convincing standard as set forth
in California Civil Code section 3294. A plaintiff must allege that the
defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice, for example, that the
defendant had the intent to inflict injury or destroy reputation. (Smith v.
Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1041-1042; G.D. Searle v.
Superior Court (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 22, 28-29 (G.D. Searle).) 
 
General pleadings are not
sufficient, but rather specific facts are required in order to support a claim
for punitive damages. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th
1033, 1041-42). “When the plaintiff alleges an intentional wrong, a prayer for exemplary damage may be supported by
pleading that the wrong was committed willfully or with a design to injure.” (G.D.
Searle, supra, 49 Cal.App.3d at p. 29). 
 
“In order to justify an
award of punitive damages on this basis, the plaintiff must establish that the
defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and
he wilfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences. [Citation
omitted.]” (Blegen v. Superior Court (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 959, 962-963,
citing Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 895-896.) 
 
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged
facts to state that defendant was aware of the probable dangerous
consequences.  Specifically, she alleges
that “even though the collapse came without immediate warning, it was
absolutely foreseeable that its collapse could and would happen.  Months prior, Ms. Kleinschmidt brought to the
building manager’s attention a crack that had been formed in the ceiling, and
she expressed her concerns that the celling might be unsafe.  However, nothing at all was done in response
to those concerns.”  (Complaint ¶
9.)  These allegations makes the case
similar enough to Penner v. Falk (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 858 to allow the
punitive damages claim to stand, at least at the pleading stage. 
 
In Penner, the Court of Appeal
reversed the trial court order striking the punitive damages where the
“pleadings sufficiently allege facts setting forth long existing physical
conditions of the premises which portend dangers for the tenants.  The pleadings also set out that respondents
knew of those conditions for up to two years, had power to make changes, but
failed to take corrective and curative measures.”  (Id. at p. 867.) Defendants’ attempted
distinctions of Penner are not persuasive in the context of this case.
 
For these reasons, the Court denies
the motion.
