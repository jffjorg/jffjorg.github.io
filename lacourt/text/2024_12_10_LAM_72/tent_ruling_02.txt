Cross-Defendants Brad Hakala and The Hakala Law
Group, P.C., a California Corporation (“Hakala”) move the Court for an order
sustaining their demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint of Cross-Complainants
Sabrina Rindels and Prestige Global Solutions, LLC (“Rindels”), without leave
to amend.  The hearing is set on December
10, 2024.
 
The Court SUSTAINS WITH LEAVE TO AMEND Hakala’s
demurrer to the  first, second and third
causes of action of the First Amended Cross-Complaint.  
 
The Court GRANTS the motion to strike with leave
to amend as to the punitive damages claim. 
 
Background
 
According to the second amended complaint, in April of 2018,
Plaintiff Englander, a managing member of Plaintiff EG, was referred to
Defendant Rindels in order to acquire CBD Isolate. (SAC, ¶ 12.) The referral
came from Brad Hakala (“Hakala”), Plaintiff Englander’s attorney. (Id.) The
Complaint alleges that Defendant Rindels assured Plaintiff Englander that she
had experience in delivering CBD Isolate. (Id.) Because there was a minimum
order of 300 kilograms of CBD Isolate to secure a price point, Plaintiff
Englander called a friend to agree to purchase 100 kilograms for $520,000.00,
which was wired to Hakala’s trust account. 
(SAC, ¶ 14.)  After establishing a
delivery date, Plaintiff EG and Defendant Prestige entered into an oral
Purchase and Sales Agreement (the “Agreement”) where Plaintiff EG would
exchange $1,237,500.00 for 225 kilograms of CBD. (SAC, ¶¶ 16-17.) Plaintiff EG
wired another $1,237,500.00 to the Hakala Law Group, P.C., based on the
representation that Defendant Prestige would deliver the 225 kilograms of CBD
on or before April 21, 2018. (SAC, ¶ 17.)  Here, the Complaint alleges that Defendant
Prestige received the money, and that after receipt, Defendant Rindels assured
Plaintiff Englander that she would deliver the CBD Isolate, however the
delivery never came. (Complaint, ¶¶ 18-21.) 
Plaintiff Englander and Plaintiff EG (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed
a Complaint on March 27, 2023, alleging three causes of action: (1) Breach of
Contract, (2) Fraud – Intentional Misrepresentation, and (3) Negligent Misrepresentation.
            
            Rindels and her company, Prestige Global
Solutions, LLC then filed a Cross-Complaint against Hakala and his law firm,
The Hakala Law Group, alleging that Hakala was not just legal representation
but also a business partner in the transaction, and that Hakala had violated
the explicit and implicit terms of his partnership and legal agreements with
Rindels.  (FAXC, ¶ 1.)  Rindels states in her Cross-Complaint that
she and Hakala had in 2017 entered into a verbal agreement to form a
partnership, and their joint venture would focus on procuring and facilitating
deals in cannabis and cannabidiol (“CBD isolate”).  (FAXC, ¶ 15.) 
The operative complaint is the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed on May
9, 2024 against Cross-Defendants Hakala alleging causes of action for (1) equitable
indemnity, (2) fraud by intentional misrepresentation, (3) fraud by
concealment, (4) breach of contract, and (5) breach of fiduciary duty by
attorney.  Hakala demurs as to the first
three causes of action, alleging that they fail to state facts sufficient to
state claims upon which relief can be granted.
            
Legal Standard
 
             Demurrer 
 
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the
allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v.
Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only
to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or
from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not
consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not
accepted for the truth of their contents].) For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not
“sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”]; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108
Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 [“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to
amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under
any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by
amendment.”]; Vaccaro v. Kaiman
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768 [“When the defect which justifies striking a
complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to amend.”].) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
 
            Equitable
Indemnity—First Cross-Claim
 
“To
state a claim for equitable indemnity, a defendant must allege the same harm
for which he may be held liable is properly attributable—at least in part—to
the cross-defendant.” (Platt v. Coldwell
Banker Residential Real Estate Services (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1439, 1445,
fn.7.)   The principle behind equitable indemnity is to
allocate loss among multiple tortfeasors on a comparative fault basis. (BFGC Architects Planners, Inc. v.
Forcum/Mackey Construction, Inc. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 848, 852 ["The
doctrine applies only among defendants who are jointly and severally liable to
the plaintiff."].) There must be some basis for tort liability against the
proposed indemnitor (Hakala). (Id.)  
The
FAXC does not allege a basis for tort liability against Hakala for Plaintiff’s
injuries.  Rindel argues that the
doctrine of equitable indemnity is broader than that, citing language in the
case law stating that a claim to indemnify may arise “when in equity and good
conscience the burden of the judgment should be shifted from the shoulders of
the person seeking indemnity to the one from whom indemnity is sought.”. (Fireman’s Fund Ins Co. v. Haslam (1994)
29 Cal.App.4th 1347, 1353-1354.) Such general statements notwithstanding, the
Court is unaware of law stating that equitable indemnity applies to a fact
pattern similar to the one alleged in the complaint.  Neither the case law cited by Rindel nor the allegations
in the current complaint explain or support why this case presents an equitable
indemnity claim.
            For this reason, the Court sustain the demurrer but
grants Rindel leave to amend and clarify this claim. 
 
            Fraud
by Intentional Misrepresentation—Second Cross-Claim
 
“The
elements of a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation are (1) a
misrepresentation, (2) with knowledge of its falsity, (3) with the intent to
induce another’s reliance on the misrepresentation, (4) actual and justifiable
reliance, and (5) resulting damage.” (Daniels
v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.) The
facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically
as to every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the
pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) To properly allege fraud
against a corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the names of the persons
allegedly making the false representations, their authority to speak, to whom
they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)
Here,
none of the allegations in this cause of action are plead with the required
specificity, and they also fail to allege facts that plead the required
elements of reliance and resulting damage. 
(FAXC, ¶¶ 55-63.)  Accordingly, the Court sustains the
demurrer with leave to amend.
 
            Fraud
by Concealment—Third Cross-Claim
 
“The elements of fraud are (a) a
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce reliance; (d)
justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Ctr. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)
The facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and
specifically as to every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal
construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 645.) To properly
allege fraud against a corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the names of the
persons allegedly making the false representations, their authority to speak,
to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)
Similarly,
this cause of action fails as Rindels has failed to allege sufficient facts with
the required specificity as to what material facts are alleged to have been
concealed or suppressed, with intent to defraud, Rindels’ unawareness of those
specific facts, and reliance on the concealment, and that Rindels sustained
damage on the account of the allegedly suppressed facts.  (FAXC, ¶¶64-73.)  For this reason, the Court sustains the
demurrer to this claim with leave to amend.
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
In
a separate motion, Hakala requests that the court strike Cross-Complainant’s
requests for punitive damages and declaratory relief.
Legal Standard
The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for
a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper
matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. § 436.)
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by
way of judicial notice. (Id. § 437.)
California
Civil Code section 3294 authorizes the recovery of punitive damages “[i]n an
action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence
that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice . . .
.”  (Civ. Code § 3294(a), emphasis
added.) “Malice” is defined as conduct intended to cause injury to a person or
despicable conduct carried on with a willful and conscious disregard for the
rights or safety of others. (Turman v.
Turning Point of Cent. Cal., Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
“Oppression” means despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust
hardship, in conscious disregard of the person’s rights. (Ibid.) “Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or
concealment of a material fact known by defendant, with intent to deprive a
person of property, rights or otherwise cause injury. (Ibid.) Conclusory allegations, devoid of any factual assertions,
are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted with oppression,
fraud or malice. (Smith v. Superior Court
(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.)  
Discussion
Here,
the Court has sustained the demurrer as to the claims of action based on fraud,
as specific facts have not been plead as to fraud. The breach of fiduciary duty
claim, as pled, does not currently support a claim for punitive damages. The
Court therefore GRANTS the motion to strike the request for punitive damages,
but does so with leave to amend if Rindels amends the claims of the
cross-complaint.
            As to Rindels’s request for declaratory relief, “To
qualify for declaratory relief, a party would have to demonstrate its action
presented two essential elements: (1) a proper subject of declaratory relief,
and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the
party’s rights or obligations.” (Jolley
v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909, quotation marks
and brackets omitted.)   A cause of
action for declaratory relief should not be used as a second cause of action
for the determination of identical issues raised in another cause of action. (General of America Insurance Co. v. Lilly
(1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470.) “The availability of another form of relief
that is adequate will usually justify refusal to grant declaratory relief” (California Insurance Guarantee Association
v. Superior Court (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1617, 1624), and a duplicative
cause of action is subject to demurrer (Palm
Springs Villas II Homeowners Association, Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248
Cal.App.4th 268, 290). Further, “there is no basis for declaratory relief where
only past wrongs are involved.” (Osseous
Technologies of America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners LLC (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 357, 366, quotation marks omitted.) 

Rindels
has not established a proper subject of declaratory relief, or that other forms
of relief will not be adequate.  In
addition, this case only involves past wrongs. 
The motion to strike the request for declaratory relief is GRANTED.
