And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on plaintiff Yauheni Klimkou's motion for attorney fees and costs against defendant Porsche Cars North America, Inc. The plaintiff seeks to recover $80,383.60 in attorney fees and costs, while the defendant objects to some of the plaintiff's evidence and claims excessive billing.

The judge has accepted the plaintiff's hourly rate of $470 per hour, which is slightly lower than the requested rate of $500 per hour. The judge has also accepted the plaintiff's calculation of 122.1 hours of attorney fees, but has reduced the lodestar by 2.7 hours due to excessive billing for administrative tasks.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a 30% lodestar enhancement, finding that the case did not involve novel or difficult questions and that the plaintiff's counsel did not demonstrate exceptional skill in litigating the case.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs in part, awarding the plaintiff $57,136.60 in attorney fees and other expenses.
