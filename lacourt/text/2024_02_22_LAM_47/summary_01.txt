Summary:

The Tentative Ruling grants Plaintiff Juliana Garcia's Motion for Attorney's Fees in the amount of $1,816,095. The Court finds that the reasonableness of the fee request is supported by evidence of the attorneys' skills, knowledge, and experience. The Court also reduces the multiplier from 3.0 to 2.0, resulting in an additional award of $908,047.50. The Court declines to rule on the issue of costs at this time and will address it in a forthcoming ruling on the pending Motion to Tax Costs.
