STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
This is a wrongful death and survivor action.  Plaintiff alleges that the decedent, Robert
Thacker, suffered neglect while he was a resident at Southland Living and died
because of Defendant’s negligence and elder neglect.  
 
Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees
and costs. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $1,816,095 in attorney’s
fees.
 
            The Court
will address Plaintiff’s request for costs in its ruling on the pending Motion
to Tax Costs. 
DISCUSSION:
 
            Plaintiff
moves for an award of attorney’s fees and costs as the prevailing party in this
action in the amount of $2,724,142.50 in fees and $77,744.94 in costs. 
 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court take judicial notice of several documents in support of
the Reply brief. As these documents are not material to the Court’s ruling,
Plaintiff’s requests are DENIED. (Gbur v. Cohen
(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 296, 301 (“[J]udicial notice . . . is always confined to
those matters which are relevant to the issue at hand.”].) 
 
Entitlement to Fees
 
            Attorney
fee awards in elder abuse cases are governed by Welfare & Institutions Code
section 15657. This statute states in pertinent part:
 
Where it is proven by clear and
convincing evidence that a defendant is liable for physical abuse as defined in
Section 15610.63, or neglect as defined in Section 15610.57, and that the
defendant has been guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in the
commission of this abuse, the following shall apply, in addition to all other
remedies otherwise provided by law: 
 
(a) The court shall award to the
plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. The term “costs” includes, but
is not limited to, reasonable fees for the services of a conservator, if any,
devoted to the litigation of a claim brought under this article.
 
(Welf & Inst. Code § 15657.) 
 
            On January
22, 2024, the Court entered judgment on a special jury verdict in which the
jury found Defendants jointly and severally liable on all causes of action, and
that they acted with recklessness in their failure to use reasonable care to
protect the Decedent from health and safety hazards. (See Plaintiffs’ Exh. 1.) Plaintiff
Juliana Garcia is therefore entitled to attorney’s fees in her capacity as
successor in interest to Robert Thacker on the elder abuse cause of action. 
 
Reasonableness of
Fees
 
            Plaintiff requests a fee award of
$2,724,142.50, based on total fees in
the amount of $908,047.50 on 1,853 hours incurred, plus a 3x multiplier for a
total of $2,724,142.50.
 
Reasonable
attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the Court and shall be an element of the
costs of suit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B).) Reasonable attorney’s fees
are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to the “lodestar” method, i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999,
1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time
spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a
determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)
In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the
“fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for
similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the
fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
 
The Court has broad discretion in
determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be
overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law,
or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)  The
Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258,
274-275.)
 
1.      Base
Fee Requests
 
            Plaintiff
requests a base fee award of $908,047.50
on 1,853 hours of attorney, incurred across the entire case at hourly rates
ranging from $150 to $750 per hour. 
 
            Plaintiff has provided an itemized
list of all hours incurred by each lawyer in this action describing the tasks
performed, the dates of those tasks, and the total hours, including hourly
rates and total fees. (See Declaration of Lisa Trinh Flint ISO Mot. Exh. 3.) Attorneys
Michael Moran and Lisa Flint testify to their skills, training, and experience,
and to the skills and experience of the attorneys employed by Moran Law and the
veracity of their billing records. (See Declaration of Michael F. Moran ISO
Mot. ¶¶ 3-11, see also Flint Decl. ¶¶ 2-8.) Attorneys Albert Villaneda and Dean
Ogrin testify as to their skills and experience, and to the veracity of their
billing records as employees of McGee Lerer & Associates. (See, e.g.,
Declaration of Albert Villaneda ISO Mot. ¶ 2-10.) Plaintiffs justify their
hourly rates as reasonable based on their experience and by comparison to the
Laffey Matrix, a standard source for determining comparable hourly
rates. (Syers Props. III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691,
702.)
 
            Defendants first challenge the base
fee request as improperly seeking fees on behalf of the McGee Lerer attorneys,
whom, Defendants claim, only provided legal services as to the wrongful death
cause of action. Defendants’ argument is based entirely on Attorneys Villaneda
and Ogrin describing themselves as counsel for Juliana Garcia. (See, e.g.,
Villaneda Decl. ¶ 1.) First, these declarations are weak evidence that the
McGee firm was retained only for the wrongful death claims since Juliana Garcia
is the Plaintiff both in her individual capacity and as successor in interest.
Thus, it is not necessarily improper to describe Ms. Garcia simply as Plaintiff.
Second, all of Plaintiff’s claims arose out of the same common factual nucleus,
such that allocation in the manner Defendants demand is inappropriate. (See,
e.g., Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 70 Cal.App.4th
1127, 1132.) 
 
            Defendants
also contend that the Laffey Matrix is not competent evidence for the
reasonableness of the hourly rates of Plaintiff’s counsel. This argument relies
entirely on non-binding federal opinions which directly contravene binding California
opinions which find the Laffey Matrix as an appropriate metric for comparison. 
 
            Finally,
Defendants assert that the Court should reduce the hourly rate of Plaintiff’s
counsel to mirror the rates billed by Defendants’ counsel, citing two cases
which they claim support this position. Defendants are incorrect. For example, Defendants
claim that Deane Gardenhome Association v. Denktas states that the Court
may consider defense counsel’s hourly rates. (Deane Gardenhome Association
v. Denktas (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1399.) The opinion offers negligible
support for this position as it states only:
 
We next consider briefly the
Association's alternative argument that "zero" is a reasonable amount
of attorney fees to be awarded: preposterous! The Association itself documented
its own demand of more than $16,000 in attorney fees prior to trial.
Indeed, the Association is seeking its attorney fees on this appeal.
 
(Id. [emphasis in original].) Similarly, although
Defendants offer In re Tobacco Cases I for the position that an
opponent’s hourly rate is probative of the reasonableness of a fee request,
that opinion contains no discussion of the hourly rate, only of the total hours
incurred, which Defendants have not challenged. (In re Tobacco Cases I
(2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 570, 584.) Defendants have not demonstrated that their
own hourly rate is a useful metric of the reasonable hourly rate.
 
            Upon review
of the evidence presented, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated
the reasonableness of their hourly rate and the total hours incurred. 
 
2.      Fee
Multiplier
 
            Plaintiff
requests that the lodestar be enhanced by a multiplier of 3, which would result
in an additional award of $1,816,095.  Plaintiff contends that this multiplier is
reasonable considering the contingent nature of this action, Plaintiff’s
counsel’s experience and knowledge, the difficulty of this litigation, and the
favorable result achieved for Plaintiff. 
            Multipliers
for successful representation on a contingency basis have frequently been
awarded. (See, e.g., Santana v. FCA US LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334,
352.) Such multipliers are entirely discretionary and may be based on
contingent risk or exceptional skill. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1138-39.) 
 
            Plaintiffs
contend that such a substantial fee multiplier is warranted by the contingent
nature of this litigation, the length and difficulty of the jury trial, and the
initial verdict awarding Plaintiff over $1,000,000 in noneconomic damages, even
though that amount had to be reduced to comply with the statute.  Plaintiff contends that this result is
indicative of exceptional skill which warrants a multiplier.  
 
            Defendants
argue that no multiplier should be imposed because “the legal, evidentiary, and
factual issues were neither novel nor particularly difficult.” (See Opp.
p.7:11-12.) Mere assertions of Defendants’ counsel are not evidence, and the
Court is not persuaded that this case was so straightforward that a multiplier
is not appropriate.  Further, the Court
agrees with Plaintiffs that certain aspects of this litigation warrant an
enhancement, including the tenacious defense mounted by Defendant, the barrage
of evidentiary objections posed by Defendants in advance of trial and
throughout, and Plaintiff’s burden of proving elder neglect under a clear and
convincing standard.  Of even greater
force, moreover, is that Plaintiff’s counsel litigated this case vigorously and
with great skill and devotion on a contingent basis with no guaranty that they
would recover any fees for their substantial efforts on Plaintiff’s
behalf.      
 
            That said,
although the Court concurs that Plaintiffs’ counsel displayed exceptional skill
and litigated this case in a manner that embraced the risk inherent in
contingent representation, the Court finds that a 3.0 multiplier cannot be
justified by the attorneys’ skills. Plaintiff’s counsel employed numerous
attorneys with extensive experience and expertise, but the level of skill
displayed is already reflected in large part by the hourly rates approved by
the Court and number of hours include in the lodestar calculation.  The Court agrees, however, that the result
obtained is extremely favorable and that Plaintiffs’ counsel shouldered
substantial risks in vigorously prosecuting this case for more than four years
and taking it to trial in the face of established legal standards that required
proof by clear and convincing evidence on Plaintiff’s central claim. The Court
will therefore reduce the multiplier to 2.0, for an additional $908,047.50 in
fees and a final total of $1,816,095.
 
Costs
 
            Plaintiff
also requests an award of costs pursuant to a Memorandum of Costs. As
Defendants have challenged this memorandum by way of a Motion to Tax Costs, the
Court declines to rule on the issue of costs at this time. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $1,816,095 in attorney’s
fees.
 
            The Court will
address Plaintiff’s request for costs in its ruling on the pending Motion to
Tax Costs. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
