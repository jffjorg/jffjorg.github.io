And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the motion for appointment of a receiver over Dragonfly Holding Corp. and Holistic Mental Health LC. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case for the appointment of a receiver. The court notes that there are ongoing investigations and factual disputes between the parties that may need an evidentiary hearing to resolve. The court also notes that the defendant has retained a computer forensics firm to preserve electronic records and that the plaintiff will continue to have access to the companies' financial records. The court suggests that the parties discuss a potential stipulation to a preliminary injunction that would enjoin the defendant from practicing medicine and from holding himself out as a licensed medical doctor.
