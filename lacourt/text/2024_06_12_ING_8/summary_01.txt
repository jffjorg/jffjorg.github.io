And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for leave to file an amended answer. The defendants, Angour Corporation and Amir H. Amiri, seek to amend their original answer to address new allegations raised by the plaintiff, Nancy Jarmen Betlazar, individually and as trustee of the Betlazar Family Trust. The defendants' motion is supported by the plaintiff, who has stipulated to the requested relief. The judge notes that the defendants have complied with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324(a) by including a copy of the proposed amendment and stating which allegations are proposed to be deleted or added. However, the defendants did not provide a separate declaration as required by Rule 3.1324(b). Despite this, the judge is granting the motion because the plaintiff has stipulated to the filing of an amended answer. The defendants are ordered to file the amended answer as a stand-alone document within 5 court days.
