Summary in English text:

The Judge, Maurice Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike or tax costs filed by Defendant Kia America, Inc. in a lemon law action brought by Plaintiff Mariana Olivares. The Plaintiff is seeking to recover costs related to the litigation, including filing and motion fees, deposition costs, service of process, court reporter fees, and other costs. The Defendant disputes the reasonableness of certain costs.

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion to strike or tax costs in part, taxing a total of $1,952.00 from the Plaintiff's claimed costs. The Judge allows the Plaintiff to recover $4,700.00 in costs for court reporter fees, but reduces the amount to $4,700.00 from the originally claimed $5,000.00. The Judge also strikes $1,652.00 in "other" charges from Item 13 in the Plaintiff's memorandum of costs. The Judge declines to award attorneys' fees to the Plaintiff at this time, but notes that the Plaintiff may file a separate motion for fees. The motion is otherwise denied.
