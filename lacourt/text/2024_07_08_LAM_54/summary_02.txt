And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the moving papers, opposition, and reply in this wrongful termination case. The defendant moves to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, dated June 25, 2018. The agreement provides that any disputes arising out of or relating to the employee's employment with the company shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration.

The court finds that the defendant has demonstrated the existence of an arbitration agreement. The plaintiff argues that the agreement is invalid under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021, but the court finds that the plaintiff's claims are not subject to this act.

The plaintiff also argues that the agreement is unconscionable, citing procedural and substantive unconscionability. However, the court finds that the degree of procedural unconscionability is low, and the agreement is enforceable.

Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stays the proceedings. The defendant is ordered to give notice to the plaintiff. If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, they should email the courtroom with notice to opposing counsel or self-represented party before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
