BACKGROUND
            
This
is a lemon law action arising from Plaintiff Mariana Olivares’s purchase of an
allegedly defective 2018 Kia Stinger. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Except as otherwise provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled
as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) “The right to recover . . . costs is determined
entirely by statute.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 44, 71.) “In ruling upon a motion to tax costs, the trial court’s
first determination is whether the statute expressly allows the particular item
and whether it appears proper on its face.” (Ibid.) “If so, the burden
is on the objecting party to show the costs to be unnecessary or unreasonable.”
(Ibid.) “Where costs are not expressly allowed by the statute, the
burden is on the party claiming the costs to show that the charges were
reasonable and necessary.”  (Ibid.)
“Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a
question of fact for the trial court.” (Ibid., internal quotations
omitted.) Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5(c)(4) gives a court discretion to
allow or deny a claimed cost where it is not explicitly allowed or prohibited
by Section 1033.5.
 
A. Filing and Motion
Fees (Item 1)
 
            Plaintiff claims $718.30 in filing
and motion fees. Defendant contends that only $435.00 is recoverable. 
 
            Filing
and motion fees are allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(1).) Defendant has not met its burden in challenging the reasonableness of
such costs. Defendant merely argues in a conclusory manner that such costs were
not reasonably incurred. 
 
B. Deposition Costs
(Item 4)   
 
“Taking, video recording, and transcribing necessary
depositions, including an original and one copy of those taken by the claimant
and one copy of depositions taken by the party against whom costs are allowed”
are allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(3)(A).) 
 
            Plaintiff has substantiated her
deposition costs in her memorandum of costs and the declaration of her counsel.
Defendant has not met its burden in challenging the reasonableness of such
costs. Again, Defendant argues in a conclusory manner, without setting forth
any facts as to the unreasonableness of such costs. 
 
C. Service of Process
(Item 5) 
 
            Costs
for service of process are recoverable. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(4).)
“Ordinary witness fees pursuant to Section 68093 of the Government Code” are
also recoverable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(7).) 
 
            Defendant
has not met its burden in challenging these costs. Plaintiff has provided
documentation; Plaintiff’s counsel also attests to the reasonableness and
necessity of the costs.  
 
D. Court Reporter Fees (Item 12)  
 
            Plaintiff’s
invoice shows that Plaintiff only incurred court reporter fees of $4,700.00,
not $5,000.00 as stated in the memorandum of costs. Counsel states that
Plaintiff hired court reporters to transcribe certain court hearings. 
 
            Plaintiff
has substantiated such costs and Defendant has failed to meet its burden to
show that such costs are unreasonable or unnecessary. Given the discrepancy in
the amount of costs for court reporter fees, the Court will tax $300.00 from
Plaintiff’s claimed costs for court reporter fees.  
 
            The Court GRANTS
Defendant’s request to tax Item 12 in the amount of $300. Plaintiff may recover
$4,700.00 in costs for court reporter fees.  
 
E. Other Costs (Item 13)  
 
            Defendant
seeks to strike $1,652.00 in “other” charges from Item 13 in Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs: $872.88 for attorney services and messengers and $780.00
for mediation. 
 
            These costs
are not expressly allowed or prohibited by CCP § 1033.5. Exercising its
discretion, the Court declines to award these costs.      The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request to strike $1,652.00 from
Item 13 in Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs.  
 
F. Attorneys’ Fees 
 
            In the opposition brief, Plaintiff
argues that she is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees incurred with the
opposition. The Court already has granted Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’
fees. (05/08/24 Minute Order.) Plaintiff argues that she is entitled to recover
attorneys’ fees incurred in preparation of her fee application. 
 
            Attorneys’ fees were not claimed in
Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs in connection with this instant motion, and the
Court will not award attorneys’ fees to Plaintiff at this time. The Court will
address any separate motion for fees Plaintiff may file. The Court notes that
Defendant has succeeded in part on its motion to tax costs. The Court does not
find that the instant motion is meritless.
 
            G. Conclusion 
 
            Defendant’s Motion to Strike or Tax
Costs is GRANTED IN PART. The Court taxes a total of $1,952.00 from Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs: $300.00 in costs from Item 12 and $1,652.00 from Item 13. The
motion is otherwise DENIED.
