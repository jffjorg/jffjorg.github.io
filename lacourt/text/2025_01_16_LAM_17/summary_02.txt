And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action pending the completion of arbitration proceedings. The plaintiff, Pep Talk, LLC, filed suit against the defendants, including Greg Harman and others, alleging civil extortion, false promise, and violations of Business & Professions Code section 17200. The defendants moved to compel arbitration and stay the action, arguing that the parties had entered into a written agreement with an arbitration provision. The judge found that the defendants had established by a preponderance of the evidence that an arbitration agreement existed and that the plaintiff's claims were covered by that agreement. Since the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, the judge determined that the burden shifted to the plaintiff to establish that the arbitration clause should not be enforced. However, the plaintiff failed to do so, and therefore the judge granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration.
