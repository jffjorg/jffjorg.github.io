PEP TALK, LLC 
  
        
  vs.
 
GREG HARMAN, et al.

 


 Case
  No.:  24STCV19441  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: January 16, 2025



 
 
Defendants’
motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED. This action is stayed pending the
completion of arbitration.
 
            On
8/2/2024, Plaintiff Pep Talk, LLC (Plaintiff) filed suit against Greg Harman,
Grid Communications, Inc. dba Gridpbx, and Quest Digital Solutions
(collectively, Defendants), alleging: (1) civil extortion; (2) false promise;
and (3) violations of Business & Professions Code section 17200. 
 
            On
11/4/2024, Defendants moved to compel arbitration and stay this action pending
the completion of arbitration proceedings.
 
            This
motion in unopposed.
 
Legal Standard 
 
Where the Court has determined that an agreement to
arbitrate a controversy exists, the Court shall order the petitioner and the
respondent to arbitrate the controversy …unless it determines that…  grounds exist for rescission of the
agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) Among the grounds which can support
rescission are fraud, duress, and unconscionability. (Tiri v. Lucky Chances, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 231, 239.) The
Court may also decline to compel arbitration wherein there is possibility of
conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2
(c).) 
 
Discussion 
 
I.                  
Defendants’ Burden 
 
The party moving to compel arbitration “bears the burden
of proving [the] existence [of an arbitration agreement] by a preponderance of
the evidence.” (Rosenthal v. Great
Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413.) The moving party
also bears the burden of demonstrating that the claims fall within the scope of
the arbitration agreement. (Omar v.
Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)
 
A.   
Existing Agreement
 
Here,
Defendants submitted evidence that Plaintiff entered into a written Price
Schedule on 4/26/2023 and 4/27/2024, which incorporated a Service Provider
Master Services Agreement, which itself contained an arbitration provision.
(Motion, Exh. A.)
 
Section 29.0
of the Service Provider Master Services Agreement provides that “[a]ll claims
and disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement are to be settled by
binding arbitration in the County and State of Orange County, California” (Ibid.)

 
Given that
Defendants have established by a preponderance of the evidence that an
arbitration agreement exists, and that Plaintiff’s claims are covered by that
agreement, the burden shifts to the Plaintiff to establish that the arbitration
clause should not be enforced. (Pinnacle, 55 Cal.4th at p. 236.) 
 
II.              
Plaintiff’s Burden  
 
The party
opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the
evidence any defense, such as unconscionability or duress. (Pinnacle, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 236.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff failed to oppose this motion and thus has not set forth any grounds
for the unenforceability of the arbitration provision.  
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration is granted. This action is
stayed pending the completion of arbitration.
 
 
It is so ordered.
