Defendant’s
claim of exemption is DENIED IN PART, GRANTED IN PART. Defendant’s claim of
exemption is GRANTED as to the Wells Fargo account, but DENIED as to the
Fidelity Accounts.  
 
On 11/4/2015, Plaintiff Cynthia Lopez filed suit against
Kenneth Lopez. Plaintiff’s first amended complaint (FAC) alleges causes of
action for: (1) defamation-libel; (2) defamation-slander; (3) intentional
infliction of emotional distress; (4) negligent infliction of emotional
distress; (5) malicious prosecution; (6) abuse of process; and (7) injunctive
relief.
 
            On
8/5/2024, Defendant noticed a hearing for a claim of exemption. 
 
Discussion  
 
            Defendant
filed a claim of exemption, claiming a Wells Fargo account and two investment
accounts are exempt from levy. 
 
Courts
consider several factors when determining whether funds in retirement accounts
are exempt. These factors are: (1) the debtor's intent regarding the design and
use of the retirement plan; (2) the timing of the plan's creation relative to
other events; (3) the degree of control the debtor has over the plan; (4)
compliance with, or violation of, IRS and plan rules; and, (5) how the funds
are actually used. (O'Brien v. AMBS Diagnostics, LLC (2019) 38 Cal.App.
5th 553, 561 (2019).
 
Defendant
argues that the subject accounts are exempt for levy. 
 
As for the
Wells Fargo account, Defendant submitted documentation to show that the Wells
Fargo Bank account at issue had, and has, less than $2,170 in it. (Lopez Decl.,
¶ 2, Exh. D). As such, Defendant contends it is exempt from levy under CCP
Section 704.220(a), and the California Department of Social Services’
determination that, between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2024, the exempt amount
in Region 1 for a family of 4 is $2,170. (Walton Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A).
 
As for the
two investment accounts, Defendant submitted evidence that the two accounts are
retirement accounts: one is a traditional IRA, the other is a SEP-IRA. As such,
Defendant contends that the Court cannot order the levy upon any assets of that
account unless they exceed:
 
(1) the
amount “necessary to provide for the support of the judgment debtor when the
judgment debtor retires and for the support of the spouse and dependents of the
judgment debtor, taking into account all resources that are likely to be
available for the support of the judgment debtor when the judgment debtor
retires.” (CCP § 704.115(e)); less 
 
(2) State and
Federal income taxes due on the retirement amounts. (Code Civ. Proc. §
704.115(e)).
 
Here, as of
11/12/2024, the balance in Mr. Lopez’ SEP IRA and Traditional IRA Fidelity
accounts is $420,523.45. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. E)
 
Defendant
argues that a levy on these accounts would violate California law, because it
would deprive him of the amount necessary to provide for his support (CCP §
704.115(e)): 
 
Mr. Lopez is
currently 55 years old. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 4). He lives with his parents and can
live there without paying rent—although he tries to help out with household
expenses when able, something he states he has not been able to do recently
because of the downturn in property valuation work. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 4). Mr.
Lopez’s projected life span, by the Social Security Administration, at age 65,
is 16.95 more years after he attains age 65. (Walton Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. B). Thus,
if Mr. Lopez retires at age 65, he will need to provide for himself and his
wife for another 17 years. His average monthly expenses for the last three
months have been $2,587—without having paid any rent, because he is living with
his parents. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 5-8, Exh. F-I; Walton Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. C).
Multiplying Mr. Lopez’s projected life expectancy of 17 years by 12 months
yields 204 months he is projected to survive past age 65. (Walton Decl. ¶ 5).
Multiplying 204 months by California’s absolute minimum standard for having a
month’s worth of expenses in the bank account of $2,170 equates to $442,680.
(Walton Decl. 5)
 
            In
opposition, and through supplemental briefing, Plaintiff argues that “the undisputed evidence shows that the Debtor’s intent
in the establishment of an alleged SEP-IRA retirement account, in lieu of his
prior standard Fidelity brokerage account, was to transfer funds which at the
time were not exempt from collection to his new (and secondary to his
traditional IRA account) “retirement” account for the purpose of preventing
Creditor from collecting on her judgment in this matter.” (Supp. Briefing
12/13/2025, p. 4: 17-22.) In other words, Plaintiff contends that Defendant has
intentionally manipulated his contributions and made transfers in order to
frustrate efforts to collect in this matter. 
 
            More specifically, Plaintiff submitted evidence that:
 
-         
Creditor offered
evidence of Defendant’s gross and net income and the Fidelity statements
showing the total contributions for several years. A review of the evidence
before the court shows Defendant contributed over the maximum amount from
2017-2023. (Boone Decl. #1, ¶¶14-26, 30-35, Exs. 6-9, and 11-12; Supp. Briefing
12/13/2025, p. 5: 9-28.) Plaintiff’s evidence suggests that the chart shows
that $130,752.30 of Defendant’s contributions to his SEP-IRA over those 7
years, from 2017 through 2023, were illegal. 
 
-         
While Defendant
was over-contributing to his SEP-IRA with non-exempt funds, he was
simultaneously over-contributing to his second “retirement” account –his
traditional IRA. Plaintiff provided evidence that in 2022 and 2023, Defendant
contributed at least $21,500.00, by transferring funds from non-exempt
accounts, into his Fidelity “Traditional IRA.” Debtor’s over-contributions to
his Traditional IRA are likely underestimated as he failed to disclose this
account and has yet to produce all statements requested by subpoena. Here,
again, Defendant violated IRS rules on contribution limits to traditional IRAs.
(Boone Decl., #1, ¶¶37-40, Exs. 1, 7 (Bates #1427 and #1971).
 
-         
At his Debtor’s
Exam on November 15, 2023, Defendant testified he used his Fidelity SEP-IRA to
“borrow” money or make withdrawals from his SEP-IRA to “pay bills” (Boone Decl.
#1, ¶27, Ex. 4, p. 42:8-24 and p. 43:5-20). Thus, Defendant effectively uses
his SEP-IRA like a holding account, maintaining monies in the account, but then
withdrawing funds to immediately pay bills, rather than keeping funds in his
personal (non-exempt) Wells Fargo checking account. (Boone Decl.#1, ¶27)
 
-         
Additional
testimony from the Defendant indicates that he regularly transfers funds from
Fidelity into his Wells Fargo checking account (rather than keeping the funds
at Wells Fargo) to pay “expenses.” (Boone Decl.#1, ¶28, Ex. 4, p. 46:2-14, p.
48:9-17 and 20-22, p. 49:15-20).
 
-         
Defendant
testified: he could not "recall" when he opened the Fidelity SEP-IRA
account (Boone Decl.#1, Ex. 4, p. 33:3-28 and p.14 34:1- 2); he could not
recall how much he put into the account to open it (Boone Decl. #1, Ex. 4, p.
34:3- 9); the source of 2023 deposits was his income (Boone Decl.#1 Ex. 4, p.
34:10-24); he had no “contribution agreement" or plan for his SEP-IRA.
(Boone Dec. Ex. 4, p. 35:9-25); and, he does not track how much he contributes
each year to his SEP-IRA (Boone Dec. Ex. 4, p. 60:8-10). In addition, the Debtor
failed to testify about, or provide any documentation regarding, his second
“retirement” account, his traditional IRA, including failing to provide any
account or contribution agreement or statements. (Boone Decl. #1, ¶¶2-10,13,
37-40, 43 and 46, Exs. 1-4, and Ex. 14, pp. 34:14-20, 36:4-25, 37:1-19).
 
Notably,
Defendant has not disputed any of these claims or figures, nor has he offered
any persuasive counter-evidence on the issue. 
 
            Moreover,
Plaintiff disputes Defendant’s analysis calculating $442,680 as the amount
necessary to provide for his support after retirement:
 
The only evidence Debtor and his attorneys submitted is
the late-filed evidence submitted 9 court days ahead of the previous hearing.
That evidence consisted of two declarations Debtor’s counsel Walton offered a
declaration on the debtor’s life expectancy and the amount of money exempt from
a bank levy under CCP 704.220 and an “analysis” of Debtors spending. The
“analysis” shows that Debtor is spending on average $2,589.99 per month. The “analysis”
does not however show what the Debtor is spending his money on.
 
After
a review of the Debtor’s credit card statements supplied with Debtor’s
declaration, it is clear why this “analysis” doesn’t break down debtor’s
expenses. The only point Walton’s declaration appears to make is that the
Debtor’s life expectancy multiplied by the minimum amount necessary to support
a family of four pursuant to CCP 704.220 is more than what is in Debtor’s
retirement accounts currently. Inconveniently for this “analysis” is the fact
that Debtor is not now supporting, nor is there any evidence he will ever be
supporting, a family of four. The analysis does not take into account the
substantial additional assets the Debtor has, including the undisclosed and
sizeable KJL trust, the fact that the Debtor will inherit  his parents sizeable estate, any financial
assets or future contribution from his wife, and that the Debtor has an
additional 10 years to contribute to his retirement.
 
            (12/13/2024 Supp. Briefing, p.10:5-27.) 
 
            After
review, the Court finds insufficient evidence to support Defendant’s claim of
exemption as to the Fidelity accounts. More specifically, the Court finds that
Defendant’s overfunding-of and regular utilization of these accounts to pay
regular expenses suggests improper sheltering of funds to avoid payment towards
judgment. Moreover, Defendant’s calculations of the amount needed to provide
for his support are not supported by the submitted evidence. As such, to allow
the levy would not run counter to established law.  
 
            As
such, the Court denies Defendant’s claim of exemption as to this amount. However,
Plaintiff’s supplemental briefing did not address the Wells Fargo account
(which is not a retirement account), and thus the Court considers this to be a
concession that this account is not subject to levy.  
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s claim of exemption is denied in part, granted in part.
Defendant’s claim of exemption is granted as to the Wells Fargo account, but
denied as to the Fidelity Accounts.  
 
 
It is so ordered.
