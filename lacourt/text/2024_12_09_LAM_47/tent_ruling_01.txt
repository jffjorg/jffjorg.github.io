CASE NO.:                 23STCV21111            
 
MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
MOVING PARTY:               Attorney Lawrence Ecoff, counsel for Defendant
Computer Institute of Technology
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response as of
12/05/24.
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a fraud action that was filed on August 31, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant submitted invoices for reimbursement for job training
without disclosing that the training was being offered in Spanish and without
first securing approval to conduct the training in Spanish. 
 
Attorney Lawrence Ecoff, counsel
for Defendant, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Lawrence Ecoff, counsel
for Defendant, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Moving Counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and filed proof of service with the Court. Moving Counsel
served the motions on the Defendant by mail and confirmed that the address is
current by telephone. (MC-052 ¶ 3(b).) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
            Here, Moving Counsel states that
withdrawal is necessary because the Defendant has failed to honor its payment
obligations under the fee agreement. (MC-052 ¶ 2.) Trial in this matter is set
for December 2, 2025. (MC-052 ¶ 6.) The only other hearings in this matter are
a Post-Mediation Status Conference set for January 7, 2025 at 8:30 AM, and a
Final Status Conference set on November 17, 2025 at 9:00 A.M. (MC-052 ¶ 5.) The
risk of prejudice to Defendant is therefore low. In light of the low risk of
prejudice to the parties at this juncture, the Court finds that Moving Counsel
has demonstrated good cause for withdrawal. 
 
            Accordingly,
Attorney Lawrence Ecoff’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant is
GRANTED.
 
            The
Court sets a Status Conference re: Defendant’s Retention of Substitute Counsel
for January 7, 2025 at 8:30 AM to coincide with the Post-Mediation Status
Conference at that date and time. 
 
            This
order is conditioned on Moving Counsel giving notice to all parties of the
Court’s ruling and order to be entered granted the motion and filing proof of
service with the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
