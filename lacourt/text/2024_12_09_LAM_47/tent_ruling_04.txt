Legal Standard
 
A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields
v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n
demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations contained therein are
assumed to be true”].) “This rule of liberal construction means that the
reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.” (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1238.) 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who has filed the pleading subject to the demurrer and file a declaration
detailing their meet-and-confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)
However, an insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds
to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Sarah Overton in
support of the Demurrer state that the declarant attempted to contact Plaintiff
via his mailing address, but received no response. (Declaration of Sarah L.
Overton ISO Dem. ¶¶ 2; 6.) Attorney Overton also attempted to contact Plaintiff
by his listed telephone number, to no avail. (Id. ¶¶ 3-6.) Defendant has
satisfied its statutory meet-and-confer obligations.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant
requests that the Court take judicial notice of the register of actions in the
matter entitled Cofey v. Metropolitan Transit Authority, Superior Court
Case No. 23STCV01422. Defendant’s request is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452(d) (court records).
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
demurs to the Complaint in its entirety for failure to state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. Defendant contends that the Complaint is
fatally defective because it is barred by quasi-judicial immunity, because
Plaintiff has not alleged compliance with the Government Claims Act, and
because it does not set forth facts supporting a negligence claim. 
 
            Well-settled
authority holds that judges enjoy absolute immunity from civil suits arising
out of the exercise of their judicial functions. (Mireles v. Waco (1991)
502 U.S. 9, 11; Tagliavia v. County of Los Angeles (198) 112 Cal.App.3d
759, 761.) This absolute immunity has been extended, under the doctrine of
“quasi-judicial immunity” to persons other than judges who “act in a judicial
or quasi-judicial capacity.” (Howard v. Drapkin (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d
843, 852-53.) This immunity has been extended to arbitrators, grand jurors,
prosecutors, and State Bar officials. (Id. at 853.) Quasi-judicial
immunity also applies to court clerks. (Acres v. Marston (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 417, 442.) Moreover, under Government Code section 815.2(b), the
Superior Court, as a public entity, “is not liable for an injury resulting from
an act or omission of an employee [. . . ] where that employee is immune from
liability.” (Gov. Code § 815.2(b).) 
 
            Defendant
argues that it cannot be liable in this action because the thrust of
Plaintiff’s claim is that the rejection of his requests for entry of default in
a separate action constituted actionable negligence. As Defendant forcefully
argues, such conduct, on its face, is an integral part of the judicial process,
and so the clerks who rejected Plaintiff’s requests are entitled to
quasi-judicial immunity for those acts. Consequently, Defendant itself is not
liable as a matter of law pursuant to Government Code section 815.2(b). 
 
            Defendant’s
Demurrer to the Complaint is therefore SUSTAINED. 
 
Leave to Amend
 
When a demurrer is sustained, the
Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can
be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318).  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts upon
which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff an
opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived of his
right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were defective
for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892,
900.) Accordingly, California law imposes the burden on the plaintiffs to
demonstrate the manner in which they can amend their pleadings to state their
claims against a defendant.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 349.) “Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion
unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of amendment. 
[Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair
opportunity to correct any defect has not been given." (Angie M. v.
Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.)
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated how
the Complaint might be cured of its deficiencies, and, moreover, amendment is
not possible in light of the Court’s finding that Plaintiff’s complaint is
barred by absolute quasi-judicial immunity. The Court therefore does not grant
leave to amend. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave
to amend. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
