And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wilton Holdings & Management LLC v. 8210 Sunset, LLC et al. (Case No. 24STCV00859). The case involves a breach of contract and wrongful eviction action, where Plaintiff Wilton Holdings & Management LLC alleges that it subleased a commercial property from Defendants with serious structural and habitability defects, which were not disclosed or remedied, and was subsequently locked out of the property without formal termination of the lease.

The judge has ruled that Plaintiff's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint in Intervention is OVERRULED, meaning that the complaint states a cause of action. The judge has also denied Plaintiff's motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint in Intervention, finding that the complaint is sufficiently comprehensible and that Plaintiff's objections to uncertainty are unfounded.

The judge has also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions and has ordered that the moving party give notice. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to submission by the parties and may be modified or rejected at the hearing on December 9, 2024.
