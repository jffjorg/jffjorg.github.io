And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling of Judge Theresa M. Traber sustains the demurrer of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles (erroneously sued as Stanley Mosk Courthouse) to the Complaint of Joseph Cofey. The Complaint alleges that the Superior Court clerk improperly rejected Cofey's request for entry of default in a separate action. The Court finds that the Complaint is barred by quasi-judicial immunity, which applies to court clerks and other officials who act in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity. The Court also finds that the Complaint does not state a cause of action because it does not comply with the Government Claims Act and does not set forth facts supporting a negligence claim. As a result, the Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that Cofey will not be able to revise his Complaint to overcome the defects identified by the Court.
