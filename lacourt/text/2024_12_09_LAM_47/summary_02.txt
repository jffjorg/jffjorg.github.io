And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint. The motion is filed by Defendant 22000 Opportunity Way, LP, and seeks to strike the prayers for restitution, attorney's fees, rescission, and punitive damages. The judge grants the motion as to the prayers for restitution, attorney's fees, rescission, and punitive damages, but denies it as to the prayer for prejudgment interest.

The judge finds that the First Amended Complaint does not contain sufficient allegations to support the prayers for relief as to Defendant 22000 Opportunity Way, LP. However, the judge grants Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies.

The judge also notes that the meet and confer requirement was not met by the moving party, but decides to address the merits of the motion in the interest of an expeditious resolution of the challenge to the pleadings.

Finally, the judge observes that punitive damages are not appropriate as to this Defendant, as the allegations in the First Amended Complaint do not demonstrate a conscious disregard for the safety of others.
