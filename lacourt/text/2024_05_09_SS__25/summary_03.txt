And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Plaintiff's Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment. The case involves a subrogation action filed by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company against Edgar Gallardo, who allegedly caused an automobile collision with Plaintiff's insured. The parties settled, with Defendant agreeing to pay $4,500.00 in monthly payments. However, Defendant has only paid $400.00, and Plaintiff has not received a payment since August 11, 2023. The judge finds that the parties entered into a settlement agreement with the court retaining jurisdiction. Since the default on the payment plan has not been cured, the judge grants Plaintiff's motion and enters judgment against Defendant in the amount of $4,100.00.
