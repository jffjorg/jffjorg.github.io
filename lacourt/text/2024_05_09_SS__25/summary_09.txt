And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is continuing the petition regarding the deposit of surplus funds and the discharge of the Petitioner, Quality Loan Service Corp. The Petitioner filed a motion to deposit the surplus funds and to discharge itself from further responsibility for the disbursement of the funds. The Petitioner sent required notice of the surplus to all potential claimants, but was unable to determine how the surplus funds should be distributed. The Petitioner did not receive a claim from the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The court finds that the Petitioner's counsel's declaration does not include the required information, such as the date of the trustee's sale, a description of the property, and the names and addresses of all persons sent notice. Therefore, the court cannot approve the petition. The Petitioner must serve and electronically file supplemental papers addressing the deficiencies noted in the court's order 16 days prior to the next scheduled hearing.
