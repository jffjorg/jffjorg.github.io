Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike, and has reached the following conclusion:

Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. has demurred to the fifth cause of action for fraud by concealment, alleging that Plaintiff Lydia Edwards has failed to allege sufficient facts and that the cause of action is barred by the economic loss rule. However, the court finds that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraud, and that the economic loss rule does not act as a bar to this claim.

The court has also considered the case of Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828, which similarly addressed issues of fraud by concealment. The court finds the reasoning in Dhital to be persuasive, and concludes that Plaintiff has alleged entitlement to punitive damages.

As a result, the demurrer is OVERRULED, and the motion to strike is DENIED. Defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 30 days of notice of ruling.
