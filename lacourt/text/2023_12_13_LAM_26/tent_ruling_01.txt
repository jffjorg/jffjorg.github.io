[TENTATIVE] order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration of the  december 7, 2021 order



 
Procedural
Background
            On May 4,
2021, Plaintiff Martha Casillas (“Plaintiff”) filed
the instant action against defendant FCA US, LLC (“Defendant”) arising from the
purchase of a 2017 Jeep Renegade.  The complaint
asserts two causes of action for (1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach
of Express Written Warranty and (2) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach
of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability. 
On December 7,
2021, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration.  The Court stayed the action pending
arbitration, relying on what was then the only California appellate opinion on
the issue, Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th
486.  (Order 8/6/21.)
            On
June 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for reconsideration of the December
7, 2021 Order compelling arbitration.  On
November 30, 2023, Defendant filed an opposition.  On December 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
            In conjunction with the reply
papers, Plaintiff requests that the Court take judicial notice of:
1.    
Third District Court of Appeal’s response
to a Petition for Writ of Mandate in Ortiz, et al. v Superior Court of
Sacramento County (C099135)
2.    
Third District Court of Appeal’s response
to a Petition for Writ of Mandate in Campos v. Superior Court of Butte
County (C098848)
3.    
The Alternative Writ issued by the Second
District Court of Appeal in Contreras v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
(B331737)
As the Court may
take judicial notice of court records and actions of the State, (See Evid.
Code, § 452(c)(d)), Plaintiff’s unopposed request for judicial notice is
GRANTED.  However, the Court does not
take judicial notice of the truth of assertions within the Court records. (See Herrera
v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366,
1375.)  
 
Discussion

            Based
in part on Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 (“Ochoa”)
and later cases relying on the reasoning in Ochoa, Plaintiff seeks
reconsideration of the Court’s December 7, 2021 Order compelling arbitration.  
 
Untimeliness of the Instant Motion
            Here, the instant motion must be brought under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008 which “generally states procedures for
applications to reconsider any previous interim court order. It ‘applies to all
applications for interim orders’ [Citation.] and provides time limits and other
requirements for such applications.”  (Le Francois v.
Goel
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1098.)  
            An application to reconsider, modify, or revoke a prior
order must fall under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 subdivisions (a),
(b), or (c).  Plaintiff purports to bring
the instant motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(c).  (Motion at pp.5-6.)  However, subdivision (c) only applies to the Court bringing its own motion.  (CCP § 1008(c), [“If a court at any time determines that there has been a
change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered, it may
do so on
its own motion and enter a different
order.”] [italics and bold added].)
Similarly, subdivision (b) applies only to renewed motions that were
either refused or granted conditionally. 
(CCP § 1008(b), [“A party who originally made an application for an
order which was refused in whole or part, or granted conditionally or on terms,
may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown.”].)  The instant motion is
not a renewed motion, and thus, does not fall under subdivision (b).
            The sole remaining basis for the instant motion is under
subdivision (a) which provides that “[w]hen an application for an order has
been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or
granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order
may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.”  (CCP § 1008(a), [Bold and
Italics Added].)  
            Notice of the December 7, 2021 Order was given on December
7, 2021 by mail.  Thus, Plaintiff “plainly
failed to move for reconsideration within the 10–day statutory timeline
established by section 1008, and his motion could properly [] be[] denied on
th[is] ground alone.”  (In re Marriage
of Herr (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1468.) 
As the Supreme Court has explained, “a party may not file a written motion
to reconsider that has procedural significance if it does not satisfy the
requirements of section 437c, subdivision (f)(2), or 1008. The court need
not rule on any suggestion that it should reconsider a previous ruling and,
without more, another party would not be expected to respond to such a
suggestion.”  (Le Francois v.
Goel
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108.)  Therefore, “[u]nless the
requirements of section 437c, subdivision (f)(2), or 1008 are satisfied, any
action to reconsider a prior interim order must formally begin with the court on
its own motion.”  (Ibid.)
 
Court’s Own Motion for Reconsideration
             An improper
motion under 1008 may be the catalyst for reconsideration of a prior ruling as
“the trial court's inherent authority to correct its errors applies even when
the trial court was prompted to reconsider its prior ruling by a motion filed
in violation of section 1008”  (In re
Marriage of Barthold (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303–1304.)  However, “[t]o be fair to the parties, if the
court is seriously concerned that one of its prior interim rulings might have
been erroneous, and thus that it might want to reconsider that ruling on its
own motion … it should inform the parties of this concern, solicit briefing,
and hold a hearing.”  (Le Francois, supra, 35 Cal.4th
at p.1108; accord Reliant Life Shares, LLC v. Cooper (2023) 90
Cal.App.5th 14, 61 [“the trial court had the authority to correct its error on
its own motion. It did so by acknowledging its error, soliciting further
briefing, and holding a further hearing.”].)
            The
December 7, 2021 Order compelling arbitration relied on what was then the only
California appellate opinion on the issue, Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020)
53 Cal.App.5th 486.  Since the August 6,
2021 Order, numerous California appellate opinions have disagreed with Felisilda
including Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 (“Ochoa”),
Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958, Kielar v.
Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614, and most
recently Yeh v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2023) 95
Cal.App.5th 264.
            In
light of this new appellate authority, the Court hereby gives notice that it is
bringing its own motion for reconsideration. 
The court hereby invites briefing from the parties.  The Court’s own motion for reconsideration
shall be heard on February 26, 2024 at 8:30 am. 
In connection with the hearing, the Court requests simultaneous
supplemental briefing by the parties limited to 5 pages, plus supporting
declarations and evidence, if any, regarding the standard a Court applies when
deciding on its own motion to reconsider a prior decision pursuant to CCP
1008(c) and how this Court should consider and evaluate various factors in this
case, including the significant length of time that has elapsed since the Court
ordered arbitration, the passage of time between the purported change in law
and Plaintiff’s filing of the instant motion for reconsideration, whether there
has been delay, the extent to which any purported delay has caused prejudice,
efforts by the parties to proceed with arbitration per the Court’s December 7,
2021 Order, and the extent to which any party failed to comply with the Court’s
December 7, 2021 Order to arbitrate.  The
parties may also – if they wish – submit supplemental evidence supporting such
arguments, and there is no page limit for the supplemental evidence.  Such supplemental briefing and materials
shall be filed and served by no later than 10 days prior to the hearing on the
Court’s own motion for reconsideration.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s Martha Casillas’s
motion for reconsideration of the December 7, 2021 order is CONTINUED TO February 26, 2024 at 8:30 am. 
The Court’s own motion for reconsideration shall also be heard on February 26, 2024 at 8:30 am.
Moving Party to
give notice and file proof of service of such.
