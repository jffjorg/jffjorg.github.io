The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Isea Group Inc.'s motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case was originally dismissed without prejudice on March 18, 2024, due to lack of appearance. The Plaintiff's counsel claims that the dismissal was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or neglect, and has provided a declaration attesting to this fact. The Judge has found that the motion is timely filed and that the Plaintiff's counsel has sufficiently established the required grounds for relief. As a result, the dismissal is set aside and the trial is scheduled for November 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse.
