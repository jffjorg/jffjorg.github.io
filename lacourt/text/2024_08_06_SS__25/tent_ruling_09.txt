On May
26, 2023, Plaintiff Manuel V. Redondo Cruz (“Plaintiff”), filed a Complaint for
Damages against Defendant Facundo Gil; Maria Belen Fernandez and DOES 1-5 for Breach
of Contract and Common Counts.  
 
On June 26, 2024, Michie Law Group (“Counsel”), counsel of
record for Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the
“Motion”).
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Relieved
as Counsel       
A.               
Legal Standard 
The court
may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or
after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney
and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.   
 An application to be relieved as counsel must
be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the
action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
Further, the
requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.  
B.        Discussion 
The Court finds that Counsel
has filed the requisite forms pursuant to the Motion as required by Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362. Declaration of Counsel provides that the Attorney-Client
relationship has deteriorated to the point that further work by attorney on
behalf of the client will not be in the best interests of the client. The
Client and all parties have been provided with notice of motion.  (MC-052, Decl. in Support of Motion). The
Moving papers have been served by mail at the Client’s last known address with
copies of the motion papers served with the Declaration.  Counsel confirmed that the address has been
confirmed in the past 30 days to be current address of Client.  (MC-052, Decl. in Support of Motion).  Trial Date is November 22, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
in Department 25 and is listed in MC-052. 
Accordingly, the Court
grants the Motion to be relieved as counsel. 

II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, Counsel Michie Law Firm’s Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff is GRANTED. 
 
The Court's Ruling and Attorney's relief as Counsel of
record for client is not effective until Proof of Service of the Order signed
by the Court upon the client is filed in this action.  Until then, counsel continues to be counsel
of record.  Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(e). 
 
 
            Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
