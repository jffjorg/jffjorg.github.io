 
BACKGROUND
 
On March
3, 2023, Plaintiffs Saini Investments LLC (“Saini”) and S. Arora Consulting,
Inc. (“Arora”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed an action against Defendants
Mayra A. Martinez (“Mayra”), Victor Martinez (“Victor”), and Rodolfo Martinez
(“Rodolfo”) for breach of contract.
 
On May 8, 2023, Defendant Rodolfo,
in propria persona, and Defendant Victor, in propria persona, each filed a
separate Answer to the Complaint.
 
On September 21, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motions to deem requests for admissions admitted as to
Defendants Rodolfo and Victor. 
 
On April 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
the instant Motion for Summary Judgment against Defendants Rodolfo and Victor. No
opposition has been filed.  
 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiffs argue
that they are entitled to summary judgment because there are no triable issues
of material fact in dispute in connection with their breach of contract claim.
Specifically, Plaintiffs present evidence of judicial admission that establish
all elements of their breach of contract claim. 

 
OPPOSITION
 
            None filed
as of August 5, 2024.
 
REPLY
 
            None filed
as of August 5, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion
for Summary Judgment 
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial.  Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.  In analyzing such
motions, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s claims; and (3)
determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable,
material factual issue.”  Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.  Thus, summary judgment or summary adjudication
is granted when, after the Court’s consideration of the evidence set forth in
the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact
exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
CCP § 437c(c); Villa v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741. 
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the party moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate or establish
an essential element.  Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.”  Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.  A motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication must be denied where the moving party’s evidence does not prove
all material facts, even in the absence of any opposition or where the
opposition is weak.  See Leyva v. Superior Court (1985) 164
Cal.App.3d 462, 475; Salesguevara v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222
Cal.App.3d 379, 384, 387. 
 
Once the moving party has met the
burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to show via specific facts that
a triable issue of material facts exists as to a cause of action or a defense
thereto.  CCP § 437c(o)(2).  When a party cannot establish an
essential element or defense, a court must grant a motion for summary
adjudication.  CCP § 437c(o)(1)-(2). 
 
A.        Undisputed Facts 
 
            Plaintiffs
are the owners as tenants in common of the real property located at 8511
Fenwick St., Sunland, CA 91040.  UMF No.
1; Arora Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 1.  The parties had
an agreement wherein Defendants rented the subject property from Plaintiffs.  UMF Nos. 3; Arora Decl., Exh. 3 RFAs Nos. 1,
4, 5.  Plaintiffs fully performed on the
rental agreement.  UMF No. 4; Arora Decl.,
Exh. 3 RFAs Nos 6-7.  Defendants breached
the rental agreement by failing to pay rent between April 1, 2022 and January
31, 2023.  UMF No. 5; Arora Decl., Exh. 3
RFAs Nos. 9-10.  Plaintiffs’ injuries
were caused by Defendants’ breach.  UMF
No. 6; Arora Decl., Exh. 3 RFAs Nos. 13-14.
 
B.        Plaintiff’s First Cause of Action for
Breach of Contract 
 
            “‘[T]he
vital elements of a cause of action based on a contract are mutual assent
(usually accomplished through the medium of an offer and acceptance) and
consideration.”  Pacific Bay Recovery
Inc. v. California Physicians’ Services, Inc. (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 200,
215.  “To prevail on a cause of action
for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the
plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the
defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.”  Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.  
 
            Here, in support of their burden,
Plaintiffs rely on the requests for admissions served on Defendants Rodolfo
and Victor that had been deemed
admitted by the Court.  UMF Nos. 3-6;
Arora Decl., Exh. 3. These requests for admissions establish most elements
necessary to support a breach of contract claim.  
 
Because the Court deemed Plaintiffs’
requests for admissions admitted, Defendants Rodolfo and Victor have
essentially responded to each of those admissions in the affirmative. (St.
Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 762, 776.) As such, they
may be used to support a motion for summary judgment. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(b)(1).)
Based on those admissions, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their
burden in showing that there are no triable issues of material fact as to whether
their breach of contract claim has merit because Defendants Rodolfo and Victor
have admitted the following: (1) a rental agreement exists between the parties,
(2) Plaintiffs performed their obligations under the rental agreement, (3) they
breached the rental agreement by failing to pay rent, and (4) their breach
caused damage to Plaintiffs. UMF Nos. 3-6; Arora Decl., Exh. 3. 
 
However, the element of damage has not
been established. None of the evidence before the court establishes damages caused
by the breach.  “An element of a
breach of contract cause of action is damages proximately caused by the
defendant’s breach.  The statutory
measure of damages for a breach of contract is ‘the amount which will
compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment proximately caused
thereby, or which in the ordinary course of things, would be likely to result
therefrom.’ ‘Contract damages seek to approximate the agreed-upon
performance.  “[I]n the law of contracts
the theory is that the party injured by breach should receive as nearly as
possible the equivalent of the benefits of performance.”’” (Copenbarger v.
Morris Cerullo World Evangelism, Inc. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1, 9
[239 Cal. Rptr. 3d 838], internal citations omitted.) Plaintiff has not brought
admissible evidence to establish the amount claimed so that a judgment can be
entered in favor of plaintiff and against defendants for that specified
amount.  Furthermore, the requests for
admission before the Court do not establish any amounts owed to
plaintiff.  
 
Based thereon, Plaintiffs have not met
their burden of proof.  Accordingly, the
Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.   
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment
is DENIED.  
 
Moving party
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
