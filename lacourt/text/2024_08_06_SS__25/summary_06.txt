And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion for summary judgment filed by Plaintiffs Saini Investments LLC and S. Arora Consulting, Inc. against Defendants Mayra A. Martinez, Victor Martinez, and Rodolfo Martinez. The court found that Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact as to whether their breach of contract claim has merit, but they have not established the element of damage. The court deemed Plaintiffs' requests for admissions admitted, which established most elements necessary to support a breach of contract claim. However, the court could not grant summary judgment because the element of damage has not been established. The court ordered that the motion for summary judgment be denied and that the moving party give notice of the ruling.
