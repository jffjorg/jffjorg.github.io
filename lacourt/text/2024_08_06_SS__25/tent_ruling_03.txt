On September 19, 2022, Plaintiff Isea Group Inc.
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Theodore Nyne Moon
(“Defendant”) for breach of contract, book account, account stated, and
services rendered. The complaint alleges that Plaintiff sold and delivered to
Defendant certain services, such as consignment services to sell shoes.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed and refused to pay Plaintiff for the
good and/or services and owes $12,672.
 
On
March 18, 2024, the case was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 581(b)(3) when no party appeared for non-jury trial.
 
On
July 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the dismissal. No
opposition has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
 
Code of Civil Procedure §473(b)
provides for mandatory and discretionary relief from dismissal.  “The
court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.”  (CCP §473(b).)  Where such
an application for discretionary relief is made, the motion shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or pleading proposed to be filed, or the application
will not be granted.  (Id.)  The court must grant relief from
dismissal where the application is accompanied by an attorney
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect.  (Id.)  In either case, the application must be
made within a reasonable time, and in no case exceeding six months after the
judgment.  (Id.)  
 
 
 
B.    
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves for relief on the
ground that dismissal was entered due to the mistake, inadvertence, or
neglect of Plaintiff’s counsel. On March 18, 2024,
the case was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 581(b)(3) when no party appeared for non-jury trial.
 
First, the court notes that the motion is timely
filed.  The action was dismissed on March 18, 2024.  This
Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal was filed on July 8, 2024, within six months
of the dismissal.
 
The trial court’s granting
or denial of relief under this provision is reviewed for abuse of
discretion.   (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 600, 610.)   It is noted that appellate courts are
traditionally “favorably disposed toward such action on the part of the trial
courts as will permit, rather than prevent, the adjudication of legal
controversies on their merits.”  (Mercantile Collection Bureau v. Pinheiro (1948)
84 Cal.App.2d 606, 608, citing Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1947) 31 Cal.2d 523.)
 
Counsel for Plaintiff provides a declaration signed under
penalty of perjury, attesting that the non-jury trial set for March 18,
2024 was mis-calendared. (Haines Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel has
sufficiently established mistake, inadvertence or neglect, and the dismissal
must be set aside.  
 
 
 Conclusion
 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion
to Set Aside the Dismissal Entered on 03/18/2024 is GRANTED.
 
 
Trial is scheduled for November 12,
2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse.
