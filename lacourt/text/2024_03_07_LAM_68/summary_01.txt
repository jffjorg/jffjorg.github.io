The defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, challenged the motion on grounds of dilatory delay, lack of good cause for leave, and prejudice. The judge found that the motion lacked specific explanation for the timing of the request, but the court granted the motion due to the public policy preference for the substantive adjudication of potential meritorious claims. The judge also found minimal prejudice and granted the motion for leave to amend, setting a deadline for the moving party to file a separate copy of the first amended complaint.
