TENTATIVE
RULING
Defendant
Community Corporation of Santa Monica’s Motion to Strike is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s
allegations in the Complaint do not reach the level of malice, fraud or
oppression to warrant a prayer for punitive damages. 
 
The
Court orders the following stricken from the Complaint:
 
1.    
Page 3, Section 14: "Plaintiff prays for judgment
for costs of suit; for such relief as is fair, just, and equitable; and for a.
(2) punitive damages." 
 
2.    
Page 6, Attachment No. COA 3, Third Cause of Action for
Breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability: "WH-7 Defendants conduct
was deliberate and undertaken with oppression, fraud, and/or malice within the
meaning provided in Civil Code § 3294, justifying an award of punitive damages
sufficient to punish Defendants and deter them from such misconduct in the
future."
 
REASONING
 
            Defendant Community Corporation of Santa Monica
(“Defendant”) moves to strike punitive damages alleged in Plaintiff Robyn
Fernandez’s (“Plaintiff) Complaint arising out of the 3rd cause of
action for implied warranty of habitability under Civ. Code § 3294. Specifically,
Defendant moves to strike page 3, § 14, and page 6, attachment no COA 3 “"WH-7
Defendants conduct was deliberate and undertaken with oppression, fraud, and/or
malice within the meaning provided in Civil Code § 3294, justifying an award of
punitive damages sufficient to punish Defendants and deter them from such
misconduct in the future." (See Compl., pp. 3, 6.) 
 
            Plaintiff does not plead facts sufficient to show malice,
fraud or oppression under the 3rd cause of action. Plaintiff does
plead negligence allegations; however, allegations of negligence or even gross
negligence alone are insufficient for an award of punitive damages. (See Nolin
v. National Convenience Stores, Inc. (1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 279, 285–286 [“conduct
classified only as unintentional carelessness, while it may constitute
negligence or even gross negligence, will not support an award of punitive
damages.”].) 
 
The Court notes that no
opposition was filed, and Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer on 7-2-24 and
7-8-24, satisfying the requirement of CCP § 435.5.
