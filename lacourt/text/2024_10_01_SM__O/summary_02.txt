And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a demurrer with motion to strike filed by the defendants in a case involving a declaratory relief action brought by the plaintiff, FF CA Policy Partnership LP, against the Estate of Olga Mellican, et al.

The judge has overruled the defendants' demurrer to the 1st through 4th causes of action for declaratory relief, finding that the plaintiff has alleged the necessary facts to state claims for declaratory relief regarding the validity of the policy, lack of standing, statute of limitations, and waiver.

However, the judge has sustained the defendants' demurrer to the 5th cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the plaintiff has failed to allege how they were harmed by the alleged breach. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to cure this deficiency.

The judge has also denied the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain documents and has granted their request for judicial notice of certain articles, court documents, and administrative ruling documents, but only as to the existence of these documents, not as to the truth of the hearsay statements contained in them.
