And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the Complaint. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's allegations do not reach the level of malice, fraud, or oppression to warrant a prayer for punitive damages. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff pleaded negligence allegations, but allegations of negligence or even gross negligence alone are insufficient for an award of punitive damages. The Judge also noted that no opposition was filed to the motion, and that the Plaintiff had attempted to meet and confer with the Defendant on the issue. As a result, the Judge ordered that pages 3, section 14, and page 6, attachment no. COA 3, be stricken from the Complaint.
