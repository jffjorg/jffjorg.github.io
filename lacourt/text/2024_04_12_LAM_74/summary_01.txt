English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint is denied without prejudice. The Judge notes that the proposed amended complaint is not serially numbered as required by the California Rules of Court. The Judge also notes that the Defendant's bankruptcy filing has stayed all legal proceedings against the Defendant, but the stay does not apply to the other defendants listed in the complaint. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff has complied with most of the applicable rules, but the proposed amended complaint does not meet the requirements.
