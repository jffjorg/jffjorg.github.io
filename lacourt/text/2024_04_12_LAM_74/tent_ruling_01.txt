  Case Number:  21STCV36896    Hearing Date:   April 12, 2024    Dept:  74 Yoon Kyoung
Lee v. Gloria Laser Clinic, Inc., et al.
Motion for Leave to File Amended
Complaint
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
October 6, 2021, Plaintiff Yoon Kyoung Lee (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant Gloria Laser Clinic, Inc. (Defendant) and Gloria Moon.
            The
complaint alleges the following causes of action: (1) unlawful business
practices, (2) unpaid overtime wages, (3) failure to provide meal breaks and
rest periods, (4) Labor Code section 203 wages, and (5) Labor Code section 226
damages. 
            On
February 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for leave to file an amended
complaint.
LEGAL STANDARD
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “[t]he court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading.”  Amendment may be
allowed at any time before or after commencement of trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
576.) “[T]he court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit
amendment of the pleadings. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” (Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 (internal
citations omitted).) “If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of
the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse
permission to amend . . .”  (Morgan v.
Sup. Ct. (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in
trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v.
Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.) 
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the proposed
amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate
it from previous pleadings or amendments. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a).) The motion must also state what allegations
are proposed to be deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line number.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a).) Finally, a separate supporting declaration
specifying the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and
proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered,
and the reason the request for amendment was not made earlier must also
accompany the motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.134(b).) 
DISCUSSION 
            As
a preliminary matter, the court notes that Defendant has filed for bankruptcy.
When an individual or corporation files for bankruptcy, all legal proceedings
against the bankrupt are stayed under the ‘automatic stay’ provision of the
bankruptcy law. (See 11 U.S.C., § 362, subd. (a)(1); Rubin v. Ross (2021)
65 Cal.App.5th 153, 163-164.) But the stay does not apply to entities other
than the debtor, such a corporate affiliates, corporate officers, codefendants,
guarantors, or general partners. (Higgins v. Superior Court (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 973, 979-980.) In addition to Defendant, Plaintiff’s complaint
lists Gloria Moon as a defendant. Moreover, the proposed amended complaint
lists Gloria Laser Center, Inc., Richard Rhee, Michael Phillips, and Kum Ok
Park as defendants. Thus, the stay does not apply to these additional parties
and the court may rule on Plaintiff’s motion. 
            Accordingly,
the court has reviewed the moving papers and finds Plaintiff has complied with
most of the applicable California Rules of Court. Moreover, none of the
Defendants have cited any potential prejudice in a timely opposition. However,
Plaintiff’s proposed amended complaint is not serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1324(a); Lee Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. 5.) 
CONCLUSION 
The
court denies Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file amended complaint without
prejudice.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
