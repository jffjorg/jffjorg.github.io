The Judge grants the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff's responses to the requests for production of documents (RFPs) and imposes sanctions on the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff failed to provide responses to the RFPs, despite Defendant's attempts to meet and confer. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to respond lacked substantial justification and awards the Defendant's counsel fees in the sum of $1,665. The Plaintiff is ordered to provide compliant responses to the RFPs without objections and produce responsive documents within 30 days. The Plaintiff is also ordered to pay the Defendant's counsel fees within 30 days.
