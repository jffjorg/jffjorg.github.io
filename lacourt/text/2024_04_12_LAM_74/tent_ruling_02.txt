 Case Number:  BC487908    Hearing Date:   April 12, 2024    Dept:  74 June Duley
v. Depuy, Inc., et al.
Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) and
Request for Sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND 
            On
July 6, 2012, Plaintiff June Duley (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant Depuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (Defendant). 
            On
October 23, 2023, Defendant propounded requests for production of documents
(set one) (RFPs) on Plaintiff.
            However,
Plaintiff never provided responses.
            Defendant
attempted to meet and confer to no avail.
            On
February 6, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses
to the RFPs.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
DISCUSSION  
            The
court grants this motion because Plaintiff has not responded to the RFPs.
Moreover, sanctions are warranted because Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond
lacked substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Defendant’s counsel’s proposed hourly rate is reasonable, and he has provided a
breakdown of work performed. (Chan Decl., ¶ 7.) Given Plaintiff’s
non-opposition to the motion, though, a substantive reply from Defendant is not
necessary. The court will adjust the award accordingly. ($1,665 = $555 (2 hours
(motion) + 1 hour (preparation for and attendance at hearing).) 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the RFPs.
Plaintiff shall provide Code-compliant responses, without objections, and
produce responsive documents within 30 days of this order. The court grants
Defendant’s request for sanctions. Plaintiff shall pay Defendant’s counsel
attorney fees in the sum of $1,665 within 30 days of this order.
Defendant
shall give notice.
