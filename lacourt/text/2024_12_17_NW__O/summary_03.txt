Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Chase Cameron Gardella's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The motion was denied because the Plaintiff failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule of Court, rule 3.1324(b), which requires a declaration specifying when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's motion was procedurally defective and did not address its substantive merits. The case stems from a physical altercation between the Plaintiff and Defendants Justin Goslee and Jack Doherty, which was live-streamed on Defendant Doherty's social media platforms. The Plaintiff is seeking to add two causes of action to his complaint.
