And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's deposition. The defendant, Abigail Van Horn, has failed to attend scheduled depositions and has not provided potential deposition dates to the plaintiff, Nilou Naderi Settimio. The judge finds that this behavior has frustrated the plaintiff's ability to engage in discovery necessary to resolve the six-year-old case. As a result, the judge is ordering the defendant to appear for a deposition on September 26, 2024.

Additionally, the judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for sanctions, ordering the defendant to pay $1,800 in fees for the plaintiff's counsel's work in attempting to obtain the deposition and preparing the motion. The judge has reduced the sanctions from the requested $2,500 due to the lack of opposition from the defendant.
