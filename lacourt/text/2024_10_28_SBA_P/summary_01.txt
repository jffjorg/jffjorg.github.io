And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the first and second causes of action, which are based on alleged breach of oral contract and quiet title. The demurrer is sustained because the allegations do not state a cause of action, and the claims are barred by the statute of frauds and statute of limitations. The motion to strike is granted in its entirety with leave to amend. The Judge grants leave to amend, but the amended complaint must be filed within 20 days.
