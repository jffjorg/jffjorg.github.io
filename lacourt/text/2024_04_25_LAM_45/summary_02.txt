And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has continued the hearing on Defendant Derek Keane's motion for summary judgment to May 31, 2024 to accommodate the taking of Keane's deposition. The plaintiff, Lafayette Apt. Associates, LP, is permitted to submit supplemental opposition papers on or before May 17, 2024, and Keane is permitted to file a supplemental reply on or before May 27, 2024. The court has declined to rule on evidentiary objections filed by the parties due to procedural errors. The plaintiff's failure to include a separate statement with its opposition papers is not a sufficient ground for granting the motion. The court has found that the plaintiff has met the procedural requirements to justify its request for a continuance. The defendant's deposition testimony is necessary for the plaintiff's opposition, and the court has continued the hearing to accommodate the taking of the deposition.
