And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories (Set One) filed by defendant Robert O'Neill. The plaintiff, CR&R, Incorporated, alleges causes of action for common count for account stated, common count for open book account, common count for services rendered, and quantum meruit. The defendant seeks to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 1-3, which request information about the alleged waste disposal services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant. The plaintiff objects to the interrogatories on the grounds that they are vague and violate Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.060 for being compound and disjunctive. The court finds that the plaintiff's objections based on vagueness have merit and denies the defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories.
