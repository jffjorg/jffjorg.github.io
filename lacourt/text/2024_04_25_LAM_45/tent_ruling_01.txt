Motion to Amend Judgment
 
            The court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition was received.
The court GRANTS the motion.
Background
            On July 1, 2019, plaintiff Matthew Dunn
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Terrence Mumford, dba Mr. T’s
Collective, and Mr. T’s Collective LLC (collectively, “Defendants”), alleging
causes of action for (1) Dissolution of Partnership; (2) Injunctive Relief; (3)
Constructive Trust; (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (5) Breach of Contract; (6)
Breach of Contract; (7) Promissory Estoppel; (8) Restitution; (9) Accounting;
and (10) Declaratory Relief.
            On November 10, 2021, the court
entered judgment following a jury trial. 
            On September 15, 2023, the court
entered an amended judgment. 
            On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant unopposed motion to amend the September 15, 2023 judgment to
correct the two clerical errors, i.e., the dates.
Legal
Standard
Under CCP § 473(d), “[t]he court may, upon motion of the injured party,
or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as
entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion
of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order.”
Discussion
Plaintiff moves
to amend the September 15, 2023
judgment to correct the two clerical errors. Specifically, Plaintiff argues
that the September 15, 2023 judgment contains an incorrect date in two places,
on page 2 (lines 10 and 11). The court observes that the judgment states: “This
amended judgment corrects the 11/10/2023 judgment signed by the Deputy Clerk of
Court; it does not modify the Judgment of Special Verdict filed 11/10/2023
containing relief on equitable causes of action.” (9/15/23 Amended Judgment.)
Plaintiff contends the intended date to be referenced is the September 10, 2021
judgment date, and that these errors can be corrected by interlineation as
follows: Page 2, Line 10: Strike “11/10/2023” and insert “11/10/2021”; Page 2,
Line 11: Strike “11/10/2023” and insert “11/10/2021.”
Based on the court file, the “11/10/2023” date was clearly a clerical
error as that date had not even passed yet, and 11/10/2021 is the date of the
prior judgment. Accordingly, the unopposed motion is GRANTED.
 
            It
is so ordered.
