Background
Plaintiff
Lafayette Apt. Associates, L.P. (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Lafayette”) filed
this action on September 2, 2021 against Kristine Rose J. Robles, Kristian
Apple J. Robles, Roselle Poblete, and Derek Keane (“Keane”) (collectively,
“Defendants”), alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract;
and (2) account stated. The complaint alleges that the parties entered into a
lease agreement in May 2019 for the premises located at 401 S. Lafayette Park
Place, Unit 206, Los Angeles, CA 90057. (Compl. at pg. 3; Exh. 1.) Defendants
allegedly breached the agreement on May 1, 2020 by failing to pay rent. (Id.
at pg. 3, ¶ BC-2.) Defendants allegedly owe to date a total of $39,802.47 in
past due rent. (Id. at ¶ BC-4.)
On December 6,
2022, Keane filed a Cross-Complaint on December 6, 2022 against Lafayette and
his co-defendants, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Retaliatory
Eviction; and (2) Contribution. The Cross-Complaint alleges Lafayette
unlawfully evicted Keane based on his inability to pay under the
then-applicable Civil Code § 1942.5(d). (Cross-Compl. ¶ 9.) Keane alleges the
eviction was wrongful since the three-day notice overstated the amount that was
actually due. (Id. at ¶ 10.) The eviction was also wrongful because the
tenants were protected by Civil Code § 1511, as their ability to pay rent
starting in March 2020 was attributable to governmental regulations. (Id.
at ¶ 11.) Further, Keane alleges the eviction violated the City and County
Covid eviction moratoria, the Tenant Relief Act of 2020 and the Tenant
Protection Act of 2019. (Id. at ¶ 12.)
On February 6,
2023, Keane filed the instant motion for summary judgment directed at
Plaintiff’s complaint.[1]
On April 11,
2024, Plaintiff filed its opposition to the instant motion. Thereafter, on
April 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed its untimely supplemental opposition papers. 
On April 17,
2024, Keane filed his reply. 
 
Legal
Standard
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) In
analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step
analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine
whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine
whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material
factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade
Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)
            As
to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary
judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate
an essential element, or to establish a defense. (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) A motion for summary judgment must be denied where the
moving party's evidence does not prove all material facts, even in the absence
of any opposition (Leyva v. Sup. Ct. (1985)
164 Cal.App.3d 462, 475) or where the opposition is weak (Salesguevara v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 379, 384,
387).
 
Evidentiary
Objections
The Court declines to rule on
all the evidentiary objections filed by the parties for failure to comply with
procedural requirements. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1354(b)-(c) [requirement
of two separate documents, i.e., evidentiary objections and a proposed order on
those objections]; Hodjat v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co.
(2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1, 9 [trial court not required to give a second chance
at filing properly formatted papers].) In any event, the subject portions are
not material to the Court’s disposition of the motion and the improper legal
opinion does not have persuasive effect in a declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (q).)
 
Discussion
A.   
Procedural Issue
As a preliminary
issue, Plaintiff has failed to include a separate statement along with its
opposing papers. While a separate statement is referenced on the caption pages
of its moving papers, it does not appear that one has been filed. “Failure to
comply with this requirement of a separate statement may constitute a
sufficient ground, in the court's discretion, for granting the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c(b)(3).) In this instance, the Court declines to grant Keane’s
motion on this procedural error. Instead, the Court shall continue the matter
in order to permit Plaintiff to resubmit its separate statement. 
B.   
Continuance Request
In connection
with its untimely filed supplemental opposition, Plaintiff seek a continuance
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 437c(h). Even
though this request was untimely made, the
court has broad discretion to overlook late-served papers and to resolve the
matter on the merits.  (E.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d); Gonzalez
v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th
162, 168 [“(E)ven if the service had been untimely, the trial court was
vested with discretion to overlook the defect”]; Bozzi v. Nordstrom (2010)
186 Cal.App.4th 755, 765.) 
Code of Civil Procedure § 437(h) states: “If it appears from the
affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication, or both, that facts essential to justify opposition may exist but
cannot, for reasons stated, be presented, the court shall deny the motion,
order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had,
or make any other order as may be just.”
Plaintiff contends that additional time is needed before Keane’s motion
for summary judgment can be heard because Keane has been uncooperative by
refusing to participate in his deposition. (Supplemental Opposition at pg. 4;
Williamson Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.) Plaintiff asserts that Keane’s deposition is
necessary because his testimony is needed to determine whether the rental
agreement was signed by all Defendants as testified by Roselie Poblete in her
deposition or had Keane been an unauthorized sublessee. (Williamson Suppl.
Decl. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff also claims, if this was an instance of an unauthorized
subletting situation, Keane’s deposition testimony is necessary to determine
the terms of that agreement and why Keane believes that there was no account
stated between the parties despite the transaction history between and among
them. (Id. at ¶ 10.) As represented by Plaintiff, Keane’s
third scheduled deposition is scheduled for May 1, 2024. (Id. at ¶ 13.)
Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met the
procedural requirements to justify its request pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 437c(h). Considering Keane’s motion for summary judgment is
premised on the contention that he was not a party to the lease agreement and
was not referenced in the account stated, Keane’s deposition testimony
regarding these issues are essential for Plaintiff’s opposition. Therefore, a
continuance is warranted. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court continues the instant motion to May 31, 2024 in order to accommodate the taking of
Keane’s deposition. Plaintiff is permitted to submit its supplemental
opposition papers on or before May 17, 2024. Keane is permitted to file a
supplemental reply on or before May 27, 2024.
 
It is so
ordered.
