```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the plaintiff's unopposed motion to amend the judgment to correct two clerical errors. The errors are related to dates that were incorrectly stated in the judgment. The court grants the motion and orders that the judgment be corrected to reflect the correct dates. The court observes that the judgment states that it corrects the November 10, 2021 judgment, not the November 10, 2023 date that was incorrectly stated. The court finds that the "11/10/2023" date was a clerical error, as that date had not yet passed, and that the correct date is November 10, 2021.
