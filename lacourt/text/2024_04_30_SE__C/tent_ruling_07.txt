Tentative Ruling 
Defendant CR&R Inc.’s Motions to Compel
Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (set one), Special Interrogatories
(set one) and Request for Production of Documents (set one) are CONTINUED to June
18, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. 
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Background 
Plaintiff Orlando Beasley (“Plaintiff”) filed this personal
injury lawsuit on October 25, 2023, alleging he was struck on his bicycle by a
negligent motorist who was driving a vehicle owned by Defendant CR&R Inc.
(“Defendant”). (Complaint, ¶¶ 2, 12.)  
On December 7, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories (set one), Special Interrogatories (set one), and Request for
Production of Documents (set one). (McLean Decl., ¶ 4.) On January 4, 2024, Defendant
agreed to a 30-day extension for Plaintiff to respond. (Id., ¶ 6.) On
January 22, 2024, Plaintiff served responses to Defendant’s discovery requests.
(Id., ¶ 7.) Defendant believed the responses were inadequate and offered
an extension to February 5, 2024. (Id., ¶ 8.) Not having received further
responses, Defendant filed the instant motions March 25, 2024.  On April 17, 2024, Plaintiff served further
discovery responses. (Gill Decl., ¶ 4.)
Meet and Confer Requirement 
A
motion¿to compel further responses to requests for production “shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the motion.¿
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  
 
The Court finds that parties have satisfied the meet and
confer requirement. 
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further
responses requires a separate statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly filed separate statements.
Legal Standard 
A party may make a demand to propound interrogatories
without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of the summons on,
or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs
first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required
to respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are
allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in
writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.070, subd. (a) - (b).) 
If a party fails to timely respond to interrogatories, the
party to whom the request is directed waives any right to exercise the option
to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any
objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  
The party who propounded the discovery request may bring a
motion to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories,
unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
Analysis

Defendant moves for an order to compel further responses to
Form Interrogatories (set one), Special Interrogatories (set one), and Request
for Production (set one).  
After this motion was brought, Plaintiff served further
responses on April 17, 2024. (Gill Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff contends that
Defendant’s motions are now moot. Defendant contends that many responses are
still deficient. 
Defendant’s motions are CONTINUED to June 18, 2024.  The parties are ORDERED to make further
efforts to resolve the issues newly presented. If, after exhausting those
efforts, court intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits
on the continued hearing date. If counsel are unable to informally resolve
their discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit a JOINT
STATEMENT no later than noon on June 11, 2024, with a detailed outline of the
remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required.
