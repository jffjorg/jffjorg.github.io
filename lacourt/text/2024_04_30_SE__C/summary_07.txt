And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The defendant's motions to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents are continued to June 18, 2024. The parties are ordered to make further efforts to resolve the issues newly presented. If, after exhausting those efforts, court intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date. If counsel are unable to informally resolve their discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit a joint statement no later than noon on June 11, 2024, with a detailed outline of the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required."
