II.       
Defendant MED (DE) LLC’s Motions to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories (set one), Requests for Production (set one),
and Special Interrogatories (set one) as to Plaintiff BRIANA WINGO are ADVANCED
from May 1, 2024 to this date and GRANTED. 
Plaintiff is ordered to serve responses without objections in 20
days.  Sanctions are DENIED.
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Defendant MED (DE) (“Defendant”) owns and operates an
apartment complex that consists of two hundred and fifty-seven apartment units.
Plaintiffs are tenants in the building. Plaintiffs allege they have experienced
various problems with the building, rendering it uninhabitable and breaching
the implied warranty of quiet enjoyment and habitability. 
Defendant moves to compel initial discovery of Form
Interrogatories (set one), Requests for Production (set one), and Special
Interrogatories (set one) against Plaintiffs Adolfo Cruz Fentanez and Briana
Wingo (collectively “Plaintiffs”). 
Defendant
alleges that as of the date the motions were filed, no discovery responses had
been provided to any of the requests.  
 
The motions are
unopposed as of April 26, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
The party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion
to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion

On June 15, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiffs with form
interrogatories, request for production, and special interrogatories via
electric mail. (Lezon Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Ex. A.) Responses were due on or before
July 20, 2023. (Id., ¶ 4.) Defendant granted an extension
to September 14, 2023.  (Id., ¶ 5).  Despite this extension, Defendant has not
received responses. (Id., ¶ 6.)
Because
Plaintiffs have failed to respond to the discovery requests, Plaintiffs are
ordered to serve responses without objection, including
objections based on privilege or on the protection for work product, within 20
days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300 subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  For interrogatories, the
failure to respond also waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230. 
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motions as to Plaintiffs Adolfo Cruz
Fentanez and Briana Wingo are
GRANTED.  
Sanctions 
Discovery sanctions may not be imposed under Section
2023.030, even together with Section 2023.010, absent another provision of the
Discovery Act that authorizes the imposition of sanctions. (City of L. A. v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 500.)
Sanctions with respect to interrogatories and requests for production of
documents are only authorized against a party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel responses. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.
(c); Code of Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, sanctions are denied
because the motions are unopposed.
