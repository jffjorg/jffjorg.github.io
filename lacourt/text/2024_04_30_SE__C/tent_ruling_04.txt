Barmaan vs City of Huntington Park, et al., Case No. 23NWCP00134
This action was
originally filed as a Petition for Administrative Mandamus under CCP §
1094.5.  Cross-Complainant City of Huntington Park has filed a
cross-compliant for public nuisance.  Cross-Complainant applies ex parte
to advance the hearing date on its motion for preliminary injunction currently
scheduled for October 23, 2024.  Cross-Complainant argues there is good
cause for a preliminary injunction because the Subject Property’s existing Code
violations present clear risks to the occupants and community. (Bollier Decl.,
¶ 18.)  However, Cross-Complainant fails to allege sufficient facts to
support this contention.  Nevertheless, in the exercise of the Court’s
discretion, the hearing date is ADVANCED from October 23, 2024 to today’s date
and CONTINUED to July 31, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  
Moving Party to
give notice.
