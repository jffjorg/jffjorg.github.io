Tentative Ruling 
Defendant City of Sante Fe Springs’ Demurrer is
CONTINUED to May 21, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Defendant City of Santa Fe Springs (“Defendant”) demurs to the
second cause of action in the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed by Plaintiffs
Vanessa Duran and Gia Esquivel (collectively “Plaintiffs”) on the grounds that
1) it fails to plead facts sufficient to plead a cause of action and 2) it
fails to adhere to the requirements set forth by the California Tort Claims Act.  
Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s late filed opposition
has prejudiced its ability to prepare a substantive reply.  So that Defendant may have an opportunity to respond
fully to the opposition brief, the hearing is CONTINUED to Tuesday, May 21,
2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  Defendant’s
reply is due no later than May 7, 2024.  No
additional filings by Plaintiff will be permitted.
