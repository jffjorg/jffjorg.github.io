Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the Complaint. The Plaintiff, George Garibay, alleges that the Defendant, Maria Chavez, has not paid rent since August 2022. The case was dismissed on January 10, 2024, without prejudice. The Plaintiff moved to set aside the dismissal on March 6, 2024, citing mistake and excusable neglect. The Judge found that the motion was timely and granted the relief sought. The Plaintiff was ordered to file and serve an amended complaint, which was submitted on April 29, 2024. The Judge deemed the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint to be filed on April 30, 2024. The Defendant, Maria Chavez, opposed the motion, arguing that the dismissal was without prejudice and that she would be prejudiced if the motion was granted. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff's statutory right to set aside the dismissal was timely asserted and that the Defendant had not articulated sufficient prejudice to deny the relief sought.
