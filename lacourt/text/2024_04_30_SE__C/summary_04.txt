And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to advance the hearing date for the motion for preliminary injunction from October 23, 2024 to July 31, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The City of Huntington Park, the cross-complainant, has applied to advance the hearing date, citing a risk to the occupants and community due to existing Code violations. However, the court finds that the cross-complainant has failed to provide sufficient facts to support its contention. Despite this, the court has exercised its discretion to advance the hearing date.
