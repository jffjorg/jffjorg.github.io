And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Har-Bro West, Inc.'s Motion to Enforce Settlement and for an award of Interest and Attorney's Fees. Defendant Michael Hakim is ordered to pay the remaining Settlement Agreement principal amount of $9,237.02, plus attorney's fees of $6,900.75, plus $1,923.34 in prejudgment interest. The court has determined that Hakim failed to pay the mandated four percent credit card service fee of $129.24 for the October 2023 payment and had not paid the February and March 2023 payments. The court has also determined that Hakim failed to timely cure multiple payments, including the October 2023, February 2024, and March 2024 payments, and thus per Settlement Agreement Section 1.G, the balance of the remaining payments has become immediately due and payable. The court has ordered Hakim to pay the remaining Settlement Agreement principal amount, plus interest and attorney's fees, as per the Settlement Agreement.
