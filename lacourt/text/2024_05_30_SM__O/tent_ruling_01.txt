  Case Number:  19SMCV01587    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  O   Case  Name:  Har-Bro West, Inc. v. Hakim, et al.    Case No.:   19SMCV01587   Complaint Filed:   9-11-19                Hearing Date:   5-30-24    Discovery C/O:   N/A     Calendar No.:   10   Discovery Motion C/O:   N/A     POS:   OK    Trial Date:   None    SUBJECT:                 MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT MOVING  PARTY:   Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant  Har-Bro West, Inc. RESP.  PARTY:         Defendant Michael Hakim     TENTATIVE  RULING             Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Har-Bro West, Inc.’s Motion to  Enforce Settlement and for an award of Interest and Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED.  Defendant Michael Hakim is ordered to pay the remaining Settlement Agreement principal amount of $9,237.02, plus attorney’s fees of $6,900.75 ($3,362.00 initial work  to enforce settlement + $3,120 to bring this motion [6 hrs. @ $280 + 4 hrs. @  $360]), plus $1,923.34 in prejudgment interest, totaling $18,061.11 pursuant to  the 8-7-23 Settlement Agreement and CCP § 664.6.                “Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 allows the court  to enter a stipulated judgment in settlement of a case, and to retain  jurisdiction to enforce the settlement.” (Ironridge Glob. IV, Ltd. v.  ScripsAmerica, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 259, 267.)  Furthermore, “[a] person who is entitled to recover  damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right  to recover which is vested in the person upon a particular day, is entitled also to  recover interest thereon from that day.” (Civ. Code, § 3287.)  “[T]he court has no discretion, but must  award prejudgment interest upon request, from the day there exists both a  breach and a liquidated claim.” (Glassman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of  America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1281, 1314–1315, as modified (May 17, 2023).) The Court can  “invoke its power to levy such prejudgment interest as it deems just and  equitable.” (Segura v. McBride (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1041.)               “In any action on a contract, where the contract  specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to  enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the  prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing  on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or  not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other  costs.” (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a); see also CCP § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10(A)  [stating prevailing parties are entitled to recover their attorney's fees as an  element of costs where such fees are authorized by contract].)               Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Har-Bro West, Inc. (“Har-Bro”) and  Defendant Michael Hakim (“Hakim”) executed a settlement agreement on 8-7-23  whereby Hakim was to pay Har-Bro a total settlement amount of $55,000 in  installment payments beginning with a $5,000 payment by 9-8-23, “then monthly  payments of $4,166.67 . . . due on the first of each month until the $55,000  payment has been paid in full.” (Feldman Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A, “Settlement  Agreement” § 1.) The monthly payments had a five-day grace period to cure any  late payment, and if Hakim failed to cure, “the balance of remaining payment  will be immediately due and payable.” (Ibid.) Upon filing this motion,  Har-Bro declared and provided evidence that Hakim failed to pay the mandated  four percent credit card service fee of $129.24 for the October 2023 payment. (Feldman  Decl., ¶¶ 4–6; Ex. B, C.) Additionally, Hakim had not paid the February and  March 2023 payments. (Feldman Decl., ¶¶ 8–12; Ex. F–I.)                In Har-Bro’s Reply filed on 5-21-24, Har-Bro declares  that on 4-9-24 Hakim paid Har-Bro $12,112.77, after $387.24 in credit card fees  were deducted from the payment, as payment February, March, and April 2023.  (Feldman Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 3–5, Ex. L, M.) On 5-7-24 Hakim paid an additional  $12,112.77, with $387.24 in credit card fees deducted from the payment, , after  Hakim’s counsel informed Har-Bro to use the same “authorization from the prior  month of April.” (Feldman Suppl. Decl., ¶¶ 6–10: Ex. Q–U.)               As of 5-21-23, Hakim had paid a total of $45,762.98 of  the principle ($21,537.44 as of initial motion filing + $12,112.77 February –  April 2024 payments + $12,112.77 May 2024 payment), and thus Hakim owes $9,237.02  in principle plus interest and attorney’s fees as per the settlement agreement.  (Feldman Suppl. Decl., ¶ 11(a)–(c).) Hakim has failed to timely cure multiple  payments including the October 2023, February 2024 and March 2024 payments and  thus per Settlement Agreement Section 1.G “the balance of the remaining  payments [became] immediately due and payable.” (Gute Decl, ¶ 2; Ex A, § 1,  subd. (G).)               Section 5 of the settlement agreement between Har-Bro and  Hakim states that any "party obtaining enforcement of this settlement  agreement pursuant to [California] Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 shall be  entitled to reasonable attorney's fees." (Gute Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A; Feldman  Decl., ¶ 2, Ex A.) Har-Bro has moved to obtain enforcement of the settlement  and thus are entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees of $6,900.75 ($3,362.00  initial work to enforce settlement  +  $3,120 to bring this motion [6 hrs. @ $280 + 4 hrs. @ $360].) (Feldman Decl., ¶¶  15–17: Ex. J, K.)               Har-Bro has requested an adjusted prejudgment interest of  $1,923.34 ($1,742.30 [10-9-23 to 4-16-24] + $122.85 [4-16-24 to 5-7-24] +  $58.19 [5-7-24 to 5-30-24].) (Feldman Suppl. Decl., ¶¶ 11(a)–(c), 12.) Hakim  provides no authority as to why he should not be mandated to pay the credit  card fees, and further Hakim first breached the Settlement Agreement on 10-9-23,  thus prejudgment interest is proper in this instance and mandatory upon  request. (See Civ. Code, § 3287.)
