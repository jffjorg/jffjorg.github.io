HEARING ON
CLAIM OF EXEMPTION
 
Notice of Hearing on Claim of Exemption filed
11/14/23.
 
JUDGMENT CREDITOR: Plaintiff Magdalena V. Guerrero
JUDGMENT DEBTOR: Defendant Yesenia Guerrero
CLAIMANT: Hugo M. Cervantes (Defendant/Judgment Debtor’s
spouse)
NOTICE: ok
 
RULING: The claim of exemption is denied.  
 
On 8/14/19, Judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff
Magdalena V. Guerrero (Plaintiff) and against Defendant Yessenia Guerrero
(Defendant) in the amount of $74,386.07. 
On 11/6/23, Defendant’s spouse, Hugo M. Cervantes submitted a Claim of
Exempt on claiming that an unidentified “personal checking account” at Wells
Fargo is exempt from being used to satisfy the judgment pursuant CCP 704.070.
 
On 11/14/23, Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of
Hearing on Claim of Exemption and Opposition to the Claim of Exemption. 
 
CCP 704.070 provides: 
 
“(a) As used in this section:
(1) ‘Earnings withholding order’
means an earnings withholding order under Chapter 5 (commencing with Section
706.010) (Wage Garnishment Law).
(2) ‘Paid earnings’ means earnings
as defined in Section
706.011 that were paid to the employee during the 30-day period ending
on the date of the levy. For the purposes of this paragraph, where earnings
that have been paid to the employee are sought to be subjected to the
enforcement of a money judgment other than by a levy, the date of levy is
deemed to be the date the earnings were otherwise subjected to the enforcement
of the judgment.
(3) ‘Earnings assignment order for
support’ means an earnings assignment order for support as defined in Section
706.011.
(b) Paid earnings that can be
traced into deposit accounts or in the form of cash or its equivalent as
provided in Section
703.080 are exempt in the following amounts:
(1) All of the paid earnings are
exempt if prior to payment to the employee they were subject to an earnings
withholding order or an earnings assignment order for support.
(2) Disposable
earnings that would otherwise not be subject to levy under Section
706.050 that are levied upon or otherwise sought to be
subjected to the enforcement of a money judgment are exempt if prior to payment
to the employee they were not subject to an earnings withholding order or an
earnings assignment order for support.”
 
The funds being held by Wells Fargo are pursuant to a
bank levy, not a wage garnishment. 
Claimant does not assert that the funds ($100,149.50) held by the
Garnishee (Wells Fargo Bank) pursuant to the Memorandum of Garnishee constitute
wages earned within the past 30 days.  In
fact, Claimant asserts that his monthly income is $0.00.  Therefore, the funds at issue cannot qualify
as exempt wages of Claimant.  
 
A creditor, such as Plaintiff, may levy on bank accounts
in the name of the debtor’s spouse whether they are in the name of spouse alone
or together with other third parties as long as an affidavit was delivered to
the financial institution at the time of levy showing that person is the
judgment debtor’s spouse.  CCP
700.160(b)(2).  It is not necessary to name
the non-debtor spouse as a defendant in the action to enforce the judgment
against the debtor’s community property. 
See CCP 700.160; Family Code 910.
 
Claimant has failed to establish that the subject funds
are exempt.
