And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the claim of exemption filed by Yesenia Guerrero's spouse, Hugo M. Cervantes, regarding $100,149.50 held by Wells Fargo Bank. The funds were levied upon by the plaintiff, Magdalena V. Guerrero, in an effort to enforce a judgment entered in her favor against Yesenia Guerrero in the amount of $74,386.07. The court determined that the funds do not qualify as exempt wages under CCP 704.070 because they were not earned within the past 30 days and the claimant, Hugo M. Cervantes, does not have any income. Additionally, the court held that a creditor may levy on bank accounts in the name of the debtor's spouse, even if the spouse is not a defendant in the action, as long as an affidavit is delivered to the financial institution showing that the person is the judgment debtor's spouse.
