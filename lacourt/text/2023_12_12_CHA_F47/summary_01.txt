Summary in English text:

The Judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Defendants Fortune Energy, Inc., Fortune Energy Distribution, Inc., Fortune Energy Distribution Corp., and F.E. Distribution Inc. to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Southwest Marine and General Insurance Company. The Judge has found that the demurrer is defective and fails to state each ground for demurrer in a separate paragraph, and does not indicate whether each ground for demurrer applies to the entire complaint or to specified causes of action. The Judge has also found that the demurrer fails to include a statement of facts in the memorandum of points and authorities, and incorrectly states the date of filing of the First Amended Complaint. The Judge has therefore overruled the demurrer and ordered the Defendants to file an answer within 30 days. The Judge has also found that the First Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for breach of contract and indemnity, and that the claims are not time-barred.
