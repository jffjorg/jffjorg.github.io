SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of payments made by Plaintiff
Southwest Marine and General Insurance Company (Plaintiff) as surety on a
Customs Bond issued by Plaintiff on behalf of Defendant Fortune Energy,
Inc.  On 2/1/23, Plaintiff filed this
action against Defendant Fortune Energy, Inc. and Defendants Fortune Energy Distribution, Inc.; Fortune Energy
Distribution Corp.; and F.E. Distribution Inc., as the alter egos of
Fortune Energy, Inc.  (collectively,
Defendants), for breach of contract and indemnity.  In response to a demurrer to the original
complaint, on 6/5/23, Plaintiff filed the subject First Amended Complaint which
alleges the same two causes of action.  
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Defendants had with the First Amended Complaint, on 7/25/23, Defendants
filed and served the instant demurrer. 
Plaintiff has opposed the demurrer and Defendants have filed a reply to
the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Procedural Defects
 
The demurrer fails to state each ground for demurrer in a
separate paragraph.  (See
Demurrer, p.ii:7-16);  CRC
3.1320(a).  The demurrer also fails to
indicate whether each ground for demurrer applies to the entire complaint or to
specified causes of action.  Id.  Additionally, the memorandum of points and
authorities filed in support of the demurrer does not include a statement of
the facts of the case.  See CRC
3.1113(b).  Further, the demurrer
indicates that it addresses the First Amended Complaint filed on 2/1/23 when
the First Amended Complaint was actually filed on 6/5/23.  (See Demurrer, p.1:3-5).
 
Merits
 
A demurrer may be based on the following grounds, among
others: the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action; the pleading is uncertain; and in an action based on a contract, it
cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written oral,
or implied by conduct.  CCP 430.10(e),
(f), (g).  
 
For purposes of demurrer, all properly pleaded facts are
accepted as true.  Align Technology,
Inc. (2009) 179 CA4th 949, 958.  In
ruling on a demurrer, the Court considers the allegations in the complaint and matters
of which it is required to or may take judicial notice.  CCP 430.30(a); Groves (2002) 100 CA4th
659, 667.
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are:
(1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach and (4) the resulting damage to the
plaintiff.  Richman (2014) 224
CA4th 1182, 1186.  Plaintiff has
sufficiently alleged the existence and terms of a written contract between the
parties based on the Customs Bond Application & Indemnity and Customs Bond
incorporated in and attached to the First Amended Complaint as Exhibits A and
B.  (See FAC ¶¶10, 12).  The allegations in the First Amended
Complaint are sufficient to establish that the breach of contract claim is
based on both of the foregoing documents. 
Plaintiff has also sufficiently alleged its performance or excuse for
non-performance under the contract, Defendants’ breach and damages to Plaintiff
as a result.  (FAC ¶¶11, 13-15).
 
Similarly, the First Amended Complaint alleges sufficient
facts to state a cause of action for indemnity as an alternative and cumulative
remedy.
 
It cannot be determined from the face of the pleading or
matters of which judicial notice has been requested or can be taken, that the
claims asserted in the First Amended Complaint are time barred.  
 
Plaintiff has alleged a sufficient basis to name
Defendants Fortune Energy Distribution, Inc.; Fortune Energy Distribution
Corp.; and F.E. Distribution Inc. as defendants in this action based on an
alter ego theory of liability.  (See
FAC ¶¶2-5, 7).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled.  Answer is due within 30 days.
