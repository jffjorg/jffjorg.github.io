And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants the Defendant's motion for summary judgment in this Unruh action. The Plaintiff, Allan J. Williams II, claims that the Defendant, Steven D. Lin, MD, failed to make his website accessible to him because the video on the website did not have closed captioning. However, the Defendant argues that the website has been redesigned and the subject video has been removed, and that the Plaintiff's claims fail because he was required, but failed, to request captioning prior to filing suit.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's claims are barred because he failed to request captioning prior to filing suit, and that the Defendant's redesign of the website and removal of the video moots the Plaintiff's claims. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's claims fail because he did not face any impediments to access on the website, and that he was not a bona fide patron. Finally, the Court finds that the Defendant's policy of providing a video and written description of the information in the video was facially neutral.

Accordingly, the Court grants the Defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismisses the Plaintiff's claims. The Court orders the Defendant's counsel to give notice of this ruling.
