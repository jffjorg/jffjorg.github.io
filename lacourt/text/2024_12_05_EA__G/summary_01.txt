As for the summary in English text, here it is:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by Rajesh Thakkar and Nidhi Mittal to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) filed by Humble Retailers, Inc. and Satish Mahajan. The Judge has sustained the demurrers with twenty (20) days leave to amend.

The case involves a contractual fraud action, where Thakkar and Mittal purchased a liquor store from defendants in 2022, but allegedly found several issues with the store, including a defective walk-in cooler and fire safety violations. The defendants allegedly failed to disclose material risks and refused to return the down payment.

The Judge found that the SACC failed to adequately plead a cause of action for breach of contract, conversion, specific performance, and declaratory relief. The Judge held that the SACC did not make clear the relationship between Satish Mahajan and Humble Retailers, nor did it adequately allege a cause of action for breach of contract and specific performance.

The Judge also found that the SACC failed to establish the existence of an actual controversy regarding the parties' obligations under the purchase agreement. Therefore, the Judge sustained the demurrers and gave the parties twenty (20) days to amend their pleadings.
