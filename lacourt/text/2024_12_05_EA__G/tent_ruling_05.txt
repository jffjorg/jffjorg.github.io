for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff State Farm General Insurance Company’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is an insurance subrogation action. In October 2023, a water filter cartridge
that was manufactured, designed, distributed, inspected, supplied, serviced,
sold, installed, or repaired by Defendant Ecolife Technologies, Inc. (Ecolife),
doing business as Waterdrop Filter, failed and caused water damage to a
property in Azusa. Plaintiff State Farm General Insurance Company (State Farm)
provided property insurance coverage for the owner of the Azusa property and
reimbursed the property owner for the damage caused.
On June
7, 2024, State Farm filed a complaint against Ecolife and Does 1-20 alleging
the following causes of action: (1) negligence, (2) strict products liability,
and (3) breach of implied warranties. On June 14, 2024, State Farm’s process
server served Ecolife with substitute service in Ontario.
On September
23, 2024, the court entered default against Ecolife after they failed to file a
timely answer. On November 26, 2024, State Farm submitted the present
application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for December 5, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
State
Farm seeks default judgment against Ecolife in the total amount of $52,611.19,
including $50,578.78 in damages, $1,464.71 in interest, and $567.70 in costs. Because
the court finds State Farm has submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS
State Farm’s application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, State
Farm’s application for default judgment is GRANTED.
