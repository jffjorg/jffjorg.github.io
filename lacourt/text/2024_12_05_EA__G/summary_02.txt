And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Herbert Bagoro Amanya's application for default judgment against Roy Martin II without prejudice. Amanya seeks $272,123.57 in damages and costs, but the court has denied the application due to several defects. First, Amanya's application for default judgment does not list any damages or costs in paragraph two of the form. Second, the amount of damages sought ($271,000.00) exceeds the amount requested in the complaint ($262,000.00). The court notes that a party may not obtain damages in a default judgment that exceed the amount requested in the complaint. Amanya will need to correct these defects and resubmit the application for default judgment.
