The settlement agreement was reached between the parties, but the court cannot determine the reasonableness of the requested attorney fees of $185,000.00 without more information. Therefore, the court orders the counsel for Cataleya Guzman to file a supplemental declaration in support of the request for attorney fees no later than nine court days before the hearing scheduled in Department G (Pomona). The court will continue the hearing to a date to be determined.
