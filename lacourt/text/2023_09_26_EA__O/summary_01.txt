Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint does not sufficiently state a cause of action for elder abuse, professional negligence, reckless neglect, violation of patient's bill of rights, and wrongful death. The court has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to correct the deficiencies.

The court has also sustained the demurrer as to the third cause of action for violation of patient's bill of rights, as the plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to support the claim.

The court has sustained the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action for wrongful death, as the complaint does not allege any facts concerning the cause of decedent's death.

The court has also ruled that the motion to strike punitive damages and attorney fees is MOOT, as the demurrer has been sustained and the plaintiff will have the opportunity to amend the complaint.

Overall, the court has determined that the plaintiff's complaint does not sufficiently state a cause of action for the claims alleged, and has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to correct the deficiencies.

And here is a summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Gardenview Healthcare & Wellness Centre, LP. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the pleadings in the complaint filed by the plaintiff, DMARIO FINCH, on behalf of himself and the estate of NOVELLA HOWARD.

The court has sustained the demurrer in its entirety with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has the opportunity to refile the complaint with additional or revised allegations. The court has also held that the motion to strike punitive damages is MOOT, as the demurrer has been sustained with leave to amend.

The court's ruling is based on its finding that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state sufficient facts to establish a cause of action for elder abuse, violation of the patient's bill of rights, and wrongful death. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff's allegations do not demonstrate conscious disregard, causation, or ratification, as required by California law.

The court has given leave to amend the complaint, allowing the plaintiff to refile the complaint with additional or revised allegations. The parties have 10 days to file a response to the tentative ruling.

## Case Summary:

**Case Number:** 22PSCV01557

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Department:** O

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** DMARIO FINCH (Individually and as Successor in Interest to NOVELLA HOWARD, Deceased)
* **Defendant:** GARDENVIEW HEALTHCARE & WELLNESS CENTRE, LP, previously DBA CLAREMONT GARDENS HEALTHCARE & WELLNESS CENTER, ERRONEOUSLY SUED AS COUNTRY VILLA CLAREMONT HEALTHCARE CENTER, INC.

**Dispute:** Alleged elder abuse


**Judge's Ruling:**  The judge sustained the defendant's demurrer (a legal challenge to the plaintiff's complaint) in its entirety with leave to amend. This means the plaintiff has the opportunity to revise their complaint to address the judge's concerns.

**Key Issues:**

* **Elder Abuse (2nd Cause of Action):** The judge found the plaintiff's allegations of elder abuse insufficient because they did not adequately demonstrate:
    * **Conscious Disregard:** The plaintiff failed to show the defendant acted with a conscious disregard for the elderly woman's health and safety. 
    * **Causation:** The plaintiff did not connect the defendant's alleged actions to the woman's death.
    * **Ratification:** The plaintiff did not clearly identify which employee(s) were responsible for the alleged abuse and whether the corporate defendant was aware of their actions.
* **Violation of Patient's Bill of Rights (3rd Cause of Action):** The judge found the plaintiff's complaint lacked specific facts to demonstrate which rights were violated by the defendant.
* **Wrongful Death (4th Cause of Action):** The judge found the plaintiff's complaint insufficient because it did not connect the defendant's actions to the woman's death.

**Motions:**

* The defendant's motion to strike punitive damages related to the elder abuse cause of action and the motion to strike attorney fees related to the violation of patient's bill of rights cause of action were deemed moot because of the ruling on the demurrer.


**Next Steps:**

The plaintiff can amend their complaint to address the judge's concerns.
