```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant argues that the allegations of pressure sores are similar to those in the case of Carter, which held that allegations of neglect and abuse are insufficient for an elder abuse COA. However, the judge finds that the allegations of pressure sores in this case are different from those in Carter, and therefore, Carter is not entirely factually analogous. The judge also notes that the allegations of recklessness and conscious disregard of high probability of injury by the defendant are sufficient to state a cause of action. The defendant's reply does not address the case of Carter and largely reiterates points raised in the demurrer.
