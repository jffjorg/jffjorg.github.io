The defendant argues that the allegations of pressure sores are similar to those in the case of Carter, which held that allegations of neglect and abuse are insufficient for an elder abuse COA. However, the judge finds that the allegations of pressure sores in this case are different from those in Carter, and therefore, Carter is not entirely factually analogous. The judge also notes that the allegations of recklessness and conscious disregard of high probability of injury by the defendant are sufficient to state a cause of action. The defendant's reply does not address the case of Carter and largely reiterates points raised in the demurrer.

## English Summary 

The judge is reviewing a case where a Plaintiff is alleging elder abuse against a Nursing Facility. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's allegations regarding pressure sores are insufficient to support an elder abuse claim. 

The judge cites the *Carter* case, which involved similar allegations of neglect against a skilled nursing facility and a hospital. The court in *Carter* found that allegations of misconduct against one defendant do not automatically apply to another defendant, and that a plaintiff alleging recklessness must also demonstrate that the defendant acted with a "conscious disregard of a high probability of injury." 

The judge notes that the facts in the present case are different from *Carter* and that the Plaintiff's allegations are not as egregious. However, the judge will need to further consider the specific details of the case before making a final ruling.

However, the Judge finds that the allegations in Carter were different, as they involved egregious conduct that led to the development of pressure ulcers, whereas the allegations in this case do not. The Judge notes that in Carter, there were two defendants, a hospital and a skilled nursing facility, whereas in this case there is only one defendant, a nursing facility. The Judge also discusses the requirement that allegations of recklessness must also allege that the decedent was denied services by the defendant(s) "with conscious disregard of high probability of such injury". The Judge's ruling is intended to determine whether the allegations are sufficient for an elder abuse COA.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a future court hearing. The Defendant argues that the allegations of elder abuse are similar to those in the Carter case, but the Judge disagrees. The Carter case involved two defendants, a hospital and a skilled nursing facility, whereas this case only involves one defendant, a nursing facility. The Judge notes that the allegations of neglect in the Carter case were more egregious than those in this case. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff must allege that the Defendant acted with conscious disregard of a high probability of injury in order to establish recklessness. The Judge finds that the allegations in this case do not meet this standard. The Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the Defendant's demurrer may be sustained, but a final ruling will be made after the court hearing.
