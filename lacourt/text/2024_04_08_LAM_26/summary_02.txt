And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is related to a demurrer filed by Defendant LG Aviation Inc. to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Eliezer Appel. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the complaint to state a cause of action. The Court has reviewed the complaint and has made some findings. First, the Court finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges a contract between the parties and that the Defendants breached that contract by failing to pay the Plaintiff. Therefore, the demurrer as to the first cause of action for breach of contract is overruled.

Second, the Court finds that the complaint does not adequately plead the claim for quantum meruit. The Court requires more specificity as to the services rendered, the value of those services, and the amount of damages being sought. Therefore, the demurrer as to the second cause of action for quantum meruit is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.

Third, the Court finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges a claim for express and implied indemnity. The Plaintiff has alleged that he incurred costs on behalf of the Defendant and that the Defendant is contractually bound to reimburse him. Therefore, the demurrer as to the third cause of action for express and implied indemnity is overruled.
