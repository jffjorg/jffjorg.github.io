And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the plaintiff, Barry Rosen, to compel the production of certain documents and to order a mandatory special meeting of the Clark Drive Homeowners Association (HOA). The plaintiff claims that the HOA has unreasonably withheld access to financial documents and that a mandatory special meeting is necessary to address issues with the HOA's board of directors.

The judge notes that the plaintiff has provided evidence that the HOA failed to respond to his requests for inspection of financial documents and that the requested documents are related to the issue of whether there are grounds for involuntary dissolution of the HOA.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to show that the HOA unreasonably withheld access to association records under Civil Code section 5235 and grants the plaintiff's request for the production of the requested documents. However, the judge declines to award attorney's fees or impose a civil penalty.

Regarding the motion for a mandatory special meeting, the judge finds that more information is necessary from both parties, particularly regarding the plaintiff's claims that the HOA failed to comply with statutory requirements with regard to the board election. The judge does not make a ruling at this time on the motion and orders the parties to provide additional briefing and evidence.
