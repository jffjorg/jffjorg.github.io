Case #23CHCV02728
 
MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 2/7/24.
 
MINOR: Maya Garcia
GAL: Rosalva Moreno
DEFENDANTS: Denny’s Restaurant; Denshan, Inc.; Dentas,
Inc. and Denjas, Inc.
 
RULING: The petition is denied without prejudice. 
 
This action arises out of an incident that occurred at a
Denny’s restaurant in Sylmar, California. 
On 9/12/21, Minor Plaintiff Maya Garcia (Minor) slipped and fell on a
puddle of water at the Denny’s restaurant. 
Minor suffered injuries to her head and back.    
 
On 9/11/23, Minor through her guardian ad litem, Rosalva
Moreno (Moreno), filed this action against Denny’s Restaurant; Denshan, Inc.; Dentas, Inc. and Denjas, Inc. for
negligence and premises liability.  No
proof of service of the summons and complaint on any of the defendants has been
filed and no defendant has appeared in this action.
 
On 2/7/24, Moreno filed this petition for approval of
compromise of the Minor’s claim.  The
petition indicates that the minor has completely recovered from her injuries
and “Denny’s Restaurant, et al.” have agreed to settle Minor’s claim for
$35,000.00 which is to be paid in full upon approval of the settlement.  
 
The attorney is requesting approval of $7,520.35 in
attorney’s fees and $562.71 in other costs.
 
The petition indicates that $4,355.87 is to be paid for
medical expenses from the settlement.  
 
The petition indicates that $22,561.07 is to be deposited
in an insured blocked account for the benefit of Minor.    
 
The petition suffers from the following defects:
 
(1) The “parent” box is not marked in number 1 of the
petition and number 2 of the proposed order approving the settlement and it
should be according to the guardian ad litem application.
 
(2) The petition indicates that Minor has completely
recovered from her injuries; however, the only medical report dated 1/10/22
indicates that as of 12/15/21 Minor was still suffering from constant cervical
spine pain, thoracic spine pain, constant lumbar spine pain, dizziness,
headache, insomnia, nausea, tinnitus, photophobia and other pain.  (See Petition, No.8.a; Attachment
8).  A report of Minor’s current
condition/prognosis of being completely recovered is not included as
required.  (See Petition, No.8).
(3) Number 5 in the proposed order “Notice has been given
as required by law” is not marked.  The
petition has not been served on the defendants (who have not appeared) or any
other interested party (i.e., lien claimants).
 
(4) There is no Attachment 8a(3) to the proposed order
despite the box being marked.
