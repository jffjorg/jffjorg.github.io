SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea
Peart’s (Plaintiff) purchase of clothing allegedly manufactured by Defendant
Calvin Klein Studio, LLC (Calvin Klein) from Defendant Macy’s Retail Holdings,
LLC (Macy’s) on 9/4/20.  Plaintiff
alleges that shortly after the purchase, while putting on one of the pieces of
clothing, the manufacturer’s tag/label came loose and cut Plaintiff’s eye
causing serious and permanent injury.  As
a result on 8/24/22, Plaintiff filed this action against Macy’s and Calvin
Klein alleging various causes of action.
 
On 12/12/22, Macy’s electronically served Plaintiff with
Form Interrogatories, Set 1; Special Interrogatories, Set 1 and Requests for
Production of Documents, Set 1, making responses due on or before 1/13/23.  (Hall Decls., Ex.A-C).  Plaintiff failed to serve responses.  (Hall Decls.).
 
On 1/27/23, Macy’s counsel sent Plaintiff correspondence
regarding the lack of responses and requesting verified responses without
objections.  (Hall Decls., Ex.D).  Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond and no
responses to the discovery were served. 
(Hall Decls.).  
 
Therefore, on 9/28/23, Macy’s filed and served the
instant motions seeking: (1) An order compelling Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea
Peart to provide verified responses, without objection, to Defendant Macy’s
Retail Holdings, LLC’s Form Interrogatories, Set 1.  Additionally, Macy’s requests sanctions
against Plaintiff and her attorneys of record in the amount of $892.50; (2) An
order compelling Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea Peart to provide verified responses,
without objection, to Defendant Macy’s Retail Holdings, LLC’s Special
Interrogatories, Set 1.  Additionally,
Macy’s requests sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorneys of record in the
amount of $892.50; and 
(3) An order compelling Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea Peart
to provide verified responses, without objection, to Defendant Macy’s Retail
Holdings, LLC’s Requests for Production of Documents,  Set 1. 
Additionally, Macy’s requests sanctions against Plaintiff and her
attorneys of record in the amount of $892.50. 
On 2/23/24, Plaintiff filed and served oppositions to the motions.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to serve timely responses to
the Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production
of Documents, Macy’s is entitled to responses without objections.  CCP 2030.290(a), (b); CCP 2031.300(a),
(b).  Additionally, Macy’s is entitled to
an award of sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel for their failure to
comply with their discovery obligations. 
CCP 2023.010(d); CCP 2023.030(a); CCP 2030.290(c); CCP 2031.300(c).
 
In the oppositions to the motions, Plaintiff’s counsel
indicates that responses, without objections, to the discovery requests were
served on 2/23/24.  (See Keshishian
Decls., Exs.A).
 
Due to the service of responses, without objections, the
requests for orders compelling such responses are moot.  However, the Court finds that Macy’s is still
entitled to an award of sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel.  Plaintiff’s counsel claims that sanctions
should not be imposed because “Plaintiff has been in and out of the hospital enduring
staph infections and requiring numerous surgeries, unrelated to the injuries
complained about in this action, and unable to assist with the
litigation.”  (See Keshishian  Decls. ¶4). 
Plaintiff’s counsel fails to explain why no response was provided to
Macy’s 1/27/23 meet and confer letter explaining the situation.  The Court finds that a delay of more than a
year in providing the responses is unreasonable, especially considering that
Plaintiff’s counsel failed to communicate the purported issue regarding
providing responses to Macy’s.  
 
Therefore, sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and
her attorneys of record, M&K Attorneys, APC, in the total amount of $1,475.00
for all three motions (6 hours to prepare the motions (2 hours for each motion)
+ ½ hour to review the oppositions + ½ hour to appear = 7 hours multiplied by
$185/hour = $1,295.00 + $180.00 in filing fees ($60.00 for each motion) =
$1,475.00).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The requests to compel responses is denied as moot.  The requests for sanctions is granted in the reduced
total amount of $1,475.00 for all three motions.  Sanctions are payable within 30 days.
