And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's request to compel responses to discovery requests as the plaintiff has now provided the responses, albeit belatedly. However, the judge has granted the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff and her attorneys for their failure to comply with discovery obligations. The judge has imposed sanctions in the amount of $1,475.00, which includes $1,295.00 for the time spent preparing and reviewing the motions and oppositions, as well as $180.00 in filing fees. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's counsel failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay in providing the responses and has found that the delay was unreasonable.
