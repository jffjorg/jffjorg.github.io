The minor, Maya Garcia, slipped and fell on a puddle of water at Denny's restaurant in Sylmar, California, and suffered injuries to her head and back. The defendants, Denny's Restaurant, Denshan, Inc., Dentas, Inc., and Denjas, Inc., have not appeared in the action. The settlement agreement is for $35,000, which will be paid in full upon approval, and includes attorney's fees and other costs.
