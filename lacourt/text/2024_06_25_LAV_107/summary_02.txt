```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to quash service of summons filed by the defendants, Sergio Miramontes and Rosa Miramontes, is granted. The court finds that the plaintiff, Jubilio Escalera, failed to prove that the defendants were properly served with the summons and complaint. The defendants submitted evidence showing that they were not served with the documents at the alleged address, and the process server, Richard Williams, is not a registered California process server. As a result, the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendants and denies the demurrer as moot.
