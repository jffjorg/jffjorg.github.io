COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
(1)
  Quash Service of Summons
(2)
  Demurrer 
 
  
                        



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
Defendants
Sergio
Miramontes and Rosa Miramontes move to quash service of summons and demur to
the complaint filed by plaintiff Jubilio Escalera. This court grants the motion
to quash service of summons and denies the demurrer as moot.
 
I. BACKGROUND
On January 1,
2021, plaintiff Jubilio Escalera agreed to do certain construction work on a property
owned by defendants Sergio Miramontes (“Sergio”) and Rosa Miramontes (“Rosa”
and, together with Sergio, “Defendants”). (Complaint pp. 2–3.) To do so,
Plaintiff furnished certain construction materials, for which Defendants later
refused to pay Plaintiff. (Id. at p. 4.) On May 11, 2022, after completing the
agreed construction work, Plaintiff recorded a mechanic’s lien against
Defendants’ property as Instrument No. 20220514463. (Ibid.)
 
On August 12,
2022, Plaintiff initiated this action by filing a complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging
a single cause of action for foreclosure of mechanic’s lien.
 
Plaintiff filed
proofs of service (the “Proofs of Service”) indicating that the summons and the
Complaint were personally served on each of Defendants on December 21, 2022 at
21025 Costanso Street, Woodland Hills, CA 91364.
 
On May 2, 2024,
Defendants filed a motion to quash service of summons (the “Motion”).
 
On May 16, 2024,
Defendants filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) to the Complaint.
 
II. LEGAL STANDARD
 
A motion to quash service of summons may be brought on
the grounds that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
(Code Civ. Proc., §¿418.10, subd. (a)(1).) “[W]here a defendant properly moves
to¿quash¿service¿of¿summons¿the burden is on the plaintiff to prove facts
requisite to an effective¿service.” (Sheard v. Superior Court (1974) 40
Cal.App.3d 207, 211.) 
 
Personal service may be accomplished by personally
delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the person to be served.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) If the complaint and summons were personally
delivered to, i.e., handed to, defendant then he could be said to have been
“personally served.” (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara, (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 389.) 
 
Filing a proof of service by a registered process
server creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper. (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th 383 at 390;
Evid. Code, § 647 [“The return of a process server registered pursuant to… the
Business and Professions Code upon process or notice establishes a presumption,
affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the
return”].)¿However, the presumption only arises if the proof of service
complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.¿ (Dill v.
Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441–42.)
 
Although the filing of a proof of service by a
registered process server creates a rebuttable presumption that service was
proper (Evid. Code § 647), that presumption may be impeached by contrary
evidence submitted by a defendant. (See, e.g., Fernandes v. Singh (2017)
16 Cal.App.5th 932, 941, fn. 6.)   
  
If service of summons is not properly and validly
effectuated by one or more of the approved methods, California courts lack
personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and any judicial actions taken
without such service violates principles of fundamental due process and is
therefore void. (County. of San Diego v. Gorham (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th
1215, 1231.) 
 
Filing a demurrer does not constitute a general
appearance and does not waive the issue of lack of personal jurisdiction if it
is done after or simultaneous with the filing of a motion to quash service of
summons. (Air Machine Com. SRL v. Superior Court (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th
414, 428; Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (e).)
 
III. DISCUSSION 
 
Defendants argue that the Complaint offends due
process and fails to authorize personal jurisdiction over them because the
Complaint and summons were never effectively served on them. (Motion p. 4.)
Defendants argue that personal service on them at 21025 Constanso was
impossible because the unit is unoccupied, and their residence is actually
21027 Constanso Street, Woodland Hills, CA 91364. (Motion, p. 4; Sergio Decl.
¶¶ 3–5, Exh. A; Rosa Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. A.) Each of Defendants submit a
declaration signed under penalty of perjury in support of this claim.
 
To further support their claim, Defendants submit
evidence that Susanna Turner (“Turner”), a paralegal of their counsel, called
the court on May 24, 2024, and at that time was informed by a Call Center Clerk
that no summons had been issued in the instant matter, Case No. 
22VECV01156. (Turner Decl. ¶¶ 3–4.) While the truth of the matter of any
assertions the Call Center Clerk made to Turner regarding the issuance of a
summons in this matter would amount to hearsay, a review of the case file
demonstrates that no summons has been filed in this action.   
 
As a preliminary matter, the court notes that
Plaintiff’s process server Richard Williams (“Williams”) is not a registered
California process server. (Rosa Proof of Service; Sergio Proof of Service.) As
such, the Proofs of Service themselves do not create a rebuttable
presumption that service was proper. To the extent Plaintiff contends
service was properly made, Plaintiff must submit evidence or a declaration of
Williams in support of the Proofs of Service. However, Plaintiff has not
opposed the Motion. In addition, as discussed above, Defendants submitted
evidence that neither Sergio nor Rosa was served with the summons and the Complaint
in the manner described in the Proof of Service given the incorrect address and
given that neither Sergio nor Rosa received service of the documents on the
alleged date. Finally, the case file for the instant matter does not appear to
include an issued filed summons, although the court acknowledges that
this does not preclude a summons from having being issued to Plaintiff for
service on Defendants.  
 
Plaintiff has not met his burden of demonstrating
facts justifying the existence of this court’s personal jurisdiction over Defendants
given that Defendants submitted evidence showing they were not served with the
summons and the Complaint and that the Proofs of Service were not completed by
a registered process server.  
 
Because the Demurrer was filed after the Motion, its
filing does not constitute a general appearance or waiver of the issue of lack
of personal jurisdiction by Defendants. However, this court’s lack of personal
jurisdiction over Defendants renders the Demurrer moot.
 
Accordingly, this court GRANTS the Motion and DENIES
the Demurrer as moot.
