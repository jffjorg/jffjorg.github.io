And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Katy E. Weber v. Ford Motor Company regarding a motion for a protective order and a request for sanctions. The judge denied the motion for a protective order and denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The judge granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,200. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to meet her burden of showing good cause for the protective order and that the defendant's deposition notice did not circumvent the timing requirements of written discovery. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations of harassment were unsubstantiated and that the defendant's counsel's rate of $200 per hour was reasonable.
