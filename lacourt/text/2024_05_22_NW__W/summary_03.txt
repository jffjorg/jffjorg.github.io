And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Alyazeed Moawya Dobi, has moved to set aside the default entered against him. The court has granted the motion. The defendant's failure to timely file a responsive pleading was due to an error in calendaring, and the defendant has demonstrated that he was not aware of the deadline to file an answer. The defendant's counsel also failed to calendar the deadline, which led to the delay. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's failure is not excusable, but the court finds that the defendant's mistake was an excusable error. The court also finds that the defendant's motion was timely, and although the defendant did not provide a copy of the proposed answer with the motion papers, the court finds that substantial compliance was sufficient.
