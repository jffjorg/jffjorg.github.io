The judge has granted Defendant Joendell G. Abner's motion to compel further responses to Plaintiff's requests for production of documents, specifically requests for production of documents related to communications with insurance carrier regarding the allegations in the complaint and the incident. The judge has also denied Defendant's request for sanctions against Plaintiffs and their counsel, finding that both parties' positions were substantially justified. The judge has ordered Plaintiffs to produce certain documents, with the limitation that true settlement proposals or counters between Plaintiff and the insurance company need not be produced as such communications are confidential. The judge has also denied Defendant's request for attorney fees, finding that the Defendant's motion was substantially justified.
