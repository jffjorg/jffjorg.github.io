Here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Honda) to compel the deposition of Nidal Kobaissa, the plaintiff. Honda served notice of deposition for May 6, 2024, and also served a Request for the Production of Documents (RFPD) in conjunction with the deposition notice. The plaintiff objected to the deposition notice, stating that he was unavailable on the scheduled date. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's objection was not valid under California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) § 2025.410, which refers to objections to deposition notices that do not comply with Article 2 of the Civil Discovery Act.

The court also finds that Honda attempted to meet and confer with the plaintiff regarding alternative deposition dates, but the plaintiff failed to respond. Therefore, the court grants Honda's motion to compel the plaintiff's attendance at deposition.

Additionally, the court denies Honda's motion to compel the plaintiff's further responses to the RFPD, as Honda failed to provide a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court (C.R.C.) Rule 3.1345(a).

The court awards sanctions of $560 in favor of Honda against the plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally. The court orders the parties to further meet and confer to determine a mutually acceptable date for the deposition.
