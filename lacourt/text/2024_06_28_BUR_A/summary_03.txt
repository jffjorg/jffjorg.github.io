And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash subpoenas requesting medical records from Claimant David Minkin. The motion was brought by Claimant in response to 11 subpoenas issued by Respondent United Financial Casualty Company. The Judge has denied the motion, but has ordered the subpoenas modified to limit the requests to documents related to Claimant's alleged injuries within the last five years.

The Judge found that Claimant had adequately demonstrated a privacy interest in his medical records, but that the requested documents were not excessively broad. The Judge also noted that Respondent had previously agreed to limit the language of medical record subpoenas to documents relating to the injured body parts within the last five years.

The Judge ordered the subpoenas modified to reflect the current state of affairs, and denied Claimant's motion to quash. The Judge also declined to order sanctions against either party, finding that the motions were not made or opposed in bad faith.
