Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Centra Funding, LLC's application for a writ of possession without prejudice. The application seeks to recover a generator leased to Anko Services and Andrii Benko, who have defaulted on payments. The judge notes that service of process has not yet occurred and that the defendants have not filed opposition. The court finds that the application is premature and that the plaintiff must effectuate service of both the summons and the notice of the application before it can be considered. The court also sets a case management conference for October 16, 2024, and orders the plaintiff to give notice.
