English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Petitioner Agapeh Panosiyan's petition to compel arbitration with Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. regarding an uninsured motorist claim. The Court notes that the insurance agreement under which the parties are allegedly bound is absent from the moving papers, and that Petitioner's submissions do not contain the declaration required by California Insurance Code ยง 11580.2(f). The Court also notes that Petitioner has not alleged whether the claim was even denied by Tesla. As a result, the Court is without the information to determine that a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the parties. The petition is denied without prejudice.
