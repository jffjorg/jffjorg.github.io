And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling in this case is that the motion for terminating sanctions brought by the defendant, Daniel Jose Mari Marquez, is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff, Karen Serrano, was ordered to provide discovery responses on March 1, 2024, but failed to comply. However, the plaintiff has since attempted to comply and provided some responses, although they were unverified. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply is not willful and that terminating sanctions are not warranted. Instead, the plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses and pay the sanctions by July 26, 2024. A trial status conference is set for September 9, 2024.
