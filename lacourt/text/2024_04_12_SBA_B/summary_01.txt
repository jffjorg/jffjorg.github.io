And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"Based on the information presented, the court has considered the demurrer and has made the following ruling: the demurrer to the second cause of action (breach of express warranty) is sustained with leave to amend, and the demurrer to the third cause of action (breach of implied warranty) is overruled. The court has denied defendant's request to take judicial notice of the Buyers Guide, and has found that plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim for breach of implied warranty. The court has also given defendant notice of its ruling."
