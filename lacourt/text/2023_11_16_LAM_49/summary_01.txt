And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiffs are seeking to add a claim for treble damages, costs of suit, and attorney's fees under California Penal Code section 496(c) based on the California Supreme Court's July 2022 decision in Siry Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour. The motion is unopposed, and the judge has determined that the amendment will not cause undue prejudice to the defendant. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to file and serve a stand-alone First Amended Complaint within 10 days, and has granted the motion on good cause shown.
