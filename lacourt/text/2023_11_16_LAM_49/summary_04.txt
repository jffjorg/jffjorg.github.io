And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to seal confidential documents. The plaintiff had filed documents with his opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment, but they contained confidential information regarding the defendant's finances, trade secrets, and non-public business dealings. The plaintiff had sought to withdraw and re-file the documents under seal. The judge found that the documents contained confidential information that overcame the right of public access to the records. The judge also found that the proposed sealing of the records was narrowly tailored, and that there was no less restrictive means to preserve the confidentiality of the records. The judge ordered the declaration of Tamara Freeze to be sealed and for the plaintiff to re-file the documents with limited redactions.
