And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maya Palominos v. Harbor City Enterprises, Inc. et al, regarding Plaintiff's motion to vacate the stay and withdraw from arbitration. The Plaintiff moved to vacate the stay and withdraw from arbitration because the Defendants failed to participate in the arbitration process. The Defendants argued that they should not be required to bear the costs of arbitration and that the costs should be split equally. The judge has continued the hearing to a date TBD, and ordered the Defendants to pay the costs of arbitration, subject to possible reallocation. If the Defendants do not agree to this, the judge will grant the Plaintiff's motion to vacate arbitration.
