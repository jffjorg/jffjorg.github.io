  - "The purpose of the statute is to enable a California resident sued by an out-of-state resident 'to secure costs in light of the difficulty of enforcing a judgment for costs against a person who is not within the court's jurisdiction.'"
  - "Defendants have not met their burden to show a reasonable possibility that they will obtain judgment in the action, based upon the evidence presented in the moving papers."
```

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for security for costs, which sought to require the plaintiff to post a security undertaking of $20,000 to cover the defendants' costs. The plaintiff is a Florida corporation and the defendants argue that they have a reasonable possibility of obtaining a judgment in the action. However, the court finds that the defendants have not met their burden to show a reasonable possibility of obtaining a judgment, as they have failed to address the merits of the plaintiff's causes of action and have only raised conclusory arguments about the validity of the lease and the lack of consideration. The court also notes that the defendants have waited over five years to file this motion, which raises questions about their diligence and the timing of their request.
