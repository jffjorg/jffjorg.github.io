And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to place the hearing on the demurrer to the complaint off calendar. The case is reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the Reclassification/Transfer Desk for reassessment to an Independent Calendar Court. The plaintiffs are ordered to pay the reclassification fee within 10 days. Additionally, all hearing dates in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse are vacated. The judge's decision is based on the relief sought in the complaint, which includes injunctive relief and attorney's fees. However, the limited jurisdiction court lacks jurisdiction to issue the injunctive relief, and therefore, the case is reclassified and transferred.
