ANALYSIS:
 
On June 5, 2024, Defendant Joseph Zarabi (“Defendant”)
served Requests for Admissions on Plaintiff Dibara Masonry, LLC (“Plaintiff”).
(Motion, Lubin Decl., Exh. 1.) Despite a
meet and confer effort, Plaintiff has not served verified responses to the
Requests for Admission. (Id. at ¶¶3-4 and Exh. 2) Defendant filed the
instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on July 26,
2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Defendant is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Plaintiff in the amount of $455.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $395.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion, Lubin
Decl., ¶6.)
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Joseph Zarabi’s Motion to
Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF
DIBARA MASONRY, LLC IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $455.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL
WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
