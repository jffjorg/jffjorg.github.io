And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the complaint. The original complaint was filed on March 1, 2022, but the plaintiff failed to appear for an Order to Show Cause on March 4, 2024, and the complaint was dismissed without prejudice. The plaintiff then filed a motion to vacate the dismissal on July 15, 2024, which was supported by an affidavit of fault from the plaintiff's counsel stating that they did not appear for the Order to Show Cause due to a calendaring error. The judge finds that the motion was timely filed and that the case must be reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). As a result, the dismissal entered on March 4, 2024 is hereby vacated. An Order to Show Cause regarding failure to file proof of service is set for October 14, 2024 at 9:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
