ANALYSIS: 
 

On March 11, 2024, Plaintiffs Robin Torres and Al
Torres (“Plaintiffs”) filed the Complaint in this
action against Defendants Brian Mendelson and Emily Kane (“Defendants”).
Defendants filed the instant Demurrer to the Complaint on July 18, 2024. On
August 28, 2024, improperly Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint without
leave of court. The First Amended Complaint was required to have been filed by
August 26, 2024, otherwise, Plaintiff was required to have moved for leave to
amend by noticed motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a); § 473, subd. (a)(1).)

 
Discussion
 
The Complaint states on the face
page that it is for “injunctive relief and attorney’s fees.” (Compl., p. 1.)
Plaintiffs allege that they seek “to enforce the Restrictive Covenants,
Conditions and Restrictions on Tract 30113 ("CC&Rs) in the City of Los
Angeles, County of Los Angeles.” (Id. at ¶1.) Specifically, that
Defendants be required to trim their trees and other foliage on their property
to meet the requirements of the CC&Rs. (Id. at ¶2.) By Failing to so
comply, Defendants have intentionally and consciously harmed Plaintiff by
totally blocking their view. (Id. at ¶3.) Plaintiffs request that the
Court order Defendants “to cut their trees to the extent necessary to become
compliant with the CC&Rs and to continue to do so whenever it is necessary
to so comply and that if they do not do so within 45 days of the issuance of
the court order, Plaintiffs have the authority to contract a tree trimming
company to do so and expend as much as $6,000 to get Respondent's property in
compliance with the CC&Rs.” (Id. at ¶32.) 
 
The limited jurisdiction court lacks jurisdiction to issue the
injunctive relief sought in the Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 85, 86.) Therefore, the case is reclassified as an unlimited civil
case and transferred to the Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of
fees and reassignment of the case to an Independent Calendar Court. Plaintiffs
are ordered to pay the reclassification fee within ten (10) days.

UNLIMITED CIVIL CASE AND TRANSFERRED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION/TRANSFER DESK FOR
