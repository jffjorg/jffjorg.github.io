And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for new trial filed by Joseph Ariel Hazani, the plaintiff, without prejudice. The plaintiff had previously filed motions for summary judgment, which were denied twice. The motion for new trial was filed on June 20, 2024, but the supporting documents were not filed until August 13, 2024. The plaintiff did not provide notice of the motion, which is a violation of the statutory requirements and due process. The judge also noted that the motion does not discuss whether there are triable issues of material fact or newly discovered evidence. As a result, the motion for new trial is denied.
