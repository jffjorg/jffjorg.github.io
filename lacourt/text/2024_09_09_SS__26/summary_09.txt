And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by defendants Edgar Yazbeck and Iris Asuncion Yazbeck to the complaint filed by plaintiff Mariscos Bahia, Inc. is overruled. The defendants are ordered to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 20 days of receiving this order. The judge's analysis indicates that the demurrer fails to demonstrate how the complaint's allegations of breach of personal guaranty do not meet the legal requirements for such a claim. The judge notes that the demurrer relies on unsupported statements and lacks legal authority to support its arguments.
