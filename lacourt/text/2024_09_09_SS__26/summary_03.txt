And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Tax Costs filed by Plaintiffs Healthcare Medical Clinic of Pomona, Inc. and Yoodiy Gonzales. The motion is granted, and the court taxes costs item nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 11, 13, and 16 from the memorandum of costs filed on May 29, 2024.

The court finds that the parties did not have an agreement to waive costs, and therefore, the entire memorandum of costs cannot be struck. However, the court notes that the parties did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a basis to strike the entire memorandum of costs.

The court further finds that the costs incurred in a separate action between the parties, Norma Perez v. Healthcare Medical Clinic of Pomona, Inc., et al., Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 20STCV35487, are not recoverable in this action. The court declines to adopt the defendants' argument that costs incurred in one action can be recovered in another, as there is no relevant legal authority to support this proposition.

In conclusion, the court grants the Motion to Tax Costs and taxes the specified costs from the memorandum of costs filed on May 29, 2024.
