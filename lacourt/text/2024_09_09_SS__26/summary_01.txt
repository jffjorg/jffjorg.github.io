And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date, which is currently set for November 12, 2024, to February 3, 2025 at 8:30 AM in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The judge has also ordered that discovery and motion cutoff dates will follow the new trial date. The defendants had argued that good cause exists for a continuance of the trial date because additional discovery needs to be conducted. The judge has considered the factors set forth in California Rule of Court 3.1332 and has determined that the factors weigh in favor of the requested continuance.
