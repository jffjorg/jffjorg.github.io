Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Joseph Zarabi, granting his motion to deem the requests for admission admitted and requesting sanctions. The plaintiff, Dibara Masonry, LLC, has failed to serve verified responses to the requests for admission, despite a meet and confer effort. The judge notes that there is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed, and that the motion can be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide responses. As a result, the judge has deemed the requests for admission admitted. The judge also awarded sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $455.00, which is based on one hour of attorney time billed at $395.00 per hour, plus a $60.00 filing fee. The plaintiff is ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days of service of the order.
