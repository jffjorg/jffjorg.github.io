ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff State Farm Fire and
Casualty Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants KMI
Enterprises, Inc. (“Defendant”) on March 1, 2022. The Court set an Order to
Show Cause Regarding Failure to File Proof of Service of Summons and Complaint
for March 4, 2024. When Plaintiff did not appear, the Court dismissed the
Complaint without prejudice. (Minute Order, 03/04/24.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on July
15, 2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed less within
six months of dismissal of the action and is supported by an attorney affidavit
of fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they did not appear for the Order
to Show Cause due to a calendaring error. (Motion, Chow Decl., ¶3.) Therefore,
the case must be reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b).
