Hazani v. Dickson, et al.MOTION
FOR NEW TRIAL(CCP § 657)
TENTATIVE RULING:  
 
Motion of Joseph Ariel Hazani, Son of David, Son of
Remington, Son of Keith, Son of Jacob,
for New Trial is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff in propria persona, Joseph
Ariel Hazani, Son of David, Son of Remington, Son of Keith, Son of Jacob (“Plaintiff”) brought this action for unknown relief against Defendant Deeann Dickson (“Defendant”) on March 20, 2024. Plaintiff then filed a Motion for
Summary Judgment on April 12 and 17, 2024. Defendant filed an answer in propria
persona on April 22, 2024. On May 6,
2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s first Motion for Summary Judgment. (Minute
Order, 05/06/24.) Plaintiff then brought a renewed Motion for Summary Judgment,
which the Court denied on June 18, 2024. (Minute Order, 06/18/24.) 
 
On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion for New Trial. However, the supporting memorandum of
points and authorities and exhibits were not filed until August 13, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date.  
 
Discussion
 
As with Plaintiff’s earlier motions, the instant Motion for
New Trial is not accompanied by a proof of service. Plaintiff asks the Court to
forgive the lack of notice because he is insolvent, however, the Court has no
discretion in the matter of notice. Failure to give notice of a motion
is not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.)
 
Even if the Court were to
determine that Defendant was properly served with the instant Motion, Plaintiff
has not shown that a different ruling is appropriate for either Motion for
Summary Judgment.
 
An order granting summary judgment is
properly challenged by a motion for a new trial. (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at
p. 858, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493.) “This is so, even though, strictly
speaking, ‘summary judgment ... is a determination that there shall be no trial
at all.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Green v. Del–Camp Investments, Inc. (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 479, 481, 14 Cal.Rptr. 420.) The new trial motion may seek reversal
of the summary judgment on the ground that there are triable issues of fact. (See
Green v. Del–Camp Investments, Inc., supra, 193 Cal.App.2d at pp. 482–483, 14
Cal.Rptr. 420.) In addition, the motion may assert that the summary judgment
should be reversed because there is “[n]ewly discovered evidence” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 657, subd. 4). (Scott v. Farrar (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 462, 467, 188
Cal.Rptr. 823 (Scott).)
 
(Doe v. United Air Lines, Inc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th
1500, 1504-1505.) The Motion does not discuss whether there are triable issues
of material fact, nor whether there is newly discovered evidence.  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the Motion of Joseph Ariel Hazani,
Son of David, Son of Remington, Son of Keith, Son of Jacob, for New Trial is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
