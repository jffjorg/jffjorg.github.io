TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
Plaintiff State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is
GRANTED. THE DISMISSAL ENTERED ON MAY 21, 2024 IS HEREBY VACATED.
 
TRIAL IS SET FOR
OCTOBER 9, 2025 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against
Defendants Amazon Logistics, Inc. and Kurt Stommer (“Defendants”) on April 11,
2024. On May 21, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the action without prejudice. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on
July 15, 2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The
motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision
(b). Under this statute, an application for relief must
be made no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The
motion was timely filed less than two months after dismissal of the action and
is supported by an attorney affidavit of fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares
that they were misled to believe that this action must be referred to
arbitration. (Motion, Pleasant Decl., ¶¶4-8 and Exhs. A-D.) Therefore, the case
must be reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).

Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is
GRANTED. THE DISMISSAL ENTERED ON MAY 21, 2024 IS HEREBY VACATED.
