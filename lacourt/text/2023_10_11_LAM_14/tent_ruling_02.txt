 Case Number:  22STCV37907    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Motion
 
            Plaintiffs
now move this court for an order permitting them to file a First Amended
Complaint adding another plaintiff who lived in the building with them.
 
Governing Standard
 
            “[T]he
court's discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of
the pleadings. [Citations]. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428. It is
an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend based on delay alone; the
amendment must affirmatively prejudice the opposing side. Higgins v. Del
Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565. However, prejudice exists where
the delay is unwarranted and the result will be additional cost for trial
preparation, witness depositions, and other discovery. See Doe v. Los
Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th
675, 689 (citing Melican v. Regents of University of California (2007)
151 Cal.App.4th 168, 175); P&D Consultants, Inc. v. City of
Carlsbad (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345 (citing Huff v.
Wilkins (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 732, 746).
 
Decision
 
            The motion is
GRANTED. Plaintiffs are ORDERED to file their First Amended Complaint within 7
days.
 
            Defendant Landlord
opposes this motion on the grounds that the new plaintiff could have been added
earlier. But as noted above, delay itself is not affirmative prejudice. Nor is
the mere fact that Defendant Landlord will have to defend itself against the
new Plaintiff. There is no prejudice here, and no basis to deny the motion.
