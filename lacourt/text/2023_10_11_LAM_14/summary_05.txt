And here is a summary in English text:

A tentative ruling has been issued in the case of 23STCV10602, granting judgment on the pleadings as to the 19th affirmative defense, but denying the motion otherwise. The defendant, Panda, had filed an answer to the complaint, but failed to properly plead an affirmative defense. The judge ruled that the first sentence of the answer does contain an adequate denial of the facts alleged in the complaint, but that the 19th affirmative defense is not a legally proper defense. The judge granted the motion as to this defense only, and otherwise denied it. The ruling allows the case to proceed to the discovery stage, where the defendant can explore the regular and normal defenses that were not properly pled.
