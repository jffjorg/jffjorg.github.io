And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV07270, which will be heard on October 11, 2023. The defendant has demurred to the fourth cause of action in the complaint, arguing that it is not supported by sufficient facts. The judge grants both requests for judicial notice (RJN) and sustains the demurrer, giving the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint.

The judge finds that the complaint is uncertain because it blends causes of action for sex and race discrimination together, which are governed by different laws (Labor Code ยง 1197.5(a) and (b)). The judge orders the plaintiff to separate these claims so that they can be evaluated separately. The plaintiff is also instructed to separate the first cause of action for FEHA discrimination in the same manner.

The judge concludes that the complaint cannot be properly evaluated because of the improper blending of claims, and therefore sustains the demurrer.
