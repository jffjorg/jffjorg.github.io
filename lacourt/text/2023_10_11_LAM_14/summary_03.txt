```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the defendant's motion to set aside the default is granted. The defendant was not properly served with the summons and complaint, as service was made at a location that is not his usual place of business or mailing address. The court finds that the evidence shows that the defendant has only visited this location twice since June 2020, and that his registered address is elsewhere. The judge cites Code of Civil Procedure § 473(d) and Ellard v. Conway (2001) to support the decision. The plaintiff had attempted to serve both defendants at the Second Location, but the defendant claims he has only visited this location twice in four years. Mr. Smith, who was not counsel for the defendant, expressed an understanding that service had occurred, but this was not binding on the defendant. The court concludes that the default entered against the defendant is void, and the motion to set it aside is granted.
