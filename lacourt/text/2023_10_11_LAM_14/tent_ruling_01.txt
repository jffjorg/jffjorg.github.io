  Case Number:  22STCV36251    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  14 (1)        Demurrer Defendant Emrani now demurs to the
entire FAC on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to support
any cause of action. Decision The demurrer is SUSTAINED, with
10 days leave to amend. First Cause of Action: Breach of Contract             “’A cause
of action for damages for breach of contract is comprised of the following
elements: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to
plaintiff.’ (Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc.
(1990) 222 C.A.3d 1371, 1388).” Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 228. “Further, the complaint must
indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct. (Code
Civ.Proc., § 430.10, subd. (g).).”  Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation
Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-459 (implicitly overruled on other
grounds as recognized by Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 401-402).             Plaintiffs
have failed to expressly plead whether the contract they seek to enforce is
written, oral, or implied by conduct. The pleadings as they currently exist strongly
imply two things: (1) that the contract was written, and (2) that Defendant Emrani
was not personally in need of legal services but referred Defendant Ruiz to
Plaintiffs. Given this, Plaintiff needs to either attach a copy of the contract
or explain in detail how the contract was intended to bind Defendant Emrani to
pay Defendant Ruiz’s bills. See Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 993. Second Cause of Action: Breach of the Implied Covenant             Breach of
the implied covenant may be either a tort or a contract claim. See Careau
& Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d
1371, 1395. If it is pled in tort, it is a claim that the defendant
had an improper motive for breaching some express provision of the contract. If
it is pled in contract, it is a claim that the defendant did something was not (in and of itself) a violation of
their contract but which did prevent Plaintiff
from reaping the benefit of the contract.  To plead the claim as a tort,
Plaintiffs must identify a legally recognized “special relationship” between
the parties. Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc.
(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1395. To
plead the claim in contract, Plaintiffs must identify the conduct that
frustrated the purpose of the contract without breaching it. Id. Plaintiffs have not made clear whether
this claim is pled in tort or in contract. They have not identified a legally recognized
“special relationship” between themselves and Defendant Emrani. Nor have they
identified any conduct which has deprived her of the benefit of the contract
without actually breaching the contract. Third Cause of Action: Fraud             To plead a
claim for promissory fraud, which seems to be Plaintiffs’ object here, all they
need to do is specifically allege the promise, and generally allege the lack of
intent to perform. See Beckwith v. Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th
1039, 1060.             For the
reasons given above, Plaintiffs have failed to specifically allege the promise.
It is unclear what Defendant Emrani promised Plaintiffs, or when, or how, or
why. In the absence of such pleading, a promissory fraud claim cannot proceed. Fourth Cause of Action: Unjust Enrichment             An unjust
enrichment cause of action may be construed as a quasi-contract claim seeking
restitution, effectively an alternative pleading to be employed if an existing
contract is not enforceable for some reason. Rutherford Holdings, LLC v.
Plaza Del Rey (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 221, 231. However, because the circumstances
surrounding the agreement and the rendering of services have not been clearly
and properly pled, this alternative claim also cannot be maintained. Fifth Cause of Action: Quantum Meruit             The
elements of a quantum meruit claim are (1) that the plaintiff was acting
pursuant to either an express or implied request from the defendant and (2)
that the services rendered were intended to and did benefit the defendant. Advanced
Choices, Inc. v. Department of Health Services (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th
1661, 1673.              As already
discussed, Plaintiffs have failed to describe the circumstances which led them
to provide services. They have failed to plead the specifics of any request
from Defendant Emrani that they provide services. They have failed to explain
how their work was intended to, and did, benefit Defendant Emrani. Conclusion             Plaintiffs’
pleading currently lacks the requisite details to state causes of action. It
appears that an amendment could clearly supply those details. Therefore, the
demurrer is SUSTAINED, with 10 days leave to amend. (2)        Motion to
Strike             Defendant
Emrani now moves this court for an order striking the request for punitive
damages from the FAC.
