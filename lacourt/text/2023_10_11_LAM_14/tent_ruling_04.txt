 Case Number:  23STCV07270    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Pleading
 
            Defendant District
now demurs to the fourth cause of action in the Complaint on the grounds that
it is not supported by sufficient facts.
 
Decision
 
            Both Requests
for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) are GRANTED.
 
The demurrer is SUSTAINED, with
10 days leave to amend. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff has rendered her
complaint uncertain by blending causes of action for sex discrimination
together with causes of action for race discrimination. Labor Code
§ 1197.5(a) governs sex discrimination. Labor Code § 1197.5(b)
governs race discrimination. These should be stated as separate claims so that
they can be evaluated separately. Although it is not at issue in this demurrer,
Plaintiff should undertake the same separation for the first cause of action
for FEHA discrimination.
 
 
 
Conclusion
 

            Because
Plaintiff has improperly blended different types of claims together, the Complaint
cannot properly be evaluated. Therefore, the demurrer is SUSTAINED, with 10
days leave to amend.
