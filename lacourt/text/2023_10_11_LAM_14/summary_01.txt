And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a case with the number 22STCV36251. The case involves a demurrer filed by Defendant Emrani, which argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to support any cause of action. The Judge has sustained the demurrer with 10 days leave to amend. The Judge's ruling is based on the lack of details in the complaint, specifically the failure to plead whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct, and the lack of specific allegations regarding the promise made by Defendant Emrani. The Judge also notes that the complaint fails to identify a legally recognized "special relationship" between the parties, and that the services rendered by the Plaintiffs were not clearly and properly pled. The motion to strike the request for punitive damages is taken off calendar as moot.
