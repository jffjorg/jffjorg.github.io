And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to file a First Amended Complaint, adding a new plaintiff who lived in the same building. The defendant, Landlord, opposed the motion, arguing that the new plaintiff could have been added earlier, but the court found that delay alone is not sufficient to deny the motion. The judge cited several precedents, including Howard v. County of San Diego, which state that the court's discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings. The judge also noted that prejudice exists where the delay is unwarranted and the result will be additional cost for trial preparation. The plaintiff is ordered to file the First Amended Complaint within 7 days.
