 Case Number:  23STCV10602    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Motion
 
Plaintiff now moves this court for
an order granting judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff’s complaint, on the
grounds that there has been no general or specific denial of his allegations,
and that no affirmative defense has been properly pled.
 
Decision
 
The motion for judgment on the pleadings
is GRANTED as to the 19th Affirmative Defense only, and
otherwise DENIED.
 
Discussion
 
            The first
sentence of Defendant Panda’s Answer does in fact contain an adequate denial of
the facts alleged in the FAC. (Answer p. 1:20-25). 
 
            The Answer
goes on to plead 19 affirmative defenses. Of those, 18 are regular and normal
defenses, (such as failure to state a cause of action and lack of jurisdiction)
would be available even if not pled. The exploration of these defenses is a
matter for the discovery stage, not pleadings motions.
 
            However,
the 19th Affirmative Defense consists only of a “reservation” of the
ability to assert future defenses. That reservation is not in itself a defense,
nor can it form any legal basis for a subsequent amendment of the answer. Such
an amendment would require leave of court in any case, and the “reservation” is
wholly irrelevant to obtaining that leave.
 
Conclusion
 
A “reservation” of rights to later
assert different affirmative defenses is neither legally proper, nor itself an
affirmative defense. However, there is otherwise no fatal flaw in the Answer.
Therefore, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED as to the 19th
Affirmative Defense only, and otherwise DENIED.
