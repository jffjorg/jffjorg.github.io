Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Gizelle Wade's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Motion was filed on May 22, 2024, and argued that Defendants LA Housing Solutions, LLC, Peerless Apartments, LLC, and Marc A. Schneider failed to return the security deposit in a timely manner and improperly deducted amounts from the deposit. The Court found that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a statutory violation under Civil Code section 1950.5, subdivision (l), and that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the timing of the security deposit and the propriety of the charges deducted from the deposit.
