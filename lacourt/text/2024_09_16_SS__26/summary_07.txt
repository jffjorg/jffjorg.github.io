And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motions filed by third-party Tom Block, claiming to be the assignee of 3 C's Group Financial, Inc., to compel responses to post-judgment requests for production of documents and interrogatories. The motions were filed on June 28, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The Judge found that Tom Block did not provide any evidence demonstrating that he is the assignee of 3 C's Group Financial, Inc. The Judge also found that the discovery requests served on Judgment Debtor, Al Perets, do not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 94, which limits the number of written discovery requests to 35 in the limited jurisdiction court. Therefore, the Judge denied the motions, stating that the Court will not grant motions to compel discovery propounded in violation of the Code of Civil Procedure.
