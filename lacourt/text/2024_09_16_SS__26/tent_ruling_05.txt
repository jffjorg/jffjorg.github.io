ANALYSIS:
 
On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff Don Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed the
instant action against Defendant Jake Perez (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed
proof of personal service of the Summons and Complaint on September 20, 2023.
Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered
their default on November 22, 2023 and default judgment on December 7, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed the first Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment (“the first Motion”) on June 12, 2024. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on August 2, 2024 and Plaintiff replied on August 8, 2024. Plaintiff
filed a supplemental declaration on August 13, 2024. At the hearing on August
15, 2024, the Court took the first Motion under submission following oral
argument from Plaintiff. (Minute Order, 08/15/24.) Thereafter, the Court denied
the first Motion. (Ibid.) 
 
On August 19, 2024, Defendant filed the instant, renewed
Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment (“the Renewed Motion”). Plaintiff
filed an opposition on September 3, 2024 and Defendant replied on September 9,
2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant again moves to vacate the entry of default and
default judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, or on
equitable grounds. (Renewed Motion, p. 2:2-8.) Despite acknowledging that this
is renewed motion, Defendant has not sought relief pursuant to the
reconsideration/renewal statute, Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. 
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), which states in relevant part:
 
When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a).) The Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling, on motion
of a party, where the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (e); Le
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) Additionally, there is a
diligence requirement: “Courts have construed section 1008 to require a party
filing an application for reconsideration or a renewed application to show
diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not having presented the new or
different information earlier.” (Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling,
Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 839.) The instant
Renewed Motion does not comply with the statutory requirements for renewal. Nor
does Plaintiff’s reply, which attempts to argue that the requirements under
section 1008 are satisfied but attaches no declaration. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Jake Perez’s Renewed Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
