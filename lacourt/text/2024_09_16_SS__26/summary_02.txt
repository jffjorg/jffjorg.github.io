And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion filed by plaintiff Miesha Hilliard seeking leave to file an amended complaint. The motion seeks to add a fifth cause of action against defendants for violation of Penal Code section 496 and to reclassify the action as one for damages in excess of $35,000. The judge found that the motion is not supported by an adequate declaration explaining what new evidence was discovered and why the amendment was not made earlier. The judge also noted that the trial date is set for less than two months away and that the discovery cutoff date is less than one month away, which means that the requirements for leave to amend are not satisfied.
