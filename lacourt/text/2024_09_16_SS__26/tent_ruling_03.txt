Wade v. LA Housing Solutions, LLC, et al.SUMMARY
JUDGMENT
(CCP § 437c)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff
Gizelle Wade’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Gizella Wade (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for habitability
violations, nuisance, negligence, and breach of contract against Defendants LA
Housing Solutions, LLC (“Defendant LAHS”), Peerless Apartments, LLC, and Marc
A. Schneider (“Defendant Schneider”) on April 10, 2023. Defendants filed a
Demurrer to, and Motion to Strike Portions of, the Complaint on May 15, 2023.
The Demurrer was sustained with leave to amend on September 14, 2023 and the
Motion to Strike was placed off calendar. (Minute Order, 09/14/23.)
 
Plaintiff filed
the First Amended Complaint on October 2, 2023, alleging a single cause of
action for bad faith retention of security deposit in violation of Civil Code
section 1950.5. Defendant answered the First Amended Complaint on November 1,
2023. On February 26, 2024, the Court denied Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings. (Minute Order, 02/26/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary
Adjudication on May 22, 2024. Defendants filed an opposition on July 24, 2024
and Plaintiff replied on July 29, 2024. When the Motion initially came for
hearing on September 16, 2024, the Court continued the matter due to
Defendant’s failure to timely file or serve the requisite separate statement of
undisputed facts. (Minute Order, 09/16/24.) The Court also denied Plaintiff’s
request for summary adjudication. (Ibid.) Defendants filed and served their
opposing separate statement on September 3, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
The First Amended Complaint alleges a single cause of action for Bad
Faith Retention of Security Deposit and Statutory Breach of Civil Code §
1950.5(l) based on the following facts. Plaintiff was a tenant of 231
North La Peer Drive #106, Beverly Hills California (“the Premises”) pursuant to
a lease agreement with Defendant LA Housing Solutions, LLC. (FAC, ¶7.) The
monthly rental rate was $3,598.00 for a period of one year, with the term to
begin on August 11, 2022. (Ibid.) Plaintiff provided the sum of $6,396.00
as a security deposit. (Id. at ¶8.) Pursuant to an agreement for early
termination of the lease (“the Release”), Plaintiff vacated the Premises on
November 3, 2022. (Id. at ¶9.) Although more than nine months have
passed since Plaintiff vacated the Premises, the First Amended Complaint
alleges that “Defendants have failed and refused, and continues to fail and
refuse, to provide Plaintiff with an itemized statement detailing a lawful
basis for Defendant’s retention of said sums of Plaintiff’s security deposit,
and the amount of any security received and the disposition of the security,
and has also failed and refused, to return the said sums of the security
deposit given to them by the Plaintiff despite several demands to Defendants.”
(Id. at ¶11.) This failure by Defendants violates Civil Code section
1950.5(l). (Id. at ¶¶10, 12.) As a result of the violation, Plaintiff
has suffered actual damages in the amount of $5,515.80. (Id. at ¶13.) 
 
Motion for Summary Judgment
 
On a motion for summary judgment, a moving plaintiff must
show that there is no defense by proving each element of every cause of action
entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (p)(1).) Then the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the causes of action
or a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Additionally, in ruling
on the Motion, the Court must view the “evidence [citations] and such
inferences [citations], in the light most favorable to the opposing party.” (Intrieri
v. Superior Court (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 72, 81 [citing Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843].)
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
Defendants’ evidentiary objections are ruled on as follows:
 
·        
Wade Decl.: No. 1 sustained; Nos. 2-15 overruled
·        
Sales Decl.: Nos. 1-6 sustained.
 
Plaintiff’s Initial Burden of Proof
 
Plaintiff first argues that Defendant LAHS is not an entity registered
with the California Secretary of State as an entity doing business in
California, and therefore, cannot defend this action. Even if this were true,
Plaintiff does not explain how that entitles her to summary judgment. As
explained above, Plaintiff’s burden on this Motion is to show that there
is no defense by proving each element of every cause of action. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1) [emphasis added].) Only then does the burden
of proof shift to Defendants. 
 
Next, Plaintiff contends that she
is entitled to judgment under the terms of the parties’ mutual Release and due
to Defendants’ violation of Code of
Civil Procedure section 1950.5, subdivision (l), which states:
 
The bad faith claim or retention by a landlord or the landlord’s
successors in interest of the security or any portion thereof in violation of
this section, or the bad faith demand of replacement security in violation of
subdivision (j), may subject the landlord or the landlord's successors in
interest to statutory damages of up to twice the amount of the security, in
addition to actual damages. The court may award damages for bad faith whenever
the facts warrant that award, regardless of whether the injured party has
specifically requested relief. In an action under this section, the landlord or
the landlord's successors in interest shall have the burden of proof as to the
reasonableness of the amounts claimed or the authority pursuant to this section
to demand additional security deposits.
 
(Civ. Code, § 1950.5, subd. (l).)
 
To the extent that Plaintiff’s Motion relies on Defendants’ purported
breach of the Release to demonstrate bad faith under section 1950.5,
subdivision (1), the Court finds this cannot show a statutory violation. The
statute expressly states that the landlord’s bad faith claim or retention of
any interest in the security deposit must be in respect to a violation of
section 1950.5. Whether Defendants breached the terms of the Release and
whether Plaintiff is entitled to damages as a result of that breach, is a
separate question that is not at issue in this action. 
 
In support of the Motion, Plaintiff contends the following facts are
undisputed. On July 29, 2022, the parties entered into a written Apartment
Lease (the “Lease”) for the premises located at 231 N. La Peer Drive #106, Los
Angeles, California (the Premises”). (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 1;
Wade Decl., ¶2 and Exh. A.) The Lease was a preprinted form contract prepared
by Defendants. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 2; Wade Decl., ¶3 and Exh.
A.) On October 24, 2022, the parties entered into a Mutual Release and Lease
Termination that released Plaintiff from any claims for cancellation fees,
rental concession amounts, or other rental obligations arising out of early
termination of the Lease. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 3-4; Wade
Decl., ¶9 and Exh. C at ¶1.) The Release also reserved to Plaintiff protections
under Civil Code section 1950.5. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 5; Wade
Decl., Exh. C, ¶6.) Under the Release, Defendants released Plaintiff from any
and all claims for economic or physical damages regarding the Premises.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 6; Wade Decl., Exh. C, pp. 1-2.)
Plaintiff moved out of the Premises on October 31, 2022 and Defendants re-took
possession of the Premises the next day[1].
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 7-8; Wade Decl., ¶¶11, 19 and Exh. D.) Plaintiff
has performed all her obligations under the Release. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact No. 9; Wade Decl. ¶9.) 
 
Defendants did not return Plaintiff’s security deposit by November 21,
2022, as required by the Release. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 10-11;
Wade Decl., ¶¶20 and Exh. C, ¶¶1, 6.) Defendants only returned a portion of
Plaintiff’s security deposit by withholding amounts attributed to lease
cancellation fees, rental concession amounts, and other rental obligations
arising out of an early termination. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos.
12-13; Wade Decl., ¶¶20 and Exh. C, ¶¶1, 6.) Defendants improperly withheld from the security deposit amounts
purportedly required to remedy damage to the Premises that did not constitute
ordinary wear and tear on the Premises. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No.
14; Wade Decl., ¶19.) Plaintiff was entitled to her entire security deposit on
or before November 22, 2022. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 21; Wade
Decl., ¶¶19, 21.) Defendants improperly deducted amounts from the security
deposit for purported claims that they had specifically released in the Release.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 24; Wade Decl., ¶19 and Exh. C.) Defendants
improperly deducted amounts from the security deposit for purported “repairs”
that were unnecessary and/or corrections of defects that existed prior to
Plaintiff’s tenancy. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 25; Wade Decl.,
¶19.) Defendants’ claimed reasons for withholding the security deposit were
pretextual and improper. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 26; Wade Decl.,
¶21.) Plaintiff is entitled to the remainder of the improperly withheld
security deposit in the amount of $5,515.00 plus statutory penalties in the
amount of $12,792.00, and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,830.78.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 27-29; Wade Decl., ¶¶4, 10 and Exh. G.) 
 
Plaintiff contends that her obligations under the Release were to move
out of the Premises by October 31, 2022, which she did. This move-out date is
demonstrated by Plaintiff’s own declaration and by text messages with
Defendants’ managing agent. (Motion, Wade Decl., ¶11 and Exh. D.) Plaintiff also
argues that Defendants were obligated to send her the security deposit within
21 days of the move-out date, subject to a final walkthrough and inspection. Civil
Code section 1950.5, subdivision (g) states: “within 21 days of the date that
the tenant vacates the Premises, the landlord must provide the tenant with a
detailed itemization of any application of the security deposit by the landlord
and must also at that time return any security deposit that has not been
applied towards legitimate deductions authorized under the section.” (Civ.
Code, § 1950.5, subd. (g).) The Motion demonstrates that Defendants did not
mail the security deposit until November 22, 2022, which was more than 21 days
after Plaintiff moved out. (Motion, Wade Decl., ¶¶18-19.) The Court notes that
although the Motion states a copy of the check with the remainder of
Plaintiff’s security deposit, dated November 22, 2022, is attached as Exhibit
A, no such copy of the check is submitted with the moving evidence. 
 
The other violation of section 1950.5 mentioned in the Motion is that Defendants
improperly deducted amounts from the security deposit for purported repairs that
were unnecessary and/or corrections of defects that existed prior to
Plaintiff’s tenancy. These amounts included (1) a $790.00 cleaning fee for
damages to the walls and floor that preexisted Plaintiff’s tenancy; (2) $1,195.00
to repaint the entire unit although Defendants’ own Second Inspection Report
showed only two marks on the walls; and (3) $314.00 “pro-rated rent” for
November 1 through 3, 2022 based on Defendants’ claim that Plaintiff did not
vacate the Premises until November 3, 2022. (Motion, Wade Decl., ¶19.) No
exhibits are cited in support of Plaintiff’s argument that these fees were
improper under section 1950.5, but they are are attested to by Plaintiff’s
declaration. 
 
This evidence carries Plaintiff’s initial burden of proof to demonstrate
that no triable issues of material fact exist regarding Defendants’ violation
of section 1950.5. The burden now shifts to Defendants to demonstrate the
existence of triable issues of material fact regarding the timing of the
returned security deposit and the propriety of the charges noted above.
 
Defendants’ Burden to Demonstrate the Existence of a Triable Issue of
Material Fact
 
Regarding the timing of the security deposit, Defendants argue that
Plaintiff did not move out until November 3, 2022, as she admitted in the First
Amended Complaint. (Opp., Separate Statement, Fact No. 7; FAC, ¶9.) This raises
a triable issue of material fact regarding the date Plaintiff moved out of the
Premises, and the date by which her security deposit was due. 21 days after
November 3, 2022 was November 24, 2022. It likewise raises a triable issue of
material fact regarding whether the pro-rated rent for November 1-3, 2022
deducted from Plaintiff’s security deposit was improper. 
 
Defendant also presents evidence disputing that the cleaning fee and
repainting fee were not necessary or were for pre-existing conditions of the
Premises. Specifically, they point to the move-in and move-out inspection form
from the November 3, 2022 final walk-through of the Premises, which indicated
the floors were damaged, the counters needed to be replaced, the plumbing
drains were slow, the refrigerator and microwave were dirty and the walls
needed painting because of the numerous marks. (Opp., Separate Statement, No.
25; Schneider Decl., ¶6 and Exh. 3.) 
 
This evidence carries Defendants’ burden to demonstrate the existence of
triable issues of material fact regarding their alleged violations of Civil
Code section 1950.5. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff Gizelle Wade’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
