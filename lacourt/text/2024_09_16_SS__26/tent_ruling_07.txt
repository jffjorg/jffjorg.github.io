ANALYSIS:
 
This action was originally filed
on July 11, 1996 by Judgment Creditor 3 C’s Group Financial, Inc. (“Judgment
Creditor”) and against Judgment Debtor Al Perets (“Judgment Debtor”) and
others. Judgment was entered in Judgment Creditor’s favor and against Judgment
Debtor on February 26, 1998. The judgment was renewed on February 1, 2008 and
August 30, 2017. 
 
On February 22, 2023, Judgment
Creditor filed an Application and Order for Appearance and Examination, which
was set for May 9, 2023. (Application and Order, filed 02/22/23.) Judgment
Debtor did not appear on May 9, 2023 but was represented by counsel and the
Court granted Judgment Creditor’s request to issue and hold a bench warrant.
(Minute Order, 05/09/23.) The hearing was continued to August 2, 2023 and
Judgment Debtor was ordered to appear on that date. (Ibid.) 
 
Judgment Debtor filed a
declaration in response to the Order to Appear on July 31, 2023. At the hearing
on August 2, 2023, the Court acknowledged the declaration and ordered the bench
warrant held until September 6, 2023. (Minute Order, 08/02/23.) On September 6,
2023, Judgment Debtor filed declarations but did not appear. (Minute Order,
09/06/23.) At Judgment Creditor’s request, the bench warrant was issued and
bail was set at $5,000.00. (Ibid.) Judgment Debtor’s Motion for
Reconsideration regarding the issuance of the bench warrant and setting of bail
was denied on November 30, 2023. 
 
On June 28, 2024, third-party Tom Block, claiming to be the assignee
of Judgment Creditor, filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Post-Judgment
Request for Production of Documents, Set One; and Request for Sanctions; and
(2) Motion to Compel Responses to Post-Judgment Interrogatories, Set One;
Request for Sanctions. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
First, no acknowledgment of assignment of judgment is on
file with the Court demonstrating that third-party Tom Block is the assignee of
Judgment Creditor. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 673.)
 
Second, the discovery requests served on Judgment Debtor do
not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 94, which limits the number of
written discovery requests to 35 in the limited jurisdiction court. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 94, subd. (a).) Judgment Creditor has served more than 35 requests on Judgment
Debtor. (Motions, Kelley Decl., Exhs. 36-37.) Based on the foregoing, the
discovery motions are denied. The Court will not grant motions to compel
discovery propounded in violation of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
 
Conclusion
 
Third-party Tom Block’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Post-Judgment
Request for Production of Documents, Set One; and Request for Sanctions; and
(2) Motion to Compel Responses to Post-Judgment Interrogatories, Set One;
Request for Sanctions are DENIED.
