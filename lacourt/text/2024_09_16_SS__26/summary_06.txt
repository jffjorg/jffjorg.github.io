The judge has granted the petition filed by Riviera Mobile Estates to declare a mobilehome abandoned. The mobilehome, located at 8801 Eton Avenue, Space 132, Canoga Park, California, has been unoccupied since September 2023 and no rent has been paid on the premises. The judge found that a reasonable person would believe the mobilehome to be abandoned based on these facts. As a result, the judge has awarded Riviera Mobile Estates $9,940.44 in principal, which is the accrued rent and storage fees on the mobilehome site from September 1, 2023 to the present. The judge notes that Riviera Mobile Estates may also move for an award of court costs and attorney's fees.
