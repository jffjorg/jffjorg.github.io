And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of Plaintiff La-Miyah C. Brown's action, filed by Petitioner Marsha Edwards, without prejudice. The court finds that the petition does not show that the minor's compromise will reimburse all of Plaintiff's medical expenses that have not been reduced or waived. The court orders Petitioner to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
