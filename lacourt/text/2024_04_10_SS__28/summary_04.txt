And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Emotional Health Association (EHA) to dismiss the case against it. The plaintiff, Vanessa Coats, alleges that EHA and Jenkins, the property owner, were negligent in preventing another tenant, Norma Burks, from threatening and pushing Coats out of a window. EHA argues that it is not liable for Coats' injuries because it was not foreseeable that Burks would engage in violent behavior. However, the court finds that EHA failed to carry its burden of showing that there is no triable issue of material fact regarding foreseeability. Specifically, the court notes that an EHA employee testified that she was concerned about Coats' safety due to the threats made by Burks. Therefore, the court denies EHA's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.
