And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiff, Nikole Marie Omotoy, filed an action against the defendant, Gianluca Paci, for motor vehicle tort. The plaintiff's counsel failed to make a timely demand for a jury trial, and as a result, the jury trial waiver was inadvertently waived. The plaintiff has filed a motion to relieve the waiver of jury trial, which the defendant has not opposed. The Court has considered the parties' stipulation that no prejudice would accrue to any party, and has exercised its discretion to grant the plaintiff's motion. The trial, which was previously set for December 26, 2024, will now be re-set as a jury trial.
