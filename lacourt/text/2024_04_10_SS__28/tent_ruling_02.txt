 Case Number:  21STCV23329    Hearing Date:   April 10, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
June 22, 2021, Plaintiffs Lamonte Brown and La-Miyah C. Brown, a minor, by and
through her guardian ad litem Marsha Edwards, filed this action against
Defendants Connie J. Howard and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort and general
negligence. 
On
October 26, 2022, the Court found that this case (case number 21STCV23329) and
case number 21STCV21001 are related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(a).  21STCV21001 became
the lead case. The cases were assigned to Department 28 at the Spring Street
Courthouse for all purposes.  The cases have not been consolidated.
On
December 6, 2022, counsel informed the Court that the case had settled.  However, Plaintiffs have not filed a notice of settlement in this case. 
On
January 9, 2024, Petitioner Marsha Edwards (“Petitioner”)
filed a petition for expedited approval of the compromise of the action of
Plaintiff La-Miyah C. Brown (“Plaintiff”). 
On
January 10, 2024, the Court advised counsel that the parties could not proceed
with the petition to approve the minor’s compromise until Petitioner filed, and the
Court granted, a request to appoint Petitioner to serve as Plaintiff’s guardian ad litem. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Marsha Edwards asks the Court to approve the compromise of Plaintiff La-Miyah
C. Brown’s claims. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
          The Court’s records do not contain an order appointing
Petitioner to serve as Plaintiff’s guardian ad litem in this case. 
          Section 13a(1) of the petition states that Plaintiff’s total
medical expenses were $24,376.67. 
Section 13a(2) states that, of this total amount, $19,525.03 was subject
to negotiated, contractual, or statutory reductions.  This should mean that the remaining medical
expenses, $4,851.64, would be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 13a(4) of the petition does
not list any amount of medical expenses to be paid or reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  Section 17b, on the
other hand, states that $2,025.45 of the
medical expenses will be paid from the settlement proceeds.  Assuming $2,025.45 should also be listed in
Section 13a(4), payment of this amount would still leave $2,826.19 of medical
expenses unaccounted for.  
The
Court cannot approve the petition unless it shows that the minor’s compromise
will reimburse all of Plaintiff’s medical expenses that have not been reduced
or waived. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for expedited approval of the
compromise of Plaintiff La-Miyah C. Brown’s action filed by Petitioner Marsha Edwards on
January 10, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
