And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the motion of Defendants Haim Mazar and Katya Mazar for leave to file a cross-complaint. The Court has considered the parties' arguments and concludes that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendants are acting in bad faith. The Court has liberally construed the statute to avoid forfeiture of a cause of action. The Court grants the motion in the interest of justice. The Defendants are ordered to file and serve the cross-complaint within 30 days of the hearing on this motion.
