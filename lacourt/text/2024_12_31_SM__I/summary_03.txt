And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the plaintiff's motion to tax the defendant's costs. The motion is granted in part and denied in part. The court grants the motion as to the filing and motion fees, but denies it as to the deposition costs, service of process costs, exhibit costs, court reporter fees, and fees for electronic filing. The court finds that the deposition costs are reasonable and necessary, despite the parties' stipulation to limit damages. The court also grants the motion as to the witness fees, transcript fees, and surveillance fees, but finds that these fees are not recoverable because they were not ordered by the court and were not necessary to the case. The court denies the motion as to the 998 offer, finding that it was not a good faith offer of settlement and that the defendant was aware that the plaintiff would not accept it. The court concludes that the defendant is entitled to recover some, but not all, of the costs sought.
