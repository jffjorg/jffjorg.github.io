 Case Number:  SC128659    Hearing Date:   December 31, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the application.  But the court will not continue or delay the
trial due to the writ petition absent (1) an order of the Court of Appeal so
directing; or (2) an order from the Court of Appeal issuing an alternative writ
or Order to Show Cause.  In other words,
if the DCA stays the case, of course the court will obey that order.  Or, if the DCA decides to consider the case
on its merits, the court will assume that the DCA has decided that there is
enough to the writ petition to warrant allowing the petition to run its course before
trial and therefore for the trial to be postponed.  But absent one of those sorts of orders, the
trial will go forward as scheduled.
