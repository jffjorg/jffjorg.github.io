And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for February 24, 2025. The case is an auto accident, and the defendant seeks to continue the trial because there has been a major change in the case, specifically a related case that must be tried first. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's success in this related case could impact the outcome of this case, as it would affect the plaintiff's ability to recover non-economic damages. The judge agrees with the defendant, citing Proposition 213, which restricts recovery of non-economic damages in auto accident cases where the plaintiff does not carry insurance of a certain amount. The judge vacates the FSC order and trial date and sets a case management conference (CMC) for February 14, 2025, to schedule an appropriate trial date once the related case has been decided.
