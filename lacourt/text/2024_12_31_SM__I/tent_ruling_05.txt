 Case Number:  23SMUD00389    Hearing Date:   December 31, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion for leave to file a cross complaint.  This was originally a UD case, but the court
understands that possession is no longer at issue and now this is a regular
civil matter.  Cross complainant seeks to
add a cause of action for breach of the warranty of habitability, which,
cross-complainant alleges, would be not only an affirmative defense but also
could lead to damages being awarded against the cross-defendant.  Prior counsel was relieved, but that could be
because the matter is no longer an unlawful detainer where possession is at
issue.  In opposition, cross-defendant
contends that cross-complainant has a practice of firing lawyers and getting
new ones on the first day of trial and then seeking a continuance.  Here, however, the trial is not se4t until May
11, 2026.  Adding the cross complaint
will not move the trial date. 
Cross-defendant also contends that the motion should have been made
earlier, inasmuch as possession was no longer at issue as of August 7,2023—well
over a year ago.  The court agrees that
this could have been brought earlier, but the cross-complaint is likely a
compulsory one, and leave to amend is generally granted absent bad faith.  While the matter could have been filed
sooner, the court sees no bad faith or prejudice.  Accordingly, the court is inclined to GRANT
the motion.  Cross-complainant will have
5 court days to file the cross-complaint as a stand alone document;
cross-defendant will have the time allowed by law to answer or otherwise
respond.
