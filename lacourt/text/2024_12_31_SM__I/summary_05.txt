And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint in a civil case that was originally an unlawful detainer (UD) case. The cross-complainant wants to add a cause of action for breach of the warranty of habitability, which could lead to damages being awarded against the cross-defendant. The cross-defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the cross-complainant has a practice of firing lawyers and seeking continuances, and that the motion should have been made earlier. The judge agrees that the motion could have been brought earlier, but finds no bad faith or prejudice. The judge is inclined to grant the motion, allowing the cross-complainant to file the cross-complaint as a standalone document within 5 court days, and giving the cross-defendant the standard time to respond.
