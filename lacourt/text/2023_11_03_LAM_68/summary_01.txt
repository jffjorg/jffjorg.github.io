```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Young Generation Video, Inc. and David Skura, against the plaintiff, Jesus Agama. The plaintiff alleges two causes of action against the defendants, one for negligence and one for premises liability, but the judge has ruled that these claims are barred by the Privette Doctrine.

The Privette Doctrine states that a person or entity that hires an independent contractor to do work generally is not liable for on-the-job injuries to the independent contractor's workers. The judge has found that the defendants did not exercise control over the manner in which the contractor performed the work, and that the power line was not a latent or concealed hazardous condition. Therefore, the judge has granted the motion for summary judgment and has dismissed the plaintiff's claims against the defendants.
