  Case Number:  21STCV02797    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  68 Motion for Summary Judgment, or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication
Jesus Agama vs. Young Generation Video, Inc., et al.,
21STCV02797
Moving Parties: Defendants Young Generation Video, Inc. and
David Skura

Responding Party: Plaintiff
Jesus Agama

I.                  
Background
Plaintiff Jesus Agama (Plaintiff) was
injured at a construction site owned by Defendants David Skura (Skura) and
Young Generation Video, Inc (YGV) (collectively “Defendants”). (UMF Nos. 1, 9.)
Plaintiff was injured when a piece of metal that he was holding came into
contact with a power line. (UMF Nos. 9-10.) 
Plaintiff was hired by Defendant
Gustavo Espinoza as an independent contractor. (Plaintiff’s Comp., ¶ 3.)
Espinoza was hired by Defendant Numa Brothers as a subcontractor to work on the
premises. (Plaintiff’s Comp., ¶ 4.) Numa Brothers were hired by YGV for the
construction. (Plaintiff’s Comp., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff was not directly hired by
YGV. Neither YGV nor Skura retained control of the work performed by Plaintiff.
(UMF No. 4.) Numa Brothers were aware of the proximity of the power lines to
the roof of the property at the construction site. (UMF No. 5.) Defendants were
not asked to remedy the issue of the power line’s proximity to the roof. (UMF
No. 6.)
After sustaining his injuries,
Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants Skura and YGV and other parties
involved in the construction. Plaintiff alleged two causes of action in his
complaint: one for negligence and one for premises liability. Defendants filed
a motion for summary judgment to both of Plaintiff’s causes of action based on
the Privette Doctrine, or in the alternative, based on Plaintiff’s
alleged contributory negligence. Plaintiff opposes Defendants’ motion.

Analysis
a.     
Standard for Summary Judgment and
Adjudication
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) CCP Section 437c(c) “requires the trial
judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)¿ “The function
of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of
the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose
whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.”¿ (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
381-382.)¿ 
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.”¿ (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)¿ 
When interpreting § 437c, courts have held that a
three-step analysis is required: (1) Identify the issues framed by the
pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond by
establishing a complete defense or otherwise showing there is no factual basis
for relief on any theory reasonably contemplated by the opponent’s pleading;
(2) Determine whether the moving party’s showing has established facts which
negate the opponent’s claim and justify a judgment in movant’s favor; and (3) Determine
whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material
factual issue. (AARTS Production, Inc. v. Crocker National Bank (1986)
179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064-1065.)¿¿ 
Summary Judgment may be granted only where all the
supporting and opposition papers show there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment “as a matter of
law.” (CCP § 437c(c).)¿¿ 
As a result, the Plaintiff “must present evidence that
would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact
more likely than not—otherwise, he would not be entitled to judgment as a
matter of law but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 851, fns. omitted; Oldcastle
Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 554,
562-563.)¿¿ 
The Defendant need only show the existence of a triable
issue of material fact. (Union Bank v. Super Ct. (Demetry) (1995)
31 Cal.4th 573, 590; see Lopez v. SuperCt. (Friedman Bros. Invest. Co.) (1996)
45 Cal.4th 705, 713; Leslie G. v. Perfy & Assocs. (1996) 43 Cal.4th 472, 482.) Summary
judgment would not be proper where the facts support a triable issue of fact.¿ 
b.     
Issues for Summary Judgment
                                                             
i.     
Issue No. 1
Defendants move for summary judgment against Plaintiff’s First and Second Causes of
Action on the basis that Plaintiff’s claims against Defendants are barred by
the Privette Doctrine.
The
Privette Doctrine “deals with whether an entity that hires an
independent contractor can be liable for on-the-job injuries sustained by the
independent contractor’s workers. Under the Privette doctrine, the
answer is no, unless an exception applies.” (Miller v. Roseville Lodge No.
1293 (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 825, 828.)
“The
Privette doctrine takes its name from Privette v. Superior Court
(1993) 5 Cal.4th 689 … which held that a person or entity that hires an
independent contractor to do work generally is not liable for on-the-job
injuries to the independent contractor’s workers.” (Miller, 83
Cal.App.5th at 831–32.)  (Se also, Acosta
v. MAS Realty, LLC (Cal. Ct. App., Sept. 20, 2023, No. B316420) 2023 WL
6889820, reh’g denied (Oct. 19, 2023), as modified (Oct. 19, 2023).)
 
“There
is a strong presumption under California law that a hirer of an independent
contractor delegates to the contractor all responsibility for workplace
safety.” (Gonzalez v. Mathis (2021) 12 Cal.5th 29, 37.) “This means that
a hirer is typically not liable for injuries sustained by an independent
contractor or its workers while on the job.” (Id. at 37-38.)
The
Privette Doctrine applies to any injured worker, whether labeled an
“employee” or “independent contractor” and “includes ‘the independent
contractor personally, the independent contractor’s employees, the independent
contractor’s subcontractors personally, the subcontractors’ employees, and so
on.’” (Miller, 83 Cal.App.5th at 829, n.1 (quoting Sandoval v.
Qualcomm Inc. (2021) 12 Cal.5th 256, 270 & n.2).)
There
are two exceptions to the Privette Doctrine: (1) if the hirer retains
control over the manner in which the contractor performs the work; and (2) if
the hirer is also an owner or possessor of land and knew or should have known
of a latent or concealed hazardous condition on the property and failed to warn
about the condition. (Miller, 83 Cal.App.5th at 833-834.)
Plaintiff was hired by Defendant Gustavo Espinoza as an
independent contractor. (Plaintiff’s Comp., ¶ 3.) Espinoza was hired by
Defendant Numa Brothers as a subcontractor to work on the premises.
(Plaintiff’s Comp., ¶ 4.) Numa Brothers were hired by YGV for the construction.
(Plaintiff’s Comp., ¶ 4.) Despite these allegations being in Plaintiff’s
own Complaint, Plaintiff’s opposition disputes this hiring chain as presented
by Defendants in their motion. To oppose this, Plaintiff points to a deposition
from a person from OSHA named Dimenstein who says that Espinoza told her that
Espinoza did not hire Plaintiff. (Plaintiff’s DMF 2; Dimenstein Depo. at
172:5-8.) In Defendants’ reply, Defendants argue that this is a
misrepresentation of what Dimenstein said, as she actually did make a
determination that Espinoza was Plaintiff’s employer. (Landes Decl., Ex. 9,
Dimenstein Depo. At 163:6-10.)
With
the hiring chain established, it is clear that the Privette Doctrine
would apply to this situation. The contractors would be responsible for safety
at the construction site, not Defendants. The next question is whether either
of the exceptions to the Privette Doctrine would apply.
For
the first exception, the hirer, Defendants, did not retain control over the
manner in which the contractor performed the work. (UMF 4.) While Skura testified
at deposition that he made sure the project progressed (Plaintiff’s DMF 4),
this does not amount to retaining control over the project based on the case
law definition. This exception applies if the hirer “retain[s] control over
safety conditions at a worksite and negligently exercises that control in a
manner that affirmatively contributes to an employee’s injuries.” (Hooker v.
Department of Transportation (2002) 27 Cal.4th 198, 213.) Plaintiff has
presented no evidence that Defendants exercised control in a way that
contributed to Plaintiff’s injuries.
For
the second exception, the power line was not a latent or concealed hazardous
condition. For this exception to apply, the hazard must be a “concealed hazard
on the property that the contractor did not know of and could not have
reasonably discovered.” (Kinsman v. Unocal Corp. (2005) 37 Cal.4th 659.)
There is no evidence presented by Plaintiff that he did not know of the power
line or could not have reasonably discovered it.
Neither
exception to the Privette Doctrine would apply in this case. Because the
Privette Doctrine is applicable to this action and there are no triable
issues of material fact, Plaintiff’s causes of action for negligence and
premises liability fail as a matter of law against Defendants YGV and David
Skura.

            The Court
grants Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s First and Second Causes
of Action.
                                                           
ii.     
Issue No. 2
In the alternative, Defendants
argue that Plaintiff’s contributory negligence bars recovery even if Defendants
were negligent.
Because the Court granted
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment based on the Privette Doctrine
issue, it is not necessary for the Court to address whether Plaintiff was
contributorily negligent. However, in reviewing the case law regarding power
lines and Defendants’ evidence supporting this argument, the Court would likely
have found that Plaintiff was contributorily negligent if he knew about the
power line.

Order
Defendants Skura and YGV’s motion
for summary judgment is GRANTED IN ITS ENTIRETY.
