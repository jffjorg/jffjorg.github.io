 Case Number:  23STCV14488    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  68 Lauren Swaim vs. Greystar
California, Inc.; 23STCV14488
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Greystar California,
Inc.
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Lauren Swaim
Demurrer to Complaint with Motion to Strike
I.
BACKGROUND
            This case arises out of an alleged
incident in which Plaintiff Lauren Swaim (Plaintiff) was attacked by an unknown
security guard assailant. The attack happened at 548 Spring Street, and
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Greystar California Inc. (Greystar) is one of
several entities that owns the property. (Comp., ¶ 19.) It appears from
Plaintiff’s complaint that she lives at the property where she was attacked. 
Plaintiff’s complaint attempts to allege 12 causes of action against all
named and Doe defendants. The causes of action include assault; battery;
intentional infliction of emotion distress; false imprisonment; negligence;
tenant harassment; housing discrimination; breach of implied warranty of habitability;
breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment; violation of LAMC, article 5.3;
Violation of Los Angeles County Code, Section 8.52.130; and bad faith retention
of security deposit.  Every claim is
asserted against every defendant.  There
is nothing in the Complaint that provides information related to the actions of
any particular defendant.
After stating that Greystar owns the property, Plaintiff’s complaint
never mentions Greystar by name again. Instead, Plaintiff just uses the
collective “Defendants” throughout her complaint. There are no specific
allegations alleged against Greystar.
Greystar demurs to all of Plaintiff’s causes of action on the basis that
they are uncertain and fail to allege any specific allegations against
Greystar. Plaintiff opposes.
            Greystar has also moved to strike portions
of Plaintiff’s complaint.
II. ANALYSIS 
A. The Demurrer
As a
general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
Where a
demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the
plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
1.   
All
Causes of Action
Defendant Greystar demurs to each of Plaintiff’s
causes of action on the basis that they are uncertain and do not contain
specific allegations against Greystar, only conclusory allegations of
wrongdoing against all defendants.
A complaint is subject to a special demurrer if the
pleading is uncertain. (CCP § 430.10(f).) As used in this subdivision,
“'uncertain' includes ambiguous and unintelligible.” (CCP § 430.10(f).) If a
complaint is so uncertain that a defendant “cannot reasonably respond,” the
complaint is properly subject to a special demurrer. (Khoury v. Maly's of
Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) The inability to reasonably
respond occurs when a defendant cannot determine what issues to admit or deny,
or what claims are being made against him. (Id.; see also, Williams
v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139.) Furthermore,
the failure to allege material facts essential to a cause of action may also
subject a pleading to special demurrer for uncertainty, particularly if the
plaintiff’s knowledge of those material facts is superior to that of the defendant.
(Corum v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. (1945) 67 Cal.App.2d 891.)
In pleading, the essential facts upon which a determination of the controversy
depends should be stated with clearness and precision so that nothing it left
to surmise; recitals, references to, or allegations of material facts which are
left to surmise are subject to special demurrer for uncertainty. (Ankey v.
Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 531.)
In this case, because Plaintiff has not pled any
specific allegations against Greystar, Greystar is left to surmise which ones
apply to it. This makes Plaintiff’s complaint uncertain. Indeed, it is
difficult for the Court to understand the allegations in the Complaint as they
are simply legal conclusions, with virtually nothing factual supporting the claimed
cause of action.  Nothing of substance is
communicated.
Plaintiff’s opposition argues that the complaint is
sufficient, but then Plaintiff’s opposition points to facts that are not, in
fact, evident from the complaint. Plaintiff must plead her complaint with
specificity and certainty; otherwise, Greystar cannot determine what to admit
or deny.
The lack of facts is glaring.  Facts, not conclusion should be pled to
support each cause of action against each of the defendants that Plaintiff alleges
is implicated in a particular cause of action.
Defendant Greystar’s demurrer to all of Plaintiff’s
causes of action is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
