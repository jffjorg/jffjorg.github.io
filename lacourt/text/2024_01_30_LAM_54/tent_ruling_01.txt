Hearing Date: January 30, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Compel Compliance
Moving Party: Defendants Emerge Capital Management,
Inc. and Lisa Langley
Responding Party: Plaintiff Marcia Mohler
 
T/R:     DEFENDANTS’
MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE IS GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF TO SERVE ALL RESPONSIVE DOCUMENTS, AND/OR A SWORN STATEMENT
THAT ALL RESPONSIVE DOCUMENTS IN DEFENDANT’S POSSESSION AND CONTROL HAVE BEEN
SERVED, WITHIN 30 DAYS OF NOTICE OF RULING.
DEFENDANTS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel
(or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
CCP § 2031.320(a) provides “[i]f a
party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling. . . thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling in accordance with that party's statement of compliance,
the demanding party may move for an order compelling compliance.”
 
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s
compliance with the statement of compliance in response to requests for
production of documents. Defendant asserts Plaintiff has failed to produce all
responsive documents relating to her Social Security Administration disability
benefits. In opposition, Plaintiff represents all responsive documents in her
control have been produced. In reply, Defendant asserts Plaintiff must make
more effort to obtain certain documents that are in the possession of her
former attorney or in possession of SSA.
 
As the parties dispute whether all
responsive documents have been served, the Court will order Plaintiff to
provide, within 15 days of notice of ruling, all responsive documents and/or a
sworn statement that all responsive documents in Plaintiff’s possession and
control have been served. The Court emphasizes, however, that Plaintiff need
only produce documents over which she has possession or control. Plaintiff must
disclose documents Plaintiff provided to her disability attorney, but otherwise
need not provide, in response to these document requests, documents maintained
by the attorney.
 
The Court declines to award sanctions
as there is no evidence of bad faith or intentional disregard of discovery
obligations.
