  - "The Felisildas' claim against FCA directly relates to the condition of the vehicle that they allege to have violated warranties they received as a consequence of the sales contract. Because the Felisildas expressly agreed to arbitrate claims arising out of the condition of the vehicle – even against third-party nonsignatories to the sales contract – they are estopped from refusing to arbitrate their claim against FCA." (Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, 497)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this lemon law action. The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration provision in the lease agreement executed by the plaintiff, Prescila Wilkins, on December 7, 2019. The judge found that the defendant is not entitled to compel arbitration under the lease agreement.

The judge cited the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) and several California court decisions, including Felisilda v. FCA US LLC and Ford Motor Warranty Cases (Ochoa v. Ford), in reaching this decision. The judge concluded that the defendant is a non-signatory to the arbitration agreement and therefore cannot compel arbitration under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.

The judge ordered the defendant to notice, and if the parties wish to submit on the tentative, they must email the courtroom with notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
