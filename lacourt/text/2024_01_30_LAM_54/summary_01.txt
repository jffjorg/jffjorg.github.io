And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel compliance with discovery obligations. The plaintiff, Marcia Mohler, has failed to produce all responsive documents relating to her Social Security Administration disability benefits. The defendants have requested that the plaintiff serve all responsive documents and/or a sworn statement that all responsive documents have been served within 30 days of notice of the ruling. The plaintiff will also need to provide a sworn statement indicating that all responsive documents in her possession and control have been served. The judge has emphasized that the plaintiff only needs to produce documents over which she has possession or control, and does not need to provide documents maintained by her disability attorney. The judge has declined to award sanctions as there is no evidence of bad faith or intentional disregard of discovery obligations.
