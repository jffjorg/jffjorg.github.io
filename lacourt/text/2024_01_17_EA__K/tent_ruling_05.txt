Plaintiff was not provided meal and rest breaks. In or about September 2022,

Wrongful Termination in Violation of the Public Policy
On October 2, 2023, EOI’s default was entered.
A Case Management Conference is set for January 17, 2024.
Legal Standard
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party
or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)
Discussion
EOI moves the court, per Code of Civil Procedure § 473,
subdivision (b), for an order setting aside the October 2, 2023 entry of default
on the basis of inadvertence, surprise, mistake, or excusable neglect.
“Excusable neglect” referred to in Section 473, subdivision
(b), “is that neglect which might have been the act of a reasonably prudent
person under the same circumstances.” (Hodge Sheet Metal Products v. Palm
Springs Riviera Hotel (1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 653, 657).
EOI’s Communications Director Giovanni Zamora (“Zamora”)
represents, and/or the accompanying exhibit reflects, that CSS is a staffing
agency that contracted with EOI for limited back-office administrative
services, including payroll processing tasks, for its temporary employees
placed to work at its client’s worksites (Zamora Decl., ¶ 3); that CSS placed
Plaintiff with Markwins as a temporary employee until her assignment ended (Id.);
that, based on its contract with CSS and its believed status as an additional
insured under CSS’s Employment Practices Liability Insurance policy, EOI
believes and understands that CSS must indemnify and defend EOI from
Plaintiff’s claims (Id., ¶ 4); that EOI was contacted by Plaintiff’s
counsel in September 2023 regarding the complaint filed by Plaintiff (Zamora
Decl., ¶ 5); that on September 27, 2023, he reached out to CSS to advise them
of Plaintiff’s complaint and was instructed that day by CSS’s designated Safety
and Risk Manager Jesse Pena (“Pena”) to “send the [complaint] to him for
handling” (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. A); that he sent Plaintiff’s complaint to Pena
on September 28, 2023 (Id.); that CSS did not inform EOI that it would
not indemnify or defend it from the action or advise EOI to seek its own legal
counsel (Id., ¶ 7) and that EOI did not retain legal counsel for this
matter because it believes and understood that CSS was indemnifying and
defending it in the lawsuit (Id.) Again, EOI’s default was entered on
October 2, 2023.
Plaintiff, in opposition, claims that EOI is not entitled to
discretionary relief because its counsel provided numerous warnings to EOI that
its default would be entered if it failed to provide an answer. The exhibits
attached to attorney Eli Banayan’s (“Banayan”) declaration, however, reflect
that EOI was actively communicating with Plaintiff’s counsel commencing August
15, 2023 (i.e., after Plaintiff’s complaint was served by substitute service on
August 2, 2023 and before service was made effective August 19, 2023) but was
having trouble identifying Plaintiff in its system as late as September 27,
2023, the very day it reached out to CSS. (See Rabban Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. B;
Banayan Decl., ¶¶ 2-14, Exhs. A-M).
The court is mindful that “Section 473 is often applied
liberally where the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the
party opposing the motion will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted. In
such situations ‘very slight evidence will be required to justify a court in
setting aside the default.’” (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d
227, 233 [citation omitted].) The burden of showing prejudice is on the
opposing party. (Aldrich v. San Fernando Valley Lumber Co., Inc. (1985)
170 Cal.App.3d 725, 740). EOI filed the instant motion on November 22, 2023,
less than two months after default was entered. Plaintiff has not asserted any
prejudice whatsoever.
Additionally, there is no requirement that EOI must
affirmatively demonstrate a meritorious defense. (See Shapiro v. Clark
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1144 [“We presume that [Smith v. Busniewski
(1952) 115 Cal.App.2d 124] is still good law insofar as it holds that in a separate action in equity brought to set aside a
prior judgment, the plaintiff must ‘plead and prove that the result in the main action would
have been different had the mistake not occurred [citations], since equity will
not grant relief to a party who claims only the barren right of being permitted
to defend against a claim to which he has no defense. [Citations.]’ (Id.
at p. 128). Courts once imposed a similar requirement on statutory motions to
set aside default, but in 1981, . . ., the Legislature abrogated any such
requirement by explicitly declaring, ‘No affidavit or declaration of merits
shall be required of the moving party.’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b);
Stats. 1981)”].)
The court finds that EOI has adequately demonstrated
excusable neglect under Section 473. The motion is granted.
