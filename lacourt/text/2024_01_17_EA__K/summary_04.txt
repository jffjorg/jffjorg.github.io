And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for an order granting preference in setting the case for trial. The plaintiff, a minor, was sexually assaulted and battered at daycare and is seeking a preferential trial date due to their age and interest in the case. The judge found that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the case as the injured party and that the motion for preference is mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure § 36, subdivision (b). The judge noted that the plaintiff's counsel has provided a copy of the plaintiff's birth certificate and that the defendants have acknowledged the plaintiff's minor status. The judge also found that the motion is supported by a declaration from counsel that all essential parties have been served with process or have appeared. The judge has set a final status conference for February 25, 2025, and a trial for March 11, 2025.
