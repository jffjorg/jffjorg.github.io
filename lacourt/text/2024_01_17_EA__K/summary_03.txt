Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Anakin Mark Privitera's motion to reopen discovery in this case. The motion was based on the claim that Privitera's previous attorney of record initiated but failed to complete discovery, and that he needs to conduct additional discovery to prepare for trial. However, the judge found that Privitera has had more than two years to conduct discovery and that reopening discovery at this juncture would likely result in a further continuance of the trial date, which the court is unwilling to countenance. The judge also noted that Privitera failed to identify what discovery had already been conducted and when, why it was not conducted before, what additional discovery he seeks to conduct, and how this additional discovery is necessary.
