MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 2/29/24.
 
MINOR: J.D.
GAL: Rashina Daniel (parent)
DEFENDANTS: Gerber Products Company and Vallarta Food
Enterprises Inc.
NOTICE: ok
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION: Plaintiff Rashina Daniel,
mother of Minor J.D., purchased baby food Gerber Organic Pear, Purple Carrot,
Raspberry Sitter 2nd Foods, from a Vallarta supermarket  located at 18571 Soledad Canyon Road, Canyon
Country, CA 91351.  On 1/17/22, Minor was
fed the baby food and began to breathe in an abnormal and noisy way.  Rashina Daniel’s older son heard his sister’s
labored breathing and examined the jar.  He discovered a string-like foreign substance.
J.D. consumed some of the foreign substance from the jar and was injured.
 
On 1/18/22, Minor visited the doctor and was diagnosed
with stridor.  The doctor informed
Rashina Daniel that Minor would need to visit a specialist at Providence
Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center in Tarzana. California.  The specialist in Tarzana, Dr. Oallalzedeh,
ordered an Esophagram.  Minor was then
placed under anesthesia, and the doctor unsuccessfully attempted to remove the
foreign body.  On 1/19/22, Minor  was transported to Children's Hospital Los
Angeles via ambulance.  Minor was put
under anesthesia and doctors unsuccessfully tried to remove the foreign body.  Minor was discharged Thursday, 1/20/22.  From the medical records it appears that the
doctors could not confirm that that there was any foreign body remaining in
Minor.  The petition indicates that Minor
has completely recovered from the effects of the injuries.
 
RULING: The petition for approval of the
settlement of the Minor’s claim is granted.
