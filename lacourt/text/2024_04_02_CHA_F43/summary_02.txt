And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages and related allegations. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendants acted with malice, fraud, or oppression in covering up the incident and denying knowledge of how the plaintiff was injured. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and lack specific factual allegations to support a claim for punitive damages. The court holds that to maintain a claim for punitive damages, the plaintiff must provide specific allegations of how the defendants' actions went beyond normal negligence. The plaintiff is given 30 days to amend their complaint to include specific allegations.
