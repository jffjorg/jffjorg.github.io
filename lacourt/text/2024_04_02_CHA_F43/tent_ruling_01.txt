ANALYSIS
Sean Dowsing of
Manning & Kass, Ellrod, Ramirez, Trester LLP, counsel of record for
Defendant Avex Builders, Inc., seeks to be relieved as counsel for that
party.¿Counsel filed a motion with the required Forms MC-051, MC-052, and
MC-053. Counsel’s declaration states that the client did not voluntarily
consent to counsel’s request to be relieved, which is why they filed this
motion. Counsel also states that irreconcilable differences have arisen between
client and counsel.
 
Absent a
showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.¿(People v. Prince¿(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)¿There is no
showing of prejudice, and counsel’s motion complies with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362 and meets its requirements.
 
It is worth
noting that corporations may not represent themselves. (Merco Constr.
Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724.) Defendant Avex
Builders, Inc., should immediately find new counsel.
 
Motion to be
relieved as counsel is granted.
