And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Sean Dowsing, counsel for Defendant Avex Builders, Inc., to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed after irreconcilable differences arose between Dowsing and his client, and the client did not voluntarily consent to the request to be relieved. The judge notes that, absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted, and there is no showing of prejudice in this case. The judge also reminds that corporations may not represent themselves, and therefore Avex Builders, Inc. should immediately find new counsel.
