And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery filed by Plaintiff Oscar Ruiz-Ramirez against Defendant Kia America, Inc. The Plaintiff alleges that Kia sold a defective vehicle and declined to repurchase, and seeks to compel further discovery responses from Kia. The judge finds that the Plaintiff's meet and confer efforts were insufficient, and that Plaintiff did not make a good faith effort to resolve the discovery dispute informally. As a result, the judge denies the motion without prejudice and orders the parties to further meet and confer. The judge also notes that Plaintiff may refile the motion if the parties are unable to reach an informal resolution.
