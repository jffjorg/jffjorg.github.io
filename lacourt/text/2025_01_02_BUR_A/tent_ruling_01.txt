ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Alex Rosales
Hernandez (Plaintiff) brings this action against Ford
Motor Company (Ford). Plaintiff alleges that Ford sold him a defective 2022
Ford F-150 (Subject Vehicle) and thereafter declined to repurchase the vehicle
in violation of the Song-Beverly Act. 
 
Before
the Court are two motions to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s Request
for the Production of Documents (RFPD) and Special Interrogatories. 
 
On
October 25, 2024, these motions came on for hearing. The Court found that Plaintiff
had failed to demonstrate good faith meet and confer efforts prior to the
brining of this motion. The Court ordered the parties further meet and confer
and continued the motions to December 20, 2024. To the extent that it was
necessary, Ford was ordered to file supplemental briefing as to the protective
order no later than December 6, 2024. Any responsive briefing from Plaintiff
was due no later than December 11, 2024. 
 
Ford did
not file supplemental briefing by the ordered deadline. On December 11, 2024,
despite the fact that Ford had filed no further briefings Plaintiff filed a short
responsive brief. On December 19, 2024, Ford filed a separately noticed Motion
for Protective Order to be heard March 7, 2025. 
 
On
December 20, 2024, these motions were continued once more to January 2, 2025 as
a result of scheduling conflict in the Court’s calendar. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
The Court begins by
observing that none of the requirements of its October 25, 2024 Order were
complied with. 
 
First, the parties
were specifically ordered to further meet and confer regarding the proposed
protective order. This order was intended to address the deficiency in
Plaintiff’s prior meet and confer efforts, without requiring the motions be
refiled. As described in the previous minute order, the Court found Plaintiff’s
rejection of Ford’s proposed protective order to be without sufficient basis.
(See Oct. 25 Minute Order [“Without even seeing the proposed protective order,
Plaintiff’s counsel rejects the assumed deviations from the LASC model order
and proceeds to assert that Ford has provided no information to substantiate
the need for a protective order.”].) 
 
Despite the above, neither Plaintiff’s supplemental
briefing nor Ford’s Motion for Protective Order contain any declarations
speaking to further meet and confer efforts after the first hearing. It appears
the parties continued to practice meet and confer by way of attrition, despite
a direct order of this Court requiring them to attempt informal resolution. 
 
Second, Ford neglected
the Court’s order to file supplemental briefing on the issue of the protective
order. Instead, Ford filed a completely separate Motion for Protective Order to
be heard March 7, 2025. This filing came after the Court’s required deadline
for supplemental briefing and has resulted in a situation where Plaintiff has
effectively had no chance to respond prior to this hearing.
 
Plaintiff asserts that
Ford never provided Plaintiff with a copy of the proposed protective order.   Ford claims that its proposed protective
order is based on the Los Angele Superior Court’s model protective order with
simply three paragraphs modified.  Ford
does not offer explanation as to why they did not comply with the Court’s
order, and with a trial date set Ford’s action will likely result in a
continuance of the trial date.
 
The Court is
disinclined to have an unwarranted delay of discovery for 90 days for failing
to provide a copy of the proposed protective order to Plaintiff.  The Court will again continue this matter and
order Ford to provide Plaintiff a copy of the proposed protective order within
three court days of this order.  The
Court will also set the matter for a sanctions hearing against Ford for
violation of the Court’s order concerning supplemental protective order
briefing and failing to properly meet an confer on the protective order issue.
 
Plaintiff will be
obligated to review the protective order and provide a meaningful meet and
confer concerning the protective order within three court days of receiving the
protective order from Ford.
