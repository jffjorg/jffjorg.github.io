And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge, Edward B. Moreton, Jr., has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Erin Haskell v. Floyd Joy Mayweather, Jr. et al. The case involves a breach of contract and fraud claim, with Plaintiff Erin Haskell alleging she was duped into making $485,000 in investments and loans to the Defendants.

The Judge has denied without prejudice Floyd Joy Mayweather Jr.'s motion to quash service of summons. Mayweather argued that he was not properly served, but the Judge found that the statutory requirements for service of process were not met at the time the motion was filed. However, the Plaintiff subsequently filed a proof of service by substitute service, which the Judge considered.

The Judge noted that the burden is on the Plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving the facts requisite to an effective service. The Judge also cited various cases and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure, to support their decision.

The Judge's decision is based on the principle that service of process is fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant, and that the statutory requirements for service of process should be liberally construed to uphold jurisdiction. The Judge also noted that a defendant may move to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her, but the motion must be filed on or before the last day of the defendant's time to plead.

In this case, the Judge found that Mayweather's motion was premature and that the subsequent filing of a proof of service by substitute service cured any defects in the service of summons. Therefore, the Judge denied Mayweather's motion to quash service of summons without prejudice.
