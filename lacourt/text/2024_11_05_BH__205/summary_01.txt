And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by defendants WG Hacienda SH LP dba Atria Hacienda and Atria Management Company LLC to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is denied. The plaintiff, Ken Listoe, alleges that the defendants failed to provide adequate care at their assisted living facility, resulting in his falls and pressure injuries. The defendants argued that the plaintiff has not sufficiently pled elder abuse, as he has not alleged recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice. However, the judge disagreed, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently pled elder abuse based on the allegations of the Complaint. The judge also found that the defendants authorized or ratified abuse by failing to take corrective action in disciplining staff members who failed to follow the plaintiff's care plans. The judge ordered that the demurrer be overruled, allowing the plaintiff's case to proceed.
