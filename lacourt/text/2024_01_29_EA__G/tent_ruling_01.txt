  Case Number:  21PSCV00399    Hearing Date:   January 29, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Bassett Unified School District’s Motion for  Protective Order Respondent: Defendant Del  Terra Real Estate Services, Inc. TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff Bassett Unified School District’s Motion for  Protective Order is DENIED. BACKGROUND This is a breach of contract  action arising from an agreement to provide construction management services.  In April 2015, Plaintiff Bassett Unified School District (BUSD) entered into a  written agreement with Defendant Del Terra Real Estate Services, Inc. (Del  Terra) in which Del Terra agreed to provide construction management services for  BUSD’s new and existing construction projects. In 2018 and 2019, the agreement  between BUSD and Del Terra was extended. Subsequently, BUSD alleges Del Terra  breached the agreement by overbilling BUSD and failing to maintain proper  records. On May 17, 2021, BUSD filed a  complaint against Del Terra and Does 1-100, alleging the following causes of  action: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) negligence,  (4) intentional misrepresentation, (5) constructive fraud, and (6) negligent  misrepresentation. On September 17, 2021, BUSD  filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same defendants alleging the  same causes of action. On January 4, 2022, the court sustained a demurrer by  Del Terra to BUSD’s fourth and fifth causes of action without leave to amend. On February 3, 2022, Del  Terra filed a cross-complaint against BUSD and Roes 1-100, alleging the  following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the covenant  of good faith and fair dealing, (3) declaratory relief. On December 6, 2023, BUSD  filed the present motion. A hearing on BUSD’s motion is set for January 29,  2024, with a final status conference on July 10 and a jury trial on July 23. ANALYSIS BUSD  moves for a protective order to preclude or limit the deposition of Dolores  Rivera. For the following reasons, the court DENIES their motion. Legal Standard "The court, for good cause shown, may make any  order that justice requires to protect any party or other natural person or  organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue  burden and expense.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.090, subd. (b)  [interrogatories], 2031.060, subd. (b) [production of documents], 2033.080,  subd. (b) [requests for admission].) Such orders may include excusing the party  from answering the discovery requests at issue, limiting the number of  discovery requests, or extending the time to respond to discovery requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.090, subd. (b), 2031.060, subd. (b), 2033.080, subd.  (b).) The court has considerable discretion in granting and crafting protective  orders. (Raymond Handling Concepts Corp. v. Superior Court (1995) 39  Cal.App.4th 584, 588.) Discussion On  November 21, 2023, Del Terra served a notice of deposition of Rivera on BUSD  that was set for December 20, 2023. (Warren Decl., ¶ 3.) On November 27, 2023, BUSD’s  counsel sent an email to Del Terra’s counsel that objected to the deposition of  Rivera and sought to meet and confer. (Warren Decl., ¶ 4.) On December 5, 2023,  Del Terra’s counsel responded to BUSD’s meet and confer correspondence with an  email. (Warren Decl., ¶ 5; Nguyen Decl., ¶ 11.) Based on these averments, the  court finds parties have adequately met and conferred on the requested  protective order. In  this case, BUSD moves for a protective order on the grounds that the deposition  of Rivera, who is a member of BUSD’s board, would uncover matters that are  privileged pursuant to the deliberate process privilege. In County of Los  Angeles v. Superior Court (1975) 13 Cal.3d 721, our supreme court  recognized the “fundamental, historically enshrined legal principle that  precludes any judicially authorized inquiry into the subjective motives or  mental processes of legislators.” (Id., at p. 726.) And subsequent  courts have applied this principle to the boards of local school districts. (See,  e.g., Governing Board v. Superior Court (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1158, 1161-62  [mental processes of governing board members in quasi-judicial proceedings not  subject to discovery].) Furthermore,  “[i]t is the general rule in both  California and federal courts that the heads of agencies and other top  governmental executives are normally not subject to depositions.” (Id.,  at p. 1467-1468.) “An exception to this general rule exists concerning top  officials who have direct personal factual information pertaining to material  issues in an action. [Citations.] [¶] A top governmental official may, however,  only be deposed upon a showing that the information to be gained from such a  deposition is not available through any other source. [Citations.]” (Id.,  at p. 1468, quoting Church of Scientology of Boston v. I.R.S. (D. Mass.  1990) 138 F.R.D. 9, 12.) “Thus, where a party seeks to depose a high government  official, and the official moves for a protective order, the burden is on the  deposing party to show that compelling reasons exist for permitting the  deposition.” (Contractors’ State License Bd. v. Superior Court (2018) 23  Cal.App.5th 125, 132.) Here, BUSD argues Nagle v. Superior Court (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1465 bars  Rivera’s deposition. In opposition, Del Terra argues Nagle is  inapplicable because Rivera was a school board member and not a top government  executive. But courts have found members of government boards to qualify as such  high government officials. (Contractors' State License Bd at p. 131 [collecting cases].) In this case, Del Terra claims  Rivera was involved in direct communications and meetings with Del Terra that  occurred outside of closed board sessions, praised BUSD’s former  superintendent, Dr. Alex Rojas, for his work, was involved in negotiations of  the amended 2019 agreement between BUSD and Del Terra, and had personal  knowledge regarding the approval of the work performed by Del Terra and the  budgeting that is now subject to dispute. (Opp., p. 8:11-15; Nguyen Decl., Ex.  C, D.) Del Terra also claims Rivera participated in meetings with Del Terra CEO  Luis Rojas and other private citizens regarding Del Terra’s work. (Opp., p.  9:7-10.) Last, Del Terra claims BUSD has stated they are unable to provide  emails from Dr. Rojas. (Nguyen Decl., Ex. B.) As a result, Del Terra states Rivera’s  deposition is of utmost importance as the above demonstrates Rivera was BUSD’s  representative in interactions and communications with Del Terra regarding its  construction and project management work. (Opp., p. 9:20-23.) Based on the above, the court  finds Del Terra adequately established compelling reasons exist for ordering  Rivera’s deposition. And to the extent issues of deliberative process privilege  arise, BUSD failed to demonstrate a protective order  is the appropriate remedy. While BUSD attempts to establish good cause for a  protective order based on hypothetical deposition questions that have not been  asked, the court can just as easily address these issues of privileges when the  actual questions are asked and objections asserted during deposition. Accordingly, BUSD’s motion is  DENIED. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, BUSD’s  motion for a protective order is DENIED.
