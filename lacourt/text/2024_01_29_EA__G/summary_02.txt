Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc. to the complaint filed by Arlene Ramirez is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The demurrer was filed to the fourth cause of action, which alleges negligent repair. The judge found that the economic loss rule bars Ramirez's claim for negligent repair because it is based on a contractual duty to repair and Ramirez has failed to allege any facts establishing an independent noncontractual duty. The judge also found that Ramirez has failed to allege how Moss Bros.'s failure to make unspecified repairs caused damage to other subcomponents of the vehicle. As a result, the judge has sustained the demurrer and given Ramirez 20 days to amend the complaint to address these issues.
