 Case Number:  23PSCV02636    Hearing Date:   January 29, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc.’s Demurrer to
Plaintiffs’ Complaint
 
Respondent: Plaintiffs Arlene Ramirez
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc.’s Demurrer to
Plaintiffs’ Complaint is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to
amend.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a lemon law action. In July 2021, Plaintiff Arlene
Ramirez allegedly entered into a warranty contract with Defendant Volkswagen Group of
America, Inc. (Volkswagen) by purchasing a 2021 Volkswagen Atlas. Subsequently,
Ramirez alleges the vehicle was delivered with suspension and electrical system
defects.
 
On August 28, 2023, Ramirez filed a complaint against
Volkswagen; Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc. (Moss Bros.); and Does 1-10, alleging
(1) breach of express warranty, (2) breach of implied warranty, (3) violation
of Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2, subdivision (b), and (4) negligent repair.
 
On November 27, 2023, Moss Bros. filed the present
demurrer. Prior to filing, Moss Bros.’s counsel attempted to meet and confer
with Ramirez’s counsel through emails and a phone call but was not successful.
(Gamino Decl., ¶ 3-4.)
 
A hearing on the present demurrer is set for January 29,
2024, with a case management conference on January 31 and an informal discovery
conference on February 5.
 
ANALYSIS

Moss Bros. demurs to Ramirez’s fourth cause
of action for negligent repair on the grounds that it is (1) barred by the
economic loss rule and (2) fails to allege sufficient facts to state a claim. For
the following reasons, the court SUSTAINS
Moss Bros.’s demurrer with leave to
amend.
 
Legal Standard

Demurrer
 
A party may demur to a complaint on the
grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747
(Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded
facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068,
1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF
Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra,
at p. 747.)
 
Economic Loss Rule
 
The economic loss rule prevents tort recovery for “‘purely
economic losses,’ meaning financial harm unaccompanied by physical or property
damage.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 922.)
This is because “conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious
only when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from
principles of tort law.” (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551.)
Economic loss can include “damages for inadequate value, costs of repair and
replacement of the defective product or consequent loss of profits.” (Robinson
Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988 (Robinson),
quoting Jimenez v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 473, 482 (Jimenez).)
 
Discussion
 
In
this case, Ramirez alleges Moss
Bros. owed Ramirez a duty “to use ordinary care and skill in storage,
preparation, and repair of the Subject Vehicle in accordance with industry
standards.” (Complaint, ¶ 66.) But it is unclear if this alleged duty is
contractual or based on an independent duty. When
it is unclear if an action arises from a contract or noncontractual duty, “the
action will be considered based on contract rather than tort.” (Arthur L.
Sachs, Inc. v. City of Oceanside (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 315, 322.) Because Ramirez’s negligent repair
action is based on a contractual duty to repair and they have not alleged any
facts establishing an independent noncontractual duty, their fourth cause of
action is barred by the economic loss rule.
 
Ramirez contends there is an exception to the economic loss
rule for professional services contracts. Indeed, such an exception does exist
to ensure “that the consumer receives the services the professional agreed to
provide.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 933.)
“In such settings, professionals generally agree to provide ‘careful efforts’
in rendering contracted-for services,¿but ‘most clients do not know enough to
protect themselves by inspecting the professional’s work or by other
independent means.’” (Ibid, quoting Rest.3d Torts, Liability for
Economic Harm (June 2020) § 4, com. a., p. 22.) Such professional services can
include those offered by doctors, attorneys, accountants, and stockbrokers. (See
Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176,
188.) But Ramirez does not provide any binding authority that establishes
whether vehicle repair service contracts meet this exception.
 
Ramirez also relies on Jimenez which holds
“California decisional law has long recognized that the economic loss rule does
not necessarily bar recovery in tort for damage that a defective product (e.g.,
a window) causes to other portions of a larger product (e.g., a house) into
which the former has been incorporated.” (Jimenez, supra, 29
Cal.4th at p. 483.) But Ramirez has failed to allege how Moss Bros.’s failure
to make unspecified repairs caused damage to other subcomponents of the
vehicle. (Complaint, ¶ 64-68.)
 
Accordingly, Moss Bros.’s demurrer to this cause of action
is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, Moss Bros.’s demurrer to Ramirez’s
Complaint is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to amend as to the
fourth cause of action.
