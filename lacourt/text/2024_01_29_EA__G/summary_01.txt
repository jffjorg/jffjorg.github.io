And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the Bassett Unified School District's (Busd) motion for a protective order to preclude or limit the deposition of Dolores Rivera, a member of Busd's board. The motion was filed in a breach of contract action against Del Terra Real Estate Services, Inc. (Del Terra), which Busd alleges breached its agreement by overbilling and failing to maintain proper records. The court found that Del Terra adequately established compelling reasons exist for ordering Rivera's deposition, including her involvement in direct communications and meetings with Del Terra regarding its construction and project management work. The court also found that Busd failed to demonstrate a protective order is the appropriate remedy, as the issues of deliberative process privilege can be addressed when the actual questions are asked and objections asserted during deposition.
