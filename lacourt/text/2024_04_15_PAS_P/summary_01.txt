Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel the deposition of Valcor Advisors, LLC. The court finds that the meet and confer efforts were not sufficient. The court rules on the merits of the motion. The court agrees with the defendants that the information sought in the deposition is relevant to their affirmative defenses and cross-complaint. The court overrules all relevancy objections. The court also overrules the privacy objections to Requests 2 and 5. The court sustains the objection to Request 6, which requests documents sufficient to identify any litigation in which Valcor Advisors, LLC has participated as a party or witness. The court orders the PMQ deposition to proceed on Requests 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
