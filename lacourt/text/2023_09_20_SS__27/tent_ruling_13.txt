MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Joshua Cliffords
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendants
Waterstone Apartments CA, LLC and Pria Perea
 
 
            On August 25, 2022, Plaintiffs Joshua Cliffords and Benjamin
Cliffords, individually and as successors in interest to Gloria Cliffords,
initiated this action against Defendants, Waterstone Apartments CA, LLC (“Waterstone”),
Cushman & Wakefield of California, Inc., Cushman & Wakefield U.S., Inc.,
and Pria Perea (“Perea”), for the wrongful death of Gloria Cliffords.  Plaintiffs allege that Ms. Cliffords was
residing in Defendants’ premises when she tripped and fell due to a dangerous
condition in the doorway.  Ms. Cliffords
sustained injuries which ultimately led to her death.
 
            On July 5, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed these motions to compel Waterstone to provide further
responses to Set One of Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents, and Request for
Admissions.  
 
            On
September 7, 2023, Waterstone filed oppositions to these motions.  In the oppositions, Waterstone contends the
motions are moot because Waterstone is unaffiliated with the subject premises
where the incident took place.  As such, Plaintiffs
have mistakenly sued Waterstone.  To that
end, Waterstone asks the Court to deny the motions as moot, or alternatively,
to continue these motions for at least 60 days to allow counsel for the parties
to resolve this issue.
 
            Plaintiffs
have not filed Replies.  As the foregoing
is uncontested, the Court is inclined to continue these motions to allow the
parties to meet and confer regarding the propriety of Waterstone’s continued
participation in this case.  
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ motions are CONTINUED to November 28, 2023 at 1:30 PM.  If the issue is resolved, Plaintiffs are
directed to promptly take the motions off calendar.  If the issues are not resolved, Waterstone
may file substantive oppositions to the motions no later than 10 court days
before the rescheduled hearing. 
Plaintiffs may file their replies no later than 5 court days before the
rescheduled hearing.   
 
Moving party to give notice.
