## English Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where Plaintiffs Joshua and Benjamin Cliffords are suing Waterstone Apartments CA, LLC, and others for the wrongful death of their mother, Gloria Cliffords.

The Plaintiffs filed motions to compel Waterstone to provide further responses to discovery requests. Waterstone, in their opposition, argues that they are not involved with the property where the incident occurred and should be dismissed from the case.

The Judge, finding merit in Waterstone's argument, has continued the motions to allow the parties to meet and confer about the appropriateness of Waterstone's continued participation in the case. The parties are given until November 28, 2023, to resolve the issue. If they reach an agreement, the motions will be taken off calendar. If not, Waterstone may file substantive oppositions to the motions, and Plaintiffs may file replies.
