```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss filed by the Settling Defendant on March 3, 2023. The judge notes that failure to serve nonparties is not grounds for denying a § 877.6 motion, but the Settling Defendant may still be exposed to liability. The judge cites Gackstetter v. Frawley (2006) and Weil & Brown's California Practice Guide to Civil Procedure Before Trial, stating that due process requires notice to other joint tortfeasors whose rights may be affected by a "good faith" determination. Since the Settling Defendant failed to serve Pi Kappa Alpha, F&S Services, and B&B with notice of the application, the judge is inclined to dismiss the case on June 21, 2023.
