## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to dismiss filed by California Gamma Chapter House. While failing to serve non-party joint tortfeasors (Pi Kappa Alpha, F&S Services, and B&B) doesn't automatically disqualify the motion to dismiss under California Code of Civil Procedure § 877.6, the Judge notes that the Settling Defendant could still be held liable.  

The Judge emphasizes the importance of due process, requiring notice to all parties whose rights could be affected by the settlement. Since the Settling Defendant has not served notice to the non-party joint tortfeasors, the Judge seems inclined to allow the motion to dismiss, but with the caveat that the Settling Defendant's liability to the non-served parties remains open.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:
The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to dismiss filed by California Gamma Chapter House on March 3, 2023. The judge notes that the failure to serve nonparties, such as Pi Kappa Alpha, F&S Services, and B&B, is not a valid reason to deny a § 877.6 motion. However, the judge emphasizes that due process requires notice to other joint tortfeasors who may be affected by a "good faith" determination. In this case, Settling Defendant has not served the necessary parties with notice, which may expose them to liability. The judge cites relevant case law, including Gackstetter v. Frawley, to support the importance of notice to nonparties. Ultimately, the judge's tentative ruling suggests that the case may be dismissed, but Settling Defendant's liability may still be at issue.

## English Summary 

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss filed by California Gamma Chapter House. The judge acknowledges that failure to serve notice to all potential joint tortfeasors, like Pi Kappa Alpha, F&S Services, and B&B, isn't automatically grounds for denying the motion. However, the judge emphasizes that the Settling Defendant might still be liable to these non-served parties. The judge points out that "due process" requires notice to all potentially affected parties in cases involving a "good faith" determination under Section 877.6, which deals with tolling statutes of limitations.  

The case was ultimately dismissed on June 21, 2023.
