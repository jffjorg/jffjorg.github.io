And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel responses to discovery requests filed by Defendant Tessa Nicole Vaughn against Plaintiff Ivan Mendez. Defendant served Plaintiff with discovery requests on February 24, 2023, but Plaintiff failed to provide responses. Defendant's counsel met and conferred with Plaintiff's counsel and provided a courtesy extension, but Plaintiff still failed to respond. As a result, all objections to the discovery requests are waived. The Court grants Defendant's motions to compel responses to Set One of Defendant's Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents, and to deem admitted Request for Admissions against Plaintiff. Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, objection-free responses to the discovery requests within 30 days.
