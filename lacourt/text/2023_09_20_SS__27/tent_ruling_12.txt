CASE:                         Matthew LaRocca. v. Andrew Devon Berkovitz
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV21569
 





















 
MOTION
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Matthew LaRocca
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
            On July 1, 2022, Plaintiff, Matthew LaRocca, filed a form
complaint against Defendant, Andrew Devon Berkovitz, for injuries arising from
a motor vehicle accident.           
 
            On February
24, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Special Interrogatories, Set Two, on Defendant.  The written discovery consists of three
interrogatories.  On March 28, 2023,
Defendant served objection-only responses. 
The responses are signed by Defense counsel but are not verified by
Defendant.  Plaintiff took issue with the
responses.
 
            On May 2,
2023, after Plaintiff met and conferred regarding the objection-only responses,
Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Plaintiff to provide responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set Two.  The motion is
unopposed.
 
            Plaintiff
is not entitled to an order compelling Defendant’s responses.  Plaintiff concedes Defendant served responses
on March 28, 2023, albeit consisting solely of objections.  Under these circumstances, only the
attorney’s signature is required.   (Code Civ. Proc., 2030.250, subd.
(a), (c); see Blue Ridge Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1988) 202
Cal.App.3d 399, 344.)  As such, Plaintiff’s recourse is to file a motion
to compel further response.  
 
            Accordingly,
the motion to compel is DENIED.  
 
            If
Plaintiff elects to file a motion to compel further response, Plaintiff is
directed to review Section 9, subdivision E of the Eighth Amended Standing
Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts for the County of Los
Angeles, Central District (“Eighth Amended Hub Order”).  Pursuant to the Eighth Amended Hub Order, the
parties must schedule and complete an Informal Discovery Conference before a
Personal Injury Hub Court will hear a Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Discovery.
            
Moving party to give notice.
