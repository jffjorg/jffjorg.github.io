[1] Dismissed on June 21, 2023.


[2] California Gamma Chapter House
filed a motion to dismiss on March 3, 2023.


[3] Failure to serve nonparties is not
ground for denying a § 877.6 motion. 
(Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter
Group), ¶ 12:860.1.)  However, Settling
Defendant may still be exposed to liability. 
“[D]ue process requires notice to other joint tortfeasors who are
not presently parties to the action but whose rights may be affected by a “good
faith” determination (because § 877.6(c) bars indemnity claims of party and
nonparty joint tortfeasors; see ¶ 12:926). [Gackstetter v.
Frawley (2006) 135 CA4th 1257, 1273, 38 CR3d 333, 345-346 (citing text)]
(emphasis in original).”  (Weil &
Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group), ¶ 12:860.)
Here, Settling Defendant has not served Pi Kappa Alpha, F&S Services, and
B&B with notice of this application.
