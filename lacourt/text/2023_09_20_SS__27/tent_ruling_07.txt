I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On July 28, 2023, Defendant, Tessa Vaughn, filed these
motions to compel Plaintiff, Ivan Mendez,[1]
to provide responses to Set One of Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents, and to deem Request
for Admissions admitted against Plaintiff. 
Defendant does not seek sanctions. 
 
The motions are unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
DISCOVERY
 
If a party to
whom interrogatories and inspection demands were directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order to compel
responses without objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).)  If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for
an order that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ Moreover, failure to timely
serve responses waives objections to the requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a), 2033.280, subd. (a).)   
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendant served
Plaintiff with the at-issue discovery requests on February 24, 2023.  Having not received responses, Defense counsel
met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel and provided a courtesy extension to
provide responses.  Plaintiff’s prior
counsel later file a motion to be relieved as counsel, which the Court granted
on June 14, 2023.  To date, Plaintiff has
not provided responses.  (See Kahen Decls.) 
Therefore, all objections to the interrogatories and requests for production
are waived.  
 
As Defendant
properly served the discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to serve responses,
the Court finds Defendant is entitled to an order directing Plaintiff to
provide responses to Set One of Defendant’s
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of
Documents.¿ In addition, Defendant is entitled to an order deeming admitted
Request for Admissions, Set One, against Plaintiff. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motions are granted.  
 
Plaintiff Ivan Mendez is ordered to provide verified,
objection-free responses to Set One of Defendant’s Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents within 30 days
of this order.  Defendant’s Request
for Admissions, Set One, are deemed admitted against Plaintiff.
 
Moving party to give notice.
