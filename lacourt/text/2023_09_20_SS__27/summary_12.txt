**Background**

On July 1, 2022, Matthew LaRocca filed a complaint against Andrew Devon Berkovitz for injuries resulting from a motor vehicle accident. On February 24, 2023, LaRocca propounded Special Interrogatories, Set Two, on Berkovitz.

**Current Motion**

LaRocca filed a motion to compel Berkovitz to provide responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, on May 2, 2023, after a meeting and conference regarding the objection-only responses. The motion is unopposed.

If LaRocca elects to file a motion to compel further response, the parties must schedule and complete an Informal Discovery Conference before a Personal Injury Hub Court will hear the motion.
