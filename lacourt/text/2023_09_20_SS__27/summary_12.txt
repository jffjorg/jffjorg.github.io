And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to special interrogatories. The defendant had served objection-only responses, which are sufficient under California law. The plaintiff should file a motion to compel further response if they are not satisfied with the current responses. The parties are also required to schedule and complete an Informal Discovery Conference before a Personal Injury Hub Court will hear a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Discovery.
