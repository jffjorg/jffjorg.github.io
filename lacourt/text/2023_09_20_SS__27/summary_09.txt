## Case Number: 22STCV01315  

**Plaintiff:** Brodie Stephenson
**Defendant:** Patricia A. Jacobs

**Nominal Defendant:** Craig Randell

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Tentative Ruling:**  

**Background:**

* This wrongful death lawsuit stems from a car accident on June 10, 2020 that killed Matthew Ryan Randell ("Decedent").
* Plaintiff Brodie Stephenson, Decedent's son, filed the lawsuit against Defendant Patricia A. Jacobs.
* Nominal Defendant Craig Randell, also claiming to be Decedent's son, filed a separate lawsuit against Jacobs.
* Both cases were consolidated on September 19, 2022.
* Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on June 30, 2023.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Standing:** The main issue is whether Plaintiff Brodie Stephenson is the sole successor in interest to Decedent's wrongful death claim. 
* **Custody Decree:** The Court will consider the validity of a Nevada custody decree that designates Plaintiff as Decedent's son.  
* **Leave to Amend:** Nominal Defendant Craig Randell requests to amend his complaint to include a survivorship cause of action and a claim for reimbursement of burial expenses.

**Judge's Concerns:**

* Plaintiff's complaint does not explicitly seek a declaration of being the sole successor in interest.
* The proposed amendment to include a survivorship cause of action lacks specifics about its nature.
* Nominal Defendant's request to continue the hearing lacks a supporting declaration, as required by law.

**Next Steps:**

* The Court will hear arguments from both sides regarding the standing issue and the proposed amendment. 
* Parties are encouraged to submit on the tentative ruling and may still appear at the hearing to argue.

**Key Points:**

* The outcome of this case hinges on whether the Nevada custody decree is recognized in California and whether Plaintiff is considered Decedent's rightful heir.
* The lack of clarity regarding the proposed survivorship cause of action and the procedural deficiency in the continuance request complicate the matter.

**Tentative Ruling**

**Case Number:** 22STCV01315
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Department:** 27
**Judge:** Kerry Bensinger, Department 27

**Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff Brodie Stephenson against Defendant Patricia A. Jacobs and nominal defendant Craig Randell. The court is considering whether the custody decree issued in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada should be given full faith and credit in the State of California, and whether Plaintiff has standing to pursue wrongful death claims against Defendant.

**Key Points:**

1. The court must apply a three-step analysis to review a motion for summary judgment: identify the issues framed by the pleadings, determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims, and determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.
2. The defendant has the burden of showing that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.
3. The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead, must set forth specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.
4. The court must liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve all doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.
5. The principal issue to be decided is whether the custody decree issued in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada is entitled to full faith and credit in the State of California.
6. The court previously held that the custody decree should be given full faith and credit when it denied Mr. Randell's motion to compel DNA testing of Plaintiff.
7. Mr. Randell opposes the motion because the relief being sought – a ruling that Plaintiff is the sole successor in interest – is not stated in the Complaint.
8. The court will hear from counsel on the issue of whether the Complaint can be amended to add a survivorship cause of action and a claim for reimbursement of burial expenses.

**Dispute:**

The dispute centers around whether the custody decree issued in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada should be given full faith and credit in the State of California, and whether Plaintiff has standing to pursue wrongful death claims against Defendant.

**Acts:**

* Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on June 30, 2023.
* Defendant opposes the motion.
* The court will hear from counsel on the issue of whether the Complaint can be amended to add a survivorship cause of action and a claim for reimbursement of burial expenses.

**Intentions:**

* The court intends to hear from counsel on the issue of whether the Complaint can be amended to add a survivorship cause of action and a claim for reimbursement of burial expenses.

**Facts:**

* Plaintiff's father, Matthew Ryan Randell, died in a car accident on June 10, 2020.
* Plaintiff filed a wrongful death action against Defendant on January 11, 2022.
* Defendant opposes the motion for summary judgment.

**Money:**

* No monetary amounts are specified in the tentative ruling.

**Laws:**

* California Code of Civil Procedure, section 437c
* California Evidence Code, section 452
* California Rules of Court, rule 3.1306

**Case Citations:**

* Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294
