And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages and attorney's fees. The Judge agrees to strike the request for punitive damages and attorney's fees from the complaint, but not for the reason the defendant identifies. The Judge finds that the complaint is deficient in that it fails to allege the factual basis for the belief that the defendant was "under the influence of a substance" at the time of the motor vehicle collision. The Judge grants leave to amend the complaint and orders the plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint within 20 days. The Judge also grants the motion to strike attorney's fees from the complaint because there are no allegations showing the statutory basis for an award of attorney's fees.
