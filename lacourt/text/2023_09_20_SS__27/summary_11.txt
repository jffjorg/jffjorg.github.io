And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages and attorney's fees. The Judge agrees to strike the request for punitive damages and attorney's fees from the complaint, but not for the reason the defendant identifies. The Judge finds that the complaint is deficient in that it fails to allege the factual basis for the belief that the defendant was "under the influence of a substance" at the time of the motor vehicle collision. The Judge grants leave to amend the complaint and orders the plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint within 20 days. The Judge also grants the motion to strike attorney's fees from the complaint because there are no allegations showing the statutory basis for an award of attorney's fees.

## Case Summary:

**Case Number:** 22STCV11740
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Department:** 27
**Judge:** Kerry Bensinger

**Plaintiff:** Fernando Pupo
**Defendant:** Jaqueline Osnaya

**Facts:**

* On April 6, 2022, Fernando Pupo filed a complaint against Jaqueline Osnaya for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision.

* Defendant filed a demurrer and a motion to strike portions of the Complaint on August 31, 2023.

**Disputes:**

* Defendant argues that Plaintiff's request for punitive damages and attorney's fees should be stricken from the Complaint because they are not adequately supported.

**Legal Arguments:**

* **Punitive Damages:** Defendant argues that driving under the influence, while negligent, does not automatically constitute malice, oppression, or fraud, which are required to award punitive damages under California Civil Code section 3294. 
* **Attorney's Fees:** Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not identified any statute authorizing an award of attorney's fees in this case. 

**Judge's Ruling:**

* The Judge granted Defendant's motion to strike both punitive damages and attorney's fees from the Complaint.
* The demurrer is deemed moot.
* Plaintiff is granted leave to amend the Complaint to include sufficient allegations to support a claim for punitive damages within 20 days.
* Defendant is required to file a responsive pleading to the amended Complaint within 30 days.

**Significant Statements:**

* The Judge acknowledged that driving while intoxicated can potentially constitute malice under *Taylor v. Superior Court* (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, but found the current Complaint lacking in factual basis to support this claim.
