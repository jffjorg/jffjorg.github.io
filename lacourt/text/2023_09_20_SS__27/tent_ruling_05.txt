APPLICATION
FOR DETERMINATION OF GOOD FAITH SETTLEMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant

RESPONDING PARTY:     No
opposition 
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On March 19, 2021, Plaintiff, Christina T. Perez, initiated
this premises liability action against Defendants, Pi Kappa Alpha[1],
Fraternity & Sorority Services, Inc (“F&S Services”)., B&B
Management Services, Inc. (“B&B”), California Gamma Chapter House
Association of Phi Deltha Theta (“California Gamma Chapter House”), and Does 1
to 50, for injuries Plaintiff sustained when the top step of the exterior
staircase of her apartment building crumbled under her foot and caused
Plaintiff to fall to the bottom of the stairs. 
On June 2, 2021, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name West Range
Corporation (“Settling Defendant”) as Doe 1. Settling Defendant is the owner of
the property.  California Gamma Chapter
House is the tenant and sublessor of the property.  B&B and F&S Series are entities
related to the management of the property. Settling Defendant answered the
complaint of August 23, 2021.  No other
defendant has filed an answer.
            
            On August 2,
2023, Settling Defendant filed a Notice of Settlement and this Application for
Determination of Good Faith Settlement.  
 
            The application
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
 
            “Any party to an action in which it is alleged that two
or more parties are joint tortfeasors or coobligors on a contract shall be
entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith settlement entered into by
the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more alleged tortfeasors or
coobligors ….”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., § 877.6.)¿ Good faith settlements further
two sometimes competing policies: (1) the equitable sharing of costs among the
parties at fault, and (2) the encouragement of settlements.¿ (Erreca’s v.
Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1487.)¿¿ 
 
            The Court must consider several factors including “a
rough approximation of plaintiffs’ total recovery and the settlor’s
proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of
settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should
pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial.”¿ (Tech-Bilt,
Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499 (Tech-Bilt).)¿¿“Other
relevant considerations include the financial conditions and insurance policy
limits of settling defendants, as well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or
tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.” ¿(Id.)¿¿¿ 
 
            The evaluation of whether a settlement was made in good
faith is¿ required to “be made on the basis of information available at the
time of settlement.”¿ (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p.
499.) ¿“[A] court not only looks at the alleged tortfeasor’s potential
liability to the plaintiff, but it must also consider the culpability of the
tortfeasor vis-à-vis other parties alleged to be responsible for the same
injury.” ¿(TSI Seismic Tenant Space, Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 159, 166.)¿ “Potential liability for indemnity to a nonsettling
defendant is an important consideration for the trial court in determining
whether to approve a settlement by an alleged tortfeasor.”¿ (Id.)¿¿ 
 
            In City of Grand View Terrace v. Superior Court
(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261, the court provided the following guidance
regarding a motion for a good faith settlement determination:¿¿ 
 
“If the good faith settlement is contested,
section 877.6, subdivision (d), sets forth a workable ground rule for the
hearing by placing the burden of proving the lack of good faith on the
contesting party. Once there is a showing made by the settlor of the
settlement, the burden of proof on the issue of good faith shifts to the
nonsettlor who asserts that the settlement was not made in good faith. If
contested, declarations by the nonsettlor should be filed which in many cases
could require the moving party to file responsive counterdeclarations to negate
the lack of good faith asserted by the nonsettling contesting party.” 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            The
notice, application, and proposed order must be served by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or by personal service.  If the nonsettling
parties do not file a motion challenging the settlement within 25 days of
mailing of the notice, application, and proposed order, or within 20 days of
personal service, the court may approve the settlement.¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., §
877.6, subd. (a)(2).)¿¿ 
            Here,
Settling Defendant served this Application on specially appearing defendant
California Gamma Chapter House[2]
and Plaintiff by certified mail on August 2, 2023—more than 25 days before this
hearing.  Settling Defendant has not served Pi Kappa Alpha, F&S
Services, nor B&B with notice of this application and settlement.  The Application is uncontested.  Settling Defendant has satisfied the
procedural requirements.[3] 
 
B.
 Good Faith Determination
 
            After
taking Plaintiff’s deposition, counsel for the parties engaged in informal
settlement discussions.  On April 14,
2023, Settling Defendant served Plaintiff with an offer to compromise.  Under the terms of the agreement, Settling Defendant
agrees to pay Plaintiff the sum of $25,000 in exchange for a release and waiver
of claims.¿ 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the Court concludes the settlement between Plaintiff Christina
T. Perez and Defendant West Range Corporation was made in good faith.¿ The
unopposed Application for Determination of Good Faith Settlement is GRANTED.       
 
Moving party to give notice.

            On July 14, 2023 and July 17, 2023, Plaintiff

as to Defendants, California Gamma Chapter House Association of Phi Delta

applications and proposed orders must be filed on pleading paper and in a
pleading format.  Once e-filed, the
applications and proposed orders will
be forwarded to the appropriate department for review and adjudication.
