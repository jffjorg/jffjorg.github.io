- Cal-Coast has not filed a Reply

Legal standards:
- Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10, subd. (a)(1): a defendant may file a notice of motion to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her within the time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow

(b): the court may relieve a party from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken
