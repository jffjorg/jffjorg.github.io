And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint by Plaintiff Gregory Langadinos in a motor vehicle negligence case against Defendant Ronald MacDonald. The Plaintiff seeks to add new defendants and causes of action, including fraud, and to expand the scope of his claims. The Judge finds that the motion is procedurally and substantively defective. The procedural defects include the failure to submit a proposed or amended pleading that is serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings, and the failure to include a declaration attesting to the effect of the amendment. The substantive defects include unwarranted delay in presenting the proposed amendment, and the failure to demonstrate that the proposed amendments would not result in any prejudice to the Defendant. The Judge denies the motion for leave to file a first amended complaint.
