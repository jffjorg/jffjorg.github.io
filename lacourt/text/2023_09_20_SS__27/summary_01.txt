## English Summary 

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Gregory Langadinos' motion to amend his complaint in the case against Defendant Ronald MacDonald. The judge finds that the motion is procedurally defective because it lacks a properly formatted proposed amended pleading and a required declaration outlining the reasons for the amendment.

Furthermore, the judge finds the motion substantively defective. Langadinos claims newly discovered medical conditions justify the amendment, but the judge notes that some of these conditions have been known to Langadinos for years. The judge also finds that allowing the amendment would significantly prejudice MacDonald, as it would expand the scope and nature of the claims, and the trial is scheduled to begin soon.

Summary:

Judge Kerry Bensinger issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Gregory Langadinos' motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The motion was procedurally and substantively defective. The procedural defects included the lack of a proposed or amended pleading with serial numbers and the failure to include a declaration as required by California Rules of Court. The substantive defects included unwarranted delay in presenting the proposed amendments and failure to demonstrate that the proposed amendments would not result in prejudice to the Defendant. The court noted that the proposed amendments would expand the scope and nature of the claims and would cause extreme prejudice to the Defendant, who would be required to respond to new causes of action and defendants.

## English Summary:

The judge denied Gregory Langadinos' request to amend his lawsuit against Ronald MacDonald. 

Langadinos wanted to add new medical diagnoses to his existing claim of negligence and also add several new defendants and causes of action.

The judge also ruled that adding new claims and defendants at this late stage would unfairly prejudice MacDonald.

**Case Number: 19STCV45414**
**Hearing Date: September 20, 2023**
**Judge: Kerry Bensinger, Department 27**

**Case: Gregory Langadinos v. Ronald MacDonald, et al.**

On December 16, 2019, plaintiff Gregory Langadinos filed a complaint against defendants Ronald S. MacDonald and Monica K. Kramer for motor vehicle negligence. Kramer was dismissed on May 11, 2021. On February 24, 2023, Langadinos filed a motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) due to a newly discovered medical condition. Langadinos seeks to add new defendants and causes of action, which MacDonald opposes.

The court may allow amendments to pleadings, including adding or striking out the name of any party, or correcting a mistake in the name of a party or other respects (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1)). Leave to amend should be liberally granted, but it should not be allowed where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing party is shown (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487).

Plaintiff's motion is procedurally and substantively defective. Plaintiff does not submit a proposed or amended pleading that is serially numbered, nor does Plaintiff indicate what allegations are proposed to be deleted or added. Plaintiff has not provided a declaration attesting to the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. Plaintiff's delay in seeking leave to amend and the addition of new causes of action and defendants may result in prejudice to the defendant.

Accordingly, the motion for leave to file a first amended complaint is **DENIED**.
