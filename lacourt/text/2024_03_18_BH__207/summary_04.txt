And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling notes that the current operative complaint is the First Amended Complaint, as the Plaintiff has not yet obtained leave of the court to file the second amended complaint. The judge declines to consider the Plaintiff's reply evidence, as the Defendant has not had a fair opportunity to respond. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated an immediate and irreparable harm that is non-pecuniary in nature, and therefore does not need to address the parties' arguments regarding likelihood of success on the merits. The judge cites two previous court cases, San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wall Street Network Ltd. v. New York Times Co., to support their decision.
