And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Michael E. Whitaker issued a tentative ruling denying WIB Holdings LLC's motion to reclassify the case from unlimited civil to small claims court. The motion was opposed by plaintiff Justin Shelton. The judge determined that the case does not meet the criteria for reclassification to small claims court because the Superior Court has jurisdiction over the action and the plaintiff seeks injunctive relief. The judge also found that the defendant's motion was timely. The court ordered that the defendant provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
