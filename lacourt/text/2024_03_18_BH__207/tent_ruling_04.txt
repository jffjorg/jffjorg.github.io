[1] The Court notes that Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint on January 16, 2024, adding additional defendants and causes of
action, but did not file the second amended complaint pursuant to stipulation,
and has not yet obtained leave of the court – a motion for leave to amend the
complaint is currently scheduled for hearing on March 28.  As such, the current operative complaint is
the First Amended Complaint. 
 


[2] The Court declines to consider Plaintiff’s reply
evidence, as Defendant has not had a fair opportunity to respond.  (San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308, 316 [“Where a remedy as
drastic as summary judgment is involved, due process requires a party be fully
advised of the issues to be addressed and be given adequate notice of what
facts it must rebut in order to prevail”]; see also Wall Street Network Ltd.
v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171.)  


[3] Because the Court finds that Plaintiff has not
demonstrated an immediate and irreparable harm that is nonpecuniary in nature,
it need not address the parties’ arguments regarding likelihood of success on
the merits.
