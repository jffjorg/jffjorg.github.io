MOTION
 
Defendant WIB Holdings LLC (“Defendant”) move to reclassify the
instant action from civil unlimited to small claims court.  Plaintiff Justin Shelton (“Plaintiff”)
opposes.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Per
Code of Civil Procedure section 86, a limited civil case is a case in which the
demand, exclusive of interest, amounts to $35,000[1] or
less. (Code Civ. Proc., § 86, subd. (a)(1).) The court must order
reclassification of a case from unlimited to limited “when . . . it becomes
clear that the matter will ‘necessarily’ result in a verdict” under $35,000. (Walker
v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262 ([hereafter Walker).) In
determining whether the demand of the case exceeds $35,000, the court
aggregates the amount of damages each plaintiff seeks. (See Collins v. City
& County of San Francisco (1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 719, 724.)
 
Per
Code of Civil Procedure section 116.221, the small claims court has jurisdiction
in an action brought by a natural person and the amount of the demand does not
exceed twelve thousand five hundred ($12,500) dollars.[2]  
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 403.040, “[t]he plaintiff, cross-complaint, or
petitioner may file a motion for reclassification within the time allowed for
that party to amend the initial pleading. The defendant or cross-defendant may
file a motion for reclassification within the time allowed for that party to
respond to the initial pleading. The court, on its own motion, may reclassify a
case at any time.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) If a party files a
motion for reclassification after the time designated by statute, “the court
shall grant the motion and enter an order for reclassification only if both of
the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The case is incorrectly classified.
(2) The moving party shows good cause for not seeking reclassification
earlier.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).)
 
            Defendant contends reclassification
to small claims is proper because (1) Plaintiff’s form interrogatory responses
indicate Plaintiff’s damages are limited to the $1,995 security deposit; (2)
Plaintiff lacks standing to recover any damages because he was not the
“tenant” as defined by the lease agreement; and (3) Plaintiff waived his right
to claim punitive damages by virtue of a waiver clause in the lease agreement. 
 
            Plaintiff counters that although the
law permits reclassification of an unlimited civil case to a limited civil case
(Walker), and transfers from small claims to the superior court (Cal.
Civil.  § 116.390), [3]  the only law permitting transfer to small
claims court requires that the trial court lacks jurisdiction of the subject
matter.   (Rosenberg v. Superior Court (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 860, 866, 868-870 (hereinafter Rosenberg).)  Moreover, Plaintiff contends that transfer of
the entire case to limited civil is inappropriate here, as Plaintiff seeks
permanent injunctive relief.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (b)(2).)  Plaintiff
further argues that Defendant’s motion is untimely.
 
            With regard to the timeliness of the
motion, a defendant may file a motion for reclassification within the time
allowed for that party to respond to the initial pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).)  If the defendant moves for reclassification
after that time, the Court cannot grant the motion unless (1) the case is
incorrectly classified; and (2) the moving party shows good cause for not
seeking reclassification earlier.  (Ibid.)  
 
Here,
Defendant has demonstrated that the basis for the reclassification motion did
not become apparent until Defendant received Plaintiff’s form interrogatory
responses, which necessarily occurred after Defendant’s responsive pleading was
due.  Moreover, the Court may reclassify
a case at any time on its own motion (ibid.) and the Court must
reclassify when it becomes apparent that the case does not meet the criteria
for unlimited civil (Walker). 
Therefore, the timeliness of the motion is not a bar to relief.
 
However,
the Court agrees with Plaintiff, that because the Superior Court does not lack
jurisdiction over the action, transfer to small claims court is improper.  (Rosenberg, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th
at pp. 866-870.)
 
            The Court further agrees that
because Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief in connection with the second cause
of action for violations of Business and Professions Code section 17200 and declaratory
relief in connection with the third cause of action, the limited civil division
lacks jurisdiction.  (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 86, subd. (a)(7) & 580, subds. (b)(2) & (b)(4).)  As such, transfer to limited civil is also
improper.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court denies Defendant’s Motion to
Reclassify.  
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service regarding the same.
