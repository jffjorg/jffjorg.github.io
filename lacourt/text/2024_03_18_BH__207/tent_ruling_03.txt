MOTION
 
            Plaintiff Joseph Robert Giannini
(“Plaintiff”) sued Defendants Gold’s Gym California, LLC and Gold’s Gym Club,
Holding, LLC for refusing to honor his prior gym contract at $29 per month, and
refusing to let Plaintiff enter the Gold’s Gym in Venice without paying either
$900 per year or $100 per month.  (See
generally First Amended Complaint[1].)  Plaintiff moves to enjoin Defendants from denying
him entry to the Venice Gym at the contract rate of $29 per month.  
 
Defendant Gold’s Gym California, LLC (“Defendant”) opposes the motion and
Plaintiff replies.[2]
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Plaintiff requests the court to take
judicial notice of five documents, all from docket entry 428 in the bankruptcy
case number 20-31318-hdh11 from the Northern District of Texas, which includes
an order approving the sale of assets and related exhibits and attachments as
follows:
 
1.     
Fifteen affiliated entities that owned and transacted
business as “Gold’s Gym[s]” throughout the United States including Gold’s
Holding Corp. filed a consolidated Chapter 11 petition. See ECF 428 p. 1
footnote 1. RSG GROUP USA INC. purchased all of these entities including their
assets, liablilities [sic], and goodwill. This purchase was approved in a
United States Bankruptcy Court order. See ECF 428
 
2.     
The Chapter 11 order states: " All employees are
employed by Gold's Holding Corp. See ECF 428, page 140 Schedule 5.12(a).
 
3.     
Gold's Holding Corp. had multiple employee
benefit programs approved by the IRS on the date of the Chapter 11 filing. See
ECF 428, page. 81-82
 
4.     
RSG GROUP USA purchased expired franchise registrations
and franchise exemptions. See Chapter 11 ECF 428, page 131 Schedule 5.6
provides: 

(c) Authorized Franchise jurisdictions 

United States: 

Sellers' franchise disclosure documents and current state franchise
registrations and exemptions have expired, so a Successful Bitter will find it
necessary to update or create a new franchise disclosure document and file new
franchise registrations in US franchise registration states in which exemptions
from registrations are not available or other registration jurisdictions before
resuming franchise offering and sales activities on a post-Closing basis.
 
5.     
RSG GROUP USA purchased the outstanding lease agreement
with Google for the Venice gym location and paid prior rent arrears of
$278,262. See ECF 306 Cure Costs p. 6 incorporated by ECF 428.
 
Judicial notice may, but is not required to, be taken of “[o]fficial
acts of the […] judicial departments of the United States” and “[r]ecords of […]
any court of record of the United States.” 
(Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (c)-(d).) 

 
The items in Plaintiff’s request concern the likelihood of Plaintiff’s
success in proving that the Gold’s Gym entity or entities with whom Plaintiff
contracted were properly licensed and registered to transact at the time
Plaintiff entered into the agreement.  As
discussed below, because the Court does not reach that issue, the Court
declines to take judicial notice of the requested documents.         
 
ANALYSIS
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 527, subdivision (a), “[a]
preliminary injunction may be granted at any time before judgment upon a
verified complaint, or upon affidavits if the complaint in the one case, or the
affidavits in the other, show satisfactorily that sufficient grounds exist
therefor.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 527, subd. (a).)  “The purpose of a
preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution
upon a trial.”  (Grothe v. Cortlandt Corp. (1992) 11
Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316.)   The status quo has been defined to mean the
last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded the pending
controversy. (14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp. (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.) Preliminary injunctive relief requires the use of
competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds for
relief. (See, e.g., ReadyLink Healthcare
v. Cotton (2005) 126
Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016; Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green (1974) 41
Cal.App.3d 146, 150.) 
 
The trial court considers two factors in determining whether to issue
a preliminary injunction: (1) the likelihood the plaintiff will prevail on the
merits of its case at trial, and (2) the interim harm the plaintiff is likely
to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm the defendant is
likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 526, subd. (a); Husain
v. McDonald’s Corp. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 860, 866-867.)  The balancing of harm between the parties
“involves consideration of such things as the inadequacy of other remedies, the
degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity of preserving the status quo.” (Husain,
supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 867.)  
 
“The decision to grant a preliminary injunction rests in the sound
discretion of the trial court ... before the trial court can exercise its
discretion the applicant must make a prima facie showing of
entitlement to injunctive relief.  The applicant must demonstrate a real
threat of immediate and irreparable injury.”  (Triple A Machine Shop,
Inc. v. State of Cal. (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 131,
138.)  “[A]n injunction is an unusual or extraordinary equitable
remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law (usually damages) will
adequately compensate the injured plaintiff,” and the party seeking injunctive
relief bears the burden to prove its absence.  (Department of Fish
& Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist. (1992) 8
Cal.App.4th 1554, 1564-1565.)   
 
IMMEDIATE AND IRREPARABLE
HARM
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 526, an injunction may be granted “[w]hen it
appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or continuance of
some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or irreparable
injury, to a party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 526, subd. (a)(2).)  The threat of irreparable harm must be
imminent as opposed to a mere possibility of harm sometime in the future.  “An injunction cannot issue in a vacuum based
on the proponents’ fears about something that may happen in the future.  It must be supported by actual evidence that
there is a realistic prospect that the party enjoined intends to engage in the
prohibited activity.”  (Korean
Philadelphia Presbyterian Church v. California Presbytery (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1069, 1084.)  Plaintiffs need
not wait until they have suffered actual harm before applying for an
injunction, however, they may seek injunctive relief against threatened
infringement of their rights.  (Maria
P. v. Riles (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1292.) 

 
Moreover,
an injunction may be granted only “[w]hen pecuniary compensation would not
afford adequate relief.”  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 526, subd. (a)(4).)  “Specific
performance of a contract will not be compelled when an adequate remedy exists
at law, and if monetary damages afford adequate relief and are not extremely
difficult to ascertain, an injunction cannot be granted.”  (Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler
Motors Corp. (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 306.)
 
In
connection with Plaintiff’s previous motion for preliminary injunction, the
Court explained:
 
Plaintiff
has therefore alleged that beginning March 2023, Gold’s Gym in Venice began
requiring that he pay $100 in monthly dues to access their facility.  In other words, Plaintiff is still able to
access the unique gym equipment he contends is only available in the Gold’s Gym
Venice location to do his preventative maintenance exercises to “combat [the]
weakness” in his lower back, so long as he pays $100 per month in dues.  This dispute therefore centers around the
amount of Plaintiff’s monthly dues.  But
easily ascertainable pecuniary damages alone, like those at issue here, cannot
substantiate a preliminary injunction. 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff has not demonstrated immediate or irreparable harm that is
nonpecuniary in nature, to warrant preliminary injunctive relief.
 
(October 12, 2023
Minute Order.)
 
            Plaintiff now provides additional
evidence that the specific “back and core equipment” he uses in the Gold’s Gym
Venice location is not available at the Gold’s Gym locations in Culver City or
Hollywood.  (Motion at p. 10 [quoting
Verified Second Amended Complaint ¶ 11].)  However, Plaintiff has still not articulated a
nonpecuniary harm.  Plaintiff is not
currently banned from the Venice Gym location or otherwise precluded from using
the unique equipment there; he is merely being required to pay higher
dues.  Thus, Plaintiff’s harm is
pecuniary in nature, and does not warrant injunctive relief.[3]
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Because Plaintiff has not
established immediate, irreparable, nonpecuniary harm, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
 
The Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and
file a proof of service of such.
