 Case Number:  22STCV16423    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Miranda v. Melkonian
22STCV16423
Defendant’s Motion for Order Deeming Plaintiff Ilsa Miranda to Have Admitted
the Truth of Matters Specified in Requests for Admission
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On May 17, 2022, Ilsa Miranda, Bryan Miranda,
and Erick Ojeda (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Vardui
Melkonian (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 for motor vehicle negligence arising
out of an automobile accident occurring on December 19, 2019.
Erick Ojeda is a minor and brings this action
by and through his guardian ad litem, Ilsa Miranda.
Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on
July 17, 2023.
On October 4, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.
In December 2023 and February 2024, Plaintiffs
amended their complaint to name Wanda Ivascyn as Doe 1 and John Ivascyn as Doe
2. 
On March 22, 2024, Wanda and John Ivascyn filed
an answer and cross-complaint against Defendant. The cross-complaint was
dismissed on May 1, 2024.
On August 15, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed
motions to be relieved as attorney of record; these motions have yet to be
heard and counsel has yet to be relieved. 
The Court notes, however, that the issue of being relieved is somewhat
complicated by the presence of a minor plaintiff; the minor cannot represent
himself, and the guardian ad litem cannot represent the minor without counsel.
On August 20, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for an order deeming Plaintiff Ilsa Miranda to have admitted the truth
of the mattes specified in Requests for Admission (Set One).  Defendant also seeks sanctions.  Plaintiff’s counsel filed an opposition on
September 4, and Defendant filed a reply on September 9.
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
Discussion
On April 26, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff Ilsa Miranda (“Plaintiff”) with Requests for Admission, Set One. (Zuniga
Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Plaintiff has not responded. (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel filed an
opposition noting that there is a motion to be relieved as counsel
pending.  But with or without the pending
motion, Defendant has been waiting for responses for more than four months, and
Plaintiff must accept the consequences of her failure to respond. 
 
Requests for Admission were properly
served, and no responses have been received. 
Defendant need show nothing more.  The motion is granted.  
 
Sanctions are mandatory in this
circumstance.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  The Court finds the fees and expenses identified
by Defendant’s counsel are reasonable and grants sanctions in the amount requested.  (See Zuniga Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
Under the circumstances, the Court
finds that the failure to serve timely responses to the Requests for Admission
were solely the responsibility of Plaintiff, and not counsel.  Accordingly, sanctions are awarded only
against Plaintiff.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion
for a deemed-admitted order. 
 
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff Ilsa
Miranda is DEEMED TO HAVE ADMITTED the truth of the matters specified in
Requests for Admission (Set One), propounded by Defendant Vardui Melkonian.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Ilsa
Miranda to pay sanctions of $380.34 under the Civil Discovery Act to Defendant Vardui
Melkonian within 30 days of notice. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
