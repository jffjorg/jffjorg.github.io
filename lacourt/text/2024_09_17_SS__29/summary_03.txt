```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Dial's motion to compel American Zurich Insurance Company (Plaintiff) to produce its employee Sean Kopeny for deposition without prejudice due to procedural grounds. The motion was denied because Dial failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of meeting and conferring or inquiring about the nonappearance before filing the motion. Additionally, Dial did not make any effort to reschedule the deposition after Plaintiff cancelled it. The judge also denied both parties' requests for sanctions, finding that Dial has acted with substantial justification and that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
