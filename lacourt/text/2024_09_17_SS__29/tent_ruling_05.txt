 Case Number:  22STCV17999    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Glenn v. Cand Rentals, LLC
22STCV17999
Defendants’ Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Produce Vehicle for Inspection
Tentative
The
motion is denied.
Background
On June 1, 2022, Michele
Glenn (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against C&D Rentals, Kevin Ciara, and
Does 1 through 10 for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising
out of an accident on July 20, 2020.
On December 9, 2022,
Plaintiff amended her complaint to name C & D Rentals, LLC as Doe 1.
On December 30, 2022, C
& D Rentals, LLC, and Kevin Caira (erroneously sued as Kevin Ciara)
(collectively “Defendants”) filed an answer.
On January 4, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved as counsel of record.  Since that time,
Plaintiff has been representing herself in pro per.
On August 16, 2024, Defendants filed
this motion to compel the inspection of Plaintiff’s vehicle. No opposition has
been filed.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely written responses, the requesting party may move for an
order compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).)
There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a
party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
Discussion
Defendants
seek an order compelling Plaintiff to produce, for inspection, her 2009 Smart
Fortwo, one of the vehicles involved in the accident.  
Defendants
state that they made an oral request for the inspection on August 12,
2024.  (Casey Decl., ¶ 5.)  Missing from Defendants’ moving papers,
however, is any evidence of a written demand for inspection under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.030.  
The
Civil Discovery Act provides for three separate types of motions relating to
inspection demands: (1) a motion to compel a code compliant initial written
response (when no response has been provided) (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300);
(2) a motion to compel a further response (when a response has been provided
but it is not code compliant or contains unmeritorious objections) (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310); and (3) a motion to compel compliance with a response
stating that the inspection will be allowed (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320).
Here,
however, Defendants appear to seek an order allowing them to skip the process
of propounding a written request and then bringing an appropriate motion
(depending on whether a response is provided and, if so, whether it is code
compliant).  In their motion, Defendants invoke
section 2031.310, but that section applies when a party contends that a
discovery response is not code compliant. 
But Defendants provide no evidence of a written request for inspection
or Plaintiff’s response.   
Defendants
may have a reasonable argument that there is good cause for the inspection, but
Defendants must comply with the requirements of the Civil Discovery Act to obtain
a court order compelling the inspection. 
The motion is denied.  
Conclusion
The
Court DENIES Defendants’ motion for an order compelling Plaintiff to produce a
vehicle for inspection.
Moving
party is to give notice.
