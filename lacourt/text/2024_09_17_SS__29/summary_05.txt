And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel the inspection of the plaintiff's vehicle. The defendants had requested an oral inspection of the 2009 Smart Fortwo, one of the vehicles involved in an accident on July 20, 2020. However, the defendants failed to provide a written demand for inspection as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge noted that the defendants did not comply with the requirements of the Civil Discovery Act and therefore did not have a valid basis for the motion. The judge also stated that the defendants may have a reasonable argument for the inspection, but they must comply with the requirements of the Civil Discovery Act to obtain a court order compelling the inspection.
