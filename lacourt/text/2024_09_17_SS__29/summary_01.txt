And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the Whitehouse Defendants' motion to advance the hearing date on their motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, to continue trial. The judge notes that the Whitehouse Defendants have a right to have their timely filed motion for summary judgment heard before trial. However, the judge must balance a number of considerations, including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion.

The judge sees four options for resolving the motion: setting the hearing on the summary judgment motion for October 25, 2024; setting the hearing on the summary judgment motion for November 7, 2024; setting the hearing on the summary judgment motion for December 12, 2024 and continuing the trial to a date in mid-January 2025; or inquiring whether all parties are willing to stipulate to extend the five-year deadline to commence trial.

The judge will hear from counsel and is open to considering any other helpful suggestions from counsel. The judge will discuss the matter further and make a final ruling.
