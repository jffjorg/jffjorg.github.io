  Case Number:  19STCV30424    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Navarro v.
Whitehouse Construction
19STCV30424
Defendants’ Motion to Advance Hearing Date Or, In Alternative, to Continue Trial
Tentative
The Court will call this matter and hear from
counsel.
Background
Plaintiffs Sergio and Silvia
Navarro (“Plaintiffs”) are the owners of a house in Castaic, California that
sustained substantial fire damage in August 2017. Plaintiffs allege that they hired
a general contractor, Defendant Matthew White (initially named as Matthew
Whitehouse), and his company Defendant Whitehouse Construction, Inc.
(collectively, the “Whitehouse Defendants”), for necessary repairs; that
Defendants’ negligence caused a flood at their home; and that Plaintiff Sergio
Navarro slipped and fell on September 1, 2017, while inspecting the water
damage, sustaining significant injuries to his spine.
On August 27, 2019, Plaintiffs
filed their Complaint, alleging causes of action for negligence, negligent
infliction of emotional distress, and loss of consortium against the Whitehouse
Defendants and Does 1 through 100.
On November 19, 2020, the Whitehouse Defendants filed their
Answer and a cross-complaint for indemnity against Roes 1 through 100.
On August 4, 2023, Plaintiffs
corrected the name of the defendant formerly sued as Matthew Whitehouse to his
true name Matthew White.
On August 9,
2023, the Court heard the motion for summary judgment filed by the Whitehouse
Defendants.  By Minute Order dated September
13, 2023, the Court denied the motion.
On November 22,
2023, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to name Erik Zindroski (“Zindroski”) and
EZ Pools, Inc. (“EZ”) as Does 1 and 2. 
On February 5,
2024, Zindroski filed an answer and cross-complaint against Does 3 through 100
and Roes 1 through 100.  
On August 2, 2024,
EZ filed an answer.
On July 31,
2024, the Whitehouse Defendants filed a renewed motion for summary judgment.  The hearing date on their motion is February
19, 2025.
On August 2,
2024, Zindroski and EZ (collectively, the “Zindroski Defendants”) filed a
motion for summary judgment.  The hearing
date on their motion is March 19, 2025.
On August 13,
2024, the Whitehouse Defendants filed this motion to advance the hearing date
on their motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, to continue trial.
Plaintiffs filed an untimely opposition on September 11.  The Whitehouse Defendants filed a reply on
September 12.
Trial is
scheduled for December 3, 2024.
The Court notes
that the Zindroski Defendants have not moved to advance the hearing on their
motion for summary judgment.
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of which
the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
As a preliminary matter, the Court exercises
its discretion to consider Plaintiffs’ late filed opposition to this motion.
The Whitehouse Defendants move to advance the hearing date on their
motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, to continue trial.  
The Whitehouse
Defendants have a right to have their timely filed motion for summary judgment
heard before trial.  (Cole
v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88; Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529.)
In ruling on this
motion, however, the Court must balance a number of considerations, including
(but not limited to) the following: (1) Plaintiffs are entitled to a minimum
notice period of 75 days, plus two court days for electronic service, meaning
that the earliest that the motion could be heard is October 16, 2024; (2) the
trial date is December 3, and the motion should be heard at least 30 days
before trial (although the Court has discretion to set a later hearing date for
good cause), meaning that the motion should be heard by no later than November
1, 2024 (November 3 is a Sunday); (3) the Court has no available summary
judgment hearing dates between October 16 and November 1; and (4) continuing
the trial date, which is the alternative relief requested by the Whitehouse
Defendants, is problematic given that the complaint was filed in August 2019,
which means that even with the six-month extension from the COVID-19 emergency
rules, the five-year date to commence trial falls in February 2025.
The Court will
discuss the matter with counsel.  The
Court sees the following options, none of which is ideal:
Option One: Set
the hearing on the summary judgment motion for October 25, 2024 (which is an
overbooking for the Court).
Option Two: Set
the hearing on the summary judgment motion for November 7, 2024 (also an
overbooking for the Court, and it is less than 30 days before trial), for good
cause shown.
Option Three: Set
the hearing on the summary judgment motion for December 12, 2024, which is the
next date the Court has available for a summary judgment hearing, and continue
the trial to a date in mid January 2025.
Option Four:
Inquire whether all parties are willing to stipulate to extend that five-year
deadline to commence trial.
The Court will
hear from counsel.  The Court is open to considering
any other helpful suggestions from counsel.
Conclusion
The Court will hear from counsel.
