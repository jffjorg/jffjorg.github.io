Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Johnny Was, LLC, against the plaintiff, Drew Hunthausen. The plaintiff is a blind individual who claims that the defendant's website is inaccessible and violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Unruh Civil Rights Act.

The judge has ruled that the complaint states a claim for an Unruh violation and has overruled the demurrer. The defendant is ordered to file and serve its answer within 10 days of this order.

The judge has addressed several of the defendant's arguments, including the lack of a nexus between the website and the denial of access to the physical store, the lack of intent to discriminate, and the lack of specific deficiencies on the website. The judge has found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a nexus between the website and the denial of access, intent to discriminate, and specific deficiencies on the website.

The judge has also addressed the defendant's argument that the plaintiff lacks standing to maintain the claim. The judge has found that the plaintiff has standing under the Unruh Civil Rights Act and that Article III standing is not required to maintain an Unruh claim in a California state court.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the plaintiff and allows the case to proceed.
