And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion of Attorney Vanessa Fantasia, Esq. to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Maria Garza De Montes. The court finds that the attorney has shown sufficient reason why the motion should be granted, including an irremediable breakdown in attorney-client communication. The court notes that the attorney failed to provide a copy of the return receipt for confirmation of the client's address, but finds that the attorney submitted a declaration establishing that the service requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, have been satisfied. The court orders that the attorney is relieved as counsel of record for plaintiff Maria Garza De Montes, effective upon the filing of the proofs of service of the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel â€“ Civil" (Judicial Council form MC-053) upon the client.
