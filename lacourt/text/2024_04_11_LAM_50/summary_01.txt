And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the City's demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action of the First Amended Complaint. The City argued that the plaintiff, Lawrence Adams, failed to allege sufficient facts to excuse compliance with the claim presentation requirement. The court agreed, stating that a plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation requirement. The court also sustained the City's demurrer to the fourth cause of action for common counts-account stated, stating that the plaintiff failed to allege any agreement between himself and the City establishing a relationship of debtor and creditor.

The court also sustained the City's demurrer to the first cause of action for declaratory relief, stating that declaratory relief is not an appropriate vehicle for judicial review of administrative actions. The court ordered the City to file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal within 30 days of the date of the order.
