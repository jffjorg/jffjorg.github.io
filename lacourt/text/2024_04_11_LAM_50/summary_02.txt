And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court notes that the causes of action listed on the caption page of the complaint do not match the causes of action alleged within the complaint. The court also points out that the city filed a supplemental notice in support of the demurrer, stating that the city learned of a government tort claim submitted by the plaintiff after the city filed its reply to the demurrer. The court notes that the plaintiff's first amended complaint does not appear to allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation requirement. The court concludes that the city's arguments are not supported by any evidence.
