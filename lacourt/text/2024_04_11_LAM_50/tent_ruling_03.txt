[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 



            
            Plaintiff South American Global Shipping & Transport, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
requests entry of default judgment against Defendant Aurelio Soto dba Mia’s
Flowers Wholesale. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount of $41,307.89,
comprising $36,763.39 in damages, $2,819.60 in interest, $524.90 in costs, and $1,200.00
in attorney’s fees. 
            The Court notes a few defects with the
submitted default judgment package.¿
First, Plaintiff’s
counsel states that “attorney’s fees are requested pursuant to California Civil Code § 1717.5(a)…” (Krantz Decl., ¶
5.) The Court notes that Civil Code
section 1717.5, subdivision (a) provides in part that “[i]f there is
a written agreement between the parties signed by the person to be charged, the
fees provided by this section may not be imposed unless that agreement contains
a statement that the prevailing party in any action between the parties is
entitled to the fees provided by this section.” In
the Complaint in this action, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that “[t]his
court is the proper court because…a defendant entered into the contract here.”
(Compl., ¶ 7(a).) In connection with the instant request, Plaintiff does not
appear to provide evidence regarding whether there is a written agreement
between the parties, and if so, whether such agreement “contains a statement
that the prevailing party in any action between the parties is entitled to the
fees provided by this section.” (Civ. Code § 1717.5, subd. (a).) Thus, the
Court is unable to determine whether the requested attorney’s fees are
warranted here under Civil Code section 1717.5. 
Second, on the second page of
the proposed judgment (Form JUD-100), the box for “The Clerk” is checked
instead of the box for “The Court.”
Accordingly, the request
for entry of default judgment is denied without prejudice. The Court will
discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment
package.
