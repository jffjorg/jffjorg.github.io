[1]The Court notes
that the causes of action listed on the caption page of the Complaint do not
match the causes of action alleged within the Complaint. The caption page of
the Complaint appears to list an additional cause of action for “breach of
contract” that is not pled in the Complaint. In addition, the cause of action
for “promissory estoppel/detrimental reliance” is incorrectly numbered as the
“twelfth” cause of action. Thus, the Court refers to this cause of action as
the “thirteenth” cause of action herein. 


[2]Moreover,
such arguments are not supported by any evidence.   


[3]The Court notes
that on April 4, 2024, the City filed a supplemental notice in support of the
demurrer stating, inter alia, that “[u]ndersigned counsel learned after
filing the City’s reply in support of its demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint that Plaintiff submitted a government tort claim to the City, which
is being evaluated and processed per Government Code
Section 900 et seq. No final decision has been made as to its
adequacy or timeliness under Government Code Section
911.2.” In any event, as discussed, Plaintiff’s
FAC does not appear to allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with
the claim presentation requirement.
