And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, has issued a tentative ruling in the case. The plaintiff, South American Global Shipping & Transport, Inc., is seeking a default judgment against the defendant, Aurelio Soto dba Mia's Flowers Wholesale, in the amount of $41,307.89. The judgment includes damages, interest, costs, and attorney's fees. The court has identified two defects in the submitted default judgment package: (1) the absence of evidence regarding a written agreement between the parties, as required by Civil Code section 1717.5, and (2) the incorrect selection of "The Clerk" instead of "The Court" on the proposed judgment form. As a result, the court is unable to determine whether the requested attorney's fees are warranted. The request for entry of default judgment is denied without prejudice, and the court will discuss a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package with the plaintiff.
