Roles: Judge of the Superior Court (Hon. Eric Harmon)
Significant Statements:
* "When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay." (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 1048(a))
* "Consolidation was appropriate." (Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust, 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 979)
* "The trial court correctly anticipated that a large portion of the trial would be devoted to issues common to the three cases" and "the parties were able to use the same witnesses . . . [and h]ad there been three separate trials the same deposition testimony would have been introduced, many of the same expert witnesses called and much of the same evidence presented." (Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust, 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 979)
* "Consolidation will further judicial economy. If the cases are consolidated, they will require a single trial and jury, rather than five separate trials and juries. Further, the common witnesses and Defendants would attend only one trial."
* "The parties can organize trial such that the jury will not be confused about the different Plaintiffs, employment dates, and facts in each case."
