And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff, Dan Sackheim, wants to add new theories of liability against the defendants, including alter ego liability and a joint venture. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not shown that he exercised due diligence in seeking leave to amend the complaint, and that the defendants would be prejudiced by the proposed amendment. The judge notes that the action was filed over five years ago, and that the defendants have not had the opportunity to conduct discovery or challenge the legal sufficiency of the new claims. The judge also notes that the defendants have already filed motions for summary judgment, which would be rendered moot by the filing of the second amended complaint. The judge concludes that it is not in furtherance of justice to grant the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint, and exercises its discretion to deny the motion.
