Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint
The court considered
the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Dan Sackheim (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
granting him leave to file a Second Amended Complaint against defendants Amazon
Studios, Inc., Genre Arts, Inc., Carlton Cuse, Carlton Cuse Productions,
Skydance Media, LLC, Skydance Television, LLC, Platinum Dunes Productions,
Viacom, Inc., Potomac River Productions, Inc., and Paramount Pictures
Corporation (“Defendants”) in this action to add additional facts regarding the
roles, responsibilities, identities, and relationships of and between the
parties in this action.  (Rosenweig
Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.)  Specifically, Plaintiff
seeks to allege (1) alter ego liability of Defendants, and (2) that Defendants
entered into and formed a joint venture regarding the production of Jack
Ryan.  (Ibid.) 
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking
out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party,
or a mistake in any other respect . . . . 
The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse
party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or
proceeding in other particulars . . . .”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿473, subd.
(a)(1).)¿  “Generally, leave to amend should be liberally granted. 
However, unwarranted delay justifies denial of leave to amend.”  (Miles
v. City of Los Angeles (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 728, 739.)  Thus, “this
policy [of permitting amendment to complaints at any stage in the proceeding]
applies ‘ “only ‘[w]here no prejudice is shown to the adverse party.’ ”
’”  (Melican v. Regents of University of California (2007) 151
Cal.App.4th 168, 175.)  “Prejudice exists where the proposed amendment
would require delaying the trial, resulting in added costs of preparation and
increased discovery burdens.”  (Miles, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th
at p. 739.) 
The court finds that (1) it is not in furtherance of justice to allow Plaintiff
to file a Second Amended Complaint, and (2) Defendants would be prejudiced by
the amendment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1).)
First, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that he exercised diligence
in seeking leave to amend his complaint. 
Counsel for Plaintiff asserts that he “recently discovered [the facts
giving rise to the proposed amendment] through review of Defendants’ discovery,
which was only provided after Plaintiff was forced to file (and prevail on)
more than a dozen discovery motions.” 
(Rosenweig Decl., ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff
did not submit evidence establishing the date(s) on which he discovered the
facts giving rise to the proposed amendment as required.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1324, subd.
(b)(3).)  Moreover, it appears that
Plaintiff discovered, or was put on notice of, these facts by the end of 2023.  
The court acknowledges, as Plaintiff notes, that Plaintiff filed various
motions to compel Defendants’ further discovery responses in September 2023.  The court issued rulings on those motions on November
1, 2023, November 3, 2023, November 14, 2023, November 17, 2023, November 30,
2023, December 1, 2023, December 6, 2023, December 8, 2023, December 13, 2023, and
December 19, 2023.  Defendants were
ordered to serve further responses and to produce responsive documents to
certain of Plaintiff’s discovery requests within 20 days of the date of each
order.  (Nov. 1, 2023 Order, p. 4:4-9;
Nov. 3, 2023 Order, p. 4:7-10, 4:15-19; Nov. 14, 2023 Order, p. 3:12-15,
3:20-23; Nov. 17, 2023 Order, p. 2:20-25; Nov. 30, 2023 Order, p. 4:4-7,
4:12-15, 4:20-23; Dec. 1, 2023 Order, p. 3:4-7, 3:12-15; Dec. 6, 2023 Order, pp.
3:27-4:3, 4:8-12, 4:17-21; Dec. 8, 2023 Order, p. 4:9-13, 4:18-22; Dec. 13,
2023 Order, pp. 3:13-19, 3:24-4:2; Dec. 19, 2023 Order, pp. 3:18-23, 4:1-6.)  Thus, Plaintiff should have received the
subject discovery from Defendants no later than December 29, 2023, i.e., 20
days of the date of the last order on Plaintiff’s motions to compel Defendants’
further discovery responses.  (Dec. 19,
2023 Order, pp. 3:18-23, 4:1-6.)  
Plaintiff did not present evidence establishing that (1) Defendants
did not serve their discovery responses within the time ordered by the court,
such that Plaintiff only recently learned of the facts necessitating the
proposed amendment despite exercising due diligence to obtain this discovery,
or (2) Plaintiff acted diligently in reviewing the discovery responses that
Defendants served following the court’s orders directing them to serve further
responses and to produce responsive documents. 
Instead, it appears that Plaintiff received Defendants’ further
discovery responses by the end of 2023, but filed his motion over seven months
later, on July 18, 2024.  
The court therefore finds that Plaintiff has not presented evidence or
argument explaining how the facts giving rise to the proposed amendments
regarding Defendants’ alleged alter ego liability and the formation of a joint
venture between Defendants could not have been discovered, or why he could not
file his motion, earlier by exercising due diligence.  (Melican, supra, 151
Cal.App.4th at p. 175 [“appellate courts are less likely to find an abuse of
discretion where, for example, the proposed amendment is ‘ “offered after long
unexplained delay . . . or where there is a lack of diligence . . . .” ’” ].)
            Second, the court finds that
Defendants would be unduly prejudiced by the proposed amendment. 
            As set forth above, Plaintiff
requests leave to amend his complaint in order to add additional theories of
liability on the ground that Defendants are alter egos of the other and joint
venturers.  (Rosenweig Decl., ¶ 2.)  However, this action was filed over five
years ago, on June 17, 2019, and trial is set to begin on December 4, 2024.  Defendants have not had the opportunity to
conduct discovery regarding these claims or to otherwise challenge their legal
sufficiency.  Moreover, Defendants, in
relying on the allegations of the First Amended Complaint, filed 10 motions for
summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication in March, April, and
June of 2023, all of which are set for hearing on various dates in October 2024
and November 1, 2024.  The court further
notes that the court has continued the hearing dates on Defendants’ motions for
summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication on three occasions,
pursuant to (1) Plaintiff’s April 25, 2023 ex parte application, in which
Plaintiff requested a continuance of all of the motions so that he could
conduct discovery, (2) Plaintiff’s September 27, 2023 ex parte application, in
which Plaintiff requested a continuance of all of the motions so that he could
conduct discovery necessary to oppose the motions, and (3) the amended
stipulation filed by Plaintiff and Defendants on February 13, 2024.  (April 26, 2023 Order, pp. 1-3; Sep. 28, 2023
Order, pp. 1-4; Feb. 13, 2024, Amended Stipulation & Order, pp. 5-6.)  
Thus, the court finds that Defendants would be prejudiced by the
proposed amendment because (1) their motions for summary judgment—which have
already been continued three times—would be rendered moot by the filing of the
Second Amended Complaint, and (2) they would be deprived of their right to file
new motions for summary judgment that are directed to the operative pleading
and address the new theories of liability before trial begins on December 4,
2024.  As set forth above, “the liberal
policy favoring leave to amend ‘applies “ ‘only “[w]here no prejudice is shown
to the adverse party.” ’ ” ’”  (Miles, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th
at p. 728.) 
Because the court has concluded that (1) Plaintiff has not justified his
delay in seeking leave to amend his complaint and (2) Defendants would be
prejudiced by the proposed amendment, the court finds that it is not in
furtherance of justice to grant Plaintiff’s request to amend his complaint.  The court therefore exercises its discretion
to deny Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Dan
Sackheim’s motion for leave to file second amended complaint.
            The court orders defendants Amazon Studios,
Inc., Genre Arts, Inc., Carlton Cuse, Carlton Cuse Productions, Skydance Media,
LLC, Skydance Television, LLC, Platinum Dunes Productions, Viacom, Inc.,
Potomac River Productions, Inc., and Paramount Pictures Corporation to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
