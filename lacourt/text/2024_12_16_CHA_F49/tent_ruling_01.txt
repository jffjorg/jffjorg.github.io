ANALYSIS
 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to
it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party to whom the demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to
the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
“The party making the demand may
move for an order compelling response to the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (b).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One
 
Defendant’s counsel, Sunny
Lee (“Lee”), attests that on April 24, 2024, Siteone served its written
discovery requests, including the Request for Production of Documents, Set One,
on Defendant Calvin Alexander Kim (“Kim”). (Lee Amended Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. “A.”) The deadline
for Kim’s responses to the discovery requests was due on May 29, 2024. (Ibid.)
On June 6, 2024, Siteone’s counsel contacted Kim’s counsel inquiring about the
discovery responses and extended the deadline to respond to June 30, 2024. (Id.
¶ 7.)  However, as of August 2, 2024,
Siteone has not received any responses from Defendant Kim. (Id. ¶ 10.)
 
Based on the above records, the
Court determines that Defendant Kim failed to serve a timely response, thereby
waiving any objection to the requests, including those based on privilege or
the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.300, subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a), the court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2021.240, and 2031.280. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
Here, Defendant Kim did not file an
Opposition to the Motion. Nor did he move separately for relief from the
waiver. Additionally, there is no record indicating any responses have been
subsequently served by Kim prior to the hearing. Consequently, the Court finds
that
relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,
subdivision (a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS the unopposed Motion.
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Monetary sanctions, as outlined
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 subdivision (c) are mandatory
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to a demand, unless the court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Additionally,
California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(a) further provides, “The Court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
The Court finds that the mandatory
sanctions apply in this case. Utilizing the lodestar approach, the Court
determines the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the Motion to be $860.00,
calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $400.00 for two hours
reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions.
