Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment or adjudication filed by Defendant Robles Glass & Supplies Inc. in a case brought by Plaintiff Marco Chavira against California Landmark Group. The motion seeks to dismiss all eight causes of action alleged by Plaintiff, except for the claim of negligence. The Court finds that Defendant has met its initial burden of showing that Plaintiff's causes of action have no merit, but Plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact that counter Defendant's circumstantial evidence. Specifically, Plaintiff introduces evidence that the property management company did not actually inspect the installation, and that Defendant's technician had minimal prior experience in installing blinds. The Court denies Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of Plaintiff's cause of action for negligence.
