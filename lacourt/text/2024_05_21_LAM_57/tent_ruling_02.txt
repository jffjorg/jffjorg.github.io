 Case Number:  21STCV08114    Hearing Date:   May 21, 2024    Dept:  57  O'Melveny & Myers's ("OMM"} motion to compel Ocean Towers Housing Corporation ("OTHC") to provide further responses to OMM's request for production of documents and requests for admission is granted.  The Court will provide further detail on the basis for this ruling at the hearing if the parties wish.    But in brief, what OMM is seeking through the two requests is  relevant to the issues in the case, and OTHC's responses are insufficient and its objections are not well-founded.   The further responses must be provided by June 4, 2024.
