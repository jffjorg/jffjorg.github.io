And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied Defendant Randy Thomas's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff Andrew Keiller's complaint, which seeks recognition and enforcement in this court of a default judgment that Keiller obtained against Thomas in an Australian court. Keiller passed away after Thomas filed his summary judgment, and his widow Louise Tanish substituted as the plaintiff in the case. The court found that Thomas purposefully availed himself of the benefits of conducting activities in Australia, and therefore, the default judgment can be recognized and enforced in this court.
