Background   
Case No. 23STCP01071
Plaintiff Annex Walnut Automotive
Colors & Supply, Inc. (“Annex”) alleges as follows:
Annex is a
distributor of automotive and industrial coatings and paint. Rachel M. Darvish
("Darvish"), Keyvan Rahbar (“Rahbar”) and Maryam Rouillard
(“Rouillard”) each own 33% of the outstanding shares and voting power of Annex.
Rouillard has been responsible for the day-to-day management and operations of
Annex. Annex seeks to wind up and dissolve. Rouillard has never distributed any
income to Darvish and Rahbar but has reported to the IRS distributions to both.

 
In December 2022,
Rouillard informed Darvish and Rahbar of her plans to retire, that she had
arranged to sell sale of Annex to one its competitors, Wesco Group, LLC.
(hereinafter "Wesco Group") and that she and Wesco Group had agreed
on a total estimated purchase price of $1,308,385.00. 
 
On January 30, 2023,
Rouillard changed Annex’s Statement of Information on file with the California
Secretary of State to name herself as agent for service of process and its only
director and Chief Executive Officer. 
 
On March 6, 2023,
Darvish, Rahbar and Rouillard met to discuss how the sale and distribution of
the proceeds would be handled; during that meeting, Rouillard became angry and
physically assaulted Darvish. Rouillard interfered with the sale due in part to
the March 6th incident, causing Wesco Group to withdraw from the transaction. 
 
On or about May 1,
2023, Darvish and Rahbar contacted Wesco Group and were able to revive Wesco
Group's initial offer to purchase Annex. On May 17, 2023, in order to
effectuate the sale, Wesco Group submitted a list of documents to be produced
by Annex. Rouillard is one two individuals affiliated with Annex who has access
to this information, the other person being Rouillard's nephew, Amir Karimpour
(“Karimpour”). Rouillard has failed to cooperate and has directed Annex’s
employees, including Karimpour, not to cooperate and supply the requested
information. Rouillard has contacted representatives of Wesco Group, as well as
other third parties and potential buyers, and informed them that she will
prevent the sale of Annex to Wesco Group or to those third-party buyers.
On June 8, 2023, Annex filed a
“Verified First Amended Petition,” asserting causes of action against Rouillard,
John Kobes, Calvin Kobes and Does 1-20 for:
1.                 
Request for Court Supervision Over Voluntary
Dissolution—California Corporations Code Section 1904
2.                 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty
3.                 
Conversion
4.                 
Fraud
5.

Relations
6.                 
Declaratory Relief
On July 7, 2023, an “Order on Petitioner Annex Walnut Automotive Colors
& Supply, Inc.’s Motion for the Appointment of a Receiver” was filed;
that day, the matter was reassigned to this instant department.
On July 11, 2023, Rouillard filed
a cross-complaint, asserting causes of action against Darvish, Rahbar, Annex
and Roes 21-50 for:
1.                 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty
2.                 
Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty
3.                 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
4.                 
Fraud
5.                 
Conspiracy to Commit Fraud

7.                 
Declaratory Relief
On August 17, 2023, the court

October 4, 2023.
Case
No. 23PSCV01022

Plaintiff M&K Partners
(“M&K”) alleges as follows:
M&K is a general
partnership between Lilly Darvish and Rahbar. On October 4, 2019, Rouillard
caused legal title to the property located at 17999 East Valley Boulevard, City
of Industry, CA 91744 (“property”) to be transferred to MMK Partners, LLC (“MMK
Partners”). The transfer was unauthorized and made without consideration. 
On May 30, 2023, M&K filed a First
Amended Complaint, asserting causes of action against MMK Partners, Kamran
Ghoreyshi (“Ghoreyshi”), Rouillard, all persons unknown claiming any legal or
equitable right, title, estate, lien, or interest in the property described in
the complaint adverse to Plaintiff’s title, or any cloud on Plaintiff’s title
thereto and Does 1-20 for:
1.                 
Quiet Title
2.                 
Cancellation of Deed
3.                 
Fraud
On August 17, 2023, the court
related Case No. 23STCP01071 to the instant case and designated Case No.
23STCP01071 as the lead case.
A Status Conference (Related
Cases) is set for October 4, 2023.
1.         OSC Re:
Preliminary Injunction
Legal Standard
 “An injunction is a
writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular act. It may be
granted by the court in which the action is brought, or by a judge thereof; and
when granted by a judge, it may be enforced as an order of the court.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 525.)
“The purpose of a preliminary
injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution upon a trial.”
(Grothe v. Cortlandt Corp. (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316.) “Status
quo has been defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status
which preceded the pending controversy.” (Voorhies v. Greene
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995 [quotations and citation omitted].)
“In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,
the trial court considers two related factors: (1) the likelihood that the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its case at trial, and (2) the interim
harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as
compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants
a preliminary injunction.” (14859
Moorpark Homeowner’s Ass’n v. VRT Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1402.)
“The trial court’s determination must be guided by a ‘mix’ of the
potential-merit and interim-harm factors; the greater the plaintiff’s showing
on one, the less must be shown on the other to support an injunction.” (Butt v. State of California (1992) 4
Cal.4th 668, 678.) “Generally, weighing these factors lies within
the broad discretion of the superior court.” (County of Kern v. T.C.E.F., Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 301, 315.)
Discussion
The Receiver seeks the issuance of a
preliminary injunction prohibiting Rouillard and her agents from authorizing,
committing or performing (directly or indirectly) any and all of the following
act: (a) going to or being present at Annex, located at 17999 East
Valley Boulevard, City of Industry, CA 91744 (“Property”); (b) communicating
with or instructing in any way any of Annex’s employees, agents or contractors
about Annex, its customers, its vendors, and its assets, whether at the
Property or anywhere else; (c) communicating with Annex’s customers regarding
Annex and (4) communicating with Annex’s vendors regarding Annex.
1.         Likelihood
of Prevailing
On July 7, 2023, the court entered an
“Order on Petitioner Annex Walnut Automotive Colors & Supply, Inc.’s Motion
for the Appointment of a Receiver” (“Appointing Order”), which appointed the
Receiver to “[a]ssume full control, management and administration of [Annex] or
assets of [Annex].” (Singer Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. 1, 4:23). The Appointing Order
authorizes the Receiver to “interview Plaintiff or Defendant and hire one or
both to help with the operations and dissolution of [Anex]” and provides that
the Receiver “shall maintain financial control of [Annex] until the sale to. .
. Wesco Group, LLC is completed.” (Id., 6:8-11). The Appointing Order
also contains a “Preliminary Injunction in Aid of Receivership” which prohibits
the parties and all persons or entities receiving notice of the Appointing
Order from “withdrawing, removing, assigning, re-conveying, transferring,
pledging, encumbering, disbursing, dissipating, converting, releasing, selling
or otherwise disposing of” any assets of Annex. (Id., 8:17-20). 
The Receiver has
presented evidence that on August 2, 2023, Rouillard improperly transferred
$115,721.90 out of Annex’s checking account at Wells Fargo. (Singer Decl., ¶ 3,
Exhs. 2 and 3). Although Rouillard replenished $9,205.83 of those funds and
used $89,876.76 of those funds to pay off Annex’s line of credit with Wells
Fargo, a total of $16,639.31 that was transferred to Rouillard’s personal
checking account remains missing and unaccounted for. (Id., ¶¶ 3-5,
Exhs. 4 and 5).
The Receiver has
also presented evidence that Rouillard visited the Property between July 18,
2023 and August 4, 2023[1] “on an almost daily basis, sometimes
multiple times a day,” and, during most of these visits, became agitated about
various issues and would raise her voice and use coarse language (Karimpour
Decl., ¶¶ 5-8); that Rouillard has thrown objects at employees and others at
the Property and broken and knocked over cans of paint and other items there. (Id.,
¶ 7); that Rouillard continues to collect payments from customers, communicate
with customers directly and interferes with Annex’s operations by communicating
with vendors and directing them to only accept orders placed by her (Id.,
¶¶ 10-15, Exhs. 1 and 3); that Rouillard has
attempted to cancel and refuse delivery of orders placed by Karimpour on behalf
of Annex (Id., ¶ 11), and that Rouillard has commandeered employees and
vehicles that belong to Annex (Id., 9.)
2.         Interim
Harm
As established by the declarations of the
Receiver, Amir Karimpour and Jeffrey Engerman, Rouillard
will continue to visit the Property and interfere with Annex’s operations.
There is a valid concern, moreover, based on Rouillard’s recent behavior of
throwing objects at employees and other individuals at Annex, that Rouillard
could cause bodily harm to employees, customers, or any other person who
happens to be at the Property. Rouillard cannot claim harm by the issuance of
an injunction as she has no right to violate the Appointing Order or ignore the
Receiver’s instructions. Karimpour worked full time at Annex from 2010-2019 in
a similar capacity to his current role as operations manager and in on-call
consulting and support at Annex from 2019 to June 2023; clearly, he is capable
of operating Annex with the Receiver’s assistance and supervision.
Conclusion
The Order to Show
Cause Re: Preliminary Injunction is granted. The court will hear from the
parties at the time of the hearing with respect to the issue of posting a bond.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 529).
2.         OSC Re:
Contempt
The Receiver seeks to
hold Rouillard in contempt for violating the court’s July 7, 2023 order by
misappropriating Annex’s funds.
“A contempt proceeding is commenced by the filing of an
affidavit and a request for an order to show cause. (§ 1211, subd, (a),(b).)
After notice to the opposing party's lawyer, the court (if satisfied with the
sufficiency of the affidavit) must sign an order to show cause re contempt in
which the date and time for a hearing are set forth. (§ 1212. . .). The order
to show cause acts as a summons to appear in court on a certain day and, as its
name suggests, to show cause why a certain thing should not be done. Unless the
citee has concealed himself from the court, he must be personally served with
the affidavit and the order to show cause; otherwise, the court lacks
jurisdiction to proceed. . .” (Cedars-Sinai Imaging
Medical Group v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286-1287 [citations omitted; emphasis in
original]; see also Koehler v. Superior Court (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th
1153, 1169 [“[A] contempt citation must served personally”].)
There is no indication that Rouillard has been
personally served with the affidavit and OSC; accordingly, the OSC is denied
for lack of jurisdiction.
