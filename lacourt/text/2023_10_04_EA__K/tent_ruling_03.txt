[1]              Motions #1 and #2 were filed (and
served via email) on September 6, 2023 and originally set for hearing on
October 2, 2023 and October 3, 2023, respectively. On September 8, 2023, two
“Notice[s] re: Continuance of Hearing and Order” were filed, wherein the court
continued the above hearing dates on Motions #1 and #2 to October 4, 2023;
notice was given to the parties. There is no indication on ecourt (i.e., as of
September 21, 2023, 9:40 a.m.), however, reflecting that moving counsel has
provided notice of the continued hearing date to the Clients.


[2]              The court notes that there are two
separate motion filings for Daniel Leon (i.e., one filed September 6, 2023 at
3:14 p.m. and the other filed September 6, 2013 at 3:15 p.m.) The filings
appear to be identical, except that the 3:15 p.m. filing does not include the
referenced Attachment 2.
