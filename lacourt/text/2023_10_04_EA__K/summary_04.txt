And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Order to Show Cause Re: Preliminary Injunction, which prohibits Rouillard and her agents from interfering with Annex's operations. The Judge found that there is a likelihood that Annex will prevail on the merits of its case and that the interim harm to Annex if the injunction is denied outweighs the harm to Rouillard if the injunction is granted.

The Judge also denied the Order to Show Cause Re: Why the Defendant Should Not be Held in Contempt for Willful and Knowing Violation of this Court's July 7, 2023 Order because Rouillard was not personally served with the affidavit and order to show cause.

The Judge ordered the parties to appear at a hearing on October 4, 2023, to discuss the issue of posting a bond to support the preliminary injunction.
