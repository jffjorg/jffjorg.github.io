And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case involving the City of Claremont and Sandblossom, LLC. The City has alleged that the property located at 1978 N. Indian Hill Boulevard in Claremont is in a perpetual state of disrepair and requires a receiver to take possession and remedy compliance issues. The court previously granted the City's petition for a receiver, but the Respondent, Sandblossom, LLC, has now moved the court for an order to show cause re: holding the receiver in contempt for willfully violating the court's order.

The court's order granted the receiver's request for discharge and exoneration of surety and repayment of fees and costs in part. However, the Respondent argues that the court ruled on the amount of principal and interest owed to the lender on the receiver's certificate and that the court authorized the receiver to increase the receiver's certificate by an additional $58,447.13. The receiver, on the other hand, argues that the court did not rule on the amount of principal and interest owed on the receiver's certificate.

The court construes the instant motion as seeking clarification of the court's order and finds that the language in the order intended to convey that the receiver's certificate be increased to $58,447.13 total, not by $58,447.13. The court also notes that the receiver failed to seek a determination from the court regarding the amount of any interest owed with respect to the receiver's certificate.

The court determines that the charging affidavit is insufficient to issue an order to show cause re: contempt and concludes that the receiver's deed of trust was recorded in violation of the court's order.

## English Text Summary

The judge is considering a motion by the Respondent (Sandblossom, LLC) for an order to show cause regarding the Receiver's (Mark Adams) actions. The Respondent argues that the Receiver acted improperly by recording a deed of trust without court authorization and is seeking contempt charges, the removal of the deed of trust, and attorney's fees against the Receiver.

The judge acknowledges that there is a dispute about the scope of a previous order issued on March 15, 2023. The court states that its intent was to order the Receiver's Certificate be raised to $58,447.13, reflecting the total amount of property taxes and fees owed to the Receiver. However, the court finds that the Receiver should have sought clarification on the matter of interest owed on the Receiver's Certificate during its initial motion for discharge.



The judge will issue a further ruling after considering the arguments presented.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has received a motion from the Respondent, Sandblossom, LLC, to show cause why the Receiver, Mark Adams and California Receivership Group, BC, should not be held in contempt for allegedly violating the court's March 15, 2023 order. The Respondent argues that the court ruled on the amount of principal and interest owed to the lender on the Receiver's Certificate and that the court authorized the Receiver to increase the Receiver's Certificate to $58,447.13. The Receiver, however, argues that the court did not rule on the amount of principal and interest owed and that the court only authorized the Receiver to increase the Receiver's Certificate by an additional $58,447.13.

The court concludes that the charging affidavit is insufficient to issue an Order to Show Cause Re: Contempt and construes the instant motion as seeking clarification of the court's March 15, 2023 order. The court determines that the Receiver's Certificate should be increased to $58,447.13 total, which includes $36,731.06 in property taxes and $21,716.07 in fees and costs incurred by the Receiver prior to the stay.

The court also notes that the Receiver should have sought a determination from the court regarding the amount of any interest owed with respect to the Receiver's Certificate in its Motion for Discharge. The court concludes that the Receiver's actions may have violated the court's order and that a further hearing is necessary to resolve the dispute.
