And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case involving the City of Claremont and Sandblossom, LLC. The City has alleged that the property located at 1978 N. Indian Hill Boulevard in Claremont is in a perpetual state of disrepair and requires a receiver to take possession and remedy compliance issues. The court previously granted the City's petition for a receiver, but the Respondent, Sandblossom, LLC, has now moved the court for an order to show cause re: holding the receiver in contempt for willfully violating the court's order.

The court's order granted the receiver's request for discharge and exoneration of surety and repayment of fees and costs in part. However, the Respondent argues that the court ruled on the amount of principal and interest owed to the lender on the receiver's certificate and that the court authorized the receiver to increase the receiver's certificate by an additional $58,447.13. The receiver, on the other hand, argues that the court did not rule on the amount of principal and interest owed on the receiver's certificate.

The court construes the instant motion as seeking clarification of the court's order and finds that the language in the order intended to convey that the receiver's certificate be increased to $58,447.13 total, not by $58,447.13. The court also notes that the receiver failed to seek a determination from the court regarding the amount of any interest owed with respect to the receiver's certificate.

The court determines that the charging affidavit is insufficient to issue an order to show cause re: contempt and concludes that the receiver's deed of trust was recorded in violation of the court's order.
