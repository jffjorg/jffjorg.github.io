And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant, Wendy Seretan. The plaintiff, Henning, Kramer, Ruiz & Singh, LLP, had opposed the motion, arguing that the defendant did not adequately meet and confer with them before filing the motion. The judge agreed with the plaintiff, finding that the defendant's meet and confer attempt was not timely and that no substantive meet and confer took place. As a result, the motion is continued, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer further and file a joint statement identifying the remaining issues and their positions on those issues. The parties are also instructed to provide notice of the continued motion and are strongly encouraged to appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
