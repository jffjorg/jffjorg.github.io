And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Judge Kevin C. Brazile, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to discovery requests filed by the defendant, Allied Universal Security Services. The motion was filed on February 13, 2024, and the defendant had previously filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion. The plaintiff, Charles Webb, filed an opposition to the motion, which was untimely. However, the court has considered the opposition and has found that the motion is moot because the plaintiff has already served responses to the discovery requests.

The court has also denied sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's failure to timely serve responses was based on a misunderstanding and was not a misuse of the discovery process. The court has encouraged counsel to appear remotely via LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
