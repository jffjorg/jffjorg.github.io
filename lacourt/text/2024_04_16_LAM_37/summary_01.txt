And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the individual PAGA claim and to stay the non-individual PAGA claims pending arbitration. The court finds that the plaintiff does not have to bring an individual PAGA claim in order to bring a non-individual PAGA claim, and that the plaintiff has standing to bring a non-individual PAGA claim without alleging or proving individual claims. The court also finds that the plaintiff's decision to not pursue individual PAGA claims for damages and instead seek non-individual PAGA claims for civil penalties has the same procedural and substantive effect as the plaintiff in Kim v. Reins International California, Inc. who chose to dismiss individual PAGA claims.
