And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the FSC materials filed by the parties, including a joint exhibit list and a joint witness list. Despite the lack of a trial brief from the defense, the court is aware of the issues in the case and assumes there are no unusual issues and that the one-day trial estimate stands. The court orders the parties to revise the exhibit list, numbering each exhibit separately and stating any objections to their admission. The parties are also required to reach an agreement on the authenticity of the exhibits where possible. If the revised exhibit list is filed, the court will deem the matter ready for trial, which may begin on August 19, 2024. However, if the court is still engaged in a jury trial on that date, the case will be continued to August 23, 2024. The court urges the parties to settle the matter and notes that it is not changing its previous ruling on treble damages.
