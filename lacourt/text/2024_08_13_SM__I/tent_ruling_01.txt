  Case Number:  22SMCV02918    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  I The application for a continuance will be reluctantly
GRANTED.  Frankly, the parties have not
shown diligence nor have they explained why they waited until the week before
the FSC to seek the continuance. 
Normally, that would be enough to deny the request.  However, as it turns out, the court is
engaged in trial and will be engaged in trial when this trial is supposed to
occur.  No point would be served denying
the request only to not hear the case when it is set.  Accordingly, the court will GRANT the
request.  The trial date is VACATED.  The FSC is VACATED but the court will hold a
TSC on 8/19/24 at 8:30 am.  Counsel for
the parties are warned that it is more luck than anything else that led to the
application being granted.
