 Case Number:  23SMCV03279    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  I The court gave the FSC order on May 5, 2024.  Some FSC materials have been filed.  Specifically, on 8/7/24, the court received
the following: (1) Joint Exhibit List (about 25 exhibits, no statements on
authenticity or objections); (2) Joint Witness List (6 witnesses, 8 hours total
direct and cross examination).  There is
no statement of unusual issues, revised trial estimate, or defense trial brief
(plaintiff filed a trial brief on 8/12/24). 
That said, the court is roughly aware of the issues, so the lack of any
trial brief is hardly fatal.  The court
assumes there are no unusual issues and that the 1 day estimate stands.  The court will ORDER the parties to revise
the exhibit list so that the exhibits are each separately numbered (no “8A”
types of exhibits) and to reach an agreement on authenticity where possible
(which ought to be all or almost all of the exhibits) and to state any other
objections to the admission of the exhibits. 
The revised exhibit list will be filed by Wednesday.  If the revised list is filed, the court will
deem the matter READY FOR TRIAL and trial might start on 8/19/24.  The problem is that the court is currently
involved in a jury trial.  If that trial
is ongoing, then this case will be CONTINUED to 8/23/24 at 10:00 am.  All of that said, the court urges the parties
to settle this matter.  The court is not
changing its treble damages ruling.
