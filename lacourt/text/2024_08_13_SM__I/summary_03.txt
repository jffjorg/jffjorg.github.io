And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment and finds that the defendant's argument that the plaintiff failed to register the property as required by the rent stabilization ordinance (RSO) is not decisive. The court notes that the deed is ambiguous and that the property in question is a condominium unit, which is exempt from the RSO under certain circumstances. The court gives deference to the agency's interpretation of the RSO and finds that the property is exempt. However, the court also considers the plaintiff's due process rights and finds that it would be unfair to penalize the plaintiff for failing to register the property when the Board refused to allow registration. The court denies the motion for summary judgment and will proceed with the trial.
