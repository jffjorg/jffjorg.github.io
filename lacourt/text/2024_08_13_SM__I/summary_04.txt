And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has not yet made a final decision, but is inclined to continue the matter to a later date. The plaintiff is seeking records related to the defendant's DBA (doing business as), but the court is not convinced that it can enforce the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) requirements on an ex parte basis without sufficient evidence. The court needs proof that the records are being sought from the defendant's DBA, not a third party. The defense counsel claims to be investigating the matter, and the court is giving them time to respond. The judge is reserving judgment until the parties have had a chance to work out the issue.
