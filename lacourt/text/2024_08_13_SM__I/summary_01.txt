And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the application for a continuance. Despite the parties' lack of diligence and failure to explain their delay in seeking the continuance, the Judge has decided to grant the application. This decision was made because the court is currently engaged in trial and would not be able to hear the case on the scheduled date. As a result, the trial date has been vacated and a new trial setting conference has been scheduled for August 19, 2024. The Judge warns counsel for the parties that this decision was granted more due to luck than any other reason.
