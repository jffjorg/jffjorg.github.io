 Case Number:  24SMCV02713    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  I The court will inquire. 
Defense counsel’s email states that counsel is looking into the
matter.  The court expects that if the
record request is to the DBA of defendant, the documents will be forthcoming
forthwith.  However, the court is not
sure that it can enforce the CFR requirements on an ex parte basis on
this showing.  The court needs evidence
that the records are sought of defendant’s DBA and not a third party.  Further, the court will give defendant some
time to respond.  Right now, while
plaintiff claims a right to statutory preference, there is no evidence to that
effect.
 
What the court is inclined to do is to CONTINUE this matter
to later in the week and hope that between now and then the parties can work it
out.  If in fact the records are being
sought from a DBA of the defense, they should be turned over assuming that the
requirements of the CFR have been met.
