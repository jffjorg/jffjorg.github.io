 Case Number:  22STCV03788    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendants’ Motion for Leave to Conduct Second
Physical Examination of Plaintiff 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
 
On January 31, 2022, Kevin Freeman (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Emmanuel and Kristin Dossetti (collectively “Defendants”) and
Does 1 through 50, asserting a negligence cause of action arising out of dog
bite incident occurring on September 13, 2021. 
Defendants filed their answer on May 30, 2023.
 
Plaintiff alleges injuries to his foot and his back.  (Cadena Decl., ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff has agreed to one physical
examination (by a spine specialist) but does not agree to a second physical
examination (by a foot specialist). 
(Id., ¶¶ 4-11 & Exhs. B-G.)
 
On March
15, 2024, Defendants filed this motion for leave to conduct a second physical  examination of Plaintiff. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on April 30, and Defendants filed a reply on May 2.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by means of a
physical or mental examination of (1) a party to the action, (2) an agent of
any party, or (3) a natural person in the custody or under the legal control of
a party, in any action in which the mental or physical condition (including the
blood group) of that party or other person is in controversy in the action.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).)
 
In a personal injury action, the defendant may
demand one physical examination of plaintiff as of right, without advance leave
of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.220.)  
If a defendant seeks a further physical examination
of plaintiff, or a mental examination, the defendant must first file a motion
and “obtain leave of court.” (Id., § 2032.310, subd. (a).) Such a motion
must “specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination.” (Id., subd. (b).) The
court may grant such a motion “only for good cause shown.” (Id., §
2032.320, subd. (a).) A showing of good cause generally requires “that the
party produce specific facts justifying discovery and that the inquiry be
relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Vinson v. Super. Ct. (1987)
43 Cal.3d 833, 840.)  
 
“An order granting a physical or mental examination
shall specify the person or persons who may perform the examination, as well as
the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd.
(d).) “The court is to describe¿in detail¿who will conduct the
examination, where and when it will be conducted, the conditions, scope and
nature of the examination, and the diagnostic tests and procedures to be
employed.  The way to describe these ‘diagnostic tests and procedures’—fully¿and¿in
detail—is to list them by name.” (Carpenter v. Super. Ct.¿(2006)
141 Cal.App.4th 249, 260.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The moving party¿must support the motion with a meet
and confer declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (b).) A
meet and confer declaration must state facts “showing a reasonable and good
faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.”¿ (Id., § 2016.040.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The examination will be limited to whatever
condition is “in controversy” in the action.¿ (Id., § 2032.020, subd.
(a).)  
 
Discussion
 
Defendants seek leave of court to conduct a second physical examination
of Plaintiff.  To obtain such relief,
Defendants must submit evidence that they made a reasonable, good faith effort
to resolve the issue before filing the motion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2032.310, subd. (b) & 2016.040.)¿¿¿¿ 
 
Defendants have not done so.  To
the contrary, the evidence submitted with the moving papers shows: (1)
Defendants demanded two physical examinations on December 14, 2023 (Cadena
Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. B); (2) when Plaintiff objected, Defendants sent an email
on January 16, 2024, stating that Defendants would proceed with a motion unless
Plaintiff agreed, and that the email “will serve as our meet and confer” (Id.,
¶ 7 & Exh. E); and (3) after Plaintiff served written objections,
Defendants sent a letter dated March 6, 2024, explaining their reasons for
seeking a second examination and stating that unless Plaintiff would stipulate,
Defendant “will proceed with a motion to compel” (Id., ¶ 10 & Exh.  G). 
That’s it.  There was never a
discussion, a request for a telephone call, or even an invitation for further
discussion.  Instead, on the two
occasions in which there was any communication at all (according to the
declaration filing with the moving papers), the message was, essentially, “Stipulate
or else.”  That is a demand, not a
meet-and-confer discussion, or even an invitation to engage in a
meet-and-confer discussion.
 
For this reason, the motion is denied without prejudice.
 
Finally, the Court notes that if any further motion practice is
necessary, moving parties must adhere to the requirements of the Code,
including, but not limited to, Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310,
subdivision (b).  
Conclusion

The Court DENIES without
prejudice the motion for leave for a second physical examination of Plaintiff.
Moving
Party is to give notice.
