Here is a brief summary in English text:

The court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, meaning that the defendant, DoorDash Inc., is not liable for the plaintiff's damages. The plaintiff, Donna Samora, claimed that the defendant driver was acting within the course and scope of his employment with DoorDash at the time of the accident. However, the defendant presented evidence that the driver was not logged on to the DoorDash app at the time of the accident, and the plaintiff failed to present evidence to show that the driver was acting within the course and scope of his employment. The court sustained an objection to certain evidence offered by the plaintiff, and therefore granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
