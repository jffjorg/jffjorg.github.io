And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the Plaintiff's motion to continue the trial. The motion was filed on April 12, 2024, and the trial was originally set for May 24, 2024. The Judge declines to consider the untimely supplemental declaration filed by Plaintiff's counsel on April 29, 2024. The Judge finds good cause for a brief continuance of the trial to hear pending motions for sanctions. However, the Judge denies Plaintiff's other arguments for a longer continuance. The trial date is continued to a date in late June 2024, and the Final Status Conference is reset accordingly.
