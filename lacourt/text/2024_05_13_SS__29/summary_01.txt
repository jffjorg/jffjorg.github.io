And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant for subrogation and the two parties entered into a written stipulation for the entry of judgment. The stipulation required the defendant to pay $14,000, which was to be discharged upon payment. The defendant made partial payments, but stopped. The plaintiff argues that the defendant owes $6,500, including filing fees, service fees, and motion fees. The court finds that the parties entered into a valid agreement, that the court retains jurisdiction, and that there is a need to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant.
