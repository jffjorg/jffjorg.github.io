And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for leave to conduct a second physical examination of the plaintiff. The defendant had filed the motion on March 15, 2024, seeking to conduct a second physical examination of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had agreed to one physical examination by a spine specialist but refused to agree to a second physical examination by a foot specialist. The judge found that the defendant had not made a reasonable, good faith effort to resolve the issue before filing the motion, as evidenced by the defendant's demand for a second examination and the plaintiff's refusal to agree. The judge denied the motion without prejudice, indicating that the defendant may refile the motion if they can demonstrate good cause for the examination.
