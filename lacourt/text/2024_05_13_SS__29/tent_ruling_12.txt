 Case Number:  22STCV38747    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Demurrer filed by Defendant Oxford Center.
 
Tentative
The demurrer is sustained in part (with leave
to amend) and overruled in part.
Background
Plaintiff Jack Parker (“Plaintiff”) alleges
that on May 7, 2022, while he was a patron of the Potions and Poisons
nightclub, he was beaten by the club’s security personnel.
Plaintiff filed the complaint in this action on
December 13, 2022, against Potions & Poisons, Inc;, Oxford Center; Solomon
Kim; Sara H. Kim; and Does 1 to 50.  In
the complaint, he asserted a total of seven causes of action, four of which
(for negligence; negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; premises
liability; and false imprisonment) were asserted against Oxford Center.
On January 26, 2023, Potions & Poisons,
Inc., Solomon Kim, and Sara H. Kim filed an answer to the complaint.  
On March 20, 2023, Plaintiff amended his
complaint to name Joshua Marcus Wilson as Doe 1.
On May 12, 2023, Oxford Center, LLC
(erroneously sued as Oxford Center) (“Oxford”) filed an answer to the
complaint.
On February 15, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).  Plaintiff filed the FAC on February 20.  Based on a stipulation of the parties, the
Court granted Plaintiff leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), which
Plaintiff filed on March 15, 2024.
In the SAC, Plaintiff now asserts a total of
eight causes of action.  As is relevant to
the motion before the Court on May 13, three causes of action are asserted
against Oxford: negligence; premises liability; and negligent undertaking. 
On April 16, 2024, Oxford filed a demurrer to
the SAC.  Plaintiff filed his opposition
on April 30, and Oxford filed its reply on May 6.
Legal Standard
A demurrer is a pleading used to test the
legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact,
regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint,
answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the
function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and
for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Id.)  
A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at
p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (Ion
Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to
consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].)  
A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of
the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar
recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of the complaint” includes material
contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the
complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v.
Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and
accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the
pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]).  
A demurrer can be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) 
Preliminary Matter
The meet and confer requirement of Code of
Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), is satisfied.  (Norton Decl., ¶ 5.)
Discussion
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s causes of
action for negligence (Fourth Cause of Action), premises liability (Sixth Cause
of Action), and negligent undertaking (Eighth Cause of Action). 
Negligence and Premises Liability
The Court begins its analysis with a general discussion of the principles
of a property owner’s liability under theories of negligence and premises
liability. 
The basic elements of the causes of action for negligence and premises
liability are the same: (1) the existence of a legal duty; (2) breach of that
duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown v. USA
Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) 
The
general rule governing duty is set forth in Civil Code section 1714: “Everyone
is responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also
for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or
skill in the management of his or her property or person, except so far as the
latter has, willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon
himself or herself.” (Civ. Code, § 1714, subd. (a).) This establishes what the
California Supreme Court has described as the “default rule” that every person
has a legal duty “to exercise, in his or her activities, reasonable care for
the safety of others.” (Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 214.)
Those who own, possess, or control property generally have a duty to
exercise ordinary care in managing the property to avoid exposing others to an
unreasonable risk of harm. (Annocki¿v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 32, 37.)  In
general, a landowner is not liable for a dangerous condition on its property
unless the landowner had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous
condition.  (Ortega
v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205-1206.)
Courts in California have
developed special rules that apply where, as here, a plaintiff seeks to hold a
property owner/landlord liable for a dangerous condition on leased premises: 
“All
landowners, including landlords, must use reasonable care to protect people who
come onto their property. For landlords, reasonable care ordinarily involves
making sure the property is safe at the beginning of the tenancy, and repairing
any hazards the landlord learns about later. … Because a landlord has
relinquished possessory interest in the land, his or her duty of care to third
parties injured on the land is attenuated as compared with the tenant who
enjoys possession and control. Thus, before liability may be thrust on a
landlord for a third party’s injury due to a dangerous condition on the land,
the plaintiff must show that the landlord had actual knowledge of the dangerous
condition in question, plus the right and ability to cure the condition.” 
(Stone
v. Center Trust Retail Properties (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 608, 612
[citations omitted]; see also, e.g., Day v. Lupo Vine St., L.P. (2018)
22 Cal.App.5th 62, 69; Garcia v. Holt (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 600, 604
[referring to this principle as a “bright line” rule]; Salinas v. Martin (2008)
166 Cal.App.4th 404, 412 [same]; Uccello v. Laudenslayer (1975) 44
Cal.App.3d 504, 510 [“the public policy of this state generally has precluded a
landlord’s liability for injuries to his tenant or his tenant’s invitees from a
dangerous condition on the premises which comes into existence after the tenant
has taken possession”].)
Turning
to the SAC here, the Court faces an initial problem in its analysis.  On the face of the SAC, Plaintiff alleges
that Oxford is one of the entities and individuals within the definition of the
term “Defendants.”  (SAC, at p.
4:24-27.)  (This is in fact the first
page of the SAC, but it bears page number 4.) 
Plaintiff alleges that he was attacked by the employees of “Defendants”;
that “Defendants” hired these employees with either actual or constructive
knowledge of their violent tendencies; that “Defendants” knew or should have
known that the hiring of these employees subjected Plaintiff to an unreasonable
risk of harm; and that Plaintiff was injured when these employees acted on
their violent tendencies, causing harm to Plaintiff.  (SAC, ¶¶ 32-34.)  That is sufficient to plead a negligence
cause of action (Fourth Cause of Action) against the Defendants, including
Oxford.
In
the premises liability cause of action (Sixth Cause of Action), Plaintiff
incorporates the prior allegations and statements in the SAC, including the
negligence cause of action.  (Id.,
¶ 47.)  Plaintiff then alleges that “Defendants
… negligently exercised their retained control over safety conditions” on the
property through the negligent hiring of employees with violent tendencies,
subjecting Plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of harm and creating a dangerous
condition on the premises, causing harm to Plaintiff.  (Id., ¶¶ 49, 52, 55.)   That
is sufficient to plead a premises liability cause of action against the
Defendants, including Oxford.
In
its moving papers, Oxford states that during the meet-and-confer process, Plaintiff
agreed that in the Fourth Cause of Action (for negligence), Plaintiff would not
pursue a claim against Oxford based on negligent hiring or respondeat superior as
to the employees’ conduct.  (Mem., at p.
8:12-22.)  Apparently, there was no such
agreement, or at least no such express agreement, as to the Sixth Cause of
Action (for premises liability).  (Id.,
at p. 10:20-11:5.)
In
any event, the short answer is that the Court is reviewing the pleadings on
file, not the terms of an agreement reached by counsel.  If counsel reached an agreement to revise or withdraw
certain allegations, the proper course is to proceed through an amended
pleading, or at the very least a stipulated order.  
The
SAC that is on file with the Court states facts sufficient to constitute causes
of action for negligence and premises liability.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)  Whether some other pleading, with fewer or
different allegations, would or would not state facts sufficient to constitute
these causes of action is not before the Court.
The
demurrer to the Fourth and Sixth Causes of Action is overruled.
Negligent Undertaking
The
elements of a cause of action for negligent undertaking are: 
“(1) the
[defendant] undertook, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to
another; (2) the services rendered were of a kind the [defendant] should have recognized as necessary for the
protection of third persons; (3) the [defendant] failed to exercise
reasonable care in the performance of the undertaking; (4) the [defendant’s] failure
to exercise reasonable care resulted in physical harm to the third persons; and
(5) either (a) the [defendant’s] carelessness increased
the risk of such harm, or (b) the [defendant] undertook to perform a duty that
the other owed to the third persons, or (c) the harm was suffered because
either the other or the third persons relied on the [defendant’s] undertaking.” 
(Paz
v. State of California (2000) 22 Cal.4th 550, 559; see also, Artiglio v. Corning Inc. (1998) 18 Cal.4th 604, 612–613; CACI No. 450C.)
Here,
Plaintiff alleges that Oxford undertook in the lease agreement with its tenant,
Potions & Poisons, Inc., to require the tenant to carry liability insurance
of at least $2 million but then failed to enforce this provision in the
lease.  (SAC, ¶¶ 70.)  As a result, Plaintiff alleges, when he was
injured, there was no insurance available, and tenant lacked the financial
means to compensate Plaintiff for his injuries. 
(Id., ¶ 71.)
As
pleaded, the SAC does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action for negligent undertaking.  As to
the second element of the tort, an insurance policy, at least as a general
rule, is not purchased for the protection of third persons; rather, it protects
the covered parties from the financial consequences that they would otherwise
face (in the absence of coverage) for covered liabilities.  As to the fourth element, Oxford’s alleged
failure to enforce the insurance requirement in the lease did not result in
physical harm to Plaintiff.  Moreover, as
to the fifth element, the alleged failure to enforce the insurance requirement
in the lease did not increase the risk of physical harm to Plaintiff; the
insurance requirement was not the exercise of a duty that the tenant owed to
Plaintiff (i.e., tenant did not owe a duty to Plaintiff to carry insurance of
any particular type or in any particular amount); and there is no allegation
that Plaintiff relied on, or indeed had any knowledge of, the lease term prior
to the incident.
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the Eighth Cause of Action is sustained.  As this is the first challenge to this cause
of action, and given the liberal standard in the case law for leave to amend, the
Court will grant Plaintiff leave to amend.
Conclusion
The Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the Fourth
and Sixth Causes of Action.
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Eighth
Cause of Action.  
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff LEAVE TO AMEND
within 15 days of notice. 
Moving Party is to give notice.
