Trial filed by Defendant Larder Burton Way LLC.
Tentative
The Court will call this matter to discuss
scheduling with counsel.
The motions are granted in part and denied in
part.
Background
On December 16, 2020, Ryan Ristic (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“City”) and Larder Burton Way,
LLC (“Larder”) for premises liability and general negligence arising from a
trip and fall occurring on December 21, 2018, on the sidewalk in front of a
restaurant located on Burton Way in Los Angeles.
On September 16, 2022, Larder filed its
answer to the complaint.
On September 26, 2022, City filed an answer
to the complaint and a cross-complaint against Larder and Roes 1 through
20.  Larder filed its answer to the
cross-complaint on October 14, 2022.
On October 25, 2023, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name 8500 Burton Way, LLC (“8500 Burton”) as Doe 1. On December
27, 2023, 8500 Burton filed its answer to the complaint.
On April 5, 2024, City filed its
cross-complaint to name 8500 Burton as Roe 1.
There are two motions for summary judgment
pending.  On March 29, 2024, Larder filed
a motion for summary judgment as to the claims in Plaintiff’s complaint.  The motion is set for hearing on April 14,
2025.  On the same day, 8500 Burton filed
a motion for summary judgment as to the claims in Plaintiff’s complaint.  The motion is set for hearing on September
23, 2024.
The current trial date is July 15, 2024.
On April 10, 2024, 8500 Burton and Larder filed
separate motions to continue trial. 
Larder also filed a notice of joinder in 8500 Burton’s motion.  The hearings were initially set on different
days (May 2 and May 13).  The Court
continued the hearing on 8500 Burton’s motion so that both motions could be
heard together, on May 13.
Plaintiff filed oppositions to the two
motions on April 19 and 30.  8500 Burton
filed its reply on April 25, and Larder filed its reply on May 3.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are disfavored,
each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a continuance only on an
affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
8500 Burton and Larder
bring parallel motions to advance the hearing date on their motions for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, to continue trial.
The requests to
advance the hearing date on the summary judgment motions are denied.  The Court does not have available hearing
dates before trial that would satisfy the statutory notice requirements.
The requests to
continue trial are granted, for good cause shown.  8500 Burton and Larder have timely filed
their motions for summary judgment, and they are entitled to have those motions
heard before trial. 
The Court is
prepared to advance the hearing on Larder’s motion for summary judgment to
October 23, 2024.
If that date works
for the parties, the court is then prepared to grant the alternative relief
requested in the motions and continue the trial date to a date in late November
or early December 2024.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the Motions to Advance the
Motion for Summary Judgment Hearing Date.
The Court GRANTS the alternative relief
requested and CONTINUES the trial date to _______________.  The Final Status Conference is continued to
_______________.  All discovery deadlines
are reset based on the new trial date.
The hearing on the motion for summary
judgment filed by Larder Burton Way is advanced to
______________________.
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
