And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the motion to relieve Elina Shakhbazyan as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed by Shakhbazyan on April 12, 2024, but no opposition has been filed. The judge notes that the motion does not comply with the California Rules of Court, as it lacks the requisite forms and proof of service on the client and other parties. Additionally, the motion does not provide proper notice to the plaintiff. The judge concludes that the motion is denied without prejudice and orders the counsel to give notice to the plaintiff.
