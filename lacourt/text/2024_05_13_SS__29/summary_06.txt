```

And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel initial responses to the supplemental request for production is denied as moot, and the request for sanctions is denied. The Court finds that Defendant Guerra did not provide timely responses to the supplemental request for production, and therefore waived any objections. Although Defendant Guerra has now served initial responses to the supplemental request, the Court notes that the responses contain objections, which is improper. The Court also denies Plaintiffs' request for sanctions, citing the Civil Discovery Act, which authorizes sanctions against a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel.
