And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendants' motion to reopen discovery. The motion was filed by Jim K. Garcia and Ian "Juliana" McNeal Guevara, who seek to obtain Plaintiffs' complete medical records, depose Plaintiffs, and possibly depose Plaintiffs' medical providers. The Judge finds that there was a complete lack of diligence by the Defendants in conducting discovery prior to the discovery cutoff, and that they have failed to provide an adequate explanation for not seeking discovery earlier. The Judge also notes that the reopening of discovery may cause prejudice to the Plaintiffs and may interfere with the trial calendar. Therefore, the motion is denied.
