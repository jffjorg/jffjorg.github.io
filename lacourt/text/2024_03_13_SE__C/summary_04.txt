And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The proposed amended complaint deletes certain parties and allegations, and adds new allegations and causes of action for fraud and negligence. The plaintiff seeks to file the amended complaint after the parties negotiated an agreement to allow the sale of the subject property with the net proceeds held in escrow. The judge notes that courts have a strong policy of allowing motions for leave to amend, but may deny such motions if there is cognizable prejudice. In this case, the plaintiff has included a copy of the proposed amended pleading and has stated the reasons why the amendment is necessary and proper.
