9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Background
This is a Song-Beverly

Motor America. On October 11, 2023, plaintiff passed away, and his daughter
Elaine Kim seeks to substitute as plaintiff in this action. 
 
Legal
Standard

“A
cause of action that survives the death of the person entitled to commence an
action or proceeding passes to the decedent’s successor in interest . . . and
an action may be commenced by the decedent’s personal representatives or, if
none, by the decedent’s successor in interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
377.30.)  After the death of a plaintiff, the court, on motion, shall
allow a pending action that does not abate to be continued by the decedent’s
personal representative or successor-in-interest.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
377.31.) 
 
The
person who seeks to commence or continue a pending action as the decedent’s
successor-in-interest shall execute and file an affidavit or declaration
stating: (1) the decedent’s name, (2) the date and place of decedent’s death,
(3) “No proceeding is now pending in California for administration of the
decedent’s estate,” (4) a copy of the final order showing the distribution of
the decedent’s cause of action to the successor-in-interest, if the decedent’s
estate was administered, (5) either the affiant or declarant is the decedent’s
successor in interest or the affiant or declarant is authorized to act on
behalf of the decedent’s successor in interest, with facts in support thereof,
(6) “No other person has a superior right to commence the action or proceeding
or to be substituted for the decedent in the pending action or proceeding,” and
(7) the statements are true, under penalty of perjury.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 377.32.) 
 
Substitute
Plaintiff 
 
Elaine Kim
submitted a declaration, but it does not meet the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 377.32. Kim does not attest that no proceeding is pending in
California for administration of the decedent’s estate. 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion is continued to April 10, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C to
allow Elaine Kim an opportunity to submit an amended declaration.  Any amended declaration shall be filed and
served no later than April 3, 2024.
