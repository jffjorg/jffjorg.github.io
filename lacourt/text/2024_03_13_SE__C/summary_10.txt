Judge Alice J. Coleman has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Thor Motor Coach, Inc.'s motion to stay the action based on Code of Civil Procedure section 410.30. The court finds that the forum selection clause in the Thor Motor Coach Product Warranty Registration Form is enforceable, as defendant has a close relationship to the contractual transaction. The court also notes that the modern trend is to enforce mandatory forum selection clauses unless they are unfair or unreasonable. The stay is granted based on the interest of substantial justice, as the plaintiff would have to litigate in the state of Indiana, where the defendant has agreed to apply California law.
