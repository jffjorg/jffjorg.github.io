Blanca E. Ortiz seeks leave to file a first amended complaint. 
 
Leave to Amend
 
Courts have a strong policy of
allowing motions for leave to amend. “If the motion to amend is timely made and
the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error
to refuse permission to amend….” (Morgan v. Super. Ct. (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527.)  A court can deny leave
to amend after long, inexcusable delay, where there is cognizable prejudice,
such as discovery needed, trial delay, critical evidence lost, or added
preparation expense. (Solit v. Tokai Bank (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435,
1448.)
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1321(a) requires that a motion to
amend must “[i]nclude a copy of the proposed… amended pleading… [and] state
what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be [deleted and/or
added], if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the [deleted
and/or additional] allegations are located…” Also, California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1324(b) states: “[a] separate declaration must accompany the motion and
must specify: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is
necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.”
 
Plaintiff seeks leave to amend the complaint to make the following
changes: 
 
·       
Delete the following
parties: DAVID
ZEPEDA, as trustee of the PETER MOORE, SANDRA MOORE, TOM CHASE, MICHELL CHASE,
ROBERT MANN, JANIS MANN, FRAN GILBERT, FRANCE GUSTON, EVAN PATCH, JUAN GALYON,
PATTY GALYON, KAY PATCH TRUST, a business entity form unknown; ALL PERSONS
UNKNOWN, CLAIMING ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE RIGHT, TITLE, EST ATE, LIEN OR
INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY DESCRIBED IN THE COMPLAINT ADVERSE TO PLAINTIFF'S
TITLE,OR ANY CLOUD UPON PLAINTIFF'S TITLE THERETO, an individual. (Complaint
page 2, lines 3-16.)
·       
Add the following party: EMIDT FREDDY ROJO. (First
Amended Complaint page 1, lines 26-28.) 
·       
Delete
the following allegations: the introductory allegations concerning a gift quit
claim and intent to sell the property (Comp. 4:2-7); the first and second
causes of action for Quiet Title and Cancellation of Instrument (Comp, 4:8-5:12);
and the focus of the third cause of action for Declaratory Relief relating to
the cancellation voiding of the forged quit claim deed and a gift quit claim
deed (Comp. 5:23-25).
·       
Add
the following allegations: introductory allegations concerning Rojo's
involvement as the notary public and the agreement between the parties to allow
the sale of the subject property with the net proceeds being held in escrow (FAC
3:13-24); two new causes of action for fraud and negligence (FAC 4:1-5:26); a
request for a declaration concerning the parties rights to the money in the
escrow account in the third cause of action (FAC 6:10-13); claims for general
damages in excess of $100,000, emotional distress, and punitive damages, along
with a declaration of the parties' rights to the money in escrow in the prayer
(FAC 6:17-20, 25-27).
 
Plaintiff has included a copy of the proposed amended pleading. (Decl.
Sienski, ¶ 5, Ex. 1.) 
 
Counsel for Plaintiff states that after the complaint was filed, the
parties negotiated an agreement that allowed for the sale of the subject property
to close and the net proceeds to be deposited in an escrow account. (Decl.
Sienski, ¶ 3.) As a result, the focus of the lawsuit changed from ownership of
the property to damages. (Decl. Sienski, ¶ 3.) Counsel further states that the
amended complaint deletes the causes of action for quiet title and cancellation
of instrument and adds the causes of action for negligence and fraud. (Decl.
Sienski, ¶ 3.) 
 
Based on the above, the Court grants leave to file a first amended
complaint.
