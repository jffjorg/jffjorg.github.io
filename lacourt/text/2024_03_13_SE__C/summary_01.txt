And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant and cross-complainant, Tesus, Inc., is entitled to recover attorney fees in the amount of $36,840.00 from the plaintiff, LBA RV-Company XVIII, LP. The ruling is based on the lodestar method, which considers the reasonable rate for comparable services in the local community and the reasonable number of hours spent on the case. The judge found that the hourly rate of $300.00 per hour, charged by counsel David M. Lawrence, is reasonable. The court also removed two erroneous entries from the award, which reduced the total amount of attorney fees from $36,946.00 to $36,840.00. The judge concluded that the hours incurred by counsel were reasonable and awarded the prevailing party the amount of attorney fees requested.
