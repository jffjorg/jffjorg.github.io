TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant and Cross-Complainant
Tesus, Inc.’s motion for attorney fees against LBA RV-Company XVIII, LP is
granted in part. Defendant is entitled to $36,840.00 in attorney fees. 
 
Moving Party to give
NOTICE.
 
 
This is a breach of contract
action. Defendant and Cross-Complainant seeks to recover attorney fees in the
amount of $36,946.00 for 123.2 hours of legal work.
 
Prevailing Party
 
In
a contract action, the prevailing party is the party who recovered greater
relief in an action “on the contract.” (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (b)(1).)

 
In
the present case, there is no dispute that Defendant and Cross-Complainant is
the prevailing party in the action and is entitled to attorney fees. Thus, the
only question to be determined by this motion is the amount of the award.
 
Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees
 
Civil
Code section 1717, subdivision (a) states that in a contract action, where the
contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs incurred to
enforce that contract shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing
on the contract shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to
other costs. 
 
Lodestar
is the objective starting point to determine if attorney’s fees are reasonable.
(Nichols v. City of Taft (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1242.) Lodestar is
calculated by using the reasonable rate for comparable services in the local
community, multiplied by the reasonable number of hours spent on the case. (Ibid.)
Lodestar requires the court to determine the reasonable number of hours
expended for the work performed. (Concepcion v. Amscan Holdings, Inc.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1320.) 
 
Here, Defendant and
Cross-Complainant seeks to recover attorney fees in the amount of $36,946.00 for
123.2 hours of legal work, with attorney David
M. Lawrence billing at $300.00 per hour. (Decl. Lawrence, ¶¶ 6, 7.) 
 
Counsel’s
Hourly Rates
 
When determining a reasonable
hourly rate, courts consider whether the stated rates “are within the range of
reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded to comparable attorneys for
comparable work.” (Children’s Hosp. & Med. Center v. Bonta (2002) 97
Cal.App.4th 740, 783.) 
 
Defendant and Cross-Complainant’s
counsel states that his rate of $300.00 per hour is “more than reasonable” in
the Southern California area for an attorney of his experience in this type of
case. (Dec. Lawrence, ¶ 6.) 
 
Applying its knowledge of the
case, the Court finds Defendant and Cross-Complainant’s hourly rate to be
reasonable.  
 
          Time Expended
 
Defendant and Cross-Complainant seeks
to recover attorney fees in the amount of $36,946.00 for 123.2 hours of legal
work. Defendant and Cross-Complainant’s Counsel submits an itemized list of
time entries detailing the legal work on this matter. (Decl. Lawrence, ¶ 7, Ex.
9.) 
 
The
moving party also bears the burden of establishing entitlement to an award and
documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. (Christian Research. Inst. v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) This burden
requires competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services
rendered. (Martino v. Denevi
(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) “Testimony of an attorney as to the number of
hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of
attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” (Ibid.)
 
The
Court applies its knowledge of the case and concludes that the hours incurred
are reasonable. This is not the inquiry of an auditor, but like a review by a
knowledgeable general counsel. (See, e.g., Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32
Cal.3d 621, 642 (trial court should not “become enmeshed in a meticulous analysis of every
detailed facet of the professional representation”); Alan S. v. Super.
Ct. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 238, 254 (trial court “should try to
get the ‘big picture’ of the case” (Family Law attorney fees procedure).) However,
the Court removes from the award work performed by “KAP” on November 11, 2021,
and “JMS” on July 15, 2022. These entries appear to be erroneously included. 
 
Thus, the Court awards 122.8
hours of attorney work at $300.00 per hour for a total of $36,840.00 in
attorney fees.
