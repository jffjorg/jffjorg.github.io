Legal
Standard

A
deposition subpoena for business records directs a nonparty's “custodian of
records” to deliver a copy of the requested documents to a “deposition officer”
or to make the original documents available to the subpoenaing party for
inspection and copying. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2020.410, subd. (c); 2020.430,
subd. (a)-(e).) 
If
a deponent does not produce a requested document under his or her control, the
subpoenaing party may bring a motion to compel production “no later than 60
days after the completion of the record of the deposition.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (b).) (Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 123, 127.) The objections or other responses to a business records
subpoena are the “deposition record” for purposes of measuring the 60-day
period for a motion to compel. (Id. at 132-133.)
Meet
and Confer
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.480, subd. (b).) 
 
As part of discovery, on January
3, 2024, Plaintiffs
issued a subpoena to Huntington Park Police Department, requesting the
following: “The full underacted investigative report related to crimes against
John G.Z. Doe #1 (aka Gerardo Zatarian; DOB 7/23/1971) and John R.Z. Doe #2
(aka Rodolfo Zatarian; DOB 4/19/1970) perpetrated by JESUS ERIBERTO GARCIA
including but not limited to the complete incident report, any and all
supplemental reports, narratives, statements, transcripts, interview notes,
color photographs, audio or video recordings, electronic data or media files,
etc.” (Decl. Shukry, ¶ 2, Ex. 1.) On January 17, 2024, Huntington Park City
Attorney served an objection to the subpoena. (Decl. Shukry, ¶ 3, Ex. 2.) On
February 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion. There is no opposition
motion. 
 
No meet and confer
declaration accompanied this motion. 
 
Thus, Plaintiffs’
motion to compel compliance is CONTINUED until Wednesday, May 15, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
in Dept. SE-C. The parties are ordered to meet and confer and Plaintiff is
ordered to file a meet and confer declaration pursuant to CCP § 2025.489, subd.
(b).  If, after meeting and conferring,
court intervention is needed, then opposition and reply briefs may be filed and
served per Code in compliance with the new hearing date.
