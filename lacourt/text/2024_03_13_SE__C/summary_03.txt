And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sandoval v. Sandoval, case number 22NWCV00413. The plaintiff, Martha Sandoval, has applied for an order to appoint a successor in interest, but the judge has denied this application without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can reapply at a later time. The judge has also set this application for a hearing on May 9, 2024, and ordered the parties to file and serve supplemental opposition and reply briefs in accordance with the California Code of Civil Procedure.

The judge has also advanced and continued several other motions, including the Cross-Defendant's demurrer, which is now set for hearing on May 28, 2024. The plaintiff's motions for issuance of a writ of attachment and for a protective order against subpoenas issued to Gloria Sandoval and Leticia Pannell have also been advanced and continued, with hearings set for May 30, 2024, and May 29, 2024, respectively.

The judge's ruling does not establish any new facts or agreements, but rather sets the stage for further proceedings in the case. The parties are ordered to give notice of the judge's ruling.
