And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Martinez's motion to compel Defendant FCA US LLC's further responses to special interrogatories and document requests. The judge found that the motions were untimely, as they were filed on September 15, 2023, past the agreed deadline of August 24, 2023. The judge noted that the 45-day deadline to bring a motion to compel is mandatory and jurisdictional, and failure to timely move to compel constitutes a waiver of any right to compel a further response. The judge also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions.
