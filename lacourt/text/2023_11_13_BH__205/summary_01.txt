And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the request for default judgment filed by Michelman & Robinson LLP against Jeremy Byk. The dispute is a breach of contract case, where the Plaintiff entered into an agreement with the Defendant to provide legal services, but the Defendant defaulted by failing to pay fees due under the agreement. The Plaintiff filed a Complaint and served the Defendant by publication, but the Defendant did not respond, and default was entered. The Plaintiff then requested a default judgment, but the Court denied it due to a discrepancy in the amounts owing under the agreement. The Court has not made a ruling on the merits of the case, but rather has denied the request for default judgment based on the lack of clarity regarding the amounts owing.
