significant statements:
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.

(Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390)
  - "Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders." (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390)
