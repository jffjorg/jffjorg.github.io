Significant Statements:
  - "The Court of Appeal in Morgan v. Superior Court held 'If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion.'"
  - "Punitive damages may be imposed where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice."
  - "A corporation is not liable for punitive damages solely because an employee was negligent or reckless, but rather because of the malice of the corporation's officers, directors, or managing agents."
  - "To establish that an individual is a managing agent, a plaintiff seeking punitive damages must show that 'the employee exercised substantial discretionary authority over significant aspects of a corporation's business.'"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend his complaint to add a claim for punitive damages. The proposed amended complaint does not allege a corporate employee who has substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy. Additionally, the evidence received in discovery does not meet the requirements for punitive damages under California law. The judge has determined that the proposed amended complaint is not timely and properly noticed, and that Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support a claim for punitive damages.
