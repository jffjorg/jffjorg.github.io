And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the motion to have Requests for Admissions, Set One Deemed Admitted and the motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, which were originally set for November 8, 2023 and December 6, 2023, respectively, to January 18, 2024. This decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff has failed to respond to the requests for admissions and has claimed to be incapacitated and in need of a guardian ad litem. The judge has also noted that the defendants have requested monetary sanctions for the plaintiff's failure to respond. The judge has given the parties an opportunity to meet and confer to determine if a resolution can be reached, and has requested that the parties email the court if they intend to submit on the tentative ruling.
