And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Long Beach Public Transportation Company, moves to have Request for Admissions, Set One deemed admitted. The defendant asserts that it served the request on September 28, 2022, and that the plaintiff, Juana Sandoval, did not respond timely. The plaintiff's counsel declares that he served verified responses to the requests on October 30, 2023. The court finds that the motion is moot since the plaintiff has served verified responses and denies the motion. The defendant requests monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel of record in the amount of $1,250, but the court reduces this amount to $500 due to the type of motion and the fact that counsel can appear remotely at the hearing. The court grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $500.
