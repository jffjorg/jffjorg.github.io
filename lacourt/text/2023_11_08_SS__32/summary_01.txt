Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement brought by Cross-Defendant Veronica Soto. The motion seeks to determine whether the settlement agreement between Soto and Cross-Complainants Natalie Bebejian and Shant Bebejian, for $10,000, was entered into in good faith. The court has found that Soto has satisfied her burden of proof that the settlement was entered into in good faith. The settlement appears to be a rough approximate of Soto's liability and Cross-Complainant's recovery, and it arose out of private mediation between the drivers. The court notes that the settlement does not appear to be collusive or fraudulent, and that the remaining claim on the cross-complaint is against City of Los Angeles. Therefore, the court grants the motion and finds that the settlement was entered into in good faith.
