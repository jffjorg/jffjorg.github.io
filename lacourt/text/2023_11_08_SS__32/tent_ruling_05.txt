CASE NUMBER:


21STCV31895




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendants Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company of
  Los Angeles, LLC and Ean Holdings, LLC 




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendants Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company of Los Angeles, LLC and Ean
Holdings, LLC (Defendants) move for terminating sanctions against Plaintiffs
Nahla Alicia Kandah and Alaa Kandah (Plaintiffs) for failing to comply with
discovery orders.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
If a person is engaging in misuse of the discovery process, the Court
may issue a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of
any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
(2) An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order
for discovery is obeyed.
(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party.
(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 (d).) 
 
“Misuse of the discovery process” includes: “(d) Failing to respond or to submit
to an authorized method of discovery . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to
provide discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010.)  
 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225,
1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra,
77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622
[terminating sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and
subsequently granting default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with
one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins.
Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia
v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions
imposed against the plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and
for violating various discovery statutes].) 

 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have not complied with three
discovery orders from the Court. 
 
On May 25, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel
further Plaintiffs’ responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One and Requests
for Admissions, Set One. (Min. Order, 5/25/23.) Notice was served on
Plaintiffs.[1] On June
21, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One. (Min. Order, 6/21/23.) Notice was served on
Plaintiffs.[2] Lastly,
on June 22, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiffs’
responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One. (Min. Order, 6/22/23.) Notice
was served on Plaintiffs.[3] According
to Defendants, as of the filing of this motion, no responses complying with any
of the Court’s orders have been served. (Miller Decl. ¶ 8, 12, 16.)
 
No opposition has been filed. Given the history of discovery abuse by
Plaintiffs, the Court grants the motion for terminating sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Defendants’ motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. The
complaint as to Defendants Enterprise Rent A Car and EAN Holdings, Inc. is
dismissed with prejudice.
 
Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
