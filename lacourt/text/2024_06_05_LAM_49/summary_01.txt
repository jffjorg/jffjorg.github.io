Summary in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of CIC Inc. v. Prestige Default Services, LLC, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff alleged that it submitted the highest bid for a residential property at a trustee's sale, but the defendant rejected the bid in violation of California Civil Code § 2924m. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff was not a third-party beneficiary of the deed of trust. The court agrees with the defendant's argument, finding that the parties did not intend to benefit the plaintiff. As a result, the court sustains the defendant's demurrer and denies the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint. A judgment for dismissal with prejudice will be entered.
