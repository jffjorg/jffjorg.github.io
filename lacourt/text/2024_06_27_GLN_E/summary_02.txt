And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses filed by Plaintiff Gevork Adjemian against Defendant BMW North America, LLC. The Plaintiff filed three motions to compel further responses, but only one motion was placed on the calendar, using the same Reservation ID for all three motions. The Judge finds this improper and orders the Plaintiff to pay additional filing fees if it wants its two motions heard. The Judge also denies the two motions to compel further responses as moot, as Defendant has provided supplemental responses. The Judge will hear from the parties on the issue of sanctions.
