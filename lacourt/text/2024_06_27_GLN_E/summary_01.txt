```

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies Defendant Francisco Javier Marquez's motion to strike the First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging punitive damages. The FAC alleges that Defendant's conduct was reckless and wanton, and that he was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of driving the vehicle but failed to avoid those consequences. The court finds that Plaintiff has made sufficient allegations for a jury to potentially find that Defendant acted with malice or "with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." The court also rejects Defendant's arguments that the FAC fails to state sufficient facts to sustain a claim for punitive damages.
