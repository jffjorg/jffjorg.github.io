And here is the English-text summary:

This is a legal malpractice case. The plaintiff retained the defendant to represent her in a wrongful death lawsuit stemming from a bus accident involving her mother and 12 other passengers. The defendant demurred to the second and third causes of action, and the court has issued a tentative ruling on the matter.

The court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend as to the third cause of action, which alleges a breach of contract. The court finds that the breach of contract claim is insufficiently pled and must be amended.

The court overrules the demurrer as to the second cause of action, which alleges a breach of fiduciary duty. The court finds that the breach of fiduciary duty claim is not duplicative of the legal malpractice claim and is sufficient to state a claim.

The plaintiff has until January 8, 2024, to amend the complaint.
