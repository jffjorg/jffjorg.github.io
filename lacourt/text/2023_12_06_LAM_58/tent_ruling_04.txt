 
            This is a
legal malpractice case. In May 2017, Plaintiff retained Defendant Brenton
Horner (Defendant) to represent her in filing a wrongful death lawsuit stemming
from a bus accident involving Plaintiff’s mother Yolanda Reyes Mendoza
(Decedent) and twelve other passengers. The Complaint alleges causes of action
for (1.) negligence, (2.) breach of fiduciary duty, and (3.) breach of
contract. 
 
On October 24, 2023, Defendant demurred
to the second and third causes of action in the Complaint. Plaintiff filed an
opposition to the demurrer. 
 
            The Court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend as to the third
cause of action, and overrules as to the second cause of action. 
 
Legal Standard for
Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v.
Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally
construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been
stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Second
Cause of Action – Breach of Fiduciary Duties
 
            Defendant argues
that the breach of fiduciary duty claim is duplicative of the legal malpractice
claim, and that Plaintiff has failed to allege a breach of loyalty or confidentiality.
 
 
            First, the
Court the claims are not duplicative. 
 
 A breach of fiduciary duty is a tort claim
entirely distinct from a malpractice claim based on professional negligence. (Stanley
v. Richmond (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1086; Barbara A. v. John G.
(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 369, 382-383.) “The elements of a cause of action for
breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of a fiduciary relationship, breach
of fiduciary duty, and damages. [Citation.]” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v.
Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 820–821.) To state a cause of action for legal
malpractice, “a plaintiff must plead ‘(1) the duty of the attorney to use such
skill, prudence, and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal
connection between the breach and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or
damage resulting from the attorney's negligence.’ ” (Charnay v. Cobert
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 179.)
 
Preliminarily,
there is a split of authority whether a demurrer may be sustained on the ground
that a cause of action is duplicative. (Compare Palm Springs Villas II
Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290 [demurrer
properly sustained on ground that cause of action was duplicative] with Blickman
Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 890 [whether
a cause of action is duplicative “is not a ground on which a demurrer may be
sustained”].) 
 
Moreover, no
California court has explicitly held that a breach of fiduciary duty claim
cannot merely duplicate a claim for professional negligence. (See Buehler v.
Sbardellati (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1527, 1544, fn. 9 [noting “there is
authority for the view the breach of fiduciary duty theory is separate from the
professional negligence theory” but “leav[ing] any resolution of this separate
cause of action question to another case”].)
 
Here, although the negligence claim
and breach of fiduciary duty claim are predicated on the same facts, the two
claims involve different elements. That is, the same facts have resulted in
different breaches. (Compare Compl., ¶ 28 with ¶ 33.) Thus, at
this demurrer stage, the Court declines to find the claims are duplicative as
matter of law. 
 
Second, the
Complaint alleges that Defendant breached duties of loyalty and confidentiality.

 
Defendant quotes
from Pierce
v. Lyman
(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1102, regarding the duty owed by attorney to client:
 “The basic fiduciary obligations are
twofold: undivided loyalty and confidentiality. Although the phrasing ... is
varied and often dependent upon the context of particular circumstances, this
rule exists in every jurisdiction in the United States.” 
 
            As
argued in the opposition, “[t]he scope of an
attorney’s fiduciary duty may be determined as a matter of law based on the
Rules of Professional Conduct which, ‘together with statutes and general principles
relating to other fiduciary relationships, all help define the duty component
of the fiduciary duty which an attorney owes to his [or her] client.’” (Stanley
v. Richmond (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1086.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff alleges Defendant never filed a lawsuit on
her behalf and, instead, filed a wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of
Plaintiff’s step-father. (Compl., ¶ 8.) After Plaintiff’s step-father died,
Defendant advised Plaintiff to sign a declaration to become the successor in
interest to her step-father’s claims, and she did so. (Compl., ¶ 10.) In
advising Plaintiff to sign the declaration, Defendant misled Plaintiff into
thinking that Defendant was helping her become the successor in interest to her
step-father’s claims. (Compl., ¶ 21.) However, unbeknownst to Plaintiff,
Defendant never filed this declaration, and Defendant did not assert any claims
on Plaintiff’s behalf in the step-father’s wrongful death lawsuit or in any
other lawsuit. (Compl., ¶ 12.) Instead, Defendant settled the step-father’s
wrongful death lawsuit without Plaintiff’s input or consent and notified her
that a purported settlement check in the amount of $39,400.00 was available for
her. (Compl., ¶ 15.) Plaintiff alleges that if Defendant had asserted wrongful
death claims on Plaintiff’s behalf and assisted Plaintiff in becoming the
successor in interest to her step-father’s claims, Plaintiff would have
received more than the $39,400.00 purported settlement. (Compl., ¶ 22.)
 
            Plaintiff
contends these allegations show Defendant violated the
Rules of Professional Conduct, including: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2
(Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority); Rule 1.3 (Diligence);
Rule 1.4 (Communication with Clients); Rule 1.7 (Conflict of Interest: Current
Clients); Rule 2.1 (Advisor); and Rule 8.4 (Misconduct).
 
            These allegations are sufficient to
state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. The demurrer to the second
cause of action is overruled. 
 
Third
Cause of Action – Breach of Contract
 
            Defendant
demurs to this cause of action on the grounds Plaintiff has not alleged the
terms of the agreement, the parties to the agreement, or even whether it was
written or oral. 
 
            To state a
claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must allege “(1) the contract, (2)
plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach,
and (4) the resulting damages to plaintiff.” (Careau & Co. v. Security
Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1388.)
 
            Plaintiff alleges
the existence of a contract in the form of the retainer agreement, and that she
performed all of her nonexcused obligations. However, as argued by the
demurrer, it is not clear what specific terms of the contract Defendant has breached.
Moreover, although the opposition contends the contract is written, this
allegation is not contained within the Complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subd. (g).) 
 
            Accordingly,
the breach of contract claim is insufficiently pled. The demurrer to the third
cause of action is sustained with leave to amend.  
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer is overruled to the
second cause of action and sustained as to the third cause of action. Plaintiff
shall have leave to amend. The amended complaint shall be served and filed on
or before January 8, 2024.
