And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lucia Reyes v. Garrett Scalfani, overruling the defendant's demurrer and allowing the complaint to proceed. The defendant argued that the plaintiff lacks the capacity to sue and that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge found that the plaintiff is the owner of the premises, as evidenced by a signed lease/rental agreement, and that the complaint adequately states the nature of the agreement between the parties. The Judge also noted that the defendant failed to meet and confer with the plaintiff as required by law and did not provide any evidence or other extrinsic matters to support his claims.
