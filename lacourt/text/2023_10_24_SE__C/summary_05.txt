And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant, Tina Rike, was aware that the dog had previously bitten other people and had a propensity to engage in harmful behavior prior to the incident. However, the judge found that these factual allegations were not made in the "four corners" of the complaint and were not judicially noticed by the court. Therefore, they cannot support a request for punitive damages at this stage of the proceedings. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies.
