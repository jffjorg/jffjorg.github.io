Defendants’ motion for terminating sanctions and monetary
sanctions:
 
          Legal
Standard
 
If
anyone engages in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process, the court
may impose monetary sanction, issue sanction, evidence sanction, terminating sanction,
and contempt sanction. (CCP § 2023.030.) The sanctions the court may impose are
such as are suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to
obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks, but the court may not impose
sanctions which are designed not to accomplish the objects of discovery but to
impose punishment. (Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 487.)  A prerequisite to
the imposition of the dismissal sanction is that the party has willfully failed
to comply with a court order. (Ibid.) Terminating sanctions should only
be ordered when there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and
it appears a less severe sanction would not be effective. (Link v. Cater
(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1326.) A terminating sanction issued solely because
of a failure to pay a monetary sanction is never justified. (Newland v.
Sup.Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615.)
 
 
          Discussion
 
Here, Defendants move for terminating sanctions against
Plaintiff for failing to comply with the Court’s January 26, 2023 and January
31, 2023 orders. Specifically, this Court ordered Plaintiff to provide verified
responses, without objection, to Defendants’ Request for Production of
Documents (Set One) within 10 days of the order and pay monetary sanctions in
the amount of $410.00 within 30 days of the order. (Min. Order. 1/26/23.) This
Court also ordered the Requests for Admission (Set One) admitted and Plaintiff
was ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $410.00. (Id.) Furthermore,
this Court ordered Plaintiff to provide responses, without objection, to
Defendants’ Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 20
days, and pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500.00 within 30 days of
the order. (Min. Order 1/31/23.) 
 
Defendants also requests default judgment against Plaintiff,
dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint, and an award of attorney’s fees in the
amount of $2,250.00. 
 
On August 18, 2022, Defendants served Plaintiff with their
first set of discovery requests via mail and electronic mail. (Chappars Decl.,
¶ 5.) Defendants state that on September 22, 2022, they emailed and mailed a
letter to Plaintiff regarding the late discovery responses. (Id. at ¶
6.) Defendants filed the aforementioned discovery motions that were granted by
the Court. (Id. at ¶ 9.) Defendants indicate that Plaintiff still has
not provided the responses and trial is currently set for January 16, 2024. (Id.
at ¶ 10.)
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted
because Plaintiff has failed to respond to Defendants’ Request for Production
of Documents (Set One), Form Interrogatories, and Special Interrogatories (Set
One). Also, this Court already imposed monetary sanctions in this case in the
total amount of $2,320.00 and Plaintiff has failed to comply with such order. It
appears imposing new monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,250.00 against
Plaintiff would not produce compliance.  Plaintiff
filed no opposition to the motions to compel and the motion for terminating
sanctions.  It is clear that Plaintiff is
disinterested in prosecuting this case. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant MARINA FRIAS and SERGIO MENDOZA’s
motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. 
 
Defendant MARINA FRIAS and SERGIO MENDOZA’s request for
monetary sanctions is DENIED. 
 
The Court dismisses Plaintiff J CRUZ ZAVALA’s complaint
against Defendants MARINA FRIAS and SERGIO MENDOZA with prejudice.
