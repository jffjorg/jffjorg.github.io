And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the dispute between WMB Group LLC (Plaintiff) and Excellence Platinum Real Estate (Defendant) regarding a rent payment dispute. The Plaintiff filed a complaint against the Defendant, alleging unlawful detainer, and the Defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that the notice was fatally defective and that the Plaintiff failed to state a cause of action.

The judge found that the Defendant's demurrer was not properly supported by a declaration stating that a good faith attempt to meet and confer was made, as required by Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a). Furthermore, the judge determined that the notice did not explicitly state "...excluding Saturdays and Sundays and other judicial holidays..." as required by CCP § 1161(2), but noted that the notice does include all other required information and that the Defendant was given the statutorily authorized amount of time within which to pay the past-due balance.

Based on these findings, the judge overruled the Defendant's demurrer, allowing the Plaintiff's complaint to proceed.
