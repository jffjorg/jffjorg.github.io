And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Plaintiff ADRIANA CORTES TECANHUEHUE's motion to compel responses to written discovery as moot, as Defendants H-T GENERAL ENGINEERING, INC., FELIX MADARIAGA, JESUS BLANQUEL, and MIGUEL AGUIRRE have already served verified responses to the discovery. The court has awarded sanctions in the amount of $1500.00 to Plaintiff, finding that Defendants acted without substantial justification in failing to respond to the discovery in a timely manner.
