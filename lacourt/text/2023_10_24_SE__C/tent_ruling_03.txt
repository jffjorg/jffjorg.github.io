TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff ADRIANA CORTES TECANHUEHUE’s motion to compel
responses to written discovery for form interrogatories, requests for
admission, and requests for production of documents is DENIED as MOOT.  The court awards sanctions in the amount of
$1500.00.  
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
This breach of contract action was filed by Plaintiff
ADRIANA CORTES TECANHUEHUE (Plaintiff) on May 2, 2022. Plaintiff’s operative
first amended complaint (FAC) was filed on August 19, 2022 and asserts the
following causes of action: (1) breach of written contract; (2) disgorgement;
(3) negligence; (4) fraud; and (5) declaratory relief.
 
Plaintiff moves for an order compelling responses to written
discovery. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to written
discovery:
 
          Legal
Standard
 
A responding party
has 30 days after service of interrogatories and an inspection demand to serve
their responses on the propounding party and/or party making the demand. (CCP
§§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a).) However, if interrogatories and inspection demand
are served by electronic service, a responding party has an additional 2 court
days to respond. (CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B).)
 
If the responding
party fails to timely respond to the interrogatories, “The party to whom the
interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).” (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
 
If a responding
party fails to timely respond to the inspection demand, “The party to whom a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).” (CCP §
2031.300.)
 
Furthermore, the
party propounding the interrogatories and/or making the demand may move for an
order compelling response to the interrogatories and inspection demand. (CCP §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b).) And “Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a
motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the
propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it
satisfied a ‘meet and confer’ requirement.” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) 
 
          Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff moves for an order compelling Defendants H-T
GENERAL ENGINEERING, INC., FELIX MADARIAGA, JESUS BLANQUEL, and MIGUEL AGUIRRE
(Defendants) to respond to Form Interrogatories (FROGS), Requests for Admission
(RFAs), and Requests for Production of Documents (RPDs). 
 
Plaintiff served FROGS, RFAs, and RPDs on Defendants on
April 20, 2023. (Peto Decl., ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff
filed this motion to compel responses on June 1, 2023.  Defendants contend they were without legal
representation as of February 2023.  Defendant
Madariaga retained legal counsel in June and the remaining defendants retained
legal counsel in August. (Danielle Joseph Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) On October 10, 2023, Defendants’ counsel discovered that
Plaintiff had filed a motion to compel responses.  Defendants served Plaintiff with written
discovery responses on October 13, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 14.)  
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel discovery is now moot because
Defendants served verified responses to the discovery before the hearing.  
 
Requests for Sanctions
 
When a request for
monetary sanctions is concurrently filed with a motion to compel responses,
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(a).) Additionally, “If
a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court
shall impose that sanction unless it finds that one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of sanction unjust.” (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff’s counsel
requests sanctions in the amount of $2000.00 based upon an hourly rate of $475.00,
two hours for drafting the motion, two hours for drafting a reply, two hours
for preparing for the hearing and costs. 
The court notes that no Reply was filed. 
Sanctions are imposed upon Defendants, jointly and severally, in the
reasonable sum of $1500.00.
