English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the defendants' unopposed motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff failed to comply with discovery orders and failed to pay monetary sanctions, despite being ordered to do so. The defendants had requested terminating sanctions, an award of $2,250.00 in attorney's fees, and default judgment against the plaintiff. The Judge finds that the plaintiff is disinterested in prosecuting the case and that terminating sanctions are warranted.
