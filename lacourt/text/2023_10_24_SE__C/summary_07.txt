```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the Demurrer to the Plaintiff's Complaint and the Motion to Strike. The Demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is overruled, as the Complaint sufficiently alleges a breach of fiduciary duty by the Defendants. The Demurrer to the third cause of action for misrepresentation is sustained, as the Complaint fails to allege facts demonstrating that the Defendant knew her statements were false at the time she made them. The Motion to Strike is granted, as the alleged facts do not support conclusions of malice, fraud, or oppression. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff failed to comply with the meet and confer requirements before filing the Demurrer, but will not consider this non-compliance as grounds to overrule or sustain the Demurrer. The judge has given the Parties 30 days to amend their pleadings.
