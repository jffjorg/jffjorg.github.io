And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling for a court hearing scheduled for July 5, 2024. The trial is expected to end on July 10, 2024, and the judge proposes continuing the trial date to July 15, 2024, as there are no trials set to begin on July 8, 2024. On July 15, 2024, the court will likely not call for a jury, but instead address remaining issues concerning in limine motions and 402 hearings regarding expert testimony and theories of damages. The judge requests that the parties provide a joint list of issues to be decided, with a deadline of July 10, 2024. If the remaining issues are resolved, the court may not start the voir dire process until July 22, 2024, as a significant case set for trial on that day is likely to take precedence.
