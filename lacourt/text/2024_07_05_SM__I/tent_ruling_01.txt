  Case Number:  19SMCV01008    Hearing Date:   July 5, 2024    Dept:  I The court is still in trial, but the trial is expected to
end on July 10, 2024 (in the sense that it will go to the jury that day).  The court would therefore suggest that the
trial date be continued to July 15, 2024, which is the following Monday.  The court has no trials set to begin on July
8, so the court will not be in an active trial on that date.
 
On July 15, 2024, there are currently three matters set for
trial.  The court has a high degree of
confidence that two will not go.  The
other one is a three day bench trial, so it might go first.  
 
The court anticipates that on July 15, 2024, the court will
not actually call for a jury, but rather will take up the remaining issues
before it concerning the various in limine motions and 402 hearings
regarding the experts and what theories of damages can and cannot go to the
jury.  The court would request that the
parties provide to the court a joint list of issues that need to be decided.  If only one side believes there is an issue,
it can be so designated, however, if either party believes it is an issue,
then it ought to be on the list.  It
would be nice if it were filed no later than July 10, 2024.  The court will likely hear the bench trial in
the afternoons, so the hearings in this case would start at 10:30.  The court hopes to have some real time during
the week of July 15, 2024, to devote to resolving the remaining issues.
 
If that is the case, then realistically the court will not
start the voir dire process until July 22, 2024.  The court has one very significant case that
is set for trial that day, and it is also running on the five year
statute.  (Indeed, it is even older than
this one).  Even so, the court is likely
to trail that case to follow this one, as it, too, is likely to go long,
although that is not a guarantee.
