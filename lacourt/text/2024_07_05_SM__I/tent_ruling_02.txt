 Case Number:  23SMCV00120    Hearing Date:   July 5, 2024    Dept:  I The court has previously ordered that the action against
Fenske be stayed pending a determination whether that action must be dismissed
for failure to obtain the required opinion when suing a licensed
architect.  That stay applies to this
motion and therefore there will be no hearing today.  The matter will be restored to the calendar
if the action survives.  The court notes
that Fenske has withdrawn one of the motions, but has not withdrawn the other.
 
The court notes that the motion to dismiss is set for July
9, 2024.
