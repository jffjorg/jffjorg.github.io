Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by Defendant Santa Monica Police Activities League to the first amended complaint filed by Plaintiffs John UNB Doe, John USS Doe, and John UNG Doe. The demurrer argues that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations, citing CCP ยง 340.1, which extends the statute of limitations for actions related to childhood sexual assault. However, the Court finds that the COVID-19 Emergency Rule 9, which tolled statutes of limitation for 178 days from April 6, 2020 to October 1, 2020, makes the claims timely. The Court notes that this issue has been addressed by the Court of Appeal in Roe v. Doe 1 (2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 965, and finds no reason to certify this ruling for writ review. Therefore, the Court overrules the demurrer and orders Defendant to file and serve an answer to the first amended complaint within 30 days of notice of this ruling.
