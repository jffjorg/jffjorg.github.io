BACKGROUND
                
On July 3, 2023, Plaintiffs John UNB Doe, John USS Doe, and John UNG Doe
filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendants City of Santa
Monica and Santa Monica Police Activities League, asserting causes of action
for (1) sexual assault; (2) negligence; (3) negligent failure to educate, train
or warn; and (4) violation of the Bane Act. Plaintiffs allege they were
sexually abused as children by City of Santa Monica police officer Eric Uller
while attending the City’s youth programing.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken
to the whole complaint or to any of the causes of action in it.  (CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only the legal
sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual allegations or the
plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations. 
(Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.
App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court must treat
as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not contentions, deductions
or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id.
at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be
construed liberally to determine whether a cause of action has been
stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendant Santa Monica Police Activities League demurs to the first
amended complaint on the ground that it is barred by the statute of
limitations. 
 
CCP § 340.1 acts to extend the statute of limitations for “an action for
recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual assault.” Under this statute, a plaintiff must file a
complaint by the later of either: (1) the revival period between January 1,
2020 and December 31, 2022; or (2) “within 22 years of the date the plaintiff
attains the age of majority or within five years of the date the plaintiff
discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury or
illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual assault,
whichever period expires later.” Plaintiffs filed the complaint June 5, 2023. The
22-year period has expired for at least one Plaintiff.
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs
assert the claims are timely under COVID-19 Emergency Rule 9, which tolled
statutes of limitation for 178 days from April 6, 2020 through October 1, 2020.
That 178 days of tolling is tacked onto the end of the limitations period,
which was December 31, 2022. 178 days from December 31, 2022, was June 27,
2023. Plaintiffs cite the recent Court of Appeal opinion that addressed this issue
and ruled in favor of Plaintiffs’ position: Roe v. Doe 1 (2023) 98
Cal.App.5th 965.
 
In reply, Defendant
acknowledges this case, but requests that the Court certify its order for
immediate writ review under CCP § 166.1. Defendant asserts Roe was
decided without adversarial briefing and that questions of law remain. The
Court sees no reason to certify this ruling for writ review. The Court of
Appeal has directly addressed the issue.
 
Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
