And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for preliminary injunction filed by Bridgeland Resources, LLC (Plaintiff) against Pacific Coast Energy Company, LP (Defendant). The Plaintiff seeks to remove liens placed by the Defendant on Plaintiff's oil fields and prevent the permanent shut down of those fields. The Court has found that the Plaintiff has not established a likelihood of success on the merits, as the contract language at issue is ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways. Additionally, the Plaintiff has not shown irreparable harm, as it has provided only a declaration from its president without supporting documentation. Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction.
