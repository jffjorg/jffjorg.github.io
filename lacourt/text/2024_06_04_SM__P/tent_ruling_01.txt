Harris, et al. v. Wilshire
Capital Group Case No. 23SMCV04861 
Hearing Date: June
4, 2024
Defendant’s Demurrer
to Plaintiff’s Complaint and Motion to Strike
 
The action arises
from plaintiffs’ investment of approximately $226,000 in bullion coins. Plaintiffs
allege for fraud, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, B&P 17200 and
unjust enrichment. Wilshire demurs, arguing uncertainty and lack of
jurisdiction, as all claims are time-barred by the one-year limitations period in
the parties' agreement.
 
Wilshire’s request
for the court to take judicial notice of the parties’ contracts dated October
3, 2022, Exhs. A and B, is DENIED, as Wilshire fails to cite authority that
would allow the court to take judicial notice of the terms of private parties’
contracts. Gould v. Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. (1995) 31
Cal.App.4th 1137, 1145.
Wilshire Capital argues the
action is barred under the parties' agreement, which sets forth a year
limitations period to bring a claim. However, this is an improper basis for a
demurrer, as it presents the court with factual issues not present in the
complaint. A demurrer tests the sufficiency of the complaint whereby the court must
take all allegations as true. E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs.
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315. 
The defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿ Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. Thus, the court must
treat the facts pled as true and cannot make factual findings beyond the four
corners of the complaint. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10. A contract between the
parties is not subject to judicial notice. Gould, supra, 31 Cal.App.4th
at 1145. Insofar as Wilshire contends the parties’ agreement outlines the
procedures when a dispute arises, such as arbitration, it may do so via an
appropriate motion. OVERRULED. 
Motion to Stike 
Wilshire Capital moves
to strike Pages 6-7, ¶20: “inter alia” and “as well as mental anguish damages”
and Page 11, Prayer ¶¶ 3-4 & 7-8. Wilshire argues plaintiffs are
contractually barred from requesting punitive damages and attorney’s fees. Plaintiffs
assert the existence and terms of the parties’ written contracts are not subject
to judicial notice and do not present adequate grounds for the motion to strike
attorney’s, citing Gould. The court agrees. 
 
Wilshire argues plaintiffs cannot recover emotional
distress damages for claims of fraud. Generally, damages for mental suffering
and emotional distress are not recoverable in contract, actions physical
injury. Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7
Cal.4th 503, 516. The complaint alleges plaintiffs suffered mental anguish but
does not allege physical injury. Furthermore, the complaint does not adequately
explain why plaintiffs are entitled to treble damages. GRANTED in part as to
Pages 6-7, ¶20 and Prayer ¶ 4. 
Wilshire Capital Group is to answer within 10 days of
notice of the court’s order.
