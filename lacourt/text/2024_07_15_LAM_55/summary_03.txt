And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Terminating Sanctions filed by Plaintiff John Oursland against Defendant Joe Sherman. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant is behind in past due rent and has been making false statements to cause other tenants not to pay rent. The Defendant has failed to comply with discovery orders and has not paid monetary sanctions as ordered by the Court.

The Judge notes that the Civil Discovery Act requires the Court to impose monetary sanctions on a party who unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel discovery responses. However, the Judge also notes that terminating sanctions should be used sparingly and as a last resort, and that less severe alternatives such as issue or evidentiary sanctions should be attempted before imposing terminating sanctions.

In this case, the Judge finds that the Defendant's failure to comply with discovery orders is relevant, and that the Plaintiff has suffered no ascertainable prejudice by the Defendant's lack of responses to the discovery. However, the Judge also notes that the Plaintiff has not sought issue or evidentiary sanctions to address the Defendant's failure to comply with the Court's orders compelling discovery.

Therefore, the Judge denies the motion for terminating sanctions and advises the Plaintiff to seek issue or evidentiary sanctions to address the Defendant's failure to comply with the Court's orders.
