And here is a summary in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Plaintiff's counsel to be relieved as attorney of record in a breach of contract case between Brenton Development Corporation and KTGY Group, Inc. The motion is granted because the required documents have been filed and the moving counsel has shown a cognizable ground for withdrawal, which is that the client has breached an agreement or obligation regarding expenses or fees. Since no opposing document has been filed showing prejudice to the client, the motion is granted and the court will sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
