And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge denies the Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees because the Plaintiff did not request fees at the time of default judgment. The Court cites Garcia v. Politis (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1474, which states that a plaintiff who obtains default judgment cannot thereafter obtain fees by post-judgment motion. The Plaintiff had sued the Defendant, Operation Bootstrap, for breach of written contract and specific performance, and the Defendant had filed no answer. The Court granted the Plaintiff's request for judgment, but the Plaintiff did not request fees at that time. The Judge rules that the motion is denied.
