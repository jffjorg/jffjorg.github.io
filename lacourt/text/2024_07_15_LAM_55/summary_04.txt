English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer hearing in a case brought by Bassam Samih Chelico against American Arbitration Association, Inc. (AAA), Rolex Watch, U.S.A., Inc., Denise Crow, Patrick Tatum, Tyler Douglas Meine, and Does 1-100. The case involves claims of violation of the False Advertising Law, Business & Professions Code section 17500 et seq., and other causes of action.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to Plaintiff's second through fifth causes of action, without leave to amend, on the grounds that the claims are barred by the doctrine of arbitral immunity. The Judge has also sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action as to defendants Crow and Tatum, without leave to amend, because Plaintiff has not alleged any facts that would show Crow and Tatum were responsible for drafting or disseminating any part of the AAA Rules.

However, the Judge has granted leave for Plaintiff to amend the first cause of action as to defendant AAA, because Plaintiff's complaint relies almost entirely on facts for which AAA is immune from liability, and Plaintiff has not clearly stated a claim for false advertising. The Judge has also granted Plaintiff thirty days' leave to amend the first cause of action as to defendant AAA.
