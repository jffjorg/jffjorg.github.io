 Case Number:  23STCV20476    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Hearing on Motion for Terminating Sanctions
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff John Oursland (“Plaintiff”) sued Joe Sherman
(“Defendant”) for defamation, intentional interference with prospect economic
advantage, and civil harassment. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is one of
Plaintiff’s tenants and is at least $94,065.00 behind in past due rent, and Defendant
has been making false statements to cause other tenants not to pay rent and
prospective tenants to decline rentals.
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion
for terminating sanctions, requesting that the Court strike Defendant’s answer
and enter his default.
Defendant, who is self-represented, filed no
opposition. Plaintiff attests he served Defendant by mail on May 22, 2024,
complying with Code of Civil Procedure section 1005.
LEGAL STANDARD
The Civil Discovery Act requires the court to impose
monetary sanctions on a party who unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel
initial or further discovery responses. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c),
2030.300(d), 2031.300(c), 2031.310(h), 2033.280(c), 2033.290(d).)
If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
initial or further response, the Act permits the court at its discretion to
impose escalating sanctions, including issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.
(See id., §§ 2030.300(e), 2031.310(i).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision
(b) through (e) elaborates on the nature and scope of the escalating sanctions
the court might impose for failure to obey discovery orders.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff argues the Court should impose terminating
sanctions because Defendant has failed to comply with three prior orders to
respond to discovery and pay monetary sanctions.
Defendant’s failure to pay past monetary sanctions is
irrelevant to the question of terminating sanctions. “[A] terminating sanction
issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction is
never justified.” (Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608,
615.) In fact, “it is an abuse of discretion for a trial court to issue a
terminating sanction for failure to pay the sanction. A monetary sanction is
immediately enforceable as a judgment, unless the court rules that it is not.
In an appropriate case failure to pay an ordered sanction is punishable as a
contempt.” (Id., at p. 610.)
The relevant discovery misconduct is Defendant’s
failure to comply with the substance of the underlying orders. On January 26,
January 29, and February 5, 2024, the Court ordered Defendant to provide
responses to three separate sets of discovery. (See 01-26-2024, 01-29-2024,
02-05-2024 Minute Orders.) The Court may in its discretion impose more serious
sanctions for Plaintiff’s failure to comply with these orders. (See Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2033.280(c).) However, the sanction Plaintiff
proposes is too draconian at this time.
In imposing discovery
sanctions, “[t]he trial court should consider both the conduct being sanctioned
and its effect on the party seeking discovery[.]” (Id., 992.) Sanctions
should be tailored to the harm created by the withheld discovery and should not
be used as punishment. (Ibid.) The court should also consider whether
the discovery misconduct was “willful” and whether the requesting party was
prejudiced by the other’s failure to comply. (Do It Urself Moving &
Storage, Inc. v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th
27, 37.) 
Case law suggests the
court should take an incremental approach to sanctions, holding that
terminating sanctions should be used “sparingly” and as a “last resort,” (Department
of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154,
191); that terminating sanctions are the “ultimate sanction” and should not be
“automatically imposed for every such disobedience of a discovery order” (Karz
v. Karl (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 637, 649); and that less severe alternatives
should be attempted unless there is reason to believe they would be
ineffective. (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc.
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)
Here, there is no reason (yet) to believe that lesser
sanctions such as issue or evidentiary sanctions would not be effective to achieve
Defendant’s compliance with the Court’s orders. There is no indication (yet) that
his failure to comply has been willful. Also, trial in this action is not set
until 2025. Plaintiff has suffered no ascertainable prejudice by Defendant’s lack
of responses to the discovery. Plaintiff could seek issue or evidentiary
sanctions to address Defendant’s failure to comply with the Court’s orders
compelling discovery. But he does not do so in this motion.
Thus, the motion for terminating sanctions is denied.
