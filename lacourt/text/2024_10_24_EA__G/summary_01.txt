```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions brought by Plaintiffs. The motion was untimely and Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they were diligent in obtaining discovery from Defendants. The judge also denies the motion for leave to amend the complaint, as the proposed amendment is not proper and does not add a new cause of action. Finally, the judge deems moot the motion for belated service of expert information, as there was no timely demand for expert exchange by Defendants.
