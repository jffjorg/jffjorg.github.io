And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mendoza v. Transtar Insurance Brokers, et al. The defendant, Mohave Transportation Insurance Company, has filed four unopposed motions to compel the plaintiff, Angela Mendoza, to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiff has failed to serve timely responses to the requests, which include interrogatories, special interrogatories, document production demands, and requests for admissions.

The judge has granted each of the defendant's motions, ordering the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objection within 10 days. The judge has also imposed monetary sanctions on the plaintiff in the amount of $880.00 for the motion to compel responses to interrogatories, and $770.00 for each of the other three motions.

The judge has waived the plaintiff's right to produce writings and has deemed the requests for admissions admitted as true. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to permit inspection and copying of the requested documents.

The judge has noted that the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests is a misuse of the discovery process and has imposed monetary sanctions on the plaintiff as a result. The judge has also encouraged the parties to use audio or video appearances through LACourtConnect/Microsoft Teams for future hearings.
