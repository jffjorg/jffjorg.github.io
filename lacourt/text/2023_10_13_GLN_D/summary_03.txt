Here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions: one seeking permission for attorney Caroline Whitlock to appear pro hac vice and the other seeking to seal certain documents. The judge grants the pro hac vice motion, finding that the application is in order and complies with the necessary requirements. The motion to seal is denied as moot, as the defendant has filed a first amended cross-complaint that names the cross-defendants sought to be identified in a document under seal. The original cross-complaint is stricken, and the demand for jury trial and request for judicial notice are also stricken as moot. The summons is stricken in its entirety, without prejudice to the defendant filing a new summons with identifying information not included. The court notes that it will continue to encourage audio or video appearances and will assume parties are submitting on the tentative if no appearance is made.
