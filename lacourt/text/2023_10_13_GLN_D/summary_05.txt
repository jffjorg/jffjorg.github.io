**Ruling**

The court denies defendant Ford's motion for judgment on the pleadings with regard to plaintiff's Song-Beverly Act claims. The court finds that plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action for breach of express warranty and breach of implied warranty.

**Analysis**

The court analyzes the Song-Beverly Act and the case law interpreting it, including Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc. and Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC. The court concludes that the language of the statute and the legislative history support the conclusion that the Song-Beverly Act applies to used cars sold with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's new warranty.

**Conflict**

The court notes a conflict between the analysis and conclusions in Jensen and Rodriguez. However, the court finds that Jensen's interpretation of the Act is more consistent with the remedial spirit and pro-consumer impetus of the Act.

**Privity**

The court finds that privity may not be a barrier to a Song-Beverly claim in certain circumstances, and that the exceptions to privity are limited. The court does not require plaintiff to affirmatively allege the exceptions in the pleading.

**Leave to Amend**

The court grants plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to allege facts concerning the purchase of the vehicle from an unidentified selling dealership, if necessary.

**Order**

The court orders that the motion for judgment on the pleadings be denied, and that the parties are to proceed with discovery and trial.
