And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel discovery responses from the plaintiffs. The defendant, Ultra Gate Corporation, served the plaintiffs, Jose Castellanos and Fernando Sandoval, with initial discovery, including interrogatories, on May 31, 2024. The plaintiffs failed to respond within the allotted time, and the defendant sent a meet and confer letter on July 3, 2024, granting a two-week extension. The plaintiffs still failed to respond, and the defendant is seeking sanctions of $860.00 per motion against the plaintiffs and their counsel. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to respond to the discovery without objection within ten days, and has imposed sanctions in the amount of $860.00 jointly and severally against the plaintiffs and their counsel. The sanctions must be paid within 30 days to the defendant's counsel.
