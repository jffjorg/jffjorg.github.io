to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   10/17/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
 If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for
a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
ANALYSIS 
 Defendant Ultra Gate Corporation moves for an order compelling
Plaintiff Jose Castellanos to respond to its Form Interrogatories, Set One, without
objections within ten days. Defendant also moves to compel Plaintiff Fernando
Sandoval to respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One. Defendant requests
sanctions of $860.00 per motion against Plaintiffs and their counsel of record.
On May 31,
2024, Defendant served Plaintiffs Castellanos and Sandoval with
its initial set of discovery, which included the subject Special and Form
Interrogatories. (Farahmand Decl. ¶4; Ex. A.) As Defendant did not receive
timely responses, on July 3, 2024, Defendant sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiffs,
granting a courtesy two-week extension for Plaintiff to respond. (Farahmand
Decl. ¶6; Ex. B.) Plaintiffs did not respond to the letter or the discovery.
(Farahmand Decl. ¶7.) To date, Plaintiffs have failed to respond to the
outstanding discovery. 
Defendant demonstrates its discovery was duly
served on Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs failed to respond within the allotted
time. Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to respond
without objection within ten days to the subject discovery. Sanctions are imposed in the noticed
amount as follows: 1) $860.00 against Plaintiff Sandoval and counsel of record,
jointly and severally; and 2) $860.00 against Plaintiff Castellanos and counsel
of record, jointly and severally. Sanctions are to be paid within 30 days to
Defendant’s counsel of record.
