  Case Number:  22VECV01019    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2023    Dept:  T 22VECV01019
Strashko v Bunduchi
Tentative
ruling:  The court will bifurcate the Quiet
Title and Partition actions for trial and try them first prior to a jury trial
on the remaining claims.  The court finds
that the resolution of these claims may expedite resolution of the case.  It would be too confusing to the jury to hear
facts related to Quiet Title and Partition which are unrelated to the decisions
it needs to make.  It is not the court’s
intention to obtain an advisory opinion from the jury.
