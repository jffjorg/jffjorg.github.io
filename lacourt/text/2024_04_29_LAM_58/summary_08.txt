Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion to set aside the court order granting the defendant's special motion to strike. The plaintiff failed to oppose the special motion to strike, and his failure to do so was not due to mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect. The plaintiff also failed to comply with procedural requirements, such as providing a copy of the proposed opposition to the defendant's anti-SLAPP motion. The judge notes that the court's ruling was not a close call, and no opposition would have saved the plaintiff's claims.
