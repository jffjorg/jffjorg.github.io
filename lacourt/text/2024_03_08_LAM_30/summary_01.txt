And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The defendant, Equity Residential Management, LLC, moves to strike paragraphs 4, 48, 65, and 67 in the First Amended Complaint. The court grants the motion with 10 days' leave to amend. The court may strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in a pleading or any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of the state or a court rule.

The defendant's alleged violations include failing to provide means for consumers to request reports, failing to notify consumers of investigative reports, and failing to notify consumers of the identity of the consumer reporting agency. However, the court finds that these allegations do not demonstrate an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of conduct or an act with evil purpose. The court agrees with the defendant's argument that mere nonfeasance, such as the failure to discover a dangerous condition or to perform a duty, amounts to ordinary negligence, but not gross negligence.

The court's inquiry is whether the First Amended Complaint provides facts that fall within the definitions of gross negligence and willfulness. The court concludes that the First Amended Complaint does not provide such facts and grants the defendant's motion to strike.
