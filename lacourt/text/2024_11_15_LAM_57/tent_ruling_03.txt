 Case Number:  BC434040    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is denying the motion of judgment debtor Arkady Lyampert to stop the accrual of interest on the renewed judgment against him in this action.   Lyampert has offered no valid legal or equitable basis for the relief that he is seeking.   The Court is persuaded by the arguments advanced in the oppositions to the motion submitted by judgment creditors Roman Frenkel and Design Creator, Inc.  Those oppositions demonstrate, in particular, that accrual of interest on the renewed judgment should not be stopped based on Lyampert's assertion of the availability of a set-off to satisfy part of the judgment stemming from Lyampert's financial stake in a company called L.A. Micro Group (UK) Ltd. that is bound up in litigation in the United Kingdom at this time.
