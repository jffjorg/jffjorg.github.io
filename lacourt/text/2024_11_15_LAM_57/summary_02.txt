And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion to relieve her from the default that was entered in the case. This is because the defendant has demonstrated that she is entitled to relief under Section 473(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiffs will be awarded costs of $129.71 for securing the default. The judge is also denying the plaintiffs' request for costs in excess of this amount.

The judge is denying the plaintiffs' request for an order to show cause to determine whether the defendant should be held in contempt for violating the preliminary injunction. This is because the judge has found that the plaintiffs failed to properly post and acknowledge the bond required by the preliminary injunction, making it unenforceable.

However, the judge suggests that if the plaintiffs were to file a new motion for preliminary injunction and properly post and acknowledge the bond, the court would likely grant the motion and the defendant would be subject to the same preliminary injunction.
