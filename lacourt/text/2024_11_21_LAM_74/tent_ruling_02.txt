 Case Number:  23STCV27920    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  74 Opendoor
Property Trust I v. Vickers et al. 
Plaintiff Opendoor Property Trust I
Motion to Compel Discovery 
 
BACKGROUND 
             This motion to compel discovery arises out of
a property dispute and quiet title claim. 
            Plaintiff
Opendoor Property Trust I (Plaintiff) seeks to compel initial responses to the
form interrogatories and special interrogatories propounded upon defendant Fred
Wendell Vickers in his capacity as the Trustee of the Fred and Beverly Vickers
Family Trust (Defendant). 
            Plaintiff
propounded discovery on March 13, 2024. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290(b), 2031.300(b).)  Moreover,
failure to timely serve responses waives objections to the requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a).)  
The
Court may impose sanctions against a party who unsuccessfully makes or oppose a
motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(c).)
 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
propounded discovery on Defendant on March 13, 2024.  As of October 14, 2024, when the motion was
filed, Defendant has not served answers. 
Defendant has not opposed this motion. 
Plaintiff has engaged in a substantial amount of meet and confer over
the discovery responses, including an informal discovery conference on August
19, 2024. 
            Defendant
has failed to respond to discovery requests; therefore, Plaintiff is entitled
to an order compelling responses without objections and sanctions. 
            Plaintiff
requests $892.00 in sanctions.  Plaintiff
filed three motions to compel discovery and requests sanctions for all three
motions divided by three.  Plaintiff’s
counsel requests 4.2 hours for preparing the motions and anticipates an
additional 5.5 hours in preparing replies and attending hearings. The court
awards 4.2 hours for preparing the motions, and an additional two hours for
attending the hearings.  Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly rate is $260.00.  The
court awards $550 in sanctions for this motion. 
            
CONCLUSION
            The
court grant’s Plaintiffs motion to compel initial responses from defendant Fred
Vickers as Trustee to Special Interrogatories, set one and Form
Interrogatories, set one.  The court
awards $550 in sanctions. 
            Plaintiff
