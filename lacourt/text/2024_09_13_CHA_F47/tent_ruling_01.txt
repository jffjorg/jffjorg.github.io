RULING: The motions are granted as set forth
below.    
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a dispute between Plaintiffs
Alicia and Robert Brown (Plaintiffs) and Defendants Middleton Investments, Inc.
dba Middleton Construction; Christopher Champion and Teri King (Defendants)
regarding alleged construction defects involving Plaintiffs residence located
at 28852 Iron Village Drive, Valencia, California 91354 (the Property).  Plaintiffs hired Defendants to repair
interior stairs and remodel the master bathroom.  Plaintiffs terminated Defendants before they
completed the work and retained a new contractor to allegedly repair and/or
replace the work that Defendants performed on the Property.  
 
On 4/12/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendants for: (1) Breach of Oral Contract; (2) Breach of Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Negligence; (4) Negligence Per Se; (5) Breach of
Express and Implied Warranties; Recovery on Contractor’s License Bond (against
Hudson Insurance); and (7) Disgorgement. 
On 6/23/23, Defendants answered the complaint.
 
On 7/13/23, Defendants electronically served Plaintiffs
with written discovery making responses due on or before 8/13/23.  (Rutherford Decls., Ex.A).  Pursuant to Plaintiffs’ requests for
extensions, responses were due on 9/22/23. 
On 9/22/23, Plaintiffs served unverified responses to the discovery.  (Rutherford Decls., Ex.B).  Dissatisfied with the unverified responses
and objections contained therein, Defendants sent a meet and confer letter on
10/3/23 which outlined the deficiencies in certain of Plaintiffs’ discovery
responses.  (Rutherford Decls. ¶10,
Ex.C).  
 
Again, Plaintiffs requested extensions of time to further
respond.  During the meet and confer
process, the parties agreed to a mutual open-ended extension regarding pending
discovery and associated deadlines on motions to compel so the parties could
engage in informal settlement discussions. 
(Rutherford Decls., Ex.D).  
 
On 12/7/23, it became clear that the case would not be
resolved.  Therefore, Defendants, again,
requested that Plaintiffs supplement their responses to the subject discovery
requests by 12/20/23 and confirmed that motions to compel further responses
were due 1/20/24.  (Rutherford Decls.,
Ex.E).  Plaintiffs failed to serve
further responses.  (Rutherford Decls.).
 
Therefore, on 1/19/24, Defendants filed and served motions
seeking orders compelling further responses from Plaintiffs to certain of Defendants’
Request for Production of Documents, Set 1; Form Interrogatories, Set 1,
Special Interrogatories, Set 1 and Request for Admissions, Set 1.  Additionally, in each motion, Defendants
requested an award of monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs and their counsel.  
 
The hearing on the first, unopposed, motion relating to
document requests went forward on 7/30/24 as scheduled.  (See 7/30/24 Minute Order).  The day before the hearing, Plaintiffs’
counsel, Todd Wolfe, filed a declaration indicating that the failure to supplement
the discovery responses and/or respond to the motion was due to his health
issues and the miscalendaring of the hearing date.  (See Wolfe Decl. filed 7/29/24).  In his declaration attorney Wolfe also
indicated that he had discussed with Defendants’ counsel the possibility of
continuing the hearing on the 7/30/24 motion and the two motions scheduled for
8/9/24 (motion re Form Interrogatories) and 8/12/24 (motion re Special
Interrogatories) to 9/13/24, the hearing date on the motion regarding Request
for Admissions.  (Wolfe Decl. ¶¶16-17).  While Defendants’ counsel could not agree to
continue the 7/30/24 hearing, he was willing to discuss continuing the hearings
on the motions scheduled for 8/9/24 and 8/12/24.  Id. 
 
Since the 8/9/24 and 8/12/24 hearings still appeared on
the Court’s 8/9/24 and 8/12/24 calendars and no other response to those motions
had been filed, court staff called Defendants’ counsel to inquire whether the
8/9/24 and 8/12/24 hearings would be proceeding as scheduled.  Defendants’ attorney, Howard Weber, indicated
that Defendants’ had agreed to continue the hearings to 9/13/24 but did not
agree to continue the briefing schedule on the motions and the motions would
not be proceeding on 8/9/24 and 8/12/24. 
Based on the foregoing, the hearings on the motions to compel further
responses to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories were continued to
9/13/24.  (See 8/9/24 Minute
Order).
 
Now, the Court considers Defendants’ motions which seek:  
 
(1) An order compelling further responses from Plaintiffs
Alicia and Robert B. Brown to Defendants’ Form Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos.
302.1(b)-(c), 302.2, 302.3(b)-(c), 302.4, 302.5 and 302.6 served on 7/13/23.  Additionally, Defendants request an award of
sanctions against Plaintiffs and their counsel in the amount of $1,740.0; 
 
(2) An order compelling further responses from Plaintiffs
Alicia and Robert B. Brown to Defendants’ Special Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos.
3, 5, 6, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and
36-95 served on 7/13/23.  Additionally,
Defendants request an award of sanctions against Plaintiffs and their counsel
in the amount of $1,740.00; and
 
(3) An order compelling further responses from Plaintiffs
Alicia and Robert B. Brown to Defendants’ Requests for Admissions, Set 1, Nos.
6-12, 14, 16 and 17 and served on 7/13/23. 
Additionally, Defendants request an award of sanctions against
Plaintiffs and their counsel in the amount of $1,950.00.
 
Plaintiffs have not opposed or otherwise responded to the
motions.  On 9/6/24, Defendants filed and
served a Notice of Non-Opposition to the Motions.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Generally, a party may obtain discovery regarding any
matter not privileged that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the
action or to the determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter
is either itself admissible into evidence or appears reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
CCP 2017.010.
 
A party who propounded interrogatories may move to compel
further responses, if it deems that: (1) an answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) an exercise of the option to
produce documents under CCP 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate; and/or (3) an objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general. CCP 2030.300(a).  Similarly, a party who propounded requests
for admissions may move to compel further responses, if it deems that: an
answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete and/or (2) an objection
to a particular request is without merit or too general.  CCP 2033.290(a).  
 
Before filing such motions, the compelling party must
meet and confer in an effort to informally resolve the discovery dispute.  CCP 2030.300(b)(1); CCP 2033.290(b)(1); CCP
2016.040.
 
If a motion to compel further responses is timely filed,
the responding party has the burden of justifying any objection or failure to
fully answer the discovery request.  See
Fairmont Insurance Co. (2000) 22 C4th 245, 255; Coy (1962) 58 C2d
210, 220-221. 
  
If responses to discovery requests contain both
substantive responses and objections, without verification, the responses are
the equivalent to objections alone as an unverified response is the equivalent
to no response.  See CCP 2030.250(a);
Appleton (1988) 206 CA3d 632, 636. 
 
Plaintiffs have made improper objections in response to
the Form and Special Interrogatories and Requests for Admissions at issue.  Additionally, Plaintiffs have failed to
respond to the motions or make any effort to justify the objections as is their
burden.  As such, further responses are
warranted.  
 
Defendants are entitled to sanctions against Plaintiffs
and their counsel of record for their failure to comply with their discovery
obligations.  CCP 2030.300(d); CCP
2033.290(d).  However, the Court finds
that the sanctions requested for each motion are excessive, especially
considering the  memorandum of points and
authorities in support of the two interrogatory motions are almost identical
and the motion regarding requests for admissions is also very similar and
contains errors (reference to document requests and statutes which support
motions regarding document requests and/or interrogatories, rather than
requests for admissions).  (See
RFA motion, p.2:15-24, p.3:1, p.5:22, p.5:25-26).  Sanctions are awarded in the total amount of $2,280.00
for all 3 motions (3 hours to prepare each the motion for a total of 9 hours
for preparation of motions + 1 hour to prepare for and appear at the combined
hearing on the unopposed motions multiplied by $210/hour +$180 in filing fees
($60 for each motion).  (See
Rutherford Decls. ¶15).
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The motions are granted.  Further responses are due and sanctions are
payable within 30 days. 
 
The Court notes that Defendants have failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to their motion as required.  See CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel for the parties are warned that
failure to comply with this requirement in the future may result in matters
being continued so that papers can be re-filed in compliance with the rule,
papers not being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
