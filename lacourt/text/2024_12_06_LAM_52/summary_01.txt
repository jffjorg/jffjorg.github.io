And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel production of partnership books and records. The plaintiff, Lee Ouye, seeks to compel the defendant, Mertz Del-Amo, to produce all responsive documents, but the plaintiff fails to provide evidence that the defendant possesses documents that it has not produced or made available for inspection. The defendant presents evidence detailing the efforts its agents took to search for and produce documents and attesting that they produced all responsive documents they could find.

The judge also overrules the defendants' demurrer to the second amended complaint's sixth cause of action for partition. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has no standing to bring the partition claim because he has no direct interest in the real property. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's fourth cause of action seeks dissolution of partnership and accounting against Mertz Del-Amo, which owns most of the real property subject to the partition claim. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for partition of the subject real property. The defendants are ordered to answer the complaint within 15 days.
