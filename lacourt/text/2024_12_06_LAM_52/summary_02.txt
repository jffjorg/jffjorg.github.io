Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied plaintiff Arthur Little's motion for leave to amend or supplement his third amended complaint to renew his cause of action for whistleblower retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5. The plaintiff argues that he has completed the process of exhausting his internal remedies, but the judge finds that the internal grievance process is still ongoing. The judge cites several precedents, including Campbell v. Regents of University of California, which holds that an employee of the Regents of the University of California must exhaust university internal administrative remedies before filing suit in superior court for whistleblower retaliation. The judge also cites Plantier v. Ramona Municipal Water Dist., which states that requiring a party to pursue an available administrative remedy aids judicial review by allowing the agency to draw upon its expertise and develop a factual record for the court's consideration. The judge finds that granting the motion would be futile and would undermine the policy behind the requirement to exhaust internal remedies.
