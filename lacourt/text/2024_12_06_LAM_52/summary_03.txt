And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, OriginPoint, LLC and Guaranteed Rate, Inc., have moved to stay this action brought by Felix Shiels. The defendants have filed a petition in federal court to compel arbitration of their claims against Shiels, and this action involves the same critical issues. The judge has granted the defendants' motion to stay the action pending the resolution of the federal petition. The judge believes that litigating this action during the pending federal proceeding would be inefficient and could result in inconsistent rulings on the same issues. The judge also cites the California Arbitration Act, which allows the court to stay an action pending the determination of an arbitration application. The judge finds that the federal court is better equipped to determine the parties' rights, and staying this action serves the interests of justice.
