Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for award of incidental compensation or an order for an accounting brought by the Plaintiffs, Bharat Patel and Dinesh Patel. The motion was opposed by the Defendants, Dr. Prakash Patel and Hardika Patel. The Judge found that the motion was substantively unsupported and procedurally improper at this stage of the action. The Judge also noted that the judgment in the case was entered on February 20, 2024, and that the Plaintiffs failed to present evidence in support of their motion during the trial. The Judge concluded that the Plaintiffs have forfeited their right to recover any incidental compensation or an accounting at this stage of the action. The Defendants are ordered to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of the Court's order.
