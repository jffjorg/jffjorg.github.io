Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motions to be relieved as Plaintiffs' counsel without prejudice. The motions were filed by Ben Roberts of Law Office of Ben Roberts, who seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Michael Rosas and Odalys Rosas. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's lack of communication with counsel is sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal, but notes that the motions need to be fixed. Specifically, the Judicial Council forms provided incorrect courthouse contact information, and the declarations do not provide sufficient evidence to confirm the Plaintiffs' current address. The proposed orders also contain outdated hearing information. The Court orders Counsel to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days.
