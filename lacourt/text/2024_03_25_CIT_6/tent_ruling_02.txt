   [1]Â Plaintiff  argues that the only remaining claim against Liou is for breach of the Guaranty  based on the Court having entered default judgment against Cloud Control on  September 19, 2022. (Memorandum of Points and Authorities, 5:18-21.) But,  Plaintiff still addresses the other causes of action for breach of contract and  common counts elsewhere in the motion. (Id., 6:1-19, 8:17-9:8.) This  argument also conflicts with the FAC, which alleges each cause of action  against Liou. (See generally, First Amended Complaint.) Thus, the Court begins  its analysis with the First Cause of Action for common counts.
