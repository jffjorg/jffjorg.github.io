And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Prapatsorn Group, Inc. (Defendant) to compel further responses to requests for admission from Perla Mageno (Plaintiff). The judge finds that the motion is moot because Plaintiff has already provided supplemental responses to the discovery at issue. The judge also denies Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that Defendant did not meet and confer in good faith. The judge finds that Defendant's meet and confer email was insufficient and did not provide enough detail for Plaintiff to respond. The judge notes that once the motion was filed, which provided sufficient detail regarding the deficiencies, Plaintiff provided responses.
