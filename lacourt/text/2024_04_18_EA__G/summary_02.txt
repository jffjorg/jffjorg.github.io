And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court grants the motion to compel arbitration filed by E*TRADE Securities LLC and John Edward Bersin. The court finds that an arbitration agreement exists between E*TRADE Securities LLC and Jose Guzman Salcedo, and that the agreement provides for arbitration of disputes arising from their relationship and account. The court also finds that the E*TRADE Defendants adequately established the existence and applicability of the arbitration provision. The court stays the entire action pending the completion of arbitration. Additionally, the court deem the E*TRADE Defendants' demurrer to Guzman Salcedo's complaint moot.
