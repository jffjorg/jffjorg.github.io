And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the City of Claremont's motion for summary judgment on both the inverse condemnation and dangerous condition of public property claims. The Court found that the City has met its burden of establishing that there are no facts to suggest that the subject tree was a public improvement planted by or at the direction of the City. Additionally, the Court found that there are no disputed facts upon which a reasonable factfinder could determine that the subject tree constituted a dangerous condition. As a result, the City's motion for summary judgment is granted on both claims.
