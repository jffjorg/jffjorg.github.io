Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion filed by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (Plaintiff) to set aside the dismissal of the case and enter judgment against Lealani Vargas (Defendant). The court finds that the settlement agreement and stipulation entered into on December 7, 2021 is valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The stipulation provides for the payment of $4,800.00, with $2,000.00 to be paid by the Defendant's insurance carrier and 14 monthly payments of $200.00 each. The court notes that the Defendant has defaulted on payments.

The Plaintiff requests that the court set aside the dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $2,819.50. However, the court finds that the Plaintiff's calculation of the judgment amount is unclear and orders the Plaintiff to provide additional clarification.

The motion is CONTINUED to November 13, 2023 at 10:00 A.M. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The Plaintiff is ordered to file supplemental papers providing additional clarification regarding its calculation of the principal and costs at least 16 court days prior to the continued hearing date. Failure to do so will result in the motion being placed off calendar or denied.
