**English Summary:**

The Judge is considering State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's ("Plaintiff's") motion to vacate the dismissal of a lawsuit against Lealani Vargas ("Defendant"). The case stems from a settlement agreement where Defendant was to pay Plaintiff $4,800 in installments.  Defendant made some payments but then defaulted, triggering the Plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement and enter judgment. 

The Judge finds the settlement agreement valid and enforceable.  However, the Judge wants more information from Plaintiff about how the requested judgment amount of $2,819.50 was calculated (specifically, which portion represents principal and which portion represents costs).  The hearing on the motion is continued to November 13, 2023, to allow Plaintiff to provide this clarification.
