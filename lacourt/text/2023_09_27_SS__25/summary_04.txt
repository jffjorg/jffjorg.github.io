The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of NY Properties, LLC v. Justine Emma Harari, et al., case number 21STLC01026. The plaintiff has filed a motion to enforce a settlement agreement reached between the parties, but the defendant has objected to the motion. The settlement agreement, which was reached on February 28, 2023, provides for the payment of $14,000.00 by the defendants to the plaintiff. However, the agreement was not signed by all parties, and the defendant, John Howard McFadden, has not made a payment to the plaintiff. The judge has denied the motion to enforce the settlement agreement, finding that it is not enforceable because it was not signed by both parties.
