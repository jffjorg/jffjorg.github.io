And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Douglas L. Hallett, is seeking damages and referral to the California Veterinary Medical Board after his dog, Rosie, died due to alleged negligence by the defendants, VCA, Inc., Marie Kerl, and Michael Kwan.

The defendants argue that the plaintiff's allegations for exemplary damages under Civil Code § 3340 are insufficient because they do not show that the defendants acted intentionally or with gross negligence. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficient alleged his claim for exemplary damages, as the defendants' failure to diagnose and treat Rosie's symptoms of urinary tract infection and/or ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS) was an extreme departure from the standard of conduct.

The defendants also argue that the plaintiff's request for referral to the California Veterinary Medical Board is improper because there is no mechanism for court referral. However, the judge finds that the request is not improper, as the purpose of the California Veterinary Medical Board is to investigate and prosecute veterinarian misconduct, including negligence, incompetence, and cruelty to animals.

The judge is denying the defendants' motion to strike in its entirety. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
