And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Douglas L. Hallett, is seeking damages and referral to the California Veterinary Medical Board after his dog, Rosie, died due to alleged negligence by the defendants, VCA, Inc., Marie Kerl, and Michael Kwan.

The defendants argue that the plaintiff's allegations for exemplary damages under Civil Code § 3340 are insufficient because they do not show that the defendants acted intentionally or with gross negligence. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficient alleged his claim for exemplary damages, as the defendants' failure to diagnose and treat Rosie's symptoms of urinary tract infection and/or ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS) was an extreme departure from the standard of conduct.

The defendants also argue that the plaintiff's request for referral to the California Veterinary Medical Board is improper because there is no mechanism for court referral. However, the judge finds that the request is not improper, as the purpose of the California Veterinary Medical Board is to investigate and prosecute veterinarian misconduct, including negligence, incompetence, and cruelty to animals.

The judge is denying the defendants' motion to strike in its entirety. The moving party is ordered to give notice.

**English Summary:**

The tentative ruling in Hallett v. VCA Inc., et al. denies the defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. 

The plaintiff alleges that his dog, Rosie, died due to negligence by VCA, Inc. and its employees, Marie Kerl and Michael Kwan. Specifically, the plaintiff claims VCA failed to diagnose Rosie's condition (ORS) and provided misleading information about the diagnosis. He is seeking both monetary compensation and a referral of the veterinarians to the California Veterinary Medical Board for potential disciplinary action.

The defendants argued that:

1. The plaintiff's request for exemplary damages should be stricken because his allegations do not rise to the level of gross negligence.
2. The request for referral to the Veterinary Medical Board should be stricken because there is no formal mechanism for such referrals in court.

The judge disagreed with both arguments, finding that:

1. The plaintiff's allegations regarding VCA's failure to diagnose ORS and its continued dissemination of misleading information about the condition did constitute gross negligence.
2. Even though there is no formal referral process, the court has the power to create remedies for wrongs, and a referral to the Veterinary Medical Board could be considered a remedy.

Therefore, the tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to strike, and the case will proceed.
