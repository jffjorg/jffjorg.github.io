And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The plaintiff's counsel admits that the failure to appear at the non-Jury Trial was a mistake that was solely his fault. The counsel states that he was grieving the loss of his longtime staff member and was having personal issues at the time, which led to the mis-calendaring of the trial date. The motion was filed within the six-month time limit and was accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his mistake. The judge finds that the dismissal was the result of the counsel's mistake and grants the motion. The next step is an Order to Show Cause regarding the plaintiff's failure to file proof of service of the summons and complaint, which is set for December 6, 2023.
