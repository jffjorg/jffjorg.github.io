And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The plaintiff's counsel admits that the failure to appear at the non-Jury Trial was a mistake that was solely his fault. The counsel states that he was grieving the loss of his longtime staff member and was having personal issues at the time, which led to the mis-calendaring of the trial date. The motion was filed within the six-month time limit and was accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his mistake. The judge finds that the dismissal was the result of the counsel's mistake and grants the motion. The next step is an Order to Show Cause regarding the plaintiff's failure to file proof of service of the summons and complaint, which is set for December 6, 2023.

**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of his case. The Plaintiff's attorney missed the scheduled trial date due to personal circumstances, including the death of a long-term staff member and health issues. The attorney filed an affidavit admitting fault and stating the missed trial was a mistake. Under California law, the court is required to vacate a dismissal if a party's attorney files an affidavit of fault within six months of the dismissal, unless the court finds the default was not caused by the attorney's mistake.  

The case is now scheduled for a new hearing on December 6, 2023, to address the Plaintiff's failure to file proof of service of the summons and complaint.
