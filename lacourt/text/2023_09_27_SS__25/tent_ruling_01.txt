agreement and enter judgment against Defendant in the amount of $18,200.48. On
that same day, the Court vacated the default judgment and scheduled an Order to

filed its Answer on October 12, 2022. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
to Vacate the Dismissal, Enforce Settlement Agreement, and Enter Judgment (the
“Motion”) on July 10 2023. No Opposition is filed.

$100.00 per month would be due on or before the 20th of each month
from April 20, 2021 to September 20, 2023. (Id.) Failure to make a
