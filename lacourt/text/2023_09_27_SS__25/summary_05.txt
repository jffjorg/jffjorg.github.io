And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between NY Properties, LLC (Plaintiff) and Justine Emma Harari and John Howard McFadden (Defendants). The case was filed on February 5, 2021, and the parties reached a settlement agreement, but it was not signed by all parties. The Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement, which was opposed by the Defendants. The judge denied the motion, finding that the settlement agreement was not enforceable because it was not signed by both parties. The judge also noted that the parties did not inform the court that they affirmatively agreed to the terms of the settlement, and that the settlement was not finalized because it was still pending due to the death of Defendant Harari.
