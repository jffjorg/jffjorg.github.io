```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, NY Properties, LLC, seeks to enforce a settlement agreement with defendants Justine Emma Harari and John Howard McFadden. The agreement was reached on February 28, 2023, but a stipulated settlement has not been filed with the court. The plaintiff argues that the defendants orally stipulated to the settlement agreement before the court, and that defendant Harari made the first payment of $1,000.00. However, defendant McFadden asserts that he did not sign the agreement and that the alleged settlement agreement is not enforceable.

The court concludes that the settlement agreement is not enforceable because it was not signed by all parties to the settlement. The court notes that the parties did not inform the court that they affirmatively agreed to the terms of the settlement, and that the stipulated settlement was not signed by any of the defendants. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement.

- "The court cannot enforce this settlement, as it is not signed by all parties to the settlement"
- "For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement under California Code of Civil Procedure 664.6 is DENIED"

In this tentative ruling, Judge concludes that Plaintiff's Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is denied because the settlement agreement was not signed by both parties, and Plaintiff did not prove that Defendants orally stipulated to the settlement agreement before the court. The Judge applies the two-part test from In re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, and finds that the court officer was not empowered to act with an adjudicatory function and the court officer did not act in that capacity in this case.
