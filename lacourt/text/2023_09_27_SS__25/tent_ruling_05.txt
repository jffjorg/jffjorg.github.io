On February 28, 2023, counsel
represented to the Court that a settlement has been reached and a stipulated

III.           
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff seeks a
court order entering judgment against Defendant McFadden pursuant to CCP
section 664.6. 
 
This matter has
not been dismissed and is still pending. As such, the Court has jurisdiction to
consider the motion.
 
Plaintiff has
provided a copy of the settlement agreement between the parties. (Motion, Ex. 1.)
The settlement agreement provides that Defendants would pay $14,000.00, of
which one thousand dollars was to be paid on March 1, 2023 and the remaining monthly
payments of one thousand dollars for thirteen additional months. (Motion at p.
3, Ex. 1). To date, Defendants have not signed the agreement. (Ex. 1.)
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Harari has died and Defendant McFadden remains
liable for the debt pursuant to the written lease between the parties. Plaintiff
argues that Defendants performed their initial payment under the terms of the
agreement and appeared by telephone in court and agreed to the settlement. 
 
                        In
opposition, Defendant McFadden asserts that he did not sign the Settlement
Agreement and was not a party to the settlement agreement and the alleged
settlement agreement was not enforceable. Furthermore, Defendant Harari died
prior to signing the settlement agreement. 
 
            Plaintiff
presents evidence that Defendant Harari made the first payment of $1,000.00 to
Plaintiff under the settlement agreement (Reply, Fine Decl. ¶6, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff
also asserts evidence that Defendant Harari appeared in person and Defendant McFadden
appeared by telephone and orally stipulated to the settlement agreement before
the court. (Ex. 1, 5.) 
 
            The Supreme
Court has held that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate in writing…
or orally on the record before the court, for settlement of the case, or part
thereof, the court upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.” (In re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 900.) Under
the Assemi two-part test, oral stipulations are considered before the
court if: “1) the court officer was empowered to act with an adjudicatory
function, and 2) the court officer did, in fact, act in that capacity.” (Murphy
v. Padilla (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 707, 712) (citing Assemi, 7 Cal.4th
at p. 909.) 
 
Here, Counsel represented to the
court that a settlement has been reached and a stipulated settlement was to be
filed shortly before the court. (02/28/23 Minute Order.) Although Defendant
Harari made the first payment on March 2, 2023, Defendant McFadden did not make
a payment to Plaintiff. (Reply, Ex. 1.) Furthermore, at the March 22, 2023
hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel needed additional time to complete the settlement
between the parties. (03/22/2023 Minute Order.) Furthermore, Plaintiff’s
counsel indicated again to the court that the settlement was still pending
since Defendant Harari was deceased. (05/24/23 Minute Order.) Plaintiff’s counsel’s
argument that Defendants orally stipulated to the settlement agreement before
the court is mischaracterized. In Assemi, the parties informed Judge
Meyers that they affirmatively agreed with the terms of the settlement
agreement. (Assemi, 7 Cal.4th at p. 902.) In this case, the
parties did not inform Judge Chilton that they affirmatively agreed to the
terms of the settlement. The parties needed additional time to finalize
settlement because the stipulated settlement was not signed by any of the
Defendants. (Fine Decl., Ex. 1). The Court cannot enforce this settlement, as
it is not signed by all parties to the settlement. Therefore, the Court
concludes this settlement is not enforceable, as it was not signed by both
parties. 
 
 
IV.           
Conclusion & Order
 
For the
foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement under
California Code of Civil Procedure 664.6 is DENIED.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
