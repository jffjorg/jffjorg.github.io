 Case Number:  21STLC07451    Hearing Date:   September 27, 2023    Dept:  25  Ramirez  v. Espinoza  21stlc07451BACKGROUND                On October 13, 2021, Plaintiff Ruben  Sandoval Ramirez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Jose Luis  Espinoza and Myriam Espinoza (“Defendants”) for a negligence cause of action  related to a motor vehicle accident.                 On October 13, 2021, the court set a  date of April 12, 2023, at 8:30am for a non-Jury Trial.                On April 12, 2023,  Plaintiff failed to show up to the hearing.   On August 30, 2023,  Plaintiff filed the instant motion to set aside/vacate dismissal.    Grounds for Motion    Plaintiff moves to vacate the dismissal under CCP § 473(b) on the grounds  that the action was dismissed as a result of its attorney’s mistake and  inadvertence.    LEGAL STANDARD    “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or  her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding  taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or  excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy  of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the  application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,  in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or  proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b).)     The court has broad discretion to vacate the entry of default, default  judgment or a dismissal, but that discretion can be exercised only if the  defendant establishes a proper ground for relief, by the proper procedure and  within the set time limits. Pursuant to CCP section 473(b), a motion to set  aside/vacate cannot be brought more than 6 months after the entry of default  and must be made within a “reasonable time.”    CCP section 473(b) provides that when an application for relief is made  no more than six months after entry of dismissal and is accompanied by an  attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,  surprise, or neglect, the court shall set aside a dismissal entered against the  attorney’s client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not  in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b).) “The court shall, whenever relief is granted based  on an attorney's affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable  compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.”    Where an “attorney¿affidavit of fault” is filed, there is no requirement  that the¿attorney's¿mistake, inadvertence, or neglect be excusable.  Relief¿must¿be granted even where the default or dismissal resulted  from¿inexcusable¿neglect by defendant's¿attorney. (Robert E. Weil, et al.,  California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial ¶ 5:495 (2018).)    DISCUSSION    Plaintiff moves to vacate the dismissal under CCP  § 473(b) on the grounds that the action was dismissed as a result of its attorney’s  mistake and inadvertence.  Plaintiff’s  counsel admits that the failure to appear at the April 12, 2023, was a mistake  that was” [his] fault and only [his] fault as [he] is in charge of all files.” (Declaration  of James M. Hodges, ¶ 7.) Counsel attests that his only staff member of over 40  years had been hospitalized for multiple medical issues involving Lymphoma,  liver problems, hemoglobin problems, and COVID-19, which resulted in her  passing on August 11, 2022.  (Id., ¶ 6.)  Counsel states that the grief from his staff  member’s passing, the illness of his wife, and problems receiving mail at his  prior office all lead to the mis-calendaring of the Trial Date. (Id., ¶¶ 4,5,6,7.)  Counsel declares this statement to be true  under the penalty of perjury in the State of California.  (Id., at pg. 7.)  Further, as required by statute, the motion  was within the 6 months of the order.  Therefore,  Counsel attests that the order was due to his personal mistake and has filed an  affidavit of fault in support of his mistake.      CONCLUSION    Plaintiff submitted an attorney’s sworn  affidavit attesting to his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the  dismissal under CCP § 473(b) is GRANTED.The Court sets the following hearing:Order to Show Cause Re: Plaintiff's Failure to File Proof of Service of the Summons and Complaint is scheduled for December 6, 2023 at 9:30 a.m., in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse.Moving Party is to Give Notice.
