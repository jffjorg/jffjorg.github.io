Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's breach of contract claim. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to substantially comply with the Government Tort Claims Act and that the claim is therefore barred. The court also finds that the breach of contract claim is barred by Ed. Code § 81655, which requires approval or ratification of the alleged contract by the governing board. The court grants the plaintiff 10 days to amend her complaint to request declaratory or injunctive relief based on the defendant's failure to confer her degree, but notes that the plaintiff may not seek monetary damages without first complying with the claim presentation requirement of the Government Tort Claims Act.
