“[I]f summary judgment is granted on the ground
that the complaint is legally insufficient, but it appears from the materials
submitted in opposition to the motion that the plaintiff could state a cause of
action, the trial court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the
complaint before entry of judgment.” (Bostrom,
supra, 35 Cal.App.4th at p. 1663.)
