And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting Defendant BMW of North America, LLC's motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. The judge requires Plaintiff Kyleen Pray to provide verified responses to the interrogatories and produce responsive documents within 20 days of the order. The judge is also granting Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $830.00 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel of record. The judge notes that Defendant combined two sets of discovery into one motion, which is not permitted by law. Therefore, the judge is conditioning the grant of the motion as to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Defendant paying the separate motion filing fee within five days of the order. If Defendant fails to pay the fee, the motion will be denied without prejudice.
