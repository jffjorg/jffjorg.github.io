Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against Defendant Jose Juan Gutierrez without prejudice. The Plaintiff's request is defective because it lacks documentary evidence to support the amount of damages claimed. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's declaration alone is not sufficient to prove damages, and that the Plaintiff must provide more details or documentary evidence to support the amount of damages sought. The case involves a construction contract dispute, and the Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $81,770.00, interest in the amount of $3,136.00, attorney fees in the amount of $2,525.40, and costs in the amount of $582.07. The Judge requires the Plaintiff to provide more evidence to support their claim for damages before considering a default judgment.
