 Case Number:  24PSCV00222    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiffs  Javier Hernandez and Alicia B. Hernandez’s Request for Entry of Default  Judgment  Defendant: Jose Juan Gutierrez  COURT RULING            Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.            BACKGROUND                         This  is a construction contract dispute. On January 22, 2024, plaintiffs Javier  Hernandez (Javier) and Alicia B. Hernandez (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed  this action against defendants Jose Juan Gutierrez (Jose), Luis Gutierrez, Refugio  Reyes-Mireles, an individual also doing business as Reyes Pools, and Does 1 to  20, alleging causes of action for breach of written contract, common count,  rescission & restitution, unfair business practices B&P 17200,  negligence, and breach of implied warranty.               On April 2, 2024,  default was entered against Jose. On May 29, 2024, Plaintiffs dismissed Luis  Gutierrez, Refugio Reyes-Mireles, and Does 1 to 20. On June 10, 2024,  Plaintiffs requested entry of default judgment against Jose.  LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS  Plaintiffs seek  default judgment against Defendant Jose in the total amount of $88,013.47,  including $81,770.00 in damages, $3,136.00 in interest, $2,525.40 in attorney  fees, and $582.07 in costs. The Court finds the request for entry of default  judgment defective, as it is not supported by any documentary evidence of  damages suffered. Plaintiff Javier Hernandez’s declaration alone is not  sufficient to prove damages. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b). [“The court shall hear the evidence offered  by the plaintiff, and shall render judgment in the  plaintiff's favor for that relief,  not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint… as appears by the evidence to be just.”]) In the context  of a request for entry of default judgment by the court, evidence to establish  liability is not required since a defendant’s failure to answer the complaint  admits the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint and no further proof of  liability is required. (Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 879,  883.) However, the “only additional proof required for a default judgment is  that needed to establish damages.” (Id., at p. 884.)  Plaintiffs ask for principal damages in  the amount of $81,770.00, purportedly comprised of $49,820.00 paid to Jose and  third parties at the direction of Jose, plus $31,950.00 for third parties they were  forced to hired to remove and correct all of the defective work performed by Jose.  (Hernandez Decl., ¶¶ 8, 17.) Plaintiffs did not provide any documentary  evidence to prove that they paid the amounts they claim to have paid. Javier’s  declaration only contains a contract for the construction service agreement  between Plaintiffs and Jose. (Id., Ex. 1.) Javier’s declaration also  lacks specificity regarding the payments made. (See Hernandez Decl., ¶¶ 8, 17.)  Plaintiffs must provide documentary evidence or at least more details in their  declarations to support the amount of damages they seek here. (See Cal. Rules  of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(2) [“Declarations  or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested”].)  CONCLUSION                          Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
