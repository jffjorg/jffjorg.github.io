And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. The Plaintiff's request is defective because it is not supported by any documentary evidence of damages suffered. The Plaintiff's declaration alone is not sufficient to prove damages. The Plaintiff must provide documentary evidence or at least more details in their declarations to support the amount of damages they seek.
