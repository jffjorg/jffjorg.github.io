**Case Summary**

Case Number: 23STCV15571

**Facts**

Janet Dixon, the plaintiff, sued The People Concern, the defendant, alleging that the defendant served her meat despite her dietary needs, which caused her harm. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to prevent the defendant from serving her meat and requests relocation to a hotel and compensation for relocation costs.

**Procedural History**

The plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction on April 5, 2024, and the defendant failed to timely file an opposition to the motion. The court granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a proposed complaint on April 3, 2024.

**Ruling**

The court denied the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the merits and failed to show the inadequacy of a legal remedy. The court noted that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action, and that money damages would likely provide an adequate remedy.

**Conclusion**

The court denied the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction, and the plaintiff's request for relief was denied.
