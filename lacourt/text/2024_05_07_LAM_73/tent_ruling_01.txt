TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is DENIED. 
 
Background
 
On December
2, 2019, Plaintiff Ashley Aarons, individually and as trustee of the Ashley
Aarons 2015 Trust dated May 15, 2015, (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants: Alliance Portfolio Private Equity Finance, Inc. (“Alliance”);
George Wong, Trustee of the George Wong Retirement Plan (“Wong”); Robert N.
Cleaves and Emmy S. Cleaves, Trustees of the Cleaves Family Trust (“Robert and
Emmy Cleaves”); Hal Dryan, Trustee of the Geoffrey Michael Dryan 2009
Irrevocable Trust Dated June 9, 2009 (“Dryan”); and Ray Gokaldas, Trustee of
the Ray Gokaldas MD A Professional Corp Profit Sharing Plan Trust Dated January
1, 2013 (“Gokaldas”). 
 
On December
20, 2021, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint alleging causes of action
for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing, (3) negligence, (4) fraud, (5) cancellation of instruments,
(6) quiet title, (7) declaratory relief, (8) unfair business practices, (9) accounting,
and (10) wrongful foreclosure. On December 20, 2021, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint. Plaintiff filed 17 requests for entry of default. The clerk
rejected all of them. On July 8, 2022, the clerk rejected Plaintiff’s three
applications for service by publication. Plaintiff was represented by counsel
from May 3, 2020 to April 20, 2023. Plaintiff has also been represented by
counsel on a limited scope basis in connection with the hearings on this
motion. On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed seven DOE amendments to her
complaint.
 
On June 5,
2023, Defendants Alliance; County Records; George Wong, Trustee of the George
Wong Retirement Plan; Robert N. Cleaves and Emmy S. Cleaves, Trustees of the
Cleaves Family Trust; and Ray Gokaldas, Trustee of the Ray Gokaldas MD A
Professional Corp Profit Sharing Plan Trust Dated January 1, 2013, filed a
motion to dismiss. 
 
On February
7, 2024, the Court dismissed the action with prejudice as to Defendants Robert
and Emmy Cleaves, Wong and Gokaldas in their capacities as trustees under Code
of Civil Procedure section 583.210 based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve these
Defendants within three years. The court did not dismiss the action as to
Defendants County Records and Alliance.
 
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff moves the Court for
reconsideration of its February 7, 2024 order. The February 7, 2024 order dismissed
the action with prejudice as to Defendants Robert and Emmy Cleaves, Wong and
Gokaldas in their capacities as trustees under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210 based on Plaintiff’s failure to
serve these Defendants within three years. 
On March
4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Errata to her Motion for Reconsideration,
stating that she inadvertently left out exhibits, table of contents and
authorities from her Motion and that she corrected grammatical errors.
Defendants
did not file an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion. Plaintiff did not file a
reply.
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Review by a
Different Judge
 
As an initial matter, the Court addresses whether
a judge who did not make the initial ruling can consider this motion.
 
Generally, a motion for reconsideration must be
made to the same judge.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a); Marriage of
Oliverez (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1248.)  “However, there are
narrow exceptions to this general rule.”  (Marriage of Oliverez, supra,
238 Cal.App.4th at 1248.)  “‘[W]here the judge who made the initial
ruling is unavailable to reconsider the motion, a different judge may entertain
the reconsideration motion.’”  (Id. (quoting Ziller Electronics
Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232) (alteration in
original).)  “Another exception is when the facts have changed or when the
judge has considered further evidence and law.”  (Id.) 
“Additionally, a second judge may reverse a prior ruling of another judge if
the record shows that it was based on inadvertence, mistake, or fraud.”  (Id.
at 1248-49.)  “Mere disagreement . . . with the prior trial judge’s
ruling, however, is not enough to overturn that ruling.”  (Id. at
1249.)   
 
Here, Plaintiff’s motion moves for
reconsideration of the February 7, 2024 order made in this Department,
Department 73, by Judge Timothy Dillon. However, the Court finds that Judge
Dillon is unavailable to hear the instant Motion due to his temporary
reassignment to another Department. Therefore, the Court finds that the assigned
judge to Department 73, Judge Rolf Treu, may consider this motion. 
 
B.     Legal
Standard 
 
The moving party must present new facts,
circumstances or law in order to grant a motion for reconsideration.  (See
CCP § 1008(a); see also Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th
1338, 1342.)  The party seeking reconsideration of an order shall state by
affidavit what application was made before, what order or decisions were made,
and what new or different facts or circumstances are claimed to be shown. 
(CCP § 1008(a).)  Further, “…the party seeking reconsideration must
provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.” (Glade v. Glade
(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457 [emphasis added].)  The legislative
intent was to restrict motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a
party offers the court some fact or circumstance not previously considered and
some valid reason for not offering it earlier. (Gilberd v. AC Transit
(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.) 
 
C.     Application
 
Plaintiff
argues there are new or different facts that were not previously considered by
the Court in its determination of the February 7, 2024 order and that they
could affect its ruling. 
 
This Court’s February
7, 2024 order found that since Defendants
Robert and Emmy Cleaves, Wong and Gokaldas were not served within three years
of the action being filed, the Court is required to dismiss the action as to
these Defendants pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 583.210 and 583.250. Plaintiff argued
that the action was stayed by a federal District Court
ordered injunction and when her bankruptcy proceedings were
converted from a Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Plaintiff argues that the
bankruptcy trustee had control over her assets and this case should be tolled
during that period. However, as the Court stated in its order, even when a
bankruptcy trustee has control over a plaintiff’s assets, courts have found
that plaintiffs are still expected to prosecute the case with reasonable
diligence. (A. Groppe & Sons Glass Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. (1991) 232 Cal. App. 3d 220,
226.) Therefore, the Court found Plaintiff failed to meet her burden of showing her action
was stayed and the stay affected service. 
CCP § 1008 allows
a motion to reconsider to be granted when it is based on an alleged different
state of facts, demands newly discovered evidence that the moving party could
not, with reasonable diligence, have previously discovered and produced. (Wilcox
v. Ford (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1170.) Here, Plaintiff fails to
present the court with any facts or evidence that she could not, with
reasonable diligence, have previously discovered and produced at the
hearing. Instead,
Plaintiff appears to rely on the same arguments raised in her original
opposition. For example, Plaintiff raises the same argument that the bankruptcy
trustee had control over her assets and the case should have been tolled during
that period. Plaintiff asserts in her motion that she has correspondence between
the bankruptcy trustee and her counsel showing that the trustee had control
over her assets. However, as the Court stated in its February 7, 2024 order, “plaintiff
could have sought an order compelling the trustee to maintain the action. If
the bankruptcy court, deferring to the chapter 11 trustee's business judgment,
denied the motion, then plaintiff would have made a record demonstrating that
it was ‘impossible, impracticable, or futile due to causes beyond the
plaintiff's control’ to serve defendant.” (Court’s 2/7/24 Order, p. 13.)
Plaintiff’s motion does not provide new evidence that Plaintiff sought an order
compelling the trustee to maintain the action. In her motion, Plaintiff also
argues that her case is different from Danielson v. ITT Industrial Credit
Co. (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 645 and other cases that the court cited in its
February 7, 2024 order. However, Plaintiff’s argument does not constitute newly
discovered facts or evidence not previously considered by the Court. Further, all
of the legal citations relied on by Plaintiff in her motion were available to
her at the time she filed her original opposition. The Court finds that
Plaintiff has not presented facts or evidence that she could not have
previously discovered and produced at the hearing that could affect the Court’s
prior ruling.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court does not grant Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration.
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is
DENIED.
