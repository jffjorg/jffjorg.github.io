```

And here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees and costs. The motion was filed late, as the court's clerk did not serve the notice of entry of judgment until December 13, 2023, and the plaintiffs' motion was filed on February 20, 2024. The court also found that the refiling of the notice of entry of judgment on January 8, 2024, did not restart the time for the plaintiffs to file their motion. Therefore, the motion was untimely and must be denied.
