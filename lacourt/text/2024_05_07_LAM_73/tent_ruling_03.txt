Here,
Plaintiffs have complied with all requirements for a default judgment.  
 
Plaintiffs
submitted the declaration of Kevin Wilson, the Chief Financial Officer of Seven
Zero Seven and Payne’s. Wilson provided a summary of the case and also attached
the invoices showing the past due payments for the Seven Zero Seven Order and
Payne’s Order. (Wilson Decl., ¶¶
6-18.) Plaintiffs also submitted the declaration of Plaintiffs’ counsel, Lance
Rogers, providing the calculations of the costs. For instance, the
Attorney’s Fees claimed for this case were calculated using Los Angeles
Superior Court Local Rule 3.214 which provides that for default cases over
$100,000, Attorney's Fees are calculated by adding $5,270 to 2% of the excess
over $100,000. (Wilson Decl., ¶ 2.) Here, the outstanding invoice balance
owed by the Defendant is $105,430.20. (Ibid.) Therefore, the attorney's
fees are $5,378.60 (as calculated $5,270 + [.02 x $5,430.20] = $5,378.60). (Ibid.)
In addition, interest on the invoices of both orders was calculated based on
the maximum statutory interest rate of 10%. (Wilson Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) Interest
on the Seven Zero Seven invoice is calculated as follows: ($8,496.26 x .10/12 x
52 months past due = $3,681.71). (Ibid.) Interest on the Payne’s invoice
is calculated as follows: ($96,933.94 x .10/12 x 52 months past due=
$42,004.70). (Ibid.)
 
For
the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs request for default judgment.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs request for default judgment.
