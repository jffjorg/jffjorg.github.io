I. BACKGROUND
 
On June 20,
2018, plaintiffs Shonna Marie Counter, Garry Michael Kann, Mark Frankel,
Douglas Fauth, Herminio Escobar, Shaina Negron, Tyler Hilliman, Samuel Saez
III, Gary Brian Bloom, Keith Milo, Ryan Cahouet, and Malik Jeter (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendants Kaf Industries, Inc., (“Kaf
Inc.”) and Kevin Farhang (“Farhang”).  
 
On February
10, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
against Kaf Inc. and Farhang asserting the following causes of action: 
 
1.              
Negligence.  
2.              
Premises liability.  
3.              
Nuisance.  
4.              
Negligent failure to provide habitable
premises.  
5.              
Breach of implied warranty of
habitability.  
6.              
Excessive collection of rent (Los
Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) § 151.041 et 
seq.). 
7.              
Breach of covenant of quiet
enjoyment.  
8.              
Intentional infliction of emotional
distress.  
9.              
Collection of rent on a substandard
dwelling (Civil Code § 1942.4). 
10.           
Failure to pay relocation
assistance.  
11.           
Respondeat superior.  
12.           
Violation of Unruh Civil Rights
Act.  
 
Before
Plaintiffs filed their SAC, defendant Farhang filed a Cross-Complaint against
Plaintiffs and cross-defendants Larissa Shadchina and Cliff Brodsky, on October
28, 2019, asserting the following causes of action: 
 
1.              
Indemnity. 
2.              
Apportionment of fault. 
3.              
Waste. 
4.              
Negligence. 
5.              
Declaratory relief. 
 
On December 13,
2023, following a jury trial, the Court entered judgment for Plaintiffs against
Defendants, specifically on the causes of action for excessive collection of
rent and failure to pay relocation assistance. Cross-Complainant Farhang prevailed
against Cross-Defendant Ryan Calhout on a cause of action for negligence.
 
A.    
Allegations in Plaintiffs’ SAC
 
The SAC
alleges the following. This action concerns properties located at 1643-16545 of
S. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles, California (the “Building”). (SAC, ¶ 1,
6-17.)  
 
Farhang is
the owner and manager of the Building. (SAC, ¶ 19.) Larissa Shadchina
(“Shadchina”) was Farhang’s property manager. (SAC, ¶ 3.) Shadchina used
websites such as Homeaway.com and Airbnb.com, as well as personal referrals, to
enter into sub-leases with numerous individuals. (SAC, ¶ 136.) Shadchina agreed
to pay Farhang about one half of rent moneys she received from sub-tenants
residing in the premises. (SAC, ¶ 136.)  
 
The Building
was constructed in 1958, and never intended to be a residential property. (SAC,
¶ 25.) Indeed, after Farhang took over ownership of the Building in 2006 but
before 2017, he rented out the units to many retail businesses, including an
illegal massage parlor that was raided and shut down by the police. (SAC, ¶
26.) 
 
After the
massage parlor business failed, that section of the Building was illegally
converted into 12 cramped and illegal residential units. (SAC, ¶¶ 1, 27.)
Farhang began renting what would have been massage rooms as residential
apartments. (SAC, ¶ 27.) Despite changing the property from a commercial to a
residential building, Farhang failed to obtain permits to convert the Building
to residential units. (SAC, ¶ 27.) He also failed to make the Building safe for
human occupancy. (SAC, ¶ 27.) 
 
Plaintiffs
(each of them individually) entered into a landlord-tenant relationship with
Farhang in 2017 for some, and 2018 for others. (SAC, ¶¶ 6-17.) By virtue of the
landlord-tenant relationship and oral lease agreements, Farhang owed Plaintiffs
a duty to maintain the Building in a habitable condition. (SAC, ¶ 73.) Instead,
the Building had no running water, had a defective plumbing system, did not
have adequate security, was infested with cockroaches, bed bugs, and rodents,
among other conditions. (SAC, ¶¶ 28-32.) In addition, on or about May 21, 2018,
Shadchina turned off the electricity and attempted to flee the building without
explanation, running over one of the Plaintiffs with her vehicle. (SAC, ¶ 3.)
As a result of the Building’s dilapidated conditions and pest infestations, the
Plaintiffs suffered a range of health of problems, including bed bug bites,
asthma, serious allergies, frequent colds, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and
nosebleeds. (SAC, ¶ 32.) Those that had disabilities saw their conditions
exacerbated. (SAC, ¶ 32.) Nevertheless, despite (1) those deplorable conditions
and (2) the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (“LADBS”) issuing a
Substandard Order and Notice of Fee (indicating that the Building was not
approved for residential housing and, therefore, could not collect rent from
the “tenants”), Farhang charged, and Plaintiffs paid exorbitant rents, up to
$2,000 per month. (SAC, ¶¶ 4, 34.) Therefore, Plaintiffs are bringing this
action to vindicate their rights and to redress the physical, emotional, and
economic injuries they have suffered. (SAC, ¶ 4.) 
 
B.    
Allegations in Farhang’s Cross-Complaint
 
Brodsky and
Shadchina communicated to Farhang their desire to create a short-term
“Airbnb-type” rental program in the Building, which the cross-defendants would
personally manage and oversee. (XC, ¶ 20.) Therefore, in approximately January
2017, Farhang and the cross-defendants entered into a verbal agreement to lease
a section of the Building. (Farhang’s Cross-Complaint (“XC”), ¶ 20.)  
 
The
cross-defendants represented to Farhang that they would faithfully discharge
their duty to protect and maintain the Building. (XC, ¶ 39.) Instead, as
illustrated through photographs and other documentary evidence, the
cross-defendants caused extensive damage in excess of $40,000. (XC, ¶¶ 21, 42.)
Those damages included damage to the Building’s furniture, flooring, carpeting,
and electrical components. (XC, ¶ 22.) As a result of the damages, Farhang has
been prevented from leasing the Building to interest third parties and lost
income. (XC, ¶ 23.) 
 
C.     The Parties’
Arguments
 
On
February 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Award of Attorneys’ fees and costs, arguing:
·      
As prevailing parties, Plaintiffs are entitled to attorney fees
and costs under the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance
("LARSO") Cal. Municipal Code $ 151.10
·      
Plaintiffs seek attorneys’ fees and costs, in
the amount of 1) $268,850 as attorneys' fees for Binh Bui, 2) costs of
$55,280.80 for Binh Bui; 3) attorneys' fees of $244,150 for Michael Stoller.
o   Due to the
contingent nature of Plaintiffs’ fee agreement and delay in receiving payment,
a 2.0 enhancement multiplier is warranted. Thus, after applying an enhancement
multiplier of 2.0, the fee award totals $ 1,025,800 (1080 hours x $475.00). 
·      
Plaintiffs request a total award of $ 1,081,080.80 in fees and
costs
 
On
April 16, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition, arguing:
·       Plaintiffs
motion must be denied because they failed to timely file their motion.
o   Plaintiffs
were required to file their motion 60 days after the
Notice of Entry of Judgment was served on December 13, 2023. (California Rules
of Court Rule 8.104(a)(1).) Here, Plaintiffs filed their motion more than 60
days after. 
·       Plaintiffs
also never filed a memorandum of costs. Memorandum of Costs must be filed within
15 days after the date of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the
clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of
written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after
entry of judgment, whichever is first. (California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1700). 
·       The fees that
Plaintiffs are requesting are also unreasonably inflated and Plaintiffs are
seeking reimbursement for costs not covered by statute.
 
On
April 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a reply, arguing:
·      
The motion is
timely because a second Notice of Entry of Judgment was filed on January 8, 2024,
which restarted the Rule 3.1702 clock. Further, even using the original
December 13, 2023, filing date, Plaintiffs motion was filed 65 days after the
entry of judgment and is timely.
·      
The Court has the discretion to consider the late filed memorandum
of costs
·      
It was improper for Defendants’ counsel discuss mediation and
settlement discussions in their opposition.
 
On
April 12, 2024, Plaintiffs also filed a Memorandum of Costs. 
 
II.DISCUSSION
 
A.    
Legal Standard 
 
CCP §§ 1032 and 1033.5 provide that a prevailing party may
recover its costs as a matter of right, and that those costs may include attorneys’
fees when authorized by statute or contract. 
 
California Municipal Code section 151. 10 provides: “Any person
who demands, accepts or retains any payment of rent in excess of the maximum
rent or maximum adjusted rent in violation of the provisions of this chapter.
or any regulations or orders promulgated hereunder, shall be liable in a civil
action to the person from whom such payment is demanded, accepted or retained
for damages of three times the amount by which the payment or payments demanded,
accepted or retained exceed the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent which
could be lawfully demanded, accepted or retained together with reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs as determined by the court."
 
“[A]bsent
circumstances rendering the award unjust, an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent,
including those relating solely to the fee.  We explained that the purpose
behind statutory fee authorizations—i.e., encouraging attorneys to act as
private attorneys general and to vindicate important rights affecting the
public interest—will often be frustrated, sometimes nullified, if awards are
diluted or dissipated by lengthy, uncompensated proceedings to fix or defend a
rightful fee claim.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1133-34 (emphasis in original).)  “The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.... The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Id. at 1134.) Other factors to consider in fixing the
reasonableness of fees to be considered beyond the fee agreement alone include,
but are not limited to “(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the
legal service properly; (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of the
particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3) the fee
customarily charged in this locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount
involved and the results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the
circumstances; and (6) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or
lawyers performing the services.” (Glendora Community Redevelopment
Agency v. Demeter (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 465, 470.)
 
B.    
Timeliness
 
Defendants argue the motion must be denied because Plaintiffs
failed to timely file their motion.
 
California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1702(b)(1) provides the motion for a claim of attorneys’
fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial
court must be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal
under California Rules of Court Rules 8.104 and 8.108.  The deadline is mandatory. (Community
Youth Athletic Center v. City of National City (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385,
1444.) California Rules of Court Rule 8.104(a)(1) provides that unless
provided otherwise, a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest
of “(A) 60 days after the superior court clerk serves on the party filing the
notice of appeal a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a
filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, showing the date either was served; (B) 60
days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party
with a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy
of the judgment, showing the date either was served; or (C) 180 days after
entry of judgment.”  California Rules of Court Rule 8.108 provides
situations in which the time to appeal prescribed in Rule 8.104(a) is extended,
such as when a motion for a new trial, to vacate judgment, for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict, a cross-appeal, or a motion to reconsider an
appealable order is filed. 
 
Here,
the Clerk of the Court served by mail on all parties the Notice of Entry of
Judgment on December 13, 2023.  None of the situations described in
California Rules of Court Rule 8.108 apply to extend the time to file the
motion and there is also no stipulation is on record by the parties extending
the time to file the motion.  Therefore, the motion for attorneys’ fees
was required to be filed and served 60 days after December 13, 2023, with an
extra five calendar days added for mailing of the Notice of Entry of Judgment
to parties within the State of California.  (See CCP § 1005(b).) 
Thus, Defendants’ motion must have been filed and served no later than February
16, 2024.  However, Defendants did not file the motion with the Court
until February 20, 2024. While Plaintiffs argue their motion was timely
because it was filed 65 days after December 13, 2023, this is incorrect as
February 20, 2024 is 69 days after December 13, 2023. Thus, the motion is
untimely and must be denied. 
 
Plaintiffs also
argue that the motion was timely because they refiled the Notice of Entry of
Judgment on January 8, 2024, which extended the deadline to file Plaintiffs
motion. Plaintiffs contend that on January 8, 2024, the Court clerk contacted
Plaintiffs counsel and advised them that the Entry of Judgment was defective. (Stoller
Decl., ¶ 2.) The Clerk told counsel that he
needed to refile and serve the Notice of Entry of Judgment. (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs argue that because they refiled and served the Notice of Entry of
Judgment on January 8, 2024, Plaintiffs had 60 days after January 8 to file
their motion, which would have made the motion due on March 13, 2024. Plaintiffs
cite to Torres v. City of San Diego (2007) 154 Cal. App. 4th 214
in support of their contention that a new appeal period starts to run if there
is an amended final judgment that was refiled. However, the Torres court
held that a new appeal period only starts to run if the amended judgment
substantially changed the judgment, not if it simply corrected a clerical
error. (Torres, supra, 154 Cal. App. 4th at 222.) The Torres
court stated: 
 
“For example, an order amending a
judgment to reflect the correct name of a party ... substantially
changes the judgment and therefore starts a new appeal time period (for an
appeal from the amended judgment). It is well settled, however, that where the
judgment is modified merely to add costs, attorney fees and interest, the
original judgment is not substantially changed and the time to appeal it is
therefore not affected.” 
(Ibid.)
 
Here,
Plaintiffs do not show how the amended judgment was amended in a substantial
way. Rather, it appears the judgement that was filed on January 8, 2024 is the
same as the December 13, 2023 judgment and it was simply refiled due to
clerical error. Thus, the Court does not find that the refiled judgment on
January 8, 2024 restarted the time for Plaintiffs to file their motion. Since
Plaintiffs did not timely file their motion 65 days after the Notice of Entry of Judgment on December 13, 2023, the
motion must be denied. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
Motion for Award of Attorneys’ fees and costs is
DENIED.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Award
of Attorneys’ fees and costs is DENIED.
