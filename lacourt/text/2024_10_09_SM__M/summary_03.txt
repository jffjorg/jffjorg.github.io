And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Counsel Jeffrey Mann's motion to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendant Harry Hutchinson. The motion was granted because the attorney-client relationship has broken down irreparably, and the client will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal, as trial is not set. The judge notes that Counsel Mann must serve the client with the order and provide notice of any upcoming hearing dates, including the hearing for the writ of attachment set for January 8, 2025. The order will be effective once proof of service is filed.
