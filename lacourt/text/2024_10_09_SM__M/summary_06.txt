And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses four demurrers filed by defendant Cooper Companies, Inc. against four separate complaints brought by pseudonymous plaintiffs for personal injuries arising from defendant's allegedly defective fertility products. The demurrers argue that the complaints do not state a cause of action because Cooper Companies was not a direct actor and the complaints do not allege facts to support indirect liability through the conduct of its subsidiary.

The Judge concludes that the complaints do state a cause of action against Cooper Companies, as they allege that the company manufactured, designed, manufactured, distributed, and/or sold the embryo cultures at issue, and knew or should have known that the recalled embryo culture media posed an unreasonable risk to human embryos.

Regarding the motion to strike punitive damages, the Judge rules that the motion is granted with leave to amend. The Judge concludes that the specific facts alleged in the complaint do not allow for an inference of despicable conduct, as plaintiff does not allege when the managing agents learned of the defects such that they "deliberately" continued to manufacture, sell and not recall the embryo media after learning of the defects.
