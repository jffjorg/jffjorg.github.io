MOTION:                     Demurrer to the
Complaint  
HEARING DATE:   10/9/2024
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant the Regents
of the University of California demurs to Plaintiff Louis Frederick Montcho’s Complaint.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s Complaint is uncertain and unintelligible.
Indeed, the Complaint states a collection of facts which does not state any comprehensibly
claim for relief. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff noticed a painful lump
on his chest and waited at the UCLA Reagan Medical Center for over 8 hours
before seeing a doctor. The doctor was confused and lacked knowledge as to what
the treatment should be. Since the first blood test was done incorrectly,
Plaintiff underwent two blood tests. Plaintiff also underwent an MRI. Plaintiff
was not offered any medication until after Plaintiff cried for relief.
Plaintiff alleges a “mini surgery” was done. Plaintiff alleges that pictures will
show that the wound was not covered properly and was exposed to bacteria. After
he went home, Plaintiff continued to bleed heavily and had to wipe blood from
his infected chest. As a result, Plaintiff was in pain for two weeks and lost
one of his largest business accounts.  
 
Examining these
allegations, Defendant cannot fairly tell what claims, if any, are directed
against it and on what basis. Thus, the complaint runs afoul of section
430.10(f). Moreover, the formatting of the Complaint does not comply with California
Rules of Court, rules 2.108 (spacing), 2.110 (footer), 2.1111 (format of first
page), or 2.112 (delineation of separate causes of action). Accordingly, the
demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Plaintiff has 30 days
to file an amended complaint.
