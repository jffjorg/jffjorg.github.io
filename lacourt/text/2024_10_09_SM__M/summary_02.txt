And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering four separate demurrers filed by Cooper Companies against four separate complaints alleging personal injuries arising from allegedly defective fertility products. Cooper Companies argues that the complaints do not state a cause of action because they do not allege facts to support indirect liability through the conduct of its subsidiary, CooperSurgical. The judge finds that the complaints do state a direct cause of action against Cooper Companies, as they allege that the company manufactured, designed, marketed, and sold the defective embryo culture media.

The judge also considers a motion to strike punitive damages claimed by Plaintiff AH. The judge finds that punitive damages require specific facts to support a claim, and that the complaints do not plead sufficient facts to support a claim of despicable conduct. The judge grants the motion to strike punitive damages with leave to amend.

Overall, the judge is overruling the demurrers and granting the motion to strike punitive damages with leave to amend.
