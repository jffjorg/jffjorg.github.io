And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant, The Regents of the University of California, has successfully demurred to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Louis Frederick Montcho. The complaint is uncertain and unintelligible, and the defendant cannot fairly determine what claims are directed against it and on what basis. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, giving the plaintiff 30 days to file an amended complaint. The judge has also pointed out that the formatting of the complaint does not comply with California Rules of Court, and that the plaintiff will need to correct these defects in any amended complaint.
