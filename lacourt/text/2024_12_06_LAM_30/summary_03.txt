And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for substitution of successor in interest, filed by Melanie Yadegar (Successor) to be substituted into the present action as cross-complainant in place of Farideh Zakaryaie (Decedent). The judge finds that, as the cause of action survives the death of the Decedent, the Successor may continue the Decedent's action. The judge also rejects the Cross-defendant's argument that the Successor is estopped from substituting, as the Cross-defendant failed to open a probate estate and the Successor has properly satisfied the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32.
