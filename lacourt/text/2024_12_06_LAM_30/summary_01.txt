The defendant, Jeanne Guy, has claimed that she was not properly served with the summons or complaint and has submitted a proposed answer to the plaintiff's complaint as required under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The plaintiff, Louis Edward Siggins, has not opposed the motion or submitted contrary evidence demonstrating proper service on the defendant. The judge credits the defendant's evidence and determines that the default judgment is void due to improper service. As a result, the judge grants the motion and orders the defendant to answer within ten days of the date of the ruling.
