And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant the Defendant's motion to stay the proceedings and vacate the current trial date pending the completion of the Plaintiff's bankruptcy proceedings. The Plaintiff filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on February 9, 2024, and the Defendant argues that the proceedings should be stayed to ensure that the Plaintiff's bankruptcy is resolved before a judgment is entered against the Plaintiff. The Judge finds that staying the proceedings is in the interests of justice and will promote judicial efficiency. The Judge notes that the automatic stay in bankruptcy law applies to the proceedings, and that the Defendant may be at risk of incurring litigation costs without any opportunity for compensation upon victory if the proceedings are not stayed.
