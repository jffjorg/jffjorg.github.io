And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff. The motion was unopposed by the plaintiff. The cross-complaint arises out of a release agreement signed by the plaintiff, which purports to release the defendant from the causes of action brought by the plaintiff. The defendant seeks to bring a counterclaim for breach of the release agreement. The judge found that the defendant has acted in good faith in attempting to resolve the matter informally and has notified the plaintiff of the potential counterclaim. The judge granted the motion because the cross-complaint is compulsory, as it arises out of the same transaction as the plaintiff's claim, and the defendant has acted in good faith. The defendant must file and serve the cross-complaint within 10 days of the date of the ruling.
