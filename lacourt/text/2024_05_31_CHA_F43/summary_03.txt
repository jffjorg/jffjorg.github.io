And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion for relief from waiver of discovery objections filed by Defendant Picture Build Corp. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents (Set One), which was served on January 19, 2024. Defendant Picture Build Corp. argued that the response deadline was miscalendared as January 30, 2024, rather than January 19, 2024. The court found that Defendant Picture Build Corp. provided substantially code-compliant responses to the Request for Production of Documents (Set One) and that the failure to serve a timely response was the result of a reasonable mistake. The court also noted that no depositions have been taken and that the trial is currently set for a year from now, giving Plaintiff ample time to conduct and request discovery. Therefore, the court found that relief from waiver of discovery objections would not be improper at this time.
