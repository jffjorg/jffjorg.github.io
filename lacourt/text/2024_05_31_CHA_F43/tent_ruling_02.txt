SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
February 5, 2024, Plaintiff John Labidi (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against
Defendant John Bratton (Defendant) for unlawful detainer. 
 
The
Complaint alleges Plaintiff is the owner of the premises located at 17011
Gledhill Street, Northridge, CA 91325 (the Premises). (Compl., ¶¶3(a), 4.) The
Complaint further alleges on May 10, 2021, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into
a written agreement for Defendant to rent the Premises for $7,200.00 per month.
The Complaint also alleges on January 30, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant a
three-day notice to pay rent or quit. (Compl., ¶9(a), 10(a)(3).) On February 2,
2024, Defendant failed to comply with the notice. (Compl., ¶9(b).) At the time
the three-day notice was served, Defendant owed past-due rent in the amount of
$50,600.00. (Compl., ¶12.)
 
On
April 30, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer and motion to strike. On
May 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a late-opposition. A timely opposition pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b) would have been May 17, 2024. A
timely reply was due May 23, 2024, none had been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Demurrer
to Complaint
 
Defendant
argues Plaintiff has failed to allege the date the premises were constructed.
As such, Defendant contends it is unable to evaluate the fair market value of
the property, where Plaintiff demands a significant some in damages on an
expedited basis by using the unlawful detainer procedure. Furthermore,
Defendant argues Plaintiff has failed to allege that they have complied with
the applicable requirements of the local eviction ordinance in the Complaint. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues no law requires it allege the date the premises
were constructed. Plaintiff also argues the Complaint complies with the
requisite pleading requirements because Plaintiff does not allege the premises
is subject to the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 under Civil Code section
1946.2. Thus, Plaintiff asserts it does not have to allege just cause for
terminating Defendant’s tenancy. 
 
“The primary function of a
pleading is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare its case
[citation], and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party
cannot be said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa
Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)¿
 
“A¿demurrer¿tests the legal
sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America,
N.A.¿(2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether “the
complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a
complete defense.” (Id.) The Court does not “read passages from a
complaint in isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer, we read the
complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.) The Court
“assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations, facts that
reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded and matters of which
judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56 Cal.4th p. 240.)
“The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)¿¿¿ 
¿
A general demurrer may be brought
under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if insufficient
facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under section
430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of
the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in
Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special
demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).)¿¿¿ 
¿
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.)¿¿
 
Generally, “[t]he basic elements of unlawful detainer
for nonpayment of rent ... are (1) the tenant is in possession of the premises;
(2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in default for
nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a written
three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day notice
period has elapsed.” (KB Salt Lake III, LLC v. Fitness Int'l, LLC, (2023)
95 Cal. App. 5th 1032, 1045.) However, when a property is subject to the Tenant Protection Act of
2019 under Civil Code section 1946.2, “[t]o plead a valid unlawful detainer
claim, the complaint must allege that the tenancy was terminated for “just
cause.” (Attenello v. Basilious (2022) 88 Cal. App. 5th Supp. 1, 6.)
 
Here, Defendant cites to case law
that does not support his contention Plaintiff must allege the date the
premises were constructed. For instance, in Harris v. Bissell (1921) 54
Cal. App. 307, the court held “[s]ince the action is not upon contract but for
recovery of possession and, incidentally, for the damages occasioned by the
unlawful detainer, such rental value may be greater or less than the rent
provided for in the lease.” (Harris v. Bissell (1921) 54 Cal. App. 307,
312–13.) Furthermore, the Complaint alleges that the subject property/premises
is not subject to Tenant Protection Act of 2019 under Civil Code section
1946.2. (Compl., ¶7(a).) As such, Plaintiff is not required to allege the
tenancy was terminated for just cause. Moreover, the Complaint alleges
Defendant is in possession of the premises, without permission. (Compl., ¶¶ 12;
19(a)-(c).) Additionally, the Complaint alleges Defendant is in default for
nonpayment of rent set at $7,200.00 per month. (Compl., ¶6(a)(2).) The
Complaint also alleges Defendant was properly served with a written three-day
notice and has continued to be in default after the three-day notice period has
elapsed. (Compl., ¶9(a)(1).)
 
Therefore, the Court finds that
the Complaint alleges sufficient facts to support an action for unlawful
detainer. 
 
Motion to Strike 
 
Defendant argues the earliest
Plaintiff is entitled to holdover damages is after the expiration of the notice
period. As such, Defendant contends Plaintiff’s request for holdover damages
for the period before Defendant’s tenancy was terminated is not permitted and
should be stricken. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
holdover damages are allowable and recoverable in unlawful detainer
proceedings. Further, Plaintiff argues what he may recover is subject to proof.
Plaintiff also contends Defendant argues how much plaintiff can recover and the
merits of his damages claim, which is reserved for affirmative defense not a
motion to strike, which only goes to plaintiff’s entitlement to claim holdover
damages. 
 
“Any party, within the time
allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to
strike the whole or any part thereof, but this time limitation shall not apply
to motions specified in subdivision (e).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435(b)(1).)
¿
“The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).)¿ 
 
“Damages occasioned by the
unlawful detainer are available in any unlawful detainer proceeding.” (Saberi
v. Bakhtiari (1985) 169 Cal. App. 3d 509, 515.)
 
Here, Defendant does not argue
that Plaintiff is not entitled to holdover damages but merely contends the
amount  and time period for which
Plaintiff is entitled holdover damages is limited to the time his tenancy was
terminated and he remained in possession of the premises. However, a motion to
strike is not the proper avenue to contest how much and through what time
period Plaintiff may claim holdover damages. Thus, Defendant has not shown that
Plaintiff’s request for holdover damages itself is prohibited by any case or
statutory authority. 
 
Therefore, the Court finds that requesting
holdover damages in an unlawful detainer complaint is proper.
 
Conclusion 
The demurrer overruled. The motion
is denied. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
