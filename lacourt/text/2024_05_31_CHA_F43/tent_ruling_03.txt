SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
August 1, 2023, Plaintiff Alan Grahge (Plaintiff) filed this contractual fraud
case against Defendants Brian M. Godley; Mohammed Rahman; Picture Build, a
California Corporation; and DOES 1-10 (Defendants), inclusive. The Complaint
asserts causes of action for breach of contract; breach of covenant of good
faith and fair dealing; breach of fiduciary duty; fraud; violation of Cal.
Penal Code § 496; violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 1194, 201-203, 226 and 558.1;
access to corporate books and records; violation of Business & Professions
Code § 17200, et seq.; accounting; and involuntary dissolution. 
 
The
Complaint alleges Plaintiff and Defendant Godley entered into a Stock Purchase
Agreement, wherein Plaintiff would purchase Godley’s 70 percent interest
Picture Build (the Company) for $1,120,000.00. (Compl., ¶33, Ex. 1.) The
Complaint further alleges Godley represented to Plaintiff that he was moving to
Florida but would remain the Responsible Managing Officer (RMO) for the Company
for four years on an as needed basis. (Compl., ¶¶34-35.) On January 10, 2023,
Godley disassociated his licenses from the Company and asserted he could not be
the RMO from Florida because he needed to be involved in daily operations of
the Company. (Compl., ¶36.) The Complaint also alleges Godley concealed
material facts concerning other stock transfer agreements, lawsuits, loans,
salary payments, and consumer complaints from Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶¶37-73.)
 
On
December 13, 2023, Defendant Brian M. Godley (Cross-Complainant) filed a
Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff and ROES 1-50, alleging causes of action for
breach of written contract and breach of fiduciary duty. 
 
On
May 7, 2024, Defendant Picture Build, a California corporation (Picture Build
Corp.) filed the instant Motion for Relief from Waiver of Discovery Objections.
On May 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On May 22, 2024, Defendant
Picture Build Corp. filed a reply. 
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant
Picture Build Corp. argues the date for response to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) was miscalendared as January 30, 2024 instead
of January 19, 2024. (Eisenberg Decl., ¶¶2-3.) Furthermore, Defendant Picture
Build Corp. contends upon Plaintiff’s counsel’s email alerting to past due
responses on January 25, 2024, it immediately explained the response deadline
had been miscalendared and served responses on two days later that are
substantially code-compliant. (Id., ¶¶4-6, Exs. A-C.) Moreover,
Defendant Picture Build Corp. contends Plaintiff’s refused to give a two-week
extension to serve responses without waiving objections. (Id.)
Additionally, Defendant Picture Build Corp. asserts the Court has broad
discretion to grant relief from waiver of discovery objections. Lastly,
Defendant Picture Build Corp. asserts that Plaintiff will not face any
prejudice by the relief  sought because
no trial date is scheduled, no deposition are scheduled, and the discovery
responses were only eight days late. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues defense counsel’s failure to calendar a discovery
deadline or intentional calendaring of a deadline forty-six (46) days after the
discovery was served are not valid grounds for relief. Plaintiff further argues
the main reason defense counsel seeks relief from waiver of all objections is
to improperly avoid providing corporate and financial documents that are
essential to Plaintiff’s fraud and penal code causes of action against Defendant
Picture Build Corp. and documents requested in Plaintiff’s demand letter. 
 
In
reply, Defendant Picture Build Corp. argues Plaintiff’s counsel fails to
explain his refusal to grant a discovery extension without insisting on
Defendant Picture Build Corp. waiving objections. Defendant Picture Build Corp.
also argues Plaintiff fails to demonstrate he would be prejudice if the relief
from waiver of objections is granted. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.300(a) states in pertinent part, “[t]he party to whom the demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to
the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300(a).) However, the Court may relieve that party from this waiver on
its determination that: “[t]he party has subsequently served a response that is
in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280” and “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300(a)(1)-(2).) 
 
Specifically, “[a] mistake of fact is when a
person understands the facts to be other than they are; a mistake of law
is when a person knows the facts as they really are but has a mistaken belief
as to the legal consequences of those facts… [i]nadvertence is defined as lack of heedfulness or attentiveness,
inattention, fault from negligence…[and] ‘excusable
neglect’ referred to in the section is that
neglect which might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person under the
same circumstances.” (Baratti v. Baratti (1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 917, 921.)
“To obtain relief a defendant must have acted within a reasonable time.” (Id.)
 
“The Legislature apparently
intended to employ the same standard for relief from defaults as used in
section 473 for failure to serve a timely response to a discovery demand.” (City
of Fresno v. Superior Court (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1467 (City of
Fresno).) In City of Ontario v. Superior Court
(1970) 2 Cal.3d 335, 345, the court concluded “[i]t is settled that an honest
and reasonable mistake of law on such an [complex and debatable] issue is
excusable and constitutes good cause for relief from default under Code of
Civil Procedure, section 473.” (Id.) As such, “[c]ounsel's mistake of
law on a relatively simple and undebatable matter was not a valid ground for
relief.” (City of Fresno, supra, 205 Cal.App.3d at 1467.)
 
Here, Plaintiff does not dispute Defendant Picture
Build Corp. provided substantially code-compliant responses to the Request for
Production of Documents (Set One). Furthermore, Plaintiff does not explicitly raise
any arguments as to whether he would be prejudice by the relief sought in this
matter. However, Plaintiff merely indicates that Defendant Picture Build Corp.
seeks to avoid providing Plaintiff documents requested in the demand letter and
essential to at least two causes of action asserted against Defendant Picture
Build Corp. On the other hand, Defendant Picture Build Corp. has demonstrated
that no depositions have been taken and so far only Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) have been served in the matter. Moreover, the
Court notes that the trial currently set a year from now, so Plaintiff would
have time to conduct and request the requisite discovery he needs. Finally,
Defendant Picture Build Corp. has shown that inadvertence of defense counsel
led to the miscalendaring of the response deadline and was quickly cured upon
Plaintiff’s counsel bringing this to defense counsel’s attention. 
 
Therefore, the Court finds that relief from waiver of
discovery objections in this matter would not be improper at this time. 
 
Conclusion 
The motion is granted.
