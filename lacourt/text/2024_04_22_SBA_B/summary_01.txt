And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiffs' motion to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) to correct the demand for interest. The plaintiffs, Glen Hamel and Cynthia Hamel, seek to reduce the interest rate from 12% to 10% in their complaint against Vince Valdez. The court found that the plaintiffs complied with the applicable rules and that the amendment is not futile. The defendant argued that the proposed amended complaint is a "futile sham pleading" and that the plaintiffs are trying to strip them of usury remedies. However, the court declined to make a finding on usury and whether the plaintiffs are entitled to 10% interest or no interest. The court ordered the plaintiffs to file the FAC forthwith and to give notice of the ruling.
