BACKGROUND
            On June 29, 2023, plaintiffs Glen
Hamel and Cynthia Hamel filed a complaint against Vince Valdez for (1) breach
of contract – personal guarantee and (2) common counts – goods and services
rendered.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
CCP § 473(a)(1) provides, in
relevant part:  “The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party,
or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other
respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer.  The court may likewise, in its
discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be
just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may
upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this
code.”
 “This discretion should be exercised liberally
in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed
matters in the same lawsuit.”  Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal. App. 3d 1045, 1047.
Under CRC Rule 3.1324(a), a motion
to amend a pleading shall (1) include a copy of the proposed amendment or
amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from
previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state what allegations in the previous
pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph and
line number, the deleted allegations are located; and (3) state what
allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are
located.
Under CRC Rule 3.1324(b), a
separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify (1) the effect
of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the
reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.
Even if a good amendment is
proposed in proper form, a long, unwarranted and unexcused delay in presenting
it may be a good reason for denial.  In
most cases, the factors for timeliness are: 
(1) lack of diligence in discovering the facts or in offering the
amendment after knowledge of them; and (2) the effect of the delay on the
adverse party.  If the party seeking the
amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party,
the judge has discretion to deny leave to amend.  Hirsa
v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal. App. 3d 486, 490.  Prejudice exists where the amendment would
require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation such as an increased burden of discovery.  Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal. App. 4th 471, 486-488.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiffs
Glen Hamel and Cynthia Hamel request leave to file a First Amended Complaint to
allege an interest rate of 10%, instead of the 12% that is currently alleged in
the complaint. 
            The
complaint alleges that on February 14, 2020, plaintiffs and Health Care
Building Investment, LLC dba Welbrook Investments, LLC entered into a written
loan agreement, entitled February 2020 Promissory Note.  Defendant Vince Valdez personally guaranteed
the loan.  Complaint, ¶¶10, 12.  On May 10, 2020, plaintiffs and Welbrook
Investments entered into another loan agreement, entitled May 2020 Promissory
Note.  Defendant personally guaranteed
the loan.  Id., ¶¶11, 13.  Plaintiffs stopped receiving payments from
defendants under the Promissory Notes. 
Id., ¶15.   In September 2022,
plaintiffs obtained a default judgment in State of Arizona in a civil action in
case no. CV2022-006299 against Welbrook Investments in the sum of $2.24
million.  Id., ¶18.  Pursuant to the Arizona Judgment, plaintiffs
are entitled to recovery of $2.24 million, prejudgment interest of $674,577.53,
costs of $417.70, and attorney’s fees of $6,057.50, plus interest at the agreed
upon rate of 12% until the Arizona Judgment is paid in full.  Id., ¶19.
            Plaintiffs
contends that this matter deals with a complex series of transactions involving
contracts under both Arizona and California law, and that plaintiffs “errantly
have overstated their demand for interest and hereby seek to correct that
demand.”  See Allan Cate decl.  Plaintiffs argue that there is no prejudice
to defendant.
            In
opposition, defendant argues that the proposed amended complaint is a “futile
sham pleading” because plaintiffs cannot strip defendant of usury remedies by
reducing the interest rate after he asserted a usury defense in his answer.  Defendant asserts that the 2020 Notes are
usurious because the interest rate is 12%, and that the California Constitution
prohibits charging interest in excess of 10%. 
Defendant argues that the remedy for usury is denial of all interest and
allocation of all prior payments exclusively to principal.  Further, defendant asserts, plaintiffs
“cannot salvage their claim by relying on the usury savings clause in the 2020
notes, which states that the interest rate is automatically reduced to the
maximum legal rates” because plaintiffs intended to charge an interest rate
that exceeds the legal limit.
Defendant
requests judicial notice of the Arizona complaint, which the court denies.
The court finds that plaintiffs
complied with CRC Rule 3.1324.  “Leave to
amend is in general required to be liberally granted.”  Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal. App. 4th
402, 412 (citation omitted).  As to
whether the amendment is “futile,” the law applies to when the proposed
amendment does not state a cause of action. 
Rather, plaintiffs’ request to amend applies to the prayer.  
As to defendant’s arguments
regarding usury, “[a] transaction is rebuttably presumed not to be
usurious.”  Ghirardo v. Antonioli
(1994) 8 Cal. 4th 791, 798 (citation omitted).  “The borrower bears the burden of proving the
essential elements of a usurious transaction.” 
Id. at 799 (citation omitted). 
One of the elements is “the lender must have a willful intent to enter
into a usurious transaction.”  Id.
at 798 (citation omitted).  “The element
of intent is narrow.”  Id.  “The existence of the requisite intent is
always a question of fact.”  Boerner
v. Colwell Co. (1978) 21 Cal. 3d 37, 44. 
Defendant is not barred from continuing to assert an affirmative defense
based on usury.  Thus, the court declines
to make a finding at the pleading stage as to usury and whether plaintiffs are
entitled to 10% interest or no interest.
The motion is GRANTED.
 
ORDER
            The motion is GRANTED.
            Plaintiffs are ordered to file the
FAC forthwith.
Plaintiffs are ordered to give
notice of the ruling.
