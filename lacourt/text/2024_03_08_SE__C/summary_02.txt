And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on an unlawful detainer action brought by Oman against Lucero, et al. On June 15, 2023, a judgment was entered in favor of Oman in the amount of $20,000.00, and the parties subsequently settled the case. However, Lucero appealed the judgment on December 20, 2023. Lucero is now seeking ex parte relief to stay the execution of the judgment and shorten the time for a hearing on his motion to set aside the judgment. The judge has denied Lucero's ex parte application, finding that he failed to establish irreparable harm or immediate danger, and did not provide Oman's counsel with a copy of his ex parte application. The judge notes that the instant motion may be moot given that Lucero is scheduled to be locked out on March 2, 2024, and did not provide sufficient evidence to support his claim of irreparable harm.
