And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer hearing will be advanced from January 2, 2025 to March 8, 2024, and continued to April 11, 2024 at 9:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C. The defendant, Graciela Ortiz, had moved ex parte to shorten the time for the demurrer hearing, but did not make a factual showing to support this request. The judge notes that a party seeking ex parte relief must show "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte." As the defendant did not meet this burden, the judge has denied the request.
