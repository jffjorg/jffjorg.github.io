v. Billy Valdivia, et al., Case No. 24NWCV00084
 
This
is a sexual assault case. Defendant Graciela Ortiz moves ex parte to shorten
time for the hearing on the demurrer so that it is heard the same day as the
anti-SLAPP motion, which is April 11, 2024. 
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)

January 2, 2025 to today’s date and CONTINUED to April 11, 2024 at 9:30 A.M. in
Dept. SE-C.
