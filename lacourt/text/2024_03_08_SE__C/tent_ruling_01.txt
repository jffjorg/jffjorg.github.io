judgment are to be heard on March 26, 2024.

granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
According
to Plaintiff, Defendants stated they would not oppose the ex parte
application.  This is consistent with the Court’s recollection of previous
discussions on this issue.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s ex parte application
to file under seal her exhibits in support of her oppositions to the motion for
summary adjudication and the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
