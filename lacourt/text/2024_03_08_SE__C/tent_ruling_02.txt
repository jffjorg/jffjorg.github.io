v. Lucero, et al., Case No. 23NWCV00214
 
This
is an unlawful detainer action. On June 15, 2023, judgment was entered in favor
of plaintiff in the amount of $20,000.00. The parties had settled the case. On
December 20, 2023, the defendant appealed. Defendant Victor Lucero, a pro se
defendant and commercial tenant, moves ex parte for the following: (1) stay
execution of the judgment until a hearing on his motion to set aside judgment;
and (2) shorten time for hearing and service of the motion to set aside. 
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Parties
appearing at the ex parte hearing must serve the ex parte application or any
written opposition on all other appearing parties at the first reasonable
opportunity. Absent exceptional circumstances, no hearing may be conducted
unless such service has been made. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1206.)
 
Defendant
states that according to the Sheriff’s Notice to Vacate, he will be locked out
on March 2, 2024. (Decl. Lucer, pg. 5.) Thus, it is not clear whether the
instant motion is now moot.  Defendant’s declaration states that notice
was given by leaving a voicemail for Plaintiff’s Counsel on February 28,
2024.  However, Defendant does not establish that he provided Plaintiff’s
Counsel with a copy his ex parte application.  
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s ex parte application is DENIED.
