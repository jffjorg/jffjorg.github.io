Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Susan Carriere regarding a motion to transfer and consolidate forty-five actions to Department 74. The motion is unopposed and seeks to transfer and consolidate actions that are not complex. The court notes that the motion is different from a petition for coordination, which requires a more complex process. The court finds that the defendants have not met the standards for coordination specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 404.1 and therefore denies their motion. The court also notes that Department 11 previously denied a petition to coordinate the same actions and that the defendants have not shown that the factors disfavoring transfer and consolidation were not considered in that ruling. The court concludes that the motion to transfer and consolidate actions is denied.
