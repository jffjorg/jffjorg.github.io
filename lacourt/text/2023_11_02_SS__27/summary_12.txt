And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel the plaintiff, Eduardo Antonio Fuentes Medina, to submit to two independent medical examinations. The defendants, Amazon.com Services LLC, et al., argue that the examinations are necessary to determine the extent of the plaintiff's injuries. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that one examination with Dr. Arthur Kreitenberg, an orthopedist, is sufficient.

The judge finds that the defendants have failed to show that Dr. Kreitenberg lacks the qualifications to diagnose the plaintiff's spinal cord injury. However, the judge also finds that the defendants' motion and demand for the examination are defective, as they did not include a separate statement and did not specify the type of tests that Dr. Kreitenberg will conduct.

As a result, the judge denies the motion to compel the examinations. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendants and their counsel, ordering them to pay $960 for the plaintiff's counsel's time and filing fees.
