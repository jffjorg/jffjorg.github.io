MOTIONS
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
National Ready Mixed Concrete Company
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On September
7, 2023, Defendant National Ready Mixed Concrete Company filed these motions to
compel Plaintiff Isidro Patino to provide responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One,  Special Interrogatories, Sets
One and Two, and Demand for Inspection and Production of Documents, Set One.  Defendant seeks sanctions against Plaintiff.
                                                     
            The motions
are unopposed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD TO COMPEL DISCOVERY
RESPONSES 
 
            If a party
to whom interrogatories and inspection demands were directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order to compel
responses without objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).)  Failure to timely serve responses waives objections
to the requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).)    
 
            Monetary
Sanctions 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
¿ 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to inspection demands, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction .
. . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)  
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant
served Plaintiff with these discovery requests on June 16, 2023 and June 21,
2023.  However, to date, Plaintiff has
not requested an extension or provided responses.¿ (See Naples Decls.)¿
Therefore, all objections to the interrogatories and production requests are
waived.¿¿ 
 
            As Defendant
properly served the discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to serve responses,
the Court finds Defendant is entitled to an order directing Plaintiff to
provide responses to the Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand
for Inspection and Production of Documents.
            
             Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Defendant
requests sanctions against Plaintiff. 
Given that the Court has granted these motions, sanctions are warranted.
 Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against
Plaintiff in the amount of $640, representing 2 hours at defense counsel’s
hourly rate and $180 in filing fees.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The
unopposed motions are granted.  Plaintiff
Isidro Patino is ordered to provide verified, objection-free responses to Defendant’s
Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Sets One and Two, and Demand
for Inspection and Production of Documents, Set One.  
 
            The request
for sanctions is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered
to pay sanctions in the amount of $640 to Defendant, by and through its
counsel.
 
            Discovery
responses are to be provided and sanctions are to be paid within 30 days of the
date of this order. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
