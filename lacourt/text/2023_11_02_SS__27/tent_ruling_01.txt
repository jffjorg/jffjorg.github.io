APPLICATION
FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Dennis Garcia, Guardian Ad Litem of Minor Valerie Garcia
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     N/A
 
 
On November 27, 2018, Plaintiff, Dennis Garcia, Guardian Ad
Litem of Minor Valerie Garcia, filed this action against Defendants, Amado
Gonzalez (“Gonzalez”), City of Los Angeles (“City”), and Does 1 through 20.  According to the Complaint, on March 4, 2018, Gonzalez
negligently rented a horse to Plaintiff which Plaintiff rode while on City’s property.  Plaintiff suffered injury when she was thrown
off and trampled by the horse.  
 
On January 10, 2019, Plaintiff served Gonzalez with the
summons and complaint by substituted service and filed the proof of service on
February 13, 2019.  
 
On January 30, 2019, Gonzalez filed an answer to the initial
complaint.  City was dismissed from the
case after its demurrer was sustained without leave to amend on September 10,
2019. 
 
On November 7, 2019, Plaintiff served requests for admission
on Defendant Gonzalez.  After receiving
no responses, Plaintiff moved to deem the matters admitted via motion on
September 29, 2020.  On June 16, 2021,
the Court struck Gonzalez’s answer after he failed to appear for the final
status conference on multiple occasions. 
 
On November 10, 2021, Plaintiff served Gonzalez with the
statement of damages.  Default was
entered against Defendant on November 10, 2021.
 
On May 10, 2022, counsel for Plaintiff requested additional
time to file the Default Judgment packet. 
The Court continued the Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to
Enter Default Judgment, as to defendant Amado Gonzalez to August 4, 2022.
On January 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a default judgment application.  On the same day, Plaintiff dismissed
Defendant Does 1 to 20.
 
On April 27, 2023, the Court rejected Plaintiff’s
application because Item 1b on Form CIV-100 and Item 5a on Form JUD-100 did not
identify all named plaintiffs in the action and Plaintiff’s request for general
damages of $650,000.00 was unsubstantiated and grossly exceeded the special
damages.  
 
On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed another default judgment application.  The Court denied the application on July 27,
2023, because (1) Plaintiff improperly sought recovery of investigative
expenses, and (2) the request for $650,000 in general damages was not supported
by the evidence presented.
 
On
September 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed another default judgment application.  Plaintiff now requests default judgment against
Gonzalez in the amount of $155,987.45,
consisting of $4,725.71 in special damages, $150,000
in general damages, and $1,261.74 in additional costs.  
 
Upon review, the Court finds the application is still
deficient for the following reasons:
·        
Plaintiff’s request for $4,725.71 in special
damages is comprised, in part, of $2,500 in future medical expenses.  However, Plaintiff does not provide any
evidence supporting the necessity of future medical treatment for her injuries.  Based on the evidence present, the Court is
inclined to award $2,225.71 in special damages.
·        
While greatly improved, Plaintiff still does not
substantiate $150,000 in general damages. 
Plaintiff submits the declaration of her father and guardian ad litem,
Dennis Garcia, which details his emotional distress in seeing how the
incident has affected his daughter. 
However, Mr. Garcia is not a party to this action.  Based on the evidence presented, the Court is
inclined to award $20,000 in general damages.
·        
Plaintiff still improperly seeks $528.34
in investigative costs.  Per CCP section
1033.5, investigative expenses are not allowable costs. 
In sum, the Court is inclined to award a reduced judgment in the sum
of $22,959.11, consisting of $2,225.71 in special damages, $20,000 in general
damages, and $733.40 in costs.¿ If Plaintiff is satisfied with this judgment,
Plaintiff should file an amended proposed judgment on Form JUD-100 and an amended
request for entry of default judgment on Form CIV-100 reflecting this award.¿
Accordingly, Plaintiff application for
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. 
The Status Conference re: Review of Default Judgment scheduled for
November 2, 2023, is CONTINUED to December 4, 2023 at 08:30 AM in Department 27
of Spring Street Courthouse.  Plaintiff is to resubmit their default
judgment application no later than 5 court days before the hearing.
 
Moving party to give notice.
