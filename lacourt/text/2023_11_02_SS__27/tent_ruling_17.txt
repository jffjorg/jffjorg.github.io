            Claimant
Jamontae Darius Card, a minor, by and through his parent and guardian ad litem
Petitioner, Shawntay Herod has agreed to settle his claims against Defendant, Stadium
Nissan LLC, Ken Garff Automotive LLC, Marvin Velasquez, Nile Valley
Enterprises, and Fouad Yacoub, in exchange for $310,000.  If approved, $13,854.07 will be used for
medical expenses, $77,500 will be used for attorney’s fees, and $7,080.48 will
be used for other expenses, leaving a settlement balance of $201,565.45 for
Claimant, to be deposited at Wells Fargo Bank in Los Angeles, CA, subject to
withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            Upon
review, the Court finds the settlement amount to be fair and reasonable.  The Court further finds that medical expenses
are supported by documentation and the request for attorney’s fees is fair,
reasonable, and consistent with the retainer agreement between Claimant and his
counsel.  
 
            Accordingly, the Petition is GRANTED.  The Court sets an OSC re: Proof of Deposit
(minor – Jamontae Darius Card)
for December 14, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.953, subd.
(a).)¿ If an acknowledgement of receipt by the financial institution is filed
before that date, no appearance will be required.¿¿ 
 
            The OSC Re:
Dismissal (Settlement) is CONTINUED to December 14, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.
 
Moving party to give notice.
