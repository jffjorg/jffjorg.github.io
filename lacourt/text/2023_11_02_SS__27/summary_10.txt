And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The motion is unopposed, and the Judge grants the motion, allowing the Plaintiffs to file the proposed first amended complaint within 10 days. The amended complaint adds factual allegations in support of a request for punitive damages, which were inadvertently left out of the original complaint. The Judge finds that no prejudice will result from granting the motion, and the Court's policy is to grant leave to amend liberally, as long as no prejudice is shown to the adverse party. The Judge notes that the Court does not consider the merits of the proposed amendment, and the motion is granted solely on the basis of the Plaintiff's showing of good cause.
