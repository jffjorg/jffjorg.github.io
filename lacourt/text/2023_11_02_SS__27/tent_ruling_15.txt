MOTION
FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Plaintiff
Houssem Zidi
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On August 5, 2022, Plaintiff Houssem Zidi filed this premises
liability action against Defendants Sanford Sigal and Cindy Sigal as Trustees
of the Sigal Family Trust UA (“Sigal Trustees”).  On the same day, the Court scheduled a
non-jury trial for February 2, 2024.  The
Complaint states that a jury trial is demanded.
 
            On November
23, 2022, the Sigal Trustees filed an Answer to the Complaint and a Notice of
Posting Jury Fees.
 
            On July 19,
2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the Complaint naming Diamante Electric
& Construction as Doe 1. 
 
            On August 10,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Posting Jury Fees.
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for relief from waiver of jury trial. 

 
            The
Non-Jury Trial is currently scheduled for February 2, 2024.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD  
            
            Under the
California constitution, “[t]rial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be
secured by all[.]”  Therefore, “[w]here doubt exists concerning the
propriety of granting relief from [a jury trial] waiver, this doubt, by reason
of the constitutional guarantee of right to jury trial, should be resolved in
favor of the party requesting trial by jury.  (Gann v. Williams
Brothers Realty, Inc. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1698, 1703-1704.)  The
court may, in its discretion upon just terms, allow a trial by jury despite the
waiver.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (g).)  Where the right to
jury is threatened, the crucial focus is whether any prejudice will be suffered
by any party or the court if a motion for relief from waiver is granted. 
(Tesoro del Valle Master Homeowners Ass’n v. Griffin (2011) 200
Cal.App.4th 619, 638-39.)  “A trial court abuses its discretion as a
matter of law when ‘. . . relief has been denied where there has been no
prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver.
[Citations.]’” ¿(Wharton v. Superior Court¿(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 100,
104.) 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            The jury fee shall be due no later than 365 calendar days
after the filing of the initial complaint. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (c)(2).) 
The failure to deposit the fees waives the party's right to a jury
trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., §631, subd. (f)(5).)  Here, Plaintiff deposited fees on August 3,
2022—more than 365 days from the filing of the initial complaint.  (See 8/4/22 Notice of Posting Jury Fees.)  As such, Plaintiff seeks relief from this inadvertent
waiver of a jury trial. 
 
            Given that both
Plaintiff and the Sigal Trustees seek a jury trial and posted jury fees, and there
is no opposition to this motion, the Court finds Plaintiff is entitled to
relief from his jury waiver.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The unopposed motion is GRANTED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
