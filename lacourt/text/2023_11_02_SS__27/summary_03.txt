And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions: one to compel Ramin Ghaneeian, the owner of Rockpoint Funding, to appear for deposition, and another to compel Rockpoint to produce a person most knowledgeable for deposition. The judge finds that Mr. Ghaneeian should not be compelled to appear for deposition because he does not have unique or superior knowledge of the case, and his counsel offered to provide a sworn affidavit attesting to this. On the other hand, the judge grants the motion to compel Rockpoint to produce a person most knowledgeable for deposition because Rockpoint's pre-settlement funding agreement with the plaintiff references collateral source payments, which are relevant to the case. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendants and their counsel.
