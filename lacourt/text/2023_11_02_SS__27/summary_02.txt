And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate the liability and damages phases of trial without prejudice. The motion was filed on July 5, 2023, and the trial is currently scheduled for January 13, 2025. The court finds it appropriate for the trial judge to determine whether bifurcation is warranted, given that the case will be tried by a different court than the one ruling on the motion. The defendants may raise this issue again at the time the trial judge rules on motions in limine.
