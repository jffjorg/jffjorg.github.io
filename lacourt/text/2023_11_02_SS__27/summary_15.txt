And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted plaintiff's unopposed motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiff deposited jury fees over 365 days after filing the initial complaint, thereby waiving the right to a jury trial. However, since both parties seek a jury trial and posted jury fees, and there is no opposition to the motion, the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to relief from the waiver. The court notes that the right to a jury trial is an inviolate right and should be resolved in favor of the party requesting a trial by jury. The motion is granted, and the moving party is directed to give notice.
