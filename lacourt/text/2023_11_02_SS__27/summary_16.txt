And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition to approve a minor's compromise in the case of Stan Heifets v. Hamid Hakkakzadeh, et al. The minor, Jackquelyn Heifets, has agreed to settle her claims against the defendants in exchange for $18,500. The settlement amount is to be divided among medical expenses, attorney's fees, and other expenses. The court finds the settlement amount to be fair and reasonable, and the request for attorney's fees to be fair, reasonable, and consistent with the retainer agreement. However, the petition cannot be approved due to defects in the submission, including the failure to provide the court or case number in which a guardianship of the minor's estate was created, the absence of a completed form MC-355, and the lack of information on who is to receive medical expenses. The hearing on the petition has been continued to November 17, 2023, and a revised petition must be filed no later than 5 court days before the hearing.
