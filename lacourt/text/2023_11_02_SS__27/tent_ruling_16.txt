CASE:                                Stan Heifets v. Hamid Hakkakzadeh, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV30398
 





















 
PETITION
TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Stan Heifets
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimant,
Jackquelyn Heifets, a minor, by and through her parent and guardian ad litem
Petitioner, Stan Heifets has agreed to settle her claims against Defendants, Jessica
Zestar-Postrik and Ana Mendy Nin, in exchange for $18,500.  If approved, $2,189.57 will be used for
medical expenses, $6,166.66 will be used for attorney’s fees, and $631.03 will
be used for other expenses, leaving a settlement balance of $9,512.74 for
Claimant, to be deposited in a block account, subject to withdrawal only on
authorization the court.  
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            Upon
review, the Court finds the settlement amount to be fair and reasonable.  The Court further finds the request for
attorney’s fees is fair, reasonable, and consistent with the retainer agreement
between Claimant and her counsel. 
However, the Petition cannot be approved because of the following
defects:
 
·        
Petitioner
indicates at Item 19a(2) of MC-350 that there is a guardianship of the estate
of the minor.  However, Petitioner does
not provide the court or the case number in which the guardianship was created.
 If there is no guardianship, Petitioner
is to select Item 19b(2).
·        
Form
MC-355 has not been submitted with the Petition.
·        
The
Petition does not state to whom medical expenses are to be paid.  Nor do the billing records attached to the
Petition substantiate medical expenses of $2,189.57.
·        
Petitioner
submits an outdated Judicial Council Form MC-350.  Petitioner is directed to use the current 2023
version.
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Hearing on Petition to Confirm
Minor’s Compromise is CONTINUED to November 17, 2023 at 1:30 PM in Department
27 at Spring Street Courthouse.  A revised Petition must be filed no later
than 5 court days before the hearing.  The Court will not require
Petitioner’s and Claimant’s attendance at the hearing.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.952, subd. (a).) 
 
Moving party to give notice.
