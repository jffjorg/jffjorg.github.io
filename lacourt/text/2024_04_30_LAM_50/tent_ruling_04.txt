[1]The Court also notes
that the parties’ “Stipulation Re Withdrawal of Evidence” filed on February 28,
2024 provides, inter alia, that Defendants withdraw certain evidence,
including, inter alia, “Hang Declaration, paragraph 13, lines 22-26.” (See
Stipulation, p. 2, ¶ 3.)

Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 520, fn. 2.)


[3]In Johnson v.
United Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children's Foundation (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th
740, 755, cited by
Plaintiff, the Court of Appeal noted that “[t]o avoid
summary judgment, an employee claiming discrimination must offer substantial
evidence that the employer’s stated
nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual, or
evidence the employer acted with a discriminatory animus, or a combination of
the two, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer
engaged in intentional discrimination.” The Johnson Court noted that “[i]n other words, plaintiff must produce
substantial responsive evidence to show that [the employer’s] ostensible motive was pretextual; that is, that a
discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or that the employer’s explanation is unworthy of credence.” (Ibid., internal quotations omitted.) 
 


[4]Plaintiff also
cites to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (p)(2), which
provides in pertinent part that “[a] defendant or cross-defendant has met his
or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has
shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately
pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the
cause of action.” 


[5]Ms. Hang states
that “ATE is a nationwide freight forwarder company with its main office in New
York. There are other offices throughout the country, including offices in
Chicago, Phoenix, Dallas, Denver, Seattle, Atlanta and Los Angeles. There are
also numerous offices in China and elsewhere in Asia.” (Hang Decl., ¶ 2.)


[6]As also discussed above, Ms. Maravilla states that
“[o]n March 24, 2020…[she] received an email from HANG, stating that they were
terminating [her] employment…” (Maravilla Decl., ¶ 14.) Ms. Maravilla states
that she “was older as were those selected in the Los Angles office…”
(Maravilla Decl., ¶ 14.) 
 


[7]In his declaration
in support of the motion, Jeff Chow states that he is the Office Manager for
the Los Angeles branch office of ATE. (Chow Decl., ¶ 1.)
