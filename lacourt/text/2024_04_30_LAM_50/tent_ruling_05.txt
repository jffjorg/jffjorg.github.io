[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 



Plaintiff San Bernardino Physicians Associates, A
Medical Corporation (“Plaintiff”)
requests entry of default
judgment against Defendant King’s Industrial Builders, Inc. Plaintiff
seeks judgment in the total amount of $107,872.95, comprising $107,350.00 in
damages and $522.95 in costs.  
The Court notes a few defects with the submitted default
judgment package. 
First, Item 2(a) of Plaintiff’s Request for Court Judgment (Form
CIV-100) indicates that Plaintiff seeks $107,350.00 in damages demanded in the
Complaint. However, in the first and second causes of action of the Complaint[1], Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that “Plaintiff has
sustained damages to the Property, and to its personal property
contained therein, in an amount in excess of the jurisdiction minimum of this
court as established by proof at time of trial, but not less than $30,000.”
(Compl., ¶¶ 9, 14.) The Court notes that “[a]
complaint…shall contain…the following:…(2) A demand for judgment for the relief
to which the pleader claims to be entitled.¿If the recovery of money or damages
is demanded, the amount demanded shall be stated.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a).) Code of Civil
Procedure section 580, subdivision (a) “limits a trial court’s jurisdiction
to grant relief on a default judgment to the amount stated in the complaint.” (Dhawan v. Biring (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 963, 968.) “[I]n all default
judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” (Finney
v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th
527, 534.) 
Second, in the proposed judgment (Form JUD-100), a
box for “Continued on Attachment 5a” is checked. However, there does not appear
to be any attachment to the proposed judgment.
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the request for
default judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a
schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
