```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court notes that the parties have agreed to withdraw certain evidence, including Hang Declaration, paragraph 13, lines 22-26. The court also notes that the plaintiff's claim of discrimination must be supported by substantial evidence that the employer's stated reason for termination was untrue or pretextual. The court cites to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (p)(2) and Johnson v. United Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children's Foundation (2009) to support this requirement. The court also notes that the plaintiff's claim is based on the termination of employment on March 24, 2020, and the defendant's alleged discriminatory animus.
