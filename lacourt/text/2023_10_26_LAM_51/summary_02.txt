And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between a plaintiff and a defendant over an arbitration agreement. The defendant updated its arbitration agreement through a new electronic process in 2019, and the plaintiff is arguing that she was surprised and unaware of the alternative dispute resolution process. The judge has found that the employment application signed by the plaintiff in 2011 notified her of the alternative dispute resolution process, and that the defendant's updated arbitration agreement was provided to employees, including the plaintiff, for acceptance. The judge has also found that the arbitration agreement is not illusory and that the parties bear their own costs for deposition, witness, expert, and attorney's fees. Finally, the judge has ruled that the delegation provision in the arbitration agreement fails to meet the threshold requirement of enforceability because it does not clearly and unmistakably intend to delegate arbitrability issues to the arbitrator.
