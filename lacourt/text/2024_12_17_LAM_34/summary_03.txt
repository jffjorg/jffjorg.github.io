And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant's counsel, Brian T. Corrigan's, motion to be relieved as counsel, subject to the filing of a proposed order within 5 days of this order and effective upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed order. The judge finds that the requirements of California Rules of Court rule 3.1362 have not been fully met, as the proposed order was not provided. However, the judge grants the motion due to the absence of any showing of resulting prejudice. The judge notes that the motion complies with the requirements of the rule, but fails to provide a proposed order. The court orders that the motion to be relieved as counsel is granted, subject to the filing of a proposed order and proof of service.
