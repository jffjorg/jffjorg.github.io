Summary:

The judge grants the motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of conducting discovery to contact Jennifer Kucera as a witness, acquiring financial information from Pacific Coastline Escrow, and depose the new witnesses identified. The court finds that the lack of diligence by the plaintiffs in pursuing the discovery sought is offset by the narrow scope of the request, the facially-apparent relevance of the information sought, and the relative distance of the trial date. The motion is granted, and the court declines to award monetary sanctions.
