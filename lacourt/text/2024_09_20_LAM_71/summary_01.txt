And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for a protective order filed by plaintiffs Sara Van Horn and Patrick Van Horn, as well as their request for sanctions against defendants The Woman's Club of Hollywood, California and Rosemary Lord. The motion was denied because plaintiffs' counsel failed to submit a meet and confer declaration, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. The court found that plaintiffs' counsel did not make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter outside of court. As a result, the court denied the motion for a protective order and the request for sanctions.
