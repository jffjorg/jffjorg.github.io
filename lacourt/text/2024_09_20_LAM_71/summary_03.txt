The demurrer is denied as moot because Cross-Complainant filed an amended cross-complaint on September 6, 2024, which renders the demurrer unnecessary. The judge's ruling means that the dispute over the merits of Cross-Complainant's Cross-Complaint will proceed to the scheduled hearing on September 20, 2024.
