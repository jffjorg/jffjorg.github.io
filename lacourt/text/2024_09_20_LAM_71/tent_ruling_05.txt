OYEKUNLE JEGEDE,  
  
         vs.
 
90018 COLLECTION LLC, et al.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV07725
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 20, 2024



 
Moving Defendant 90018 Collection, LLC’s motion for a
protective order is denied.
Moving Defendant’s request for sanctions is denied.
 
Defendant 90018
Collection, LLC (“90018”) (“Moving Defendant”) moves for a protective order
quashing discovery propounded by pro per Plaintiff Oyekunle Jegede
(“Jegede”) (“Plaintiff”).  (Notice of
Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§2017.020, 2023.280, 2023.090, 2023.300.)  Moving Defendant moves on the grounds that Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories, Set One (“SROG”), Requests for Admission, Set One
(“RFA”), and Requests for Production of Documents Set One (“RFP 1”) and Set Two
(“RFP 2”) (collectively, “Plaintiff’s Discovery”) served on July 11, 2024, and
July 13, 2024, seeks information about the rights held by other tenants (for
which Plaintiff has no standing to complain), contracts and financial data
having nothing to do with Plaintiff’s lease, and evidence of alleged other
unrelated “bad acts” by 90018 to prove 90018 is sufficiently bad to deserve
being sued here. (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.) 

Moving Defendant
argues such discovery demands are overbroad, unfocused and seek information
that is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence
and violate 90018’s right to privacy under the California Constitution.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  Moving Defendant also requests an award of
attorney’s fees of $6,370.00 and costs in the sum of $80.97 for a total of
$6,450.97 that were unreasonably incurred to bring the matter before the Court
on the grounds that reasonable resolutions were offered to Plaintiff, (either
deferral or narrowing of the requests) which he rejected.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed his initial complaint
in this matter on March 27, 2024, against Moving Defendant and Non-moving
Defendants Winston Cenac, Trustee of the Island Boy Trust (“Cenac”), Jason
Penneton (“Penneton”), Shelby Ring (“Ring”), the Law Offices of Rebecca Hufford
Cohen (“Law Office”), and On Time (“On Time”) (collectively, “Defendants”) for
four causes of action: (1) illegal eviction; (2) illegal theft; (3)
discrimination; and (4) fraud.
On August 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants alleging seven
causes of action: (1) wrongful eviction; (2) discrimination (violation of
FEHA); (3) breach of contract; (4) conversion; (5) negligence; (6) fraud and
misrepresentation; and (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress,
arising from his tenancy at a studio apartment located at 238 ½ Market St.,
Venice, CA (“Subject Property”).  (See
FAC ¶2.)
On July 1, 2024, Moving Defendant
filed the instant motion.  On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed his
opposition.  On September 13, 2024,
Moving Defendant filed its reply.  On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a sur-reply.[1]
 
Meet and Confer
          C.C.P.
§2031.060 provides, in part:
When an inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of documents, tangible
things, places, or electronically stored information has been demanded, the
party to whom the demand has been directed, and any other party or affected
person, may promptly move for a protective order. This motion shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
 
(C.C.P. §2031.060(a), emphasis added.)
Moving Defendant’s counsel declares that on June 27,
2024, she met and conferred with Plaintiff regarding his Complaint and
discovery requests, but that the matters presented in this motion were not
resolved.  (See Decl. of Windler
¶¶5-14, Exh. 6.)  Moving Defendant’s
counsel’s declaration states facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve
the matter outside of court.  (C.C.P. §§2016.040,
2031.060(a).)  Therefore, the Court will consider the
instant motion.
 
Legal Standard 
C.C.P. §2031.060(b) provides that
“[t]he court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to
protect any party or other person from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or
oppression, or undue burden and expense.” 
(C.C.P. §2031.060(b).)
The decision upon whether to enter a
protective order lies within the sound discretion of the court.  (Raymond Handling Concepts
Corp. v. Superior Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 584, 588, 591; Meritplan Insurance
Co. v. Superior Court (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 237, 242.)  Moving
parties have the burden to show good cause for protective order.  (Emerson
Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1101,
1110.)   
 
          Discussion
Moving
Defendant’s motion for a protective order is denied.  Moving Defendant failed to meet its burden to
demonstrate they need protection from Plaintiff’s Discovery Requests.  
First,
Moving Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff’s discovery is premature is
unavailing. The right to discovery generally does not depend on the
status of the pleadings. i.e., the case need not be “at issue.”  (Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young &
Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436 [upholding sanctions for refusal to
make discovery because demurrer pending].)
Deficiencies
in the pleadings generally do not affect either party’s right to conduct
discovery. Thus, for example, discovery may continue after a demurrer has been
sustained with leave to amend, although no amended complaint has yet been
filed—i.e., no valid complaint need be on file.  (Budget Finance Plan v. Superior Court
(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 794, 797.)
Second,
Moving Defendant does not have a right to privacy protected by the California
Constitution; Article I, §1 of the California Constitution protects the rights
of “people” only.  (SCC Acquisitions,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 741, 755; see Ameri-Medical
Corp. v. Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1260,
1287; Zurich American Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (2007) 155
Cal.App.4th 1485, 1504 [corporation acknowledged that it had no right of
privacy under the California Constitution].)  While corporations do have a right to privacy,
it is not a constitutional right.  The
corporate right to privacy is a lesser right than that held by human beings and
is not considered a fundamental right.  (Ameri-Medical
Corp., 42 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 1287-1288.)
Because
the corporate privacy right is not constitutionally protected, the issue
presented in determining whether Plaintiff’s discovery requests infringe that
right is resolved by a balancing test.  The
discovery’s relevance to the subject matter of the pending dispute and whether
the discovery “appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence” is balanced against the corporate right of privacy.  (Hecht, Solberg, Robinson, Goldberg &
Bagley LLP v. Superior Court (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 579, 595.)  Doubts about relevance generally are resolved
in favor of permitting discovery. (Id.)
Here,
Moving Defendant’s records regarding the sale or transfer of the multi-unit
property Defendant Cenac owned that includes the Subject Property (i.e. RFP 2
Nos. 2, 3) is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence because Plaintiff’s FAC pertains to the ownership of the property and
the legal authorization of Cenac to take possession of the Subject
Property.  (See FAC ¶4.)
Third,
Moving Defendant fails to demonstrate Plaintiff’s discovery requests are
burdensome and oppressive.
Based
on the foregoing, Moving Defendant’s motion for protective order is denied.
 
Sanctions
In light of this Court’s ruling on the motion, Moving
Defendant’s request for sanctions is denied.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendant’s motion for protective order is denied.
Moving Defendant’s request for sanctions is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
