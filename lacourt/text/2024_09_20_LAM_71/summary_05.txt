And here is a summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the court has denied the motion for a protective order filed by 90018 Collection LLC (Moving Defendant) and denied its request for sanctions. The motion was filed in response to the discovery requests served by plaintiff Oyekunle Jegede (Plaintiff) on July 11, 2024, and July 13, 2024. Moving Defendant argued that the discovery requests are overbroad, unfocused, and seek information that is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and that they infringe on its right to privacy under the California Constitution.

The court found that Moving Defendant failed to meet its burden to demonstrate that it needs protection from Plaintiff's discovery requests. The court also found that the discovery requests are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and that Moving Defendant's records regarding the sale or transfer of the multi-unit property are relevant to the subject matter of the pending dispute.

The court also denied Moving Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the discovery requests are not burdensome and oppressive. The court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) and the California Constitution.
