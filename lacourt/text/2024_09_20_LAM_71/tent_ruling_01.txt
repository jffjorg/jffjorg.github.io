TENTATIVE RULING
 



SARA VAN HORN, et al.,  
  
         vs.
 
THE WOMAN’S CLUB OF HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA,
  et al.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV01565
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 20, 2024



 
Plaintiffs Sara Van Horn’s and Patrick Van Horn’s motion
for a protective order is denied.  
 
Plaintiffs Sara Van
Horn (“Sara”) and Patrick Van Horn (“Patrick”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move
for a protective order.  (Notice of
Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§2025.420, 2030.090(a).)  Plaintiffs also move for sanctions up to and
including sanctions striking Defendants The Woman’s Club of Hollywood,
California (“WCOHC”) and Rosemary Lord’s (“Lord”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
pleadings and seeking costs and fees associated with the Motion in an amount no
less than $10,000.  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2031.060, 2023.030; CRC, Rule 3.1152.)
 
Background
On June 27, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
the instant motion for protective order.  On September 6, 2024, Defendants
filed their opposition.  As of the date
of this hearing no reply has been filed.
 
Meet and Confer
          C.C.P.
§2031.060 provides, in part:
When an inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of documents, tangible
things, places, or electronically stored information has been demanded, the
party to whom the demand has been directed, and any other party or affected
person, may promptly move for a protective order. This motion shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
 
(C.C.P. §2031.060(a), emphasis added.)
Plaintiffs’ counsel failed to submit a meet and
confer declaration in compliance with C.C.P. §2016.040.  (See Decl. of Holliday.)  Plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration does not state
facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the
matter outside of court.  (C.C.P. §§2016.040,
2031.060(a).)  Therefore, the Court denies the instant
motion.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ motion for protective order is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
