And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on plaintiff Vitoli Builders, Inc.'s motion to compel the depositions of non-parties Rebecca Ann Buck and Itshak Sananes. The judge denies both motions. The judge finds that the motion to compel Itshak Sananes' deposition was procedurally defective because it was not personally served on Sananes within 60 days of the scheduled deposition. The judge also finds that the motion to compel Rebecca Ann Buck's deposition was procedurally defective because it was not personally served on Buck within 60 days of the scheduled deposition. The judge notes that the failure to personally serve the motions is a jurisdictional issue and that the court lacks the required jurisdiction to hear these motions. The judge orders that both motions be denied.
