```
Case Number: 22VECV01970
Case Type: Premises Liability Negligence
Parties:
  - Plaintiff: Mary Howard
  - Defendant: El Camino Shopping Center, LLC
Court: Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Northwest District
Judge: Hon. Eric Harmon
Hearing Date: June 20, 2024
Department: 107

Order:

* The court's tentative ruling is to deny the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's May 15, 2024 order granting the defendant's requests for monetary sanctions in its motions to compel further.
* The defendant's request for additional monetary sanctions is also denied.
* The court finds that the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is not based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law, and that the plaintiff failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce evidence at an earlier time.
* The court also finds that the defendant did provide evidence that the original motions were properly served on the plaintiff, and that the court considered this evidence before making its May 15 order.
* The court denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, as the court finds that the plaintiff did not engage in bad faith or bring the motion solely to cause unnecessary delay.

  - Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5

Roles:
  - Judge: Hon. Eric Harmon
  - Plaintiff: Mary Howard
  - Defendant: El Camino Shopping Center, LLC

Significant Statements:
  - "The Motion is premised on the factual allegation that the Original Motions were never served on the Plaintiff and that this court's May 15 order on the Original Motions considered only prejudice to the Plaintiff caused by a lack of service of the Original Motions."
  - "The Motion is not 'new or different facts, circumstances, or law' for purposes of a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a)."
  - "We do not find that the Plaintiff engaged in bad faith or that the Motion was frivolous or intended solely to cause unnecessary delay, and sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 for the Plaintiff's bringing of the Motion are therefore unwarranted."
