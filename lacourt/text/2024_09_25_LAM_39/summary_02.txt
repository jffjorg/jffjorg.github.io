Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Medical Management International, Inc. (Defendant) against Nina Pusateri (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff sued the Defendant for employment claims, alleging that she was terminated in retaliation for reporting wrongful conduct. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's refusal to meet in person with her superiors was a legitimate reason for termination.

The judge rules that the Defendant has met its burden of showing that the Plaintiff cannot prevail on her claim for retaliation because the termination was due to the Plaintiff's refusal to engage in an in-person meeting. However, the judge concludes that the Plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact concerning whether the Defendant's termination was retaliatory or for legitimate reasons.

The judge also rules that the Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the Plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) is granted because the termination and requirement to attend in-person meetings are normal parts of the employment process.

Finally, the judge denies the Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages, finding that the Plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact as to whether the Defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous.

The case will proceed to a hearing on September 25, 2024, where the judge will make a final ruling.
