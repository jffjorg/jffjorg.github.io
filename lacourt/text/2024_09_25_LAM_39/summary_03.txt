And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Homeboy Industries, defendant, to the first amended complaint filed by Jose Sevilla, plaintiff. The court has sustained the demurrer, but granted the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint to cure a deficiency. Specifically, the plaintiff did not allege that he filed an administrative complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing before suing under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The court has ordered the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days and has ordered the defendant to provide notice of this order and to file a proof of service of same. The court's ruling is based on the principle that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint, and that the court must liberally construe the allegations of the complaint.
