MOTION
Defendant Homeboy
Industries (“Defendant”) demurs to the complaint of Plaintiff Jose Sevilla
(“Plaintiff”).  Plaintiff opposes the
motion. 
ANALYSIS
“It is black
letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In ruling on a demurrer, the Court must
“liberally construe[]” the allegations of the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.) “This rule of liberal construction means that the reviewing court draws
inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the defendant.” (Perez v. Golden
Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendant
hired Plaintiff to work in its 18-month training program, his case manager did
not like him, and that individual harassed him until he was wrongfully
terminated.  (First Amended Complaint, pp.
2-3.)  Plaintiff asserts causes of action
for harassment, retaliation, and failure to accommodate disability.  Such causes of action arise under the Fair
Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).  An
aggrieved employee must file an administrative complaint with the California
Department of Fair Employment and Housing before suing under FEHA.  (Gov. Code, §§ 12960, 12965, subds. (b), (c)(1)(A)
&(D).) The administrative complaint must set forth the “particulars” of the
alleged discrimination. (Gov. Code, § 12960, subds. (b), (c).)  Plaintiff does not allege he filed an
administrative complaint.  
Accordingly, the
Court sustains the demurrer, but Plaintiff is afforded an opportunity to amend
the complaint to cure this deficiency.  Plaintiff,
therefore, is to file an amended complaint within 20 days of notice of this
order.
Defendant is
ordered to provide notice of this order and to file a proof of service of same.
