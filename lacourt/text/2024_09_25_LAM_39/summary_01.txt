And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to seal Exhibit 2, which was filed publicly and is already part of the public record. The court found that the parties' stipulated protective order is not sufficient to justify sealing the document, and that the court must hold a hearing and make specific findings before sealing records. The court also reviewed the document and did not find it necessary to seal the entire document. The motion to seal is therefore denied.
