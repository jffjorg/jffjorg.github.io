ANALYSIS
Civil court
proceedings are presumptively open to the public. (See Richmond Newspapers,
Inc. v. Virginia (1980) 448 U.S. 555, 580, fn. 17.)  Before sealing records, “a trial court must
hold a hearing and expressly find that (i) there exists an overriding interest
supporting closure and/or sealing; (ii) there is a substantial probability that
the interest will be prejudiced absent closure and/or sealing; (iii) the
proposed closure and/or sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding
interest; and (iv) there is no less restrictive means of achieving the
overriding interest.” (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1217-1218.)
Plaintiff filed
the document at issue publicly.  As such,
the document is already part of the public record, which makes a sealing order
futile.  (Hurvitz v. Hoefflin
(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1245.)  Further,
the Court has reviewed the document and is not convinced sealing the entire
document is warranted.  The Court cannot
order the document sealed simply because of the parties’ stipulated protective
order.  (See In re Marriage of
Nicholas (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1578.)        Accordingly, the motion to seal is denied.
