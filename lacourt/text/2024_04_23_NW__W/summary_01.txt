And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motions to relieve counsel for the parties involved in the case. The reason for the relief is that there has been an irreparable breakdown of the working relationship between the clients and their counsel, resulting in an actual conflict of interest between the counsel and their clients. The judge notes that counsel has complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 and has personally served the clients with copies of the motion papers. The case is set for trial on September 16, 2024, and there is a pending motion for summary judgment set for June 3, 2024.
