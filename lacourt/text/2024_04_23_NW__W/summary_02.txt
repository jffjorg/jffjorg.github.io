And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to reconsider the plaintiff's fee waiver. The defendant argues that the plaintiff may not be entitled to the fee waiver because he failed to disclose the $204,500.00 inheritance as required by the fee waiver application. The plaintiff argues that the defendant made the motion in bad faith and that the court should not allow the defendant's attorney and third parties to be privy to the hearing. The court has scheduled a hearing to determine whether the plaintiff was entitled to the fee waiver and has ordered the plaintiff to present records to establish his eligibility for the fee waiver.
