And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim on a demurrer and motion to strike in a lawsuit filed by Santos Hernandez against the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles and others. The lawsuit involves a workplace injury that occurred when Hernandez fell six stories while working on an elevator at the Jordan Downs Housing Project. The Housing Authority demurred to all six causes of action in the complaint, arguing that they were not pleaded with sufficient particularity and that the causes of action were uncertain. The Housing Authority also moved to strike the prayer for attorney's fees. The Court granted the motion to strike the prayer for attorney's fees without leave to amend, but sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The Court found that the allegations in the complaint did not plead enough facts to apply the exceptions to the Privette doctrine, which would excuse the Housing Authority's liability. The Court gave the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.
