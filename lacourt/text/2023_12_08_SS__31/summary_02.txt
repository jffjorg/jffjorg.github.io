And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting default judgment against Defendant Richard Ryan Sotillo Baes in the amount of $37,445 for the Udiong Plaintiffs (Angelo and Amada Udiong) and $300,000 for Plaintiff Joshua Ancheta. The Udiong Plaintiffs are seeking damages for wrongful death, strict products liability, negligence, breach of warranty, and wrongful death, while Ancheta is seeking damages for special damages and general damages related to injuries from the incident.

The judge has determined that the Udiong Plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages for their own pecuniary loss caused by Decedent Paula Bianca Udiong's death, but has been unable to consider a damages award due to lack of evidence. The judge has also reduced the amount of general damages for Ancheta from $1,500,000 to $200,000 due to insufficient evidence.

The judge has ordered Plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling and has granted the request for default judgment against Defendant Baes.
