And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's physical examination with Dr. Falakassa. The defendant originally noticed the demand for physical examination on July 27, 2023, but the plaintiff did not appear. The parties met and conferenced on proposed dates, but the plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's attempts to schedule the examination. The judge found that the defendant properly served the plaintiff with notice to appear for the physical exam, and the plaintiff did not oppose the motion or provide any valid grounds for refusing to appear. However, the judge denied the motion without prejudice due to the defendant's failure to specify the diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination in the moving papers. The judge ordered the defendant to give notice and encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
