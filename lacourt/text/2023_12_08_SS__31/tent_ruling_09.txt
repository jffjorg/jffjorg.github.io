Background Plaintiff Santos Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Housing Authority of The City of Los Angeles and Does 1 to 50 for damages arising from a workplace injury. Plaintiff alleges he was employed by defendants as a third-party contractor to perform soldering work on an elevator in building 2 of the Jordan Downs Housing Project. While the elevator was positioned at the 6th floor, Plaintiff alleges he fell six stories in free fall when the elevator suddenly fell and crashed to the 1st floor due to broken cables and other malfunctions.  The complaint asserts six causes of action for (1) liability for employee under California Gov. Code §815.2, (2) liability for independent contractor under California Gov. Code §815.4, (3) liability for non-delegable duty §815.6, (4) liability for dangerous condition of property under §835, (5) negligence as a common carrier under California Civil Code §2100, and (6) strict liability under California Civil Code §2101.  Defendant Housing Authority of The City of Los Angeles (“HACLA”) demurs to all six causes of action, arguing Plaintiff has not pleaded with requisite particularity and that the cause of action is uncertain. HACLA additionally moves to strike from the complaint the prayer for attorney’s fees.  Plaintiff opposes the demurrer, and HACLA filed a reply. The motion to strike is unopposed.   II. Motion To Strike Meet and Confer Before filing a motion to strike, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who has filed the pleading subject to the motion to strike and file a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5(a).) The Court finds HACLA has fulfilled this requirement prior to filing the demurrer.  (Mot. Barker Decl. ¶¶ 4-7.)  Discussion The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)  The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with California law, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).)  An immaterial or irrelevant allegation is one that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense; is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense; or a demand for judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subd. (b).)  The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.) HACLA moves to strike any and all references to attorney’s fees and “5. For costs of suit herein incurred and applicable reasonable attorneys’ fees;”. CCP § 1021 provides, “[e]xcept as attorney's fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to their costs, as hereinafter provided.”  The complaint does not cite any authority or assert any allegations suggesting Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney’s fees in this action. Further, Plaintiff does not oppose HACLA’s motion to strike.  Therefore, the unopposed request to strike the prayer for attorney’s fees is GRANTED without leave to amend, but only as to the portion “and applicable reasonable attorneys’ fees” in the prayer. Costs of the suit are generally recoverable by the prevailing party in any action or proceeding, and therefore that portion shall remain. ¿   III. Demurrer A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings.  It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (CCP §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.)  The “face of the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”].) A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action.  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)  Meet and Confer Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (CCP § 430.41(a).)   The Court finds HACLA has fulfilled this requirement prior to filing the demurrer.  (Mot. Barker Decl. ¶¶ 3-7.)  B. Discussion  HACLA argues Plaintiff was an employee of Steel Craft, Inc., a subcontractor for Walton Construction Inc., hired to perform work at the Project. HACLA contends because workers’ compensation benefits are available for the alleged work-related incident, each of Plaintiff’s causes of action are barred by the Privette doctrine.  “ ‘The elements of a negligence cause of action are the existence of a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury…”  (McIntyre v. The Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.)  As in any negligence action, whether a duty was owed under the facts is a question of law for the Court.  (Castaneda v. Olsher (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1205, 1213.)    The WCA provides the exclusive remedy for an injury sustained by an employee in the course and scope of employment. (Lab. Code, §§ 3600, subd. (a), 3602, subd. (a); Charles J. Vacanti, M.D., Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund (2001) 24 Cal.4th 800, 813, 102 Cal.Rptr.2d 562, 14 P.3d 234 (Vacanti).) The workers’ compensation exclusivity rule is based on the “presumed ‘compensation bargain’ ” in which, in exchange for limitations on the amount of liability, the employer assumes liability regardless of fault for injury arising out of and in the course of employment. (Shoemaker v. Myers (1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 16, 276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054.) The compensation bargain encompasses both psychological and physical injury arising out of and in the course of the employment. (Lab. Code, §§ 3600, subd. (a), 3208.3.)  (Shirvanyan v. Los Angeles Community College Dist. (2020) 59 Cal.App.5th 82, 105.)    Consequently, an injured worker's remedies against his employer or a co-employee are (absent narrow exceptions) solely under the workers' compensation law—i.e., there is no “common law” action against the employer or a co-employee because, as a general rule, workers' comp is the exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee occurring in the course and scope of employment.  (Lab. Code §§ 3600, 3601; see generally, Jones v. Kaiser Industries Corp. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 552, 556.)  Moreover, “The Privette doctrine holds that a hirer generally delegates to an independent contractor all responsibility for workplace safety and is not liable for injuries sustained by the contractor or its workers while on the job.”  (Gonzalez v. Mathis (2021) 12 Cal.5th 29, 40.)   There are, however, two exceptions to the Privette doctrine. The court in Miller v. Roseville Lodge No. 1293 (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 825, 833-834 (Miller) described them as follows:  The first exception was recognized in Hooker, supra, 115 Cal.Rptr.2d 853, 38 P.3d 1081 and is usually referred to as the retained control exception. It applies if: (1) the hirer retains control over the manner in which the contractor performs the work; (2) the hirer actually exercises its retained control by involving itself in the work such that the contractor is not entirely free to do the work in its own manner; and (3) the hirer’s exercise of retained control affirmatively contributes to the worker's injury. (Sandoval, at pp. 276-277, 283 Cal.Rptr.3d 519, 494 P.3d 487.) Under this exception, the hirer's delegation of tort duties to the independent contractor can be seen as “incomplete” or “only partial[ ]” because it retains control over some aspect of the work and actually exercises that retained control. (Id. at p. 271, 283 Cal.Rptr.3d 519, 494 P.3d 487.)  The second exception was recognized in Kinsman, supra, 37 Cal.4th 659, 36 Cal.Rptr.3d 495, 123 P.3d 931 and is usually referred to as the concealed hazard exception. It applies if the hirer is also an owner or possessor of land, and if “the landowner knew, or should have known, of a latent or concealed preexisting hazardous condition on its property, the contractor did not know and could not have reasonably discovered this hazardous condition, and the landowner failed to warn the contractor about this condition.” (Id. at p. 664, 36 Cal.Rptr.3d 495, 123 P.3d 931, fn.omitted.) Under this exception, the hirer’s delegation of tort duties can be seen as “ineffective” because the independent contractor cannot protect its workers against a hazard it does not know about and could not reasonably discover. (Sandoval, supra, 12 Cal.5th at p. 271, 283 Cal.Rptr.3d 519, 494 P.3d 487.)  Here, the complaint’s general allegations plead, in relevant part, that HACLA owns and manages the Jordan Downs Housing Project where Plaintiff was employed as a third-party contractor to perform work on an elevator (Compl. at ¶¶ 1 and 3), that the “elevator was in a state of poor maintenance. One or more cables broke along with other malfunctions, causing the elevator platform to fall six stories” (Id. at ¶ 6) and that “Defendants knew, at the time Plaintiff was sent to work on the elevator that the elevator was in poor condition and dangerous” (Id. at ¶ 7.) In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the retained control exception applies because HACLA actively participated in the manner in which Plaintiff performed his soldering work, and provided Plaintiff instruction. However, as Defendants point out on reply, there are no facts in the complaint alleging that HACLA retained control and exercise of Plaintiff’s work. The Court agrees that the allegations do not plead enough facts to encompass any of the exceptions. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained. However, because there is a possibility for an amendment to change the legal effect of the pleading, HACLA’s demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend.   Plaintiff is granted twenty (20) days leave to amend.¿  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 8th day of December 2023      Hon.
