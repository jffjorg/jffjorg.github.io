And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant, Adam Zames, argues that he is entitled to summary judgment because there is no evidence that he was negligent and that there are no allegations that would allow the plaintiff to pursue a claim against him as an individual. The plaintiff, John Hampton, opposes the motion, requesting that the Court continue the hearing to allow for further discovery, including the depositions of Adam Zames and forklift driver Jose Luis Rodriguez, and to allow discovery on Jam-N Logistics' corporate minutes. The Court will not consider the merits of the motion yet and will continue the hearing to allow for further discovery. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and the Court will not be inclined to continue the motion again if the plaintiff fails to promptly complete any remaining discovery. The hearing is continued to a date to be determined in 2024.
