(the “Spa”), Altaf Amlani (“Amlani”), and DOES 1-10, inclusive (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Lease; (2) Breach of Guaranty; (3) Claim and Delivery; and (4) Willful and Malicious Conversion.On February 26, 2020, Defendants Spa and Amlani filed their answer. The same day, they filed a cross-complaint against Pawnee; Laser Leasing, Inc.; John Case a.k.a. Collin Casey; and DOES 1-10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for (1) Fraud and (2) Theft by False Pretenses.On June 9, 2020, Defendants Spa and Amlani filed an amended cross-complaint against Pawnee. Pawnee filed its answer on October 29, 2020.On February 14, 2022, Cross-Defendant John Casey was dismissed from the case without prejudice. The same day, a bench trial was scheduled for May 3, 2023, in Department M.On November 18, 2022, the court scheduled a post-mediation status conference for December 2, 2022. The post-mediation status conference was continued to November 8, 2023.On July 6, 2023, Defendants Spa and Amlani filed a motion for summary judgment (“MSJ”) or in the alternative, summary adjudication (“MSA”). Pawnee filed an opposition on September 12, 2023. On November 14, 2023, the court denied the MSJ and MSA.On April 17, 2024, Defendants Spa and Amlani filed a motion in limine to exclude certain evidence. Pawnee filed its opposition on April 30, 2024.A non-jury trial was held on July 15, 2024, to argue the motion in limine. The parties held an informal settlement conference on the same day and informed the judge that the matters in the complaint and cross-complaint had been settled.On July 25, 2024, the parties informed the court that the settlement had not been finalized.On August 27, 2024, Defendants Spa and Amlani filed the instant motion and a request for judicial notice in support of the motion. Pawnee filed its opposition on September 11, 2024. Defendants Spa and Amlani filed a reply on September 17, 2024.On September 19, 2024, Defendants Spa and Amlani filed a memorandum of costs.FACTUAL BACKGROUNDPawnee filed a complaint to collect payments from Defendants Spa and Amlani, pursuant to an equipment lease agreement “Agreement.” (Motion, p. 1, lines 4-8.) At the hearing on Defendants’ Motion in Limine, Defendants established that Amlani did not sign the Agreement upon which Pawnee’s complaint relied. (Motion, p. 1, lines 9-10.) The court excluded the signature and date on the Agreement from evidence. (Motion, p. 1, lines 12-13.)Subsequently, the parties reached a settlement agreement (“Settlement”). (Motion, p. 1, line 15.) The Settlement deemed Defendants Amlani and Spa the “prevailing parties,” entitling them to recover attorney’s fees and costs. (Motion, p. 1, line 15.) The parties agreed to cap recovery of fees at $100,000. (Motion, p. 1, lines 17-18.)Defendants Spa and Amlani now seek to recover $100,000 in attorney’s fees and costs, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement; Civil Code section 1717, subd. (a); and Code of Civil Procedure section 1032.LEGAL STANDARDA prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including attorneys’ fees, as a matter of right. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, subd. (a)(4), 1032, subd. (b), and 1033.5.) In a breach of contract action, attorneys’ fees shall be awarded when a contract provides that one of the parties or the prevailing party shall be awarded attorneys’ fees in an action on that contract. (See Civ. Code, § 1717.)Generally, if a request for attorney’s fees is based on a contractual right, the prevailing party may only recover fees under Civil Code section 1717, to the extent they relate to the contract action. (Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 124, 129.) However, “[a]ttorney's fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in which they are not allowed.” (Id. at pp. 129-130.)The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. A computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.) Such an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id. at p. 48, n. 23.) After the trial court has performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether the total award so calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is more than a reasonable amount and, if so, shall reduce the section 1717 award so that it is a reasonable figure. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096.)The factors considered in determining the modification of the lodestar include the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required and employed to handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm, LLC v. Teitler Family Trust (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774 (emphasis in original).) A negative modifier was appropriate when duplicative work had been performed. (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)DISCUSSIONMoving Party’s ArgumentsDefendants Amlani and Spa argue that they are entitled to attorney’s fees and costs as the prevailing party in this matter. Further, the Settlement provides that they may recover up to $100,000.Defendants contend that they incurred attorney’s fees in excess of $112,892.43 because they have been defending this action for about four years. The fees incurred were reasonable because Pawnee continued to argue a case it knew had no merit and defense counsel spent 283.40 hours on this matter.Moreover, defense counsel argues that his fee is reasonable, given prevailing market rates. Defense counsel has thirty years of experience, and his standard fee ranges from $490-600 per hour. However, the lowered his usual fee to $400 per hour once it was clear that Pawnee intended to pursue this matter, despite the evidentiary deficiencies.Responding Party’s OppositionPawnee argues that the requested fees are unreasonable. Further, the court should prorate the requested fee to exclude time spent defending against non-contract claims, as the bulk of Pawnee’s complaint was based on fraud, theft, and unfair business practices claims. Pawnee also contends that defense counsel purposefully block billed to make it difficult for the court to determine what a reasonable award would be.Pawnee alleges that defense counsel filed an unnecessary cross-complaint to inflate his hours and increase his payout.Procedurally, the request for attorney’s fees is defective because defense counsel block billed and failed to submit a cost memorandum.Reply ArgumentsThe Settlement does not limit Defendants’ ability to recover fees, so it is unnecessary to prorate the fees to exclude time spent working on non-contract matters.Defendants argue that if anyone dragged out litigation, it was Pawnee because Defendants attempted to settle in 2021.Defendants argue that their requested fees are reasonable, as they incurred expenses in excess of the requested $100,000.Evidentiary ObjectionPlaintiff’s evidentiary objection as to the settlement discussion between the parties is overruled.Merits of the MotionA. Request for Judicial NoticeDefendants request judicial notice of Pawnee’s complaint. The court may take notice of its own file. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) The request is GRANTED.B. Reasonableness of FeeGiven prevailing market rates for attorneys with defense counsel’s level of experience, an hourly fee of $400 is reasonable.C. Apportionment of FeesThe parties agree that the Defendants are the prevailing parties for the purposes of this motion. The main issue is whether their requested fees should be prorated to exclude the non-contract claims.Pawnee cites to Reynolds and asserts that the court should limit the Defendants’ recovery because the gravamen of the complaint was tort-based. However, the court finds this argument unpersuasive, given Pawnee’s complaint requested attorney’s fees for all causes of actions, even those they claim are based in tort.Therefore, having considered the declarations of Defendant’s counsel and the court’s records of this action, the court finds that an award of $100,000 in attorneys' fees is reasonable. In addition, Defendant’s memorandum of costs is supported by sufficient documentation.CONCLUSIONDefendant Spa and Amlani’s motion to recover attorney’s fees and costs is GRANTED in the amount of $103,234.43 ($100,000 in fees and $3,234.43 in costs)Defendants to give notice.
