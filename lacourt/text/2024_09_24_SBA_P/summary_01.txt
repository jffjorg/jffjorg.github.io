And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion by Blue Diamond Spa, Inc. and Altaf Amlani (Defendants) for attorney's fees and costs as the prevailing party in this matter. The Defendants seek to recover $100,000 in attorney's fees and costs, pursuant to the settlement agreement and Civil Code section 1717.

The court finds that the settlement agreement does not limit the Defendants' ability to recover fees, and therefore, the requested fees should not be prorated to exclude time spent working on non-contract claims. The court also finds that the requested fees are reasonable, considering the prevailing market rates for attorneys with defense counsel's level of experience.

The court awards the Defendants $103,234.43 in attorney's fees and costs, which includes $100,000 in fees and $3,234.43 in costs. The court grants the motion in its entirety.
