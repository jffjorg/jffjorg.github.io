BACKGROUND
             On July 19, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant
Petition and Declaration Regarding Unresolved Claims and Deposit of
Undistributed Surplus Proceeds of Trustee Sale (the “Petition”) The gross
amount of deposit is $223,387.59 (Pet. ¶ 16.) 
 


 
DISCUSSION
            Civil Code section 2924j subdivision
(c) states in pertinent part: If after due diligence, the trustee is unable to
determine the priority of the written claims received by the trustee to the
trustee’s sale surplus of multiple persons or if the trustee determines there
is a conflict between potential claimants the trustee may file a declaration of
the unresolved claims and deposit with the clerk of the superior court of the
county in which the sale occurred, that portion of the sales proceeds that
cannot be distributed, less any charges by the clerk pursuant to this
subdivision. (Civ. Code § 2924j subd. (c).)
            
            Petitioner is the Trustee under Deed
of Trust executed by Joel Hyman and recorded on May 12, 2009. (Pet. ¶¶ 2-3.)
The Deed of Trust was secured by real property commonly known as 1443 East 92nd
Street, Los Angeles, CA 90002. (Pet. ¶ 2.) The property was sold at a
non-judicial foreclosure sale on April 11, 2003 and generated funds exceeding
the amount due and owing under the Deed of Trust. (Mot. pp. 1:25-2:5.) 
 
            On April 12, 2023, counsel for Petitioner
mailed a Notice of Surplus Funds to all potential claimants via first class
mail. (Pet. ¶ 3, Attach. 8.) Petitioner “has determined there is a conflict
between potential claimants to the surplus proceeds.” (Pet. ¶¿11(b), Attach. 11(b).)
On June 1, 2023, Petitioner received a claim from Goldsmith & Hull APC,
attorney for Banco Popular North America. (Pet. Attach. 11(b), Ex. B.) On June
28, 2023, Petitioner received a claim from the Controller, State of California.
(Pet. Attach. 11(b), Ex. C.)
 
On July 19, 2024, Petitioner filed this
Petition. The Petition states that the property located at 1443 East 92nd
Street, Los Angeles, CA 90002, was the subject of a trustee sale held on April
11, 2003 (Pet. ¶¶ 2, 4.) The property was sold for $481,000.00 and $227,132.36
in surplus funds remained. (Pet. ¶¶ 6, 7.) A copy of the trustee’s sale
guarantee is attached to the Petition. (Pet. ¶ 5, Attach. 5.) The identity,
location, and priority of the potential claimants is discussed in the
Petition.  (Pet. ¶¶ 8, 11, Attachs. 8, 11(b).)
 
All claimants have been served with Notice
of Petition, Petition, and related documents. 
(7/26/2024 Proof of Service.)  
 
            Petitioner
requests permission to deposit the surplus funds with the Court and a court
order discharging Petitioner from the matter. 

 
            Having
reviewed the Petition, the Court finds it satisfies the requirements of Civil
Code section¿2924j with respect to the trustee’s declaration, trustee’s notice,
and service of written notice to all potential claimants to the surplus funds.
 
            The Motion is GRANTED. 
 
Petitioner is ordered to deposit surplus
funds of $223,387.59 with the Court within twenty (20) days of service of this
order.  
 
            Upon
deposit of the surplus funds to the Court and filing of the proof of service of
the notice of disbursement hearing, Petitioner shall be discharged of further
responsibility for the disbursement of sale proceeds. (Civ. Code § 2924j subd. (c).)

 
 
 
A Hearing on Claims to the Undistributed
Surplus Funds is set for February 27, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 56 at the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
