And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (Transferee) v. J.D. (Payee). The Transferee has petitioned the Court to approve the transfer of certain structured settlement payment rights from the Payee. The Judge has found that the transfer is in the best interest of the Payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the Payee's dependent. The Judge has also found that the transfer is fair and reasonable because the underlying settlement was intended as compensation for a personal injury claim and was not intended to provide for future medical care and treatment or necessary living expenses. The Payee was advised in writing to seek independent professional advice, but chose not to do so. The Judge has granted the Transferee's petition and approved the transfer of the structured settlement payment rights.
