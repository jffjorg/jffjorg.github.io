Petitioner J.G. Wentworth Originations,
LLC’s unopposed amended petition for approval of transfer of payment
rights is granted.  
 
Petitioner
J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (“JG Wentworth”) (“Petitioner”) (“Transferee”)
petitions unopposed for this Court to approve its Amended Petition and

Legal
Standard
Insurance Code §10137 provides, “[a] transfer
of structured settlement payment rights is void unless a court reviews and
approves the transfer and finds the following conditions are met: (a) [t]he
transfer of the structured settlement payment rights is fair and reasonable and
in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support
of his or her dependents [; and] (b) [t]he transfer complies with the
requirements of this article, will not contravene other applicable law, and the
court has reviewed and approved the transfer as provided in Section 10139.5.”  (Ins. Code §10137.)  The transfer agreement is effective only upon
approval in a final court order.  (Ins.
Code §10139.5(a).)
Insurance Code §10139.5(a) requires the court
to make the following findings:
(1)  
The transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account
the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents.
(2)  
The payee has been advised in writing by the transferee to seek
independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has either received
that advice or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the
advice.
(3)  
The transferee has complied with the notification requirements pursuant
to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has provided the payee with
a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement
complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.
(4)  
The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the order of
any court or other government authority.
(5)  
The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the
terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136.
(6)  
The payee understands and does not wish to exercise the payee’s right to
cancel the transfer agreement.
 
(Ins. Code §10139.5(a).)
In addition, pursuant to Insurance Code §10139.5(c):

Every petition for approval of a transfer of structured settlement
payment rights, except as provided in subdivision (d), shall include, to the
extent known after the transferee has made reasonable inquiry with the payee,
all of the following:
 
(1)
The payee’s name, address, and age.
(2)
The payee’s marital status, and, if married or separated, the name of
the payee’s spouse.      
(3)
The names, ages, and place or places of residence of the payee’s minor
children or other dependents, if any.
(4)
The amounts and sources of the payee’s monthly income and financial
resources and, if presently married, the amounts and sources of the monthly
income and financial resources of the payee’s spouse. 
(5)
 Whether the payee is currently
obligated under any child support or spousal support order, and, if so, the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or agency
that is receiving child or spousal support from the payee under that order or
that has jurisdiction over the order or the payments in question.
(6)
Information regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers, as
described in paragraph (11), (12), or (13) of subdivision (b).  The transferee or payee may choose to provide
this information by providing copies of pleadings, transaction documents, or
orders involving any previous attempted or completed transfer or by providing
the court a summary of available information regarding any previous transfer or
attempted transfer, such as the date of the transfer or attempted transfer, the
payments transferred or attempted to be transferred by the payee in the earlier
transaction, the amount of money received by the payee in connection with the
previous transaction, and generally the payee’s reasons for pursuing or
completing a previous transaction.  
 
(Ins. Code §10139.5(c).)
 
Discussion
In or about February 23, 1998, Payee Jawhar
Dunn (“Dunn”) (“Payee”) became entitled to certain structured settlement
payments resulting from a claim for damages arising in connection with a
personal injury claim.  (Amended Petition
¶¶2-3.)  The settlement Payee agreed to provides
for periodic structured payments including, but not limited to, (A) 1 payment of
$65,000.00 on March 1, 2039, and (B) 1 payment of $211,923.00 on March 1, 2042.  (Amended Petition ¶4.)  
The “annuity issuer” who has issued an insurance
contract used to fund the structured settlement payments is Prudential
Insurance Company of America.  (Amended
Petition ¶5.)  The “structured settlement
obligor” with respect to the aforementioned structured settlement payments is
Prudential Assigned Settlement Services Corp. 
(Amended Petition ¶6.)  Payee has
agreed to sell, and Transferee, JG Wentworth, has agreed to purchase certain
lump sum payments as referenced within their proposed Purchase Agreement.  (First Amended Exh. A.)
All of this information has been properly
disclosed to Payee by way of the disclosure form in compliance with Insurance
Code §10136, as required by Insurance Code §10139.5(a)(3).  (Amended Petition ¶9(A), Exh. B.)  Payee was also advised in writing to seek
independent legal, tax, and financial professional advice.  (Amended Petition, pg. 4 at Exh. E.)  Payee chose not to seek an independent
professional’s advice.  (Amended Petition,
pg. 4 at Exh. E §A.)  Therefore,
Petitioner has complied with the statutory disclosure requirements in Insurance
Code §10139.5(a)(2).
The transfer agreement also complies with
Insurance Code §§10136 and 10138 as required by Insurance Code §10139.5(a)(3).  The transfer agreement does not contravene any
applicable statute or order of any court or other governmental authority.  (Ins. Code §10139.5(a)(4).)  Petitioner has also provided copies of the Annuity
Contract and Qualified Assignment Agreement and the underlying Settlement
Agreement.  (Amended Petition, Exhs. C,
D.)

(Decl. of Payee ¶9.)  Petitioner has provided all of the

Analysis
of Transfer
The terms of the proposed Purchase Agreement
are as follows:
You have agreed to sell to the transferee future payments totaling
Sixty-Five Thousand Dollars and 00/100 Cents dollars ($$65,000.00) in exchange
for a purchase price of Fifteen Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars and 00/100
Cents dollars ($$15,250.00).
 
Those future payments have a discounted present value equal to
Thirty-Five Thousand Twenty-Three Dollars and 53/100 Cents dollars ($$35,023.53).
This is the value of your structured settlement in current dollars. This amount
was calculated by applying the discount rate of 4.40% percent utilized by the
Internal Revenue Service to value annuities in probate proceedings.
 
The purchase price to be paid to you was calculated using a discount rate
of 10.62% percent.
 
The purchase price payable to you is less than the present value of the
future payments stated above because the discount rate of your transaction is
greater than the rate utilized by the Internal Revenue Service.
 
(First Amended Exh. B, at pg. 1.)
Pursuant to Insurance Code §10139.5(b)(2), the
Payee declares that he is currently experiencing financial hardship and if
approved, he plans to use the money received from the proposed settlement to
put a down payment on a house. (Decl. of Payee ¶11.)  The Amended Petition states that the funds
received from the transaction contemplated in the Purchase Agreement can be
better used today to provide for the foregoing, rather than to provide support
to Payee several years from now. 
(Amended Petition, pg. 4.)  The
Payee declares, “[w]hen the original settlement was completed, the future
period payment(s) that are the subject of the proposed transfer were not
intended to pay for the future medical care and treatment relating to the
incident that was the subject of the settlement. The settlement was monetary in
its entirety.”  (Decl. of Payee ¶6.)  Further, the Payee declares, “[w]hen the
original settlement was completed, the future periodic payments that are the subject
of the proposed transfer were solely monetary in nature and were not intended
to provide for necessary living expenses.” 
(Decl. of Payee ¶7.)
The Court finds the transfer is in the best
interest of the Payee, taking into account the welfare and support of Payee’s
dependent.  The Court determines the
transfer is fair and reasonable because the underlying settlement was intended
as compensation for a personal injury claim and were not intended to pay for
future medical care and treatment, nor were they intended to provide for
necessary living expenses; therefore, the instant transfer does not deprive the
Payee of funds that were set aside for future essential needs.  (See Amended Petition, pg. 7.)  The Payee was fully informed of his rights
and has knowingly waived independent professional advice regarding the
transfer.  (Amended Petition, Exh. E.)
Accordingly, Petitioner’s petition is granted.

 
Conclusion
Petitioner’s unopposed petition
is granted.
