Motion to Compel Arbitration
A.  Arbitration Agreements
1.    
Plaintiff Does Not Challenge The
Arbitration Agreement’s Existence
Federal
law provides for enforcement of arbitration agreements. The Federal Arbitration
Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq. (“FAA”), establishes a strong federal policy
in favor of arbitration of disputes where a written arbitration agreement
exists. Section 2 of the FAA provides, in pertinent part that “[a] written
provision . . . to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out
of such contract . . .  shall be valid, irrevocable, and
enforceable.”  (9 U.S.C. §2.)  The purpose of the FAA is to “reverse
the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements.” (Gilmer v.
Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. (1991) 500 U.S. 20, 24.)  The FAA places
arbitration agreements “on an equal footing with other contracts and [requires
courts] to enforce them according to their terms.”  (AT&T Mobility,
LLC v. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333, 339; see also Rent-A-Center
West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010) 561 U.S. 63, 67 [“The FAA reflects the
fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.”].)  The
FAA will preempt not only a state law that “discriminat[es] on its face against
arbitration,” but also a state law that “covertly accomplishes the same
objective by disfavoring contracts that (oh so coincidentally) have the
defining features of arbitration agreements.”  (Kindred Nursing Centers
Limited Partnership v. Clark (2017) 137 S.Ct. 1421, 1426.)
The
United States Supreme Court has specifically held that the FAA applies to
employment contracts: “[A]s a matter of law the answer is clear.  In the
Federal Arbitration Act, Congress has instructed federal courts to enforce
arbitration agreements according to their terms.”  (Epic Systems Corp.
v. Lewis (2018) 138 S.Ct. 1612, 1619 [holding that employees must submit to
arbitration agreements including those with collective action waivers].)  
The
FAA restricts a court’s inquiry related to compelling arbitration to two
threshold questions: (1) whether there was an agreement to arbitrate between
the parties; and (2) whether the agreement covers the dispute.  (Howsam
v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (2002) 537 U.S. 79, 84.)  
California
law also favors arbitration for dispute resolution. The California Arbitration
Act (“CAA”), codified at C.C.P. §1281 et seq., provides, “A written
agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy
thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such
grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.”  (C.C.P. §1281; see
also Grafton Partners L.P. v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 955
[“[U]nlike predispute jury waivers, predispute arbitration agreements are
specifically authorized by statute.”].)  
“California
law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid arbitration
agreements.”  (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc.
(2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97, 99.)  The public policy in favor of
arbitration is so strong that California courts have held that an employee is
“bound by the provisions of the [arbitration] agreement regardless of whether
[he] read it or [was] aware of the arbitration clause when [he] signed the
document.”  (Brookwood v. Bank of America (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th
1667, citing Macaulay v. Norlander (1992) 12 Cal.App.4th 1.)  The
only prerequisite for a court to order arbitration is a determination that the
parties have entered into an agreement to arbitrate the dispute.  (United
Transportation Union v. Southern California Rapid Transit District (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 804, 808.)  Thus, arbitration must be ordered “unless the
agreement clearly does not apply to the dispute in question.”  (Vianna
v. Doctors’ Management Co. (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1189.)
Defendant
makes the barest of showings that Plaintiff agreed to arbitrate disputes
arising out of Plaintiff's employment with Defendant.  Plaintiff does not
challenge Plaintiff’s showing.  (Compare, Fabian v. Renovate America,
Inc. (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 1062, 1067.)  Accordingly, the Court
finds that Plaintiff agreed to the terms of employment argued by Defendant,
including an agreement to arbitrate the instant dispute.  
 
B.
Unconscionability
“[P]rocedural
and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to
exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the
doctrine of unconscionability.”  (Armendariz, 24 Cal.4th at pg.
102.)  Courts invoke a sliding scale which disregards the regularity of
the procedural process of the contract formation, that creates the terms, in
proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive
terms themselves, i.e., the more substantively oppressive the contract term,
the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to conclude that
the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.  (Id., at pg.
114.)  Plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the provision at issue
is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.  
 
1.    
Procedural Unconscionability
Plaintiff
argues the Arbitration Agreement is procedurally unconscionable because the
Arbitration Agreement is a contract of adhesion.  (Opposition, pgs. 7-8.)
“Procedural
unconscionability focuses on the elements of oppression and surprise.
[Citations] ‘Oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which
results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice . . .
Surprise involves the extent to which the terms of the bargain are hidden in a
‘prolix printed form’ drafted by a party in a superior bargaining position.’
[Citations.]”  (Roman v. Superior Court (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th
1462, 1469.)
Procedural
unconscionability “focuses on the unequal bargaining positions and hidden terms
common in the context of adhesion contracts.”  (24 Hour Fitness, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1212-1213.)  Although
standard employment agreements offered on a “take it or leave it” basis are
generally considered contracts of adhesion, this alone is not enough to equate
to unconscionability.  (See Graham v. Scissor-Tail, Inc. (1981)
28 Cal.3d 807, 817-819 [“To describe a contract as adhesive in character is not
to indicate its legal effect. It is, rather, ‘the beginning and not the end of
the analysis insofar as enforceability of its terms are concerned.’”].) 
Adhesion contracts are “fully enforceable . . . unless certain other factors
are present which under established legal rules—legislative or judicial—operate
to render it otherwise.”  (Id. at pgs. 819-820; Harper v. Ultimo
(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1409 [adhesion alone does not render
arbitration agreements unconscionable]; see also Armendariz, 24
Cal.4th at 114; Lagatree v. Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps, LLP
(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1105 [discussing many authorities upholding
arbitration agreements contained in adhesion contracts].) 
Plaintiff’s
argument in opposition that his requirement to sign the Arbitration Agreement
as a condition of his employment is unavailing and is unsupported by case
law.  The adhesive nature of arbitration agreements in the employment
context alone does not render an agreement unenforceable.  (Lagatree,
74 Cal.App.4th at pg. 1127 [“[C]ases uniformly agree that a compulsory
predispute arbitration agreement is not rendered unenforceable just because it
is required as a condition of employment or offered on a ‘take it or leave it’
basis.”]; Armendariz, 24 Cal. 4th at pg. 113 [holding that the
requirement that the employee sign an arbitration agreement may contain some
elements of procedural unconscionability, but that, in itself, does not
invalidate the arbitration agreement]; Ajamian v. CantorCO2e, LP (2012)
203 Cal.App.4th 771, 796 [“Where there is no other indication of oppression or
surprise, the degree of procedural unconscionability of an adhesion agreement
is low[.]”].)  
Here,
the Application Statement and Agreement includes in all caps at the top of the
first page, “CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.” (Decl. of Makerian ¶10,
Exh. A.)  The agreement further provides:
I UNDERSTAND THAT I AM GIVING UP THE
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY . . . MY SIGNATURE BELOW ATTESTS TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE
BEEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ AND CONSIDER THIS AGREEMENT . . . DO NOT SIGN
UNTIL YOU HAVE READ THE ABOVE ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND AGREEMENT.”
 
(Decl.
of Makerian ¶10, Exh. A.)
Plaintiff
has failed to demonstrate any procedural unconscionability.  (Hicks v.
Superior Court (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 77, 91.)  Further, Plaintiff
does not submit a declaration in support of his opposition with sufficient
evidence to contradict that Defendant provided him with sufficient
opportunities to review and ask questions about the documents he signed.  
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds the Arbitration Agreement is, at most,
minimally procedurally unconscionable.  However, as discussed below, the
Court finds the arbitration agreement is not substantively
unconscionable.  
 
2.    
Substantive Unconscionability
Plaintiff
argues the Arbitration Agreement is substantively unconscionable because (1) it
is an infinite agreement; (2) the Arbitration Agreement lacks mutuality; (3)
improperly stays non-arbitrable claims; and (4) permits Defendant to delay
payment of arbitration fees until 60 days prior to the commencement of the
arbitration hearing, in violation of CCP §1281.98(a)(1).  (Opposition,
pgs. 7-13.)
“Substantive
unconscionability focuses on the actual terms of the agreement and evaluates
whether they create ‘overly harsh’ or ‘‘one-sided’ results’ [Citations] that
is, whether contractual provisions reallocate risks in an objectively
unreasonable or unexpected manner.  [Citation] Substantive
unconscionability ‘may take various forms,’ but typically is found in the
employment context when the arbitration agreement is ‘one-sided’ in favor of
the employer without sufficient justification, for example, when ‘the
employee’s claims against the employer, but not the employer’s claims against
the employee, are subject to arbitration.’ [Citations].”  (Roman,
172 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 1469-1470.)  In determining whether an arbitration
agreement is unconscionable, the Court considers whether the agreement: (1)
provides for a neutral arbitrator; (2) provides for reasonable discovery; (3)
requires a written award; (4) provides for the same remedies that otherwise
would be available in court; and (5) does not require employees to bear costs
unique to arbitration.  (See Armendariz, 24 Cal.4th at pgs.
102-103.)
First,
Plaintiff contends that the Agreement is an infinite agreement.  Plaintiff
is mistaken.  The comprehensive reach of the arbitration agreement makes
it more fair, not less because arbitration agreements that are broadly drafted
apply to all “claims an employer might bring as well as those an employee might
bring.”.  (Baltazar v. Forever 21, Inc. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1237,
1249.)  Here, the arbitration agreement is written to ensure both parties
can bring claims pursuant to the arbitration agreement. Further, unlike the
arbitration agreement in Cook v. University of Southern California
(2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 312, the present Arbitration Agreement can be
interpreted to terminate after a reasonable duration, since no procedure for
revocation is provided.  Additionally, Plaintiff could have inferred that
the arbitration agreement would apply to future claims because the agreement
was a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, and therefore would reasonably be
interpreted to apply to future claims, since no claims had occurred between
Plaintiff and Defendant prior to Plaintiff’s signing of the Arbitration
Agreement.
Second,
Plaintiff’s argument that the Agreement lacks mutuality is unavailing. 
Section 4 of the agreement makes clear that LAX Automotives’ third-party
beneficiaries include “owners, directors, officers, managers, employees,
agents, partners, attorneys, sister-companies, subsidiaries, parent companies,
joint-venturers, affiliated persons/entities, independent contractors, and
parties affiliated with its employee benefit and health plans.” (Decl. of
Makerian, Exh. A at §4.) The entities identified by Plaintiff are inapplicable
to Plaintiff because he does not identify which of his third-party
beneficiaries to this Arbitration Agreement—assuming he has any—Defendant would
ever have a claim against.  Nonetheless, an arbitration agreement lacks
mutuality only where the employer asks the employee to arbitrate his claims
“without accepting that forum for itself.”  (Armendariz, 24 Cal.4th
at pg. 118.) Here, both Defendant and Plaintiff agreed to arbitrate their
claims.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s argument on this basis is unavailing.
Third,
Plaintiff’s argument that the agreement is unconscionable because it is in
violation of the EFAA is inapplicable and a complete non-sequitur; Plaintiff
does not state any claims relating to sexual harassment or sexual assault.
Finally,
Plaintiff’s argument that the improper arbitration fee provision renders the
agreement substantively unconscionable is unavailing.  The agreement
expressly requires Defendant to “pay all costs and arbitration
fees unique to the arbitration as required by controlling case law.” 
(Decl. of Makerian ¶10, Exh. A at §8, emphasis added.) 
Based
on the evidence before the Court, the terms of the Arbitration Agreement do not
create overly harsh or one-sided results, satisfying the requirements for a
substantively conscionable agreement.
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds the Arbitration Agreement is not
substantively unconscionable.  
 
C.   
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s
claims is granted.  The Court sets a Status Conference regarding the
arbitration on January 13, 2026, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 71.  The
parties are ordered to submit a Joint Status Conference Report advising the
Court of the status of the matter by January 6, 2026.   Plaintiff’s
representative claim is stayed  pending
the arbitration.
