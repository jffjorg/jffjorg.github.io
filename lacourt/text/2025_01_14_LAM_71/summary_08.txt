And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24STCV22082 between 3LA MGMT LLC and The Desert Seven LLC. The defendant, The Desert Seven LLC, had filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, alleging uncertainty, failure to state a claim, and whether the contract, if there is any, is written, oral, or implied by conduct. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for common counts. The judge also found that the defendant's failure to submit a meet and confer declaration was not grounds to overrule or sustain the demurrer. The judge has concluded that the defendant's demurrer to the entire complaint is overruled, and the moving party is required to give notice.
