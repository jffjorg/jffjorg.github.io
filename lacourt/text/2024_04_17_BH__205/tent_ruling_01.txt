  Case Number:  22SMCV01934    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   LEO DAVID,   Plaintiff, v.  AURICE VELOSO,   Defendants.    Case No.:  22STCV35085   C/W Case No. 22STCV01934     Hearing Date:  April 17, 2024      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF LEO DAVID’S MOTIONS TO    COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO     REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS, SPECIAL    INTERROGATORIES, FORM    INTERROGATORIES AND REQUESTS   PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS         BACKGROUND This case arises from an employment dispute.  Defendant Aurice Veloso was a long-time caregiver for Plaintiff Leo David and his late wife, Ruth David.  (Compl. ¶¶ 7-8.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant stole monies and personal property and engaged in financial and physical elder abuse.  (Id. ¶¶ 11-30.)   The operative complaint alleges eleven claims for: (1) Elder Abuse; (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (3) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (5) Promissory Estoppel; (6) Breach of Oral Agreement; (7) Fraud; (8) Conversion; (9) Trespass to Chattel; (10) Defamation: Slander (Cal. Civ. Code § 46); and (11) Unjust Enrichment.  This hearing is on David’s four motions to compel further responses to requests for admissions, special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for production of documents.  David also seeks monetary sanctions.  David argues that (1) Veloso waived all of her objections; (2) Veloso’s amended answers are evasive and not code-compliant; (3) Veloso’s objections are boilerplate and meritless, and (4) Veloso’s initial responses (containing only boilerplate objections) and subsequent false promises to provide amended answers constitute misuse of the discovery process and are sanctionable.    LEGAL STANDARD  On receipt of a response to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and/or demand requests, the propounding and/or demanding party may move for an order compelling further response if: (1) the response is evasive or incomplete; (2) the representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) the objection is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a), 2031.310, subd. (a).)¿¿¿ “On receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party deems that either or both of the following apply: (1)¿An answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete[;] (2)¿An objection to a particular request is without merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a)(1)–(2).) TIMELINESS  David’s motions to compel further are timely.  On November 29, 2023, the parties agreed to extend the parties’ motion to compel deadlines to January 10, 2024.  (Ex. 9 to McKeon Decl.)  On December 14, 2023, the parties again agreed to extend the deadlines from January 10, 2024 to February 10, 2024.  (Ex. 10 to McKeon Decl.)  On January 26, 2024, this deadline was further extended by agreement between the parties to a date “two weeks after the new [informal discovery conference] IDC.”  (Ex. 13 to McKeon Decl.)  The “new” IDC occurred on March 8, 2024—thus David’s motion to compel deadline was extended by agreement to March 22, 2024.  David filed his motions to compel further on March 21, 2024.     MEET AND CONFER  On May 26, 2023, David’s counsel attempted to meet and confer regarding Veloso’s refusal to provide substantive responses.  (Ex. 6 to McKeon Decl.)  On June 1, 2023, Veloso’s counsel promised to provide discovery responses “in the next few days.”  (Ex. 7 to McKeon Decl.)  Veloso failed to provide any substantive responses.  (McKeon Decl. ¶ 9.) On December 12, 2023, the parties participated in an IDC where the Court granted David permission to file his motions to compel.  Following the IDC, Veloso promised to provide amended, code-compliant responses to all of David’s discovery requests.  (Exs. 10-11.)   While Veloso did serve supplemental responses, David argues the responses continue to be evasive and incomplete.  On these facts, the Court concludes David has sufficiently complied with his meet and confer obligations.   JOINT STATEMENT  On a motion to compel further responses, this Department’s rules require the moving party to file a joint statement consisting of four columns: the first column will identify the number of the discovery request; the second, the text of the discovery request; the third, the text of the response, and the fourth, brief bullet-point statements, one from each party as to why a further response should or should not be compelled.   David filed a “joint” statement but it did not include Veloso’s position.  David’s counsel represents that he sent a draft joint statement to Veloso’s counsel on March 11, 2024, and asked her to provide her portion by March 14, 2024.  Veloso’s counsel did not respond.  On March 17, 2024, David’s counsel again asked Veloso’s counsel for her portion of the joint statement.  Veloso’s counsel did not provide her portion of the joint statement.  On these facts, the Court concludes David has sufficiently met his obligations to comply with the Court’s local rule regarding the filing of a joint statement.  Moreover, given Veloso’s failure to cooperate in the preparation of the joint statement, the Court declines to consider her oppositions to the motions to compel.  Veloso’s belated filing of a “joint statement” on April 9, 2024, past the deadline for filing her oppositions, does not cure her earlier failure to cooperate in the preparation of a joint statement.    DISCUSSION David served Veloso with requests for admissions (“RFAs”), special interrogatories (“SROGs”), form interrogatories (“FROGs”) and requests for production of documents (“RFPs”), on March 20, 2023.  (Exs. 1, 2, 3, 4 to McKeon Decl.)  Veloso’s responses were due by April 21, 2023.   On April 20 (the day before her responses were due), Veloso sought an extension to May 22.  (Ex. 5 to McKeon Decl.)  David granted the extension “on the condition that [Veloso would] take the time to provide substantive code-compliant responses and not objections only (or mainly) answers.”  (Id.)  Nonetheless, Veloso served objection-only responses on May 22.  (Ex. 4(a) to McKeon Decl.)  Because Veloso’s objection-only responses violated the terms of the extension, Veloso’s responses were untimely, and her objections are waived.   Accordingly, the Court grants David’s motions to compel further responses.  Veloso is ordered to serve further responses, without objections, to RFA Nos. 41-42, 47-54; SROG Nos. 37, 38, 44, 48-50, 53-71, 158-160, 164-217; FROG Nos. 8.4, 8.8, 9.1, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 16.1, 16.2, 17.1 and 50.1-50.6; and RFP Nos. 1-66.  Veloso is further ordered to produce all documents responsive to the RFPs. David also seeks sanctions in the amount of $21,725.  The Court concludes sanctions are warranted given Veloso’s misuse of the discovery process.  First, Veloso’s original responses asserted identical objections to every request.  Asserting identical objections to every request is not a “good faith” response. Second, Veloso refused to withdraw her objections and serve a single substantive response for nearly seven months, from March 20, 2023 to October 19, 2023.  Third, Veloso’s counsel promised on numerous occasions that she would provide code-compliant responses, but she failed to do so.  It is now over a year since David served his discovery requests, and David is still awaiting substantive responses to numerous discovery requests in addition to the production of responsive documents.   In determining the appropriate amount of sanctions, the Court starts with the lodestar which is the reasonable hourly rate multiplied by the reasonable hours spent. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096; see also Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  David’s counsel has not stated how long he has been practicing, and the Court therefore, cannot determine whether his hourly rate of $550 is reasonable for an attorney of similar experience in the prevailing market.  Accordingly, the Court will use an hourly rate of $250.   As to the reasonable hours spent, David’s counsel attests he has spent 31.5 hours preparing the four motions to compel, conducting research in support of the motions, analyzing Veloso’s various discovery responses to prepare the joint statements, collecting exhibits, and preparing his declaration.  He expects to spend another 8 hours preparing a reply and preparing for the hearing.  In other words, counsel spent an average of 9.875 hours per motion.  The Court concludes these hours are reasonable, and accordingly, it will award $9,875 in sanctions. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART David’s motions to compel further responses and for sanctions.  Veloso is required to provide further responses within 20 days of this Order.  Also, sanctions of $9,875 is awarded in favor of David and against Veloso and her counsel, jointly and severally and is to be paid within 30 days of this Order.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: April 17, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B. Moreton, Jr. Judge of the Superior Court 

Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   AURICE VELOSO,   Plaintiff, v.  LEO DAVID, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  22STCV35085   Related to: Case No. 22STCV01934     Hearing Date:  April 17, 2024      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   CROSS-DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR    MONETARY AND TERMINATING    SANCTIONS AGAINST AURICE VELOSO    AND HER ATTORNEY          BACKGROUND This case arises from claims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  Plaintiff Aurice Veloso was employed by Defendant Leo David as a caregiver for his wife.  Veloso alleges that David asked her to sleep with him in exchange for improved working conditions and other financial incentives including a house, car and tuition.  Veloso further alleges that despite her working around the clock, she was not compensated for overtime or provided rest and meal breaks.  David then terminated Veloso when she opposed his alleged discrimination and harassment.   Defendant paid Plaintiff’s wages through various companies he owned, including XCVI, LLC (“XCVI”) and Construction for Less, Inc. (CFL).  Plaintiff alleges these corporate defendants ratified and adopted the conduct of David.   On November 3, 2022, Veloso filed a complaint against David, XCVI and CFL asserting (among others) claims under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”) for (1) sex discrimination, (2) sex harassment (hostile work environment), (3) sex harassment (quid pro quo), (4) retaliation and (5) failure to prevent/investigate (the “FEHA Claims”). On August 14, 2023, XCVI and CFL filed a demurrer to the FEHA claims based on Veloso’s failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.  On October 11, 2023, David filed a separate demurrer, challenging the FEHA claims on similar grounds as XCVI and CFL but with the additional ground that David was not subject to FEHA because there was no allegation in the complaint that he employed five or more persons.  On November 15, 2023, the Court issued an order sustaining David’s demurrer to the FEHA claims without leave to amend holding that Plaintiff has not sufficiently plead David employed five or more persons and has not set forth facts demonstrating that she could successfully amend to cure this defect.   Six days later, on November 21, 2023, the Court issued a separate order sustaining XCVI and CLF’s demurrer to the FEHA claims without leave to amend reasoning that Plaintiff has not exhausted her administrative remedies prior to filing her complaint. On December 1, 2023, Veloso filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court denied on January 8, 2024.   David filed a cross-complaint.  On January 26, 2024, Veloso filed a cross-complaint to David’s cross-complaint, asserting six FEHA claims against David, XCVI and CFL (“Cross-Defendants”).  These are the exact same claims against the same parties that the Court already dismissed without leave to amend.    This hearing is on Cross-Defendants’ motion for terminating sanctions and for monetary sanctions pursuant to Civ. Proc. Code §§ 128.5 and 128.7 and 177.5.  Cross-Defendants seek terminating sanctions as to all cross-claims filed by Veloso, and monetary sanctions against Veloso and her counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $5,000.  Cross-Defendants argues that Veloso’s cross-complaint, filed after the Court dismissed her FEHA claims without leave to amend, is a meritless pleading subject to sanctions.   LEGAL STANDARD Sanctions Under Code Civ. Proc. §128.5 ¿ Code of Civil Procedure § 128.5 permits a trial court to “order a party, a party’s attorney, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith, that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (a).)  Actions or tactics include, but are not limited to, filing or opposing motions, complaints, answers, or other responsive pleadings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (b)(1).) “‘Frivolous’ means totally and completely without merit or for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (b)(2).)  Bad faith is determined using a subjective standard.  (In re Marriage of Sahafzadeh-Taeb & Taeb (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 139, 134-35.)¿¿ Expenses pursuant to Section 128.5 cannot be imposed unless noticed in a party’s moving or responding papers, or on the court’s own motion after providing the offending party notice and an opportunity to be heard.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (c).)  An order imposing expenses must be in writing and must recite in detail the action, tactic, or circumstances justifying the order.  (Id.)¿¿ ¿ Sanctions under this section may also be awarded if the offending party is provided a 21-day safe harbor to withdraw or correct an offending document or pleading and declines to do so. “If the alleged action or tactic is the making or opposing of a written motion or the filing and service of a complaint, cross-complaint, answer, or other responsive pleading that can be withdrawn or appropriately corrected, a notice of motion shall be served as provided in Section 1010, but shall not be filed with or presented to the court, unless 21 days after service of the motion or any other period as the court may prescribe, the challenged action or tactic is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (f)(1)(B).)   In addition, the court may, on its own motion, “enter an order describing the specific action or tactic, made in bad faith, that is frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, and direct an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why it has made an action or tactic as defined in subdivision (b), unless, within 21 days of service of the order to show cause, the challenged action or tactic is withdrawn or appropriately corrected.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (f)(1)(D)(1).)   An award of sanctions may include an award of attorney’s fees incurred as a direct result of the offending party’s bath faith action or tactic.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (f)(1)(D)(2).)¿¿ Sanctions Under Code Civ. Proc. §128.7¿ ¿ An attorney or unrepresented party who presents a motion to the court makes an implied certification as to its legal and factual merit, which is subject to sanctions for violation of this certification under Code of Civil Procedure § 128.7.  (Murphy v. Yale Materials Handling Corp. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 619, 623.)  The Court may impose sanctions for conduct that violates any one of the requirements set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, subdivision (b). (Eichenbaum v. Alon (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 967, 976.)¿¿¿ Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, subdivision (b) provides:¿¿ ¿ (b)¿By presenting to the court, whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating, a pleading, petition, written notice of motion, or other similar paper, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, all of the following conditions are met:¿ ¿ (1)¿It is not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.¿ ¿ (2)¿The claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.¿ ¿ (3)¿The allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.¿ ¿ (4)¿The denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.¿ ¿ Only “an attorney or unrepresented party may be sanctioned” under the statute.  (In re Marriage of Reese & Guy (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1221.)¿¿ “Under section 128.7, a court may impose sanctions if it concludes a pleading was filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably without merit, either legally or factually. [Citation.]” (Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189.) “A claim is factually frivolous if it is ‘not well grounded in fact’ and is legally frivolous if it is ‘not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.’ [Citation.]  In either case, to obtain sanctions, the moving party must show the party’s conduct in asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable. [Citation.]  A claim is objectively unreasonable if ‘any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is totally and completely without merit.’ [Citations.]” (Id.)  No showing of bad faith is required.  (In re Marriage of Reese & Guy, supra, 73 Cal.App.4th at p. 1221.)¿¿ “The California Legislature essentially sought to replicate rule 11 [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] when it enacted section 128.7.” (Musaelian v. Adams (2009) 45 Cal.4th 512, 518, fn. 2.)  As a result, federal case law construing rule 11 is persuasive authority on the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7. (Guillemin v. Stein (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 156, 167.)  Under rule 11, even though an action may not be frivolous when it is filed, it may become so if later-acquired evidence refutes the findings of a prefiling investigation and the attorney continues to file papers supporting the client’s claims.  (See Childs v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (5th Cir. 1994) 29 F.3d 1018, 1024-1026.)  As a result, a plaintiff’s attorney cannot “just cling tenaciously to the investigation he had done at the outset of the litigation and bury his head in the sand.”¿ (Id. at 1025.)¿¿ In addition, Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 “contains a safe harbor provision.  It requires the party seeking sanctions to serve on the opposing party, without filing or presenting it to the court, a notice of motion specifically describing the sanctionable conduct. Service of the motion initiates a 21-day ‘hold’ or ‘safe harbor’ period. [Citations.] During this time, the offending document may be corrected or withdrawn without penalty. If that occurs, the motion for sanctions ‘‘shall not’’ be filed. [Citations.]  By mandating a 21-day safe harbor period to allow correction or withdrawal of an offending document, section 128.7 is designed to be remedial, not punitive. [Citation.]” (Li v. Majestic Industry Hills, LLC (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 585, 590-591.)¿ Sanctions under Code Civ. Proc. §177.5 Code Civ. Proc. §177.5 provides the following: A judicial officer shall have the power to impose reasonable money¿sanctions, not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500), notwithstanding any other provision of law, payable to the court, for any violation of a lawful court order by a person, done without good cause or substantial justification.  This power shall not apply to advocacy of counsel before the court.  For the purposes of this section, the term “person” includes a witness, a party, a party’s attorney, or both. Sanctions pursuant to this section shall not be imposed except on notice contained in a party’s moving or responding papers; or on the court’s own motion, after notice and opportunity to be heard. An order imposing sanctions shall be in writing and shall recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 177.5.) “The imposition of monetary sanctions under¿section 177.5¿is within the discretion of the trial court.” (People v. Ward (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1518, 1527¿(quoting¿Winikow v. Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 719, 726).)  “That discretion must be exercised in a reasonable manner with one of the statutorily authorized purposes in mind and must be guided by existing legal standards as adapted to the current circumstances.”¿(Id. (quoting¿Winikow, 82 Cal.App.4th at 726).) REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Veloso requests judicial notice of her DFEH administrative charge filed on January 26, 2024.  The Court grants the request pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §§ 452(c) and 453.¿¿ DISCUSSION If the alleged sanctionable conduct is the filing and¿service of a complaint, both¿Code Civ. Proc. §§ 128.5 and 128.7 have a safe harbor provision, which¿requires that the moving party serve the motion on the sanctionable party at least¿21-days before it is filed with the Court.¿(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 128.5, subd. (f)(1)(B);¿128.7, subd. (c)(1).)  This affords the party an opportunity to cure the improper pleading.  (Id; see¿Li v. Majestic Industry Hills LLC¿(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 585, 591¿(“By mandating a 21-day safe harbor period to allow correction or withdrawal of an offending document,¿section 128.7¿is designed to be remedial, not punitive.”).) The 21-day “safe harbor” provision is strictly enforced.  “Substantial compliance” is insufficient.  (See¿Cromwell v. Cummings¿(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 15¿(“Correspondence to opposing counsel which threatens sanctions of an unknown nature at an unspecified time against unidentified persons, and which lacks citation to controlling authority, does not fulfill these statutory purposes.”).) The motion provided to the opposing party must be the same as the motion that is filed with the court.  (Hart v. Avetoom¿(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 410, 414.)  The notice served must contain a hearing date and must comply with all the requirements of¿Code of Civil Procedure § 1010, including the time and place of the motion hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 128.5, subd. (f)(1)(B);¿128.7, subd. (c)(1);¿GalleriaPlus, Inc. v. Hanmi Bank¿(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 535, 538¿(document served stating sanctions motion would be filed “on or after” specified date did not provide notice of hearing date and did not satisfy “safe harbor” requirement).) Cross-Defendants have not shown they complied with the 21 safe harbor provision.  Accordingly, the Court denies their motion for sanctions under §§128.5 and 128.7. As to Cross-Defendants’ motion under §177.5, that section does not allow for terminating sanctions, and any monetary sanctions are limited to $1,500 and are payable to the Court, not the parties.  Accordingly, §177.5 also does not provide support for Cross-Defendants’ motion.   Notwithstanding, courts have inherent authority to dismiss an action.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 581, subd. (m),¿583.150;¿Lyons v. Wickhorst¿(1986) 42 Cal.3d 911, 915;¿Progressive Concrete, Inc. v. Parker¿(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 540, 551.)  Trial courts should only exercise this authority in extreme situations, such as when the conduct was clear and deliberate and where no lesser alternatives would remedy the situation (Lyons v. Wickhorst, 42 Cal.3d at 917),¿the fault lies with the client and not the attorney, and when the court issues a directive that the party fails to obey.  (Del Junco v. Hufnagel (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 789, 799).) Here, the Court sustained a demurrer on Veloso’s FEHA claims without leave to amend and denied her motion for reconsideration of its ruling.  Notwithstanding the Court’s orders, Veloso filed a cross-complaint alleging the same FEHA claims in the same action.  Veloso’s cross-complaint is also procedurally improper – Veloso cites no authority that she can file a cross-complaint to a cross-complaint to her own action.  The proper procedure was to file a motion for leave to amend her complaint, which Veloso failed to do.           Veloso’s opposition to the motion for sanctions is essentially a motion for reconsideration, outlining reasons Veloso believes the Court got it wrong.  But the motion for reconsideration is not based on any new facts or law.  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500 (“a court acts in excess of jurisdiction when it grants a motion to reconsider that is not based upon “new or different facts, circumstances or law”).)  Veloso’s January 26, 2024 administrative charge is based on the same facts as her original complaint.  The charge cannot be a new fact.  If it were otherwise, then each time the Court issued an order that Veloso disagrees with, she could re-file a new administrative complaint to create a “new” fact for reconsideration.   CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Cross-Defendants’ motion for sanctions.  Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §177.5, the Court orders Veloso and her attorney to pay $1,500 to the Court within 30 days of the date of this Order.  The Court also denies as moot Cross-Defendants’ motion to strike the Cross-Complaint set for hearing on April 25, 2024.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: April 17, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.

   Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  LEO DAVID,    Plaintiff, v.  AURICE VELOSO,   Defendant.    Case No.:  22STCV35085 c/w 22SMCV01934     Hearing Date:  April 17, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   LEO DAVID, XCVI, LLC’S AND    CONSTRUCTION FOR LESS, INC.’S    MOTION TO EITHER VACATE TRIAL    SETTING OR CONTINUE TRIAL     AURICE VELOSO,    Cross-Complainant, v.  LEO DAVID, et al.,   Defendants.              BACKGROUND  This action arises from Aurice Veloso’s employment as a care giver for Leo David and his late wife, Ruth David.  David alleges Veloso stole monies and personal property and engaged in financial and physical elder abuse.   Meanwhile, Veloso alleges David harassed and discriminated against her, and failed to pay her rest and meal breaks and overtime.  Veloso claims David then fired her when she complained of the alleged harassment and discrimination.  Veloso also sued David’s companies, XCVI, LLC (“XCVI”) and Construction for Less, Inc. (“CFL”) as joint employers.   This hearing is on David, XCVI and CFL’s (“Moving Parties’”) motion to continue trial.  Moving Parties seek a six month continuance because (1) Veloso’s claims are not yet fully in issue, (2) Veloso’s first amended complaint only recently became at issue and significant discovery is needed to explore the factual bases for these claims, (3) written discovery is nowhere near complete, (4) while Veloso has identified over 106 fact witnesses in this case, fact depositions have not begun, (5) experts have not been selected, and (6) the summary judgment deadline was on March 8, 2024 yet the scope of Veloso’s claims is uncertain and significant discovery issues remain unresolved.  There was no opposition filed as of the posting of this tentative ruling.       LEGAL STANDARD ¿ Trial dates are firm to ensure prompt disposition of civil cases. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd. (a).)¿ Continuances are thus generally disfavored.¿ (See id., rule 3.1332, subd. (b).)¿ Nevertheless, the trial court has discretion to continue trial dates.¿ (Hernandez v. Superior Court (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1246.)¿ Each request for continuance must be considered on its own merits and is granted upon an affirmative showing of good cause.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd. (c); Hernandez, supra, 115 Cal.App.4th at p. 1246.)¿¿¿ Circumstances that may indicate good cause include: (1) the unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness due to death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (2) the unavailability of a party due to death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (3) the unavailability of trial counsel due to death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (4) the substitution of trial counsel where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in the interests of justice; (5) the addition of a new party if (A) the new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial, or (B) the other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party’s involvement in the case; (6) a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; or (7) a significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd. (c).)¿¿ The court must also consider such relevant factors as: (1) the proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial caused by any party; (3) the length of the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a continuance; (5) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; (6) if the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; (7) the court’s calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; (8) whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9) whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; (10) whether the interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and (11) any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.¿ (Id., rule 3.1332, subd. (d).)¿ ANALYSIS The Court concludes that a continuance is not warranted.  The parties have over-litigated this case and engaged in scorch-earth tactics, filing numerous motions that could have been avoided had the parties met and conferred in good faith.  Allowing a continuance would only encourage further over-litigation, excessive motion practice and the consumption of limited judicial resources.  To the extent discovery is not further advanced, it results from the parties’ aggressive approach to discovery, of either serving excessive amounts of discovery or resisting even the most basic requests.   CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES the motion to either vacate trial setting or continue trial.    DATED: April 17, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
