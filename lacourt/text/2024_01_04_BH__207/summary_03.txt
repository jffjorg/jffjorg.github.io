**Tentative Ruling**

This tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to set aside the defaults entered against them on July 7, 2023. The defendants, Insight Multi-Strategy U.S. Partners, LLC; Insight Advisors, LLC; and Michael Tito, filed their motion on December 20, 2023, but missed the deadline to file it with the court. The plaintiff, Suzanne Tito, filed an opposition to the motion, assuming that it was untimely.

The court finds that the defendants' counsel did not provide sufficient factual detail to support their request to set aside the defaults. Furthermore, the motion fails to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1005 and the court's November 13, 2023 order.

As a result, the court will proceed with entering the default judgment against the defendants forthwith. The clerk of the court shall provide notice of the court's ruling.
