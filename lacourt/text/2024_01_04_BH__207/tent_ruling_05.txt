LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
1.      Interrogatories
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on
privilege or the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with
Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)-(b).) 
 
2.      Requests
for Admission
 
             Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to whom requests
or admission are directed fails to serve a timely response . . .  [t]he party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product[.]”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  Where a party fails to respond to
requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
3.     
Requests for Production 
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure, section 2031.300, subd. (a), “[i]f a party to whom
a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to
serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party
to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed
waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(a).)  Where a party fails to respond to
demands for production, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
response to the demand.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) “Within 30 days after service of a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is
directed shall serve the original response to it on the party making the demand
. . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     
Discovery Requests
 
Defendant served Plaintiff the first sets of
the FROG, SROG, RFP and RFA on January 27, 2023.  (See Mullis Decl. ¶ 3 and Ex. A to each
Motion.)   On February 28, Plaintiff’s counsel requested
a 30-day extension of time to respond to the discovery requests.  (Id. at ¶ 4.)  On October 2, Plaintiff told Defendant over
the phone that she does “not have time” for this matter.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  Plaintiff has not otherwise communicated
about or responded to the discovery requests, and did not attend the Informal
Discovery Conference on October 17, 2023. 
(Id. at ¶¶ 4-8.)  
 
And as of the filing date of the
motions, Defendant has not received responses from Plaintiff.  Accordingly, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to timely serve responses to the FROG,
SROG, RFP and RFA.  
 
2.     
Monetary Sanctions
            Defendant
request monetary sanctions in connection with the motions.  The Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the FROG, SROG, RFP and RFA to be abuses of the discovery process,
warranting monetary sanctions.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c),
2033.280, subd. (c).)  Accordingly, the
Court will impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $1465.00,
which represents five hours of attorney time to prepare the moving papers, and
attend the hearing, at $245 per hour, plus the filing fees of $240 at $60 per
motion. 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to
the FROG, SROG and RFP per Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 and
2031.100.  As such, the Court orders
Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD, without
objections, within 30 days of notice of the Court’s orders.
 
Further, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to deem admitted matters
specified in the RFA per Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, and deems
admitted the matters specified in the RFA propounded to Plaintiff.
 
Further, the Court orders Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1465.00 to Defendant, by and through counsel for Defendant, within
30 days of notice of the Court’s orders.
 
            Defendant
shall provide notice of the Court’s orders and file a proof of service of such.
