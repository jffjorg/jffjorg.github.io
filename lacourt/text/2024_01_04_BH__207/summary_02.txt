And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had filed several exhibits conditionally under seal, but failed to file a motion to seal these documents. As a result, the court is inclined to unseal these exhibits or for the plaintiff to withdraw them to prevent public disclosure. Additionally, the court finds that the defendants, Jack Seal, PVS Studios, LLC, and Orwo Films Distribution, LLC, failed to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(e), by not filing a separate opposition statement. As a result, the court considers the opposition of these defendants to be procedurally defective.
