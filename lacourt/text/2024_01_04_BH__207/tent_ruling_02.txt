[1] Plaintiff filed several exhibits “conditionally under
seal,” however Plaintiff has not filed a motion to seal any documents in
connection with this Motion.  As such,
the Court is inclined to unseal all exhibits filed conditionally under
seal.  Alternatively, because the Court
does not find any of the sealed documents material to the disposition of this
Motion, Plaintiff may also withdraw these exhibits, to prevent their public disclosure.
 


[2] Defendants Jack Seal, PVS Studios, LLC and Orwo Films Distribution,
LLC did not comply with California  Rules
of Court, rule 3.1350(e), in filing an opposition separate statement.  As such, the Court finds the opposition of
said Defendants to be procedurally defective.
