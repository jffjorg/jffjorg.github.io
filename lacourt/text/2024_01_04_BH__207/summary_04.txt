And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Afshin Eftekhari, without prejudice due to the failure to provide the client, Seyed Farid Hajimirsadeghi, with adequate notice as required by Code of Civil Procedure sections 1005 and 1013. The motion was filed instead of a consent because of an "unresponsive and unreachable client." The client was served with the notice of motion and motion to be relieved as counsel, but the service was made via mail on November 22, 2023, which is less than the required 16 court days prior to the hearing. The judge ruled that the service did not provide the client with adequate statutory notice of the motion.
