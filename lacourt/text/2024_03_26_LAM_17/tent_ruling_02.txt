Plaintiff,
  
         vs.
 
BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC;
 
Defendant,

 


Case No.:   23STCV10407
 
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
  MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
 
Hearing Date: March 26,
  2024




 
            Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved is GRANTED. 
 
            On May 9, 2023, Plaintiff Shirley Bruno (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Defendant BMW of North America, LLC (“Defendant”) for breach
of written and implied warranty and three causes of action under the
Song-Beverly Act. 
 
On June
21, 2023, Defendant filed an answer to the complaint.
 
            On February 23, 2024, Counsel for Plaintiff, Timothy J.
Abeel, Jr. (“Counsel”) filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel.  As of March 20, no opposition has been filed.  
 
Legal Standard
 
Motions to
withdraw are routinely granted if made in the proper form and presented with
proper notice.  The court may issue an order allowing an attorney to
withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 284(2).) 
 
CRC Rule 3.1362
requires motions to be relieved as counsel pursuant to CCP section 284(2) be
made on Judicial Council Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order).  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362.)  Furthermore, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case.  (Id., rule
3.1362(d).)  If the client is served by mail, there must be a declaration
showing confirmation of the service address within the past 30 days or that the
service address is the last known residence or business address of the client
and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making
reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion.  (Id.) 
 
Discussion 
 
Counsel’s
declaration contains facts in paragraph 2 showing that he seeks to withdraw
because he is “unable to effectively act as counsel due to a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship.”  (MC-052 ¶
2.)
 
The
Court finds that there is good cause to grant leave to withdraw.  
 
Counsel
has submitted forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 in seeking to be relieved as
counsel.  The moving papers were served
on Plaintiff and counsel for Defendant at their current addresses by first-clas
mail and by email as confirmed by the proofs of service.  Therefore, the Court finds that Counsel has
satisfied the requirements of CRC 3.1362(a), (c)-(e) by filing the motions on
the correct forms and by serving the motion on Plaintiff and counsel for
Defendant.   
 
The
Court notes that trial is set for January 13, 2025 and Plaintiff has sufficient
to find new counsel.
 
Therefore,
the Court grants the unopposed motion and Plaintiff’s counsel will be granted
leave to withdraw. 
 
Counsel
to give notice.
