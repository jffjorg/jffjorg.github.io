The tentative ruling by the Judge in the case of Timeless Corals and Fish, LLC vs. Brandon Pierce (Case No. 23STCV03912) sets out the Judge's thinking based on the information presented before the hearing on March 26, 2024. The case involves allegations of embezzlement and declaratory relief, with the Plaintiff alleging that the Defendant was convicted of stealing merchandise and pleaded guilty in criminal court. The Plaintiff filed a complaint on February 22, 2023, and proof of personal service on August 28, 2023. Default was entered against the Defendant on December 5, 2023, and the Plaintiff filed default judgment papers on December 6, 2023. However, the Court was unable to view the default judgment packet at the time, and it was later determined that the Plaintiff did not file a 585 with the default judgment. The Judge has identified deficiencies in the Plaintiff's default judgment packet, including the lack of a summary of the case and admissible evidence to support the requested amount. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to refile the entire default judgment packet by April 9, 2024, and warns that failure to do so may result in sanctions including dismissal.
