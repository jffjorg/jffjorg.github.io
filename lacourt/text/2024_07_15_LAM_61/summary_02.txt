And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant Ford Motor Company (Ford) has filed a motion for a protective order to guard its confidential and trade secret materials regarding its business and private information regarding its customers. Ford claims that these materials are not generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from their disclosure or use, and that Ford has taken reasonable efforts to maintain their secrecy.

The court finds that Ford has met its burden to establish good cause for the issuance of a protective order, and that a protective order is necessary to protect its trade secrets. However, the court also finds that Ford has not made an adequate case for the additional protective measures that it seeks, such as limiting attorney access to confidential documents, requiring all firm staff with access to the documents to agree in writing to be bound by the protective order, and limiting the online posting of confidential documents for sale.

The court grants Ford's motion for a protective order, but only in part. The court enters the LASC Model Protective Order — Confidential Designation Only, with necessary changes for the identity of the parties, and with a modification to paragraph 7g that prohibits disclosure of confidential information to outside experts or consultants who are currently employed by an automobile manufacturer competitor of Ford.
