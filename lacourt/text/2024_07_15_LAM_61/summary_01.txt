And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting both parties' motions to compel the deposition of the other party. The motions were based on the parties' failure to appear for scheduled depositions. The judge found that both parties had failed to appear for depositions, despite prior agreements and notices. The judge also found that the parties had failed to offer alternative dates for the depositions. The judge granted the motions to compel deposition, but did not award any sanctions to either party. The judge noted that the mutual relief afforded to both parties made the imposition of sanctions unjust. The judge ordered the depositions to take place within 60 days, unless agreed to by the parties.
