 Case Number:  23STCV23457    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  61 NEIL ANENBERG vs ANTONETTE ISHAM, et al. (Commercial)TENTATIVEPlaintiff Neil Anenberg’s Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories and Requests for Production from Defendants Scott Spicer and Antonette Isham are GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to provide responses, without objections, within 20 days of this Order. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant in the amount of $1,902.50.Plaintiff to give notice.DISCUSSION A propounding party may demand a responding party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)A party who fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)Plaintiff Neil Anenberg (Plaintiff) served Form Interrogatories – General, Form Interrogatories – Unlawful Detainer, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production on Antonette Isham and Scott Spicer on March 31, 2024. (Nussbaum Decl. Exh. A.) Because this is an unlawful detainer action, responses were due within five days. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.260, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (b).) No responses were served, however, by April 29, 2024. (Nussbaum Decl. ¶¶ 2–3.) No opposition to the motions has been filed.Plaintiff has shown hat requests and interrogatories were served on March 31, 2024, and no responses have been timely received. The motions are GRANTED.The prevailing party on a motion to compel is generally entitled to monetary sanctions, unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Sanctions are also mandatory against a party whose failure to serve responses to requests for admission makes the motion necessary. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)Plaintiff seeks $2,197.50 for each motion, representing 3.5 hours of attorney work at $475 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee (Nussbaum Decl. ¶ 4.) This appears to be a miscalculation, however, as the hours indicated multiplied by the hourly fee yield a per-motion total of $1,722.50 (3.5 hours x $475 plus a $60 filing fee). Due to the simplicity of the motions and their duplicative nature, the Court finds $1902.50 to be reasonable (3.5 hours x $475 plus $60 x4 filing fees). Sanctions are awarded against Defendants in the amount of $1,902.50.
