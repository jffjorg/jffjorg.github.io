[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
 
plaintiff’s demurrer to amended answer
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Shahnaz Bahadori
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Houman Vosoghi, M.D. 
Demurrer to Amended Answer
Plaintiff Shahnaz Bahadori (“Plaintiff”) filed the pending demurrer to
the eighth and fourteenth affirmative defenses asserted by defendant Houman
Vosoghi, M.D. (“Defendant”) in his Amended Answer, filed on September 27, 2023,
for a hearing date of March 15, 2024. 
On March 11, 2024, the court issued a minute order (1) stating that it
was, on its own motion, continuing the hearing on Plaintiff’s demurrer to March
25, 2024, and (2) ordering that counsel for the moving party (i.e., Plaintiff’s
counsel) shall give notice of the court’s ruling to any other party not listed
on the attached Certificate of Mailing. 
(Mar. 11, 2024, p. 1.)  The
Certificate of Mailing states that the March 11, 2024 order was served on
counsel for Plaintiff and Defendant, but not counsel of record for defendants
Paul Dougherty, M.D., Inc., Dougherty Laser Vision, DLV Vision, DLV Vision
Management, LLC, DLV Vision ASC, LLC, Sharmini Asha Balakrishnan, M.D., and
Paul J. Dougherty, M.D.  (Mar. 11, 2024
Certificate of Mailing, p. 1.)  Thus,
counsel for Plaintiff was required to serve a notice of the court’s March 11,
2024 order on those defendants. 
Plaintiff did not file a notice of ruling and proof of service with
the court establishing that her counsel served defendants Paul Dougherty, M.D.,
Inc. Dougherty Laser Vision, DLV Vision, DLV Vision Management, LLC, DLV Vision
ASC, LLC, Sharmini Asha Balakrishnan, M.D., and Paul J. Dougherty, M.D. with
notice of the new hearing date on Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s amended
answer.  Thus, it appears that those
defendants did not receive notice of the new hearing date on this matter.
The court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing
on plaintiff Shahnaz Bahadori’s demurrer to defendant Houman Vosoghi, M.D.’s
amended answer to April 10, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders plaintiff Shahnaz Bahadori (1) to give notice of this
ruling to all parties that have appeared in this action, and (2) to file with
the court, no later than April 2, 2024, the notice of ruling and a proof of
service of the notice of ruling establishing that all parties have been served
with the notice of ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  March 25, 2024
