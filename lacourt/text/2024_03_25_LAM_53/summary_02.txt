And here is the English-text summary:

The court has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application, which sought relief without notice to the opposing party. The plaintiff had failed to meet the requirement of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), which demands an affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte. The court has instead continued the hearing on the defendant's motion to compel arbitration to April 16, 2024, to be heard in conjunction with the plaintiff's motion to seal documents related to the arbitration motion.
