 Case Number:  22STCV40862    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  53 Doe v. Defendant Doe 1  22STCV40862 
Ex
Parte Application  3/25/24
The
court finds that plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement of California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), that an applicant for an ex parte order
must make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent
testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or
other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.
The
hearing on defendants’ motion to compel arbitration was set for hearing on
March 26, 2024.  But, as explained in the
court’s March 22, 2024 order, the court has continued the hearing on that
motion to April 16, 2024, so that it can be heard with plaintiff’s motion to
seal documents that have been filed in connection with defendants’ motion to
compel arbitration in order for the court to establish what the evidentiary
record will be on the motion to compel arbitration.  The briefing and evidence presented in
connection with defendants’ motion to compel arbitration has been completed and
is now closed.  The court finds that
plaintiff has not shown good cause to grant the relief requested in her ex
parte application.   
The
court therefore denies plaintiff’s ex parte application.       
The court
orders plaintiff to give notice of this order.
