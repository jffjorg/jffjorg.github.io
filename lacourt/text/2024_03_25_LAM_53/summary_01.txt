And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the Plaintiff's demurrer to the Defendant's Amended Answer. The Plaintiff had filed the demurrer on September 27, 2023, and the court had initially set a hearing date for March 15, 2024. However, the court later continued the hearing to March 25, 2024, and ordered the Plaintiff's counsel to give notice of the new hearing date to all parties, except for certain defendants who were not listed on the Certificate of Mailing. The Plaintiff failed to serve notice of the new hearing date to those defendants, and therefore the court has continued the hearing to April 10, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 53. The court also orders the Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling to all parties and file a proof of service with the court by April 2, 2024.
