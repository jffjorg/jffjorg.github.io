And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Cross-Defendants to the first amended cross-complaint. The judge has sustained the demurrer in part and overruled it in part. The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the first cause of action for breach of contract by Family Living Vineyard Avenue LLC and Family Living Berryman Avenue LLC, as they are not parties to the contract. The judge has also sustained the demurrer as to the second cause of action for fraud by Family Living Berryman Avenue LLC, as there are no specific allegations of intentional misrepresentation by Sung Ki Min.

The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the third cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as the alleged implied covenant is superfluous. The judge has also overruled the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action for unfair business practices, as the allegations are sufficient at the pleading stage.

The judge has granted the Cross-Defendants 30 days' leave to amend their demurrer and has given notice to the parties to submit on the tentative ruling.
