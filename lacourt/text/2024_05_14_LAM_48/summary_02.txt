**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has granted Defendant 1602 Cats #7's motion for attorney fees in part. The Court awarded Defendant $165,000.00 in attorney fees. The Court found that Defendant is entitled to attorney fees under the License Agreement, which provides for an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party. The Court applied the "lodestar" approach to determine a reasonable amount of attorney fees, considering factors such as the complexity of the case and the length of litigation. The Court reduced the award for some of the time spent by Defendant's counsel, but still found that a reasonable amount of attorney fees is $165,000.00.
