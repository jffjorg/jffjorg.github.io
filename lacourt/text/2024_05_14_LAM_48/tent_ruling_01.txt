[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING JRA’S MOTION FOR
  SUMMARY JUDGMENT; GRANTING JAMISON SERVICES’ AND CENTRAL PLAZA’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY
  JUDGMENT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 14, 2024



 
On November 27, 2019, Plaintiff
Hyung Koo filed this personal injury action. 
Plaintiff later identified Defendant Doe 1 as Jamison Services Inc. (“Jamison
Services”), Doe 2 as Central Plaza LLC (“Central Plaza”), and Doe 3 as Jamison Realty
Advisors LLC (“JRA”).
On
July 24, 2023, JRA filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary
adjudication.
On
November 30, 2023, Jamison Services and Central Plaza filed a motion for summary
judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication.
LEGAL
STANDARD
For
each claim in the complaint, the defendant moving for adjudication must satisfy
the initial burden of proof by showing that one or more elements of a cause of action
cannot be established or that there is a complete defense to a cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520 (Scalf).)  Then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf,
supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1520.)  To establish a triable issue of material fact,
the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial responsive evidence.”  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
151, 162-163.)
JRA’S MOTION
The
first and second causes of action allege general negligence and premises liability.  (The third cause of action is not brought against
JRA.)  JRA argues that it owed no legal duty
to Plaintiff and did not cause Plaintiff’s injuries.
A.        Request for Judicial Notice
JRA’s
request for judicial notice of the Baycap LLC Financing Statement listing the subject
cross-over machine as collateral issued by Baycap LLC, recorded on August 16, 2012,
is granted.
B.        Evidentiary Objections
JRA’s
Objection Nos. 1-8:  Sustained.  (Summers v. A.L. Gilbert Co. (1999) 69
Cal.App.4th 1155, 1180 [expert opinion on the legal interpretation of contracts
is inadmissible].)
JRA’s
Objection Nos. 9-29:  Overruled.
C.        Background Facts
Plaintiff’s
accident occurred on November 8, 2019, while he was using a cable crossover machine
at the Wilfit Sports Club (“Gym”) located in Suite 100 of 3470 Wilshire Blvd, Los
Angeles, California 90010.  (Undisputed Material
Facts “UMF” 1-2.)  Central Fitness LP (“Central
Fitness”) dba Wilfit Sports Club, formerly Central Fitness LLC, was the owner of
the Gym.  (UMF 3.)  The Gym was located in a building owned and leased
by Central Plaza LLC (“Central Plaza”), and Jamison Services Inc. (“Jamison Services”)
was the sole property management company for the building.  (UMF 4-5; see UMF 7.)  JRA was not involved in the management of the
Central Plaza buildings.  (UMF 9.)
JRA
is a placeholder entity to assist with real estate acquisitions.  (UMF 6.) 
JRA has never owned the Gym, was not involved in its maintenance, and did
not exercise control over the Gym.  (UMF 8,
10-11.)
TechnoGym
USA Corp. (“TechnoGym”) sold the Machine to Central Fitness, and BayCap financed
the purchase of the Machine.  (UMF 12.)  The only payments made for the purchase of the
Machine were made by Central Fitness.  (UMF
13.) JRA never owned, assembled, installed, or maintained the Machine.  (UMF 14-17.)
D.        Discussion
JRA
argues that Plaintiff cannot establish its duty when it had no ownership, possession,
or control over the premises.  (Motion at
pp. 3-4.)  JRA argues that “the undisputed
evidence shows that JRA did not own, possess or even manage the Gym or the building
where Plaintiff was injured, much less had anything to do with the subject crossover
machine.”  (Motion at p. 3.)
A
cause of action for negligence requires (1) a legal duty owed to the plaintiff to
use due care, (2) breach of that duty, (3) causation, and (4) damage to the plaintiff.  (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2006) 137 Cal. App. 4th 292, 318.) 
The elements of a negligence claim and a premises liability claim are the
same.”  (Kesner v. Superior Court (2016)
1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158.)  “In premises liability
cases, summary judgment properly may be granted where a defendant unequivocally
establishes its lack of ownership, possession, or control of property alleged to
be in a dangerous or defective condition.” 
(Lopez v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 705, 714.)
JRA’s
evidence shows that it never owned, assembled, installed, or maintained the Machine.  (UMF 14-17.) 
JRA did not own or manage the building, never owned the Gym, was not involved
in its maintenance, and did not exercise control over the Gym.  (UMF 4-5, 7-11.)
JRA
has met its moving burden of showing that Plaintiff cannot establish all elements
of his claims—namely JRA’s duty to Plaintiff and causation of Plaintiff’s harm.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
Plaintiff
argues that JRA, Central Plaza, Jamison Services, and Central Fitness are indistinguishable
entities operating as a single enterprise who built the Gym as part of a joint venture.  (Opposition at pp. 7, 10-14.)  Single enterprise is a theory of liability, not
a cause of action.  (See Las Palmas Associates
v. Las Palmas Center Associates (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1220.)  “Two conditions are generally required for the
application of the [single enterprise] doctrine to two related corporations: (1)
such a unity of interest and ownership that the separate corporate personalities
are merged, so that one corporation is a mere adjunct of another or the two companies
form a single enterprise; and (2) an inequitable result if the acts in question
are treated as those of the corporation alone.” 
(Tran v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1219.)  “A joint venture exists when there is ‘an agreement
between the parties under which they have a community of interest, that is, a joint
interest, in a common business undertaking, an understanding as to the sharing of
profits and losses, and a right of joint control.’”  (Connor v. Great Western Sav. & Loan Ass’n
(1968) 69 Cal.2d 850, 863.)
This
theory of liability was not alleged in the Complaint.  (See Simmons v. Ware (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th
1035, 1050 [“[The] complaint was wholly inadequate to raise a joint venture and
at no time did [he] seek to amend [his] complaint to conform to proof.”].)  “[A] party cannot successfully resist summary
judgment on a theory not pleaded.”  (Whelihan
v. Espinoza (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1576.)
Even
considering Plaintiff’s argument, Plaintiff has not shown a triable issue of material
fact regarding a single enterprise or joint venture.  Plaintiff contends that JRA “either entered into
a joint venture or was a single enterprise with respect to Wilfit.  Ownership of the relevant companies, including
Jamison Realty Advisors, were all owned, organized, and operated by Dr. David Lee
and his family.”  (E.g., Response to UMF 3.)  Plaintiff also contends that “Central Plaza and
Jamison Services shared in the profits and losses of Wilfit,” without presenting
evidence about JRA’s profit sharing.  (E.g.,
Response to UMF 3.)  When arguing that JRA
“along with the other entities, controlled, funded, and oversaw Wilfit’s construction,”
Plaintiff cites evidence about Jamison Services hiring Philmont Management for construction,
Central Plaza being the sole entity paying for construction, and Jamison Services’
property management and inspection—without evidence of JRA’s involvement.  (E.g., Response to UMF 3.)
Plaintiff
also argues that there are triable issues regarding JRA’s ownership of the Machine.  (Opposition at pp. 15-16.)  Plaintiff generally relies on the Baycap Equipment
Leasing Agreement, under which Central Plaza, Jamison Services, and “Jamison Realty
Inc.” agreed to make payments for the Machine. 
(Opposition at p. 16; Opposition, Ex. 31.)  JRA is not a party to this agreement.
Summary
judgment is granted in favor of JRA.
E.        Conclusion
The
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.  JRA
is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within five days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
May 22, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
JAMISON SERVICES’ AND CENTRAL
PLAZA’S MOTION
The
first and second causes of action allege general negligence and premises liability.  (The third cause of action is not brought against
Jamison Services and Central Plaza.)  Jamison
Services and Central Plaza (“Defendants”) argue that they owed no legal duty to
Plaintiff and did not cause Plaintiff’s injuries.
A.        Evidentiary Objections
Defendants’
Objection Nos. 1-8:  Sustained.  (Summers v. A.L. Gilbert Co. (1999) 69
Cal.App.4th 1155, 1180 [expert opinion on the legal interpretation of contracts
is inadmissible].)
Defendants’
Objection Nos. 9-29:  Overruled.
B.        Background Facts
Jamison
Services is a property management company, and Central Plaza was the owner of the
relevant property.  (Undisputed Material Facts
“UMF” 1-3.)  As property manager, Jamison
Services would conduct inspections of Central Plaza premises, including when construction
was done for tenant improvements.  (UMF 4.)  Jamison Services would also inspect the premises
before the tenant took possession, in accordance with tenant lease agreements.  (UMF 5, 8.) 
Jamison Services would not inspect tenant-specific business equipment and/or
fixtures, and it was not responsible for ensuring that a tenant correctly installed
its business equipment.  (UMF 6-7.)
In
April 2011, Wilfit entered into a lease agreement with Defendants, with the lease
beginning on July 1, 2011.  (UMF 9-10.)  Per the lease agreement, Wilfit agreed to maintain
equipment and fixtures in good repair.  (UMF
42.)  The parties’ lease further provides
that “[a]ll business and trade fixtures, machinery and equipment, furniture, movable
partitions and items of personal property owned by the Tenant or installed by the
Tenant at its expense in the Premises shall be and remain the property of the Tenant.”   (UMF 43.) 
Before Wilfit took final possession of the premises, Jonathan Kim from Jamison
Services conducted a walkthrough of the space with a Wilfit representative.  (UMF 11.) 
Jamison Services inspected only those parts of the construction related to
the premises to make sure that everything regarding the building premises was done
properly.  (UMF 16.)
Defendants
did not purchase any gym equipment for or on behalf of Wilfit, and they were not
involved in the selection or purchase of equipment from TechnoGym.  (UMF 17.) 
The subject cable crossover machine was purchased on approximately August
11, 2011, and Wilfit financed the purchase of the machine.  (UMF 18.) 
The cable crossover machine was delivered to Wilfit on July 18, 2012.  (UMF 19.) 
Jamison Services employee Jin Soo Choi gave the delivery company access to
Wilfit so that the machine could be delivered. 
(UMF 20.)  Mr. Choi did not supervise
the delivery company’s delivery or accompany the delivery company to Wilfit; he
merely let them into the building.  (UMF 23.)  At the time of delivery, Mr. Choi signed what
he believed was a document confirming the delivery.  (UMF 25, 30.) 
He did not believe that either he or his company was taking responsibility
for the installation of the cable crossover machine, and he did not tell anyone
at Jamison Services that he had signed this form.  (UMF 26-27.)
C.        Discussion
Defendants
argue that they had no actual knowledge that the machine needed to be secured to
the premises or that the machine was not properly installed or secured.  (Motion at pp. 8-10.)  Defendants also argue that they cannot be liable
for accidents after the tenant took possession. 
(Motion at pp. 10-12.)  “‘[I]t is the
general rule that [the landlord] is under no obligation to anyone to look after
the premises or keep them in repair, and is not responsible, either to persons injured
on the land or to those outside of it, for conditions which develop or are created
by the tenant after possession has been transferred.’”  (Uccello v. Laudenslayer (1975) 44 Cal.App.3d
504, 511.)  “Public policy precludes landlord
liability for a dangerous condition on the premises which came into existence after
possession has passed to a tenant.”  (Garcia
v. Holt (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 600, 604.) 
“[B]efore liability may be thrust on a landlord for a third party’s injury
due to a dangerous condition on the land, the plaintiff must show that the landlord
had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition in question, plus the right and
ability to cure the condition.”  (Ibid.,
quotation marks omitted.)  “‘A landlord cannot
be held to be responsible for all dangers inherent in a dangerous business,’” including
those inherent dangers at a gym.  (Day
v. Lupo Vine Street, L.P. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 62, 73.)
Wilfit’s
lease began on July 1, 2011.  (UMF 10.)  Jamison Services conducted a walkthrough of the
space with a Wilfit representative before Wilfit took final possession.  (UMF 11.) 
The machine was purchased on August 11, 2011 and delivered on July 18, 2012—after
Wilfit took possession.  (UMF 18-19.)  Defendants did not purchase any gym equipment
for or on behalf of Wilfit, and they were not involved in the selection or purchase
of equipment from TechnoGym.  (UMF 17.)  Jamison Services is not involved in the operation
of the gym or operating a gym for the tenant. 
(UMF 44.)  Under the lease, Wilfit
was responsible for maintain its fixtures, and ““[a]ll business and trade fixtures,
machinery and equipment” installed by Wilfit remained its own property.  (UMF 42-43.)
Defendants
have met their moving burden of showing that Plaintiff cannot establish all elements
of his claims—namely Defendants’ duty to Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
Plaintiff
argues that Defendants, JRA, and Central Fitness are indistinguishable entities
operating as a single enterprise who built the gym as part of a joint venture.  (Opposition at pp. 7-9, 13-14.)  Single enterprise is a theory of liability, not
a cause of action.  (See Las Palmas Associates
v. Las Palmas Center Associates (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1220.)  “Two conditions are generally required for the
application of the [single enterprise] doctrine to two related corporations: (1)
such a unity of interest and ownership that the separate corporate personalities
are merged, so that one corporation is a mere adjunct of another or the two companies
form a single enterprise; and (2) an inequitable result if the acts in question
are treated as those of the corporation alone.” 
(Tran v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1219.)  “A joint venture exists when there is ‘an agreement
between the parties under which they have a community of interest, that is, a joint
interest, in a common business undertaking, an understanding as to the sharing of
profits and losses, and a right of joint control.’”  (Connor v. Great Western Sav. & Loan Ass’n
(1968) 69 Cal.2d 850, 863.)
This
theory of liability was not alleged in the Complaint.  (See Simmons v. Ware (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th
1035, 1050 [“[The] complaint was wholly inadequate to raise a joint venture and
at no time did [he] seek to amend [his] complaint to conform to proof.”].)  “[A] party cannot successfully resist summary
judgment on a theory not pleaded.”  (Whelihan
v. Espinoza (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1576.)
Even
considering Plaintiff’s argument, Plaintiff has not shown a triable issue of material
fact regarding a single enterprise or joint venture.  Plaintiff contends that Defendants “either entered
into a joint venture or were a single enterprise with respect to Wilfit Sports Club.  Ownership of the relevant companies, including
Defendants, were all owned, organized, and operated by Dr. David Lee and his family.”  (E.g., Response to UMF 7.)   However, Defendants were not involved with the
purchase of any equipment, and Jamison Services is not involved in the operation
of the gym.  (UMF 17, 44.)  Plaintiff has not raised a triable issue of material
fact regarding unity of interest and ownership or a common business undertaking
to establish a single enterprise or joint venture.  (See Reply at pp. 8-12.)
Plaintiff
also argues negligent undertaking when an employee signed the “Securing Equipment
Disclaimer” from TechnoGym and provides access to the gym for the delivery of the
machine.  (Opposition at p. 27.)  However, Defendants’ alleged liability arises
from failure to anchor/secure the machine and failure to warn.  (Complaint at p. 5.)  “A moving party seeking summary judgment or adjudication
is not required to go beyond the allegations of the pleading, with respect to new
theories that could have been pled, but for which no motion to amend or supplement
the pleading was brought, prior to the hearing on the dispositive motion.”  (Irvine Company LLC v. Superior Court of Orange
County (2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 858, 875, quotation marks omitted.)  When a complaint does not suggest a negligence
claim based on anything other than physical conditions or certain conduct, a motion
for summary judgment need not address an unpleaded claim for negligent undertaking.  (Ibid.)
Summary
judgment is granted in favor of Defendants.
D.        Conclusion
The
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.  Jamison
Services and Central Plaza are ordered to submit a proposed judgment within five
days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
May 22, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
