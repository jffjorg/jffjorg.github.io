[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO COMPEL
  FURTHER RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 14, 2024



 
On
July 18, 2023, Defendants Greg Zandate and Laura Zandate filed (1) a motion to compel
further responses from Plaintiff Noemi Ceja for Form Interrogatories and Special
Interrogatories (Reservation ID 042773476684); (2) a motion to compel further responses
from Plaintiff Carlos Figueroa for Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories
(Reservation ID 678564236875); and (3) a motion to compel further responses from
Plaintiff Dominique Santana for Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories
(Reservation ID 994477943824).  Each motion
also requests sanctions.  No oppositions were
filed, and Plaintiffs did not provide their positions in the separate statements.
A
party may move to compel a further response to interrogatories if the demanding
party deems an answer to be evasive or incomplete, if an exercise of the option
to produce documents is unwarranted or inadequate, or if objection is without merit
or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a).)
FILING
DEFICIENCIES
Each
set of discovery should have been filed as a separate motion, with separate filing
fees and hearing reservations.  Despite being
scheduled as only three motions and three hearings, the total substance is that
of six motions.  This unfairly allows the
parties to take only three hearing reservations (instead of six) and results in
an inaccurate projection and accounting of the Court’s workload, inconveniencing
both the Court and other litigants. 
All
parties are ordered not to do this again and are warned that continued action of
this type may result in monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section
177.5.  For any future discovery motions,
the parties must file a separate motion for each set of discovery, or the Court
may strike or deny the motions for being improperly filed.
Defendants
are ORDERED to pay three additional filing fees within 10 days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Payment of Additional Filing Fees is scheduled for
May 29, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
