And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to quash the subpoena issued by Defendant Shango Meru Kani to Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club is denied. The court modifies the subpoena to exclude records of the policyholder's injuries, treatment, and property damage. The court finds that the subpoena is not overbroad and does not violate the privacy rights of Gasparyan. The court notes that Defendant is entitled to information about Gasparyan's injuries and vehicle damage incurred in the October 2021 accident because it is relevant to a possible apportionment of Gasparyan's damages between that accident and the accident at issue in this case.
