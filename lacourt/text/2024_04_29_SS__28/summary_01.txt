And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers in this case. The Defendant City of Los Angeles seeks to compel Plaintiff Chellie Schou's mental examination and reopen discovery. The Plaintiff opposes the motion and requests sanctions. The Court finds that the Defendant did not demonstrate diligence in requesting the mental examination from the time the Defendant filed its answer in May 2020 to late November 2023. Therefore, the Court denies the Defendant's motion. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The Court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service within five days.
