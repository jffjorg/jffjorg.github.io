And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the parties' requests and rules as follows. John Louie, a defendant and cross-complainant, has moved for a protective order preventing any party from taking his deposition, citing his inability to hear or speak and his "intellectual challenges." Plaintiff has opposed the motion, requesting sanctions against John Louie and his counsel for failing to provide medical evidence supporting his claims. The court finds that John Louie has not established good cause for a protective order and denies his motion. The court also denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the circumstances make imposition of sanctions unjust.
