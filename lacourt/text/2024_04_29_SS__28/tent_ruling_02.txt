considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
November 13, 2020, Plaintiff Eugene Taulbee
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Veteran’s Towing &
Transport, Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle negligence and
general negligence. 
On
February 16, 2021, the Court entered Defendant’s default. 
On
April 22, 2022, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice. 
On
June 17, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to change Defendant’s name from
Veteran’s Towing & Transport, Inc., which was incorrect, to Defendant’s
true name, Veterans Towing, LLC. 
On
August 3, 2022, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. 
On
September 8, 2022, and February 15, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion
to vacate the dismissal. 
On
February 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing substituted service
on Defendant of (1) the summons, complaint, and other documents on October 4,
2022 and (2) a statement of damages on December 3, 2022. 
On
February 10, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
March 28, 2024, the Court continued Plaintiff’s request for Court judgment
filed on February 22, 2024 to April 29, 2024 and ordered Plaintiff to submit (1)
a supplemental declaration with a copy of the
statement of damages served on Defendant on December 3, 2022 and (2) a new
Declaration of Mailing for the CIV-100 form. The Court also noted that the
JUD-100 form stated that the total amount requested was “78,967.”  The Court stated it would assume that the
total amount requested is $78,967.04 (the combined amount of the damages and
costs listed). 
On April
11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a supplemental declaration with a copy of the
statement of damages served on Defendant on December 3, 2022 and a new
declaration of mailing for the CIV-100 form. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant Veterans Towing,
LLC and award Plaintiff $78,967.04, consisting of $8,370.82 in special damages,
$70,000.00 in general damages, and $596.22 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
 “(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has submitted a completed application with all
necessary information.  The Court grants
the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Eugene Taulbee’s application
for default judgment filed on February 22, 2024 and awards Plaintiff Eugene
Taulbee $78,967.04 on his complaint against Defendant Veterans Towing, LLC. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
