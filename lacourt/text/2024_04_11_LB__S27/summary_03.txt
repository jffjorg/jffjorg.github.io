```

And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court's tentative ruling states that the application for determination of good faith settlement was granted prematurely by the Court on December 14, 2023. The Court finds that the application was served by certified mail on November 22, 2023, and that 25 days after service fell on a Sunday. The Court acted prematurely in granting the application, but since no harm was caused and the opposition to the application was not a timely motion to contest the good faith settlement, the Court denied the motion for reconsideration. The Court also suggested that the parties arrange to appear remotely at the CMC (Case Management Conference) and hearing on the application.
