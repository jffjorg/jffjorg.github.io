Summary in English:

This tentative ruling concerns a dispute between Plaintiffs (Antonio Calderon, Ana Canchola, and Frank G. Martinez) and Defendant (SCE) regarding an electrical explosion and fire in an underground high-voltage vault. The Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents (RPDs) and another to compel depositions of persons most knowledgeable (PMQs). The Defendant failed to respond to the RPDs in a timely manner, but ultimately served responses. The Court finds that the motion to compel responses to RPDs is substantively moot, but the motion to compel PMQ depositions is necessary to identify the PMQs and schedule depositions. The Court imposes monetary sanctions of $3850 against the Defendant and its attorney. The Court also orders the Defendant to provide at least three dates and times for the deposition of each remaining PMQ within the next week.
