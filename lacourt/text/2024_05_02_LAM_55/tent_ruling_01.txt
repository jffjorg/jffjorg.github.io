PEGGY PINTO and LUIS PINEDA (Plaintiffs) filed a
Complaint alleging that, in September 2015, Plaintiffs entered an oral lease,
with owner CARMEN MORENO, an individual, and as Trustee of the CARMEN MORENO
TRUST (Defendants),
of an unpermitted portion of the single-family dwelling at 13501 West Terra
Bella Street, Pacoima, having various uninhabitable conditions, and the Los
Angeles Housing Department repeatedly instructed Defendants to cease tenant
harassment such as attempted evictions, done in retaliation for tenants’
complaints.
Plaintiffs bring four motions requesting orders
compelling Defendants to serve initial responses to form and special
interrogatories and document requests, and deeming admitted admission requests,
because Defendants served no responses and thereby statutorily waived discovery
objections. Additionally, Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions against
Defendants, as to each motion.
A motion to compel initial discovery responses need
only show that discovery was properly served on the opposing party, the time to
respond expired, and no response was served. Leach v. Sup. Ct. (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905; Code Civ. Proc., §§2030.290 (compelling initial
interrogatory responses), 2031.300 (compelling initial document requests). A
motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting
and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate
statement. Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal. App. 4th 390, 404.
A motion to deem admitted requests for admissions lies
based upon a showing of failure to respond timely. Demyer v. Costa Mesa
Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, disapproved on other
grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 983.
“If the party seeking a monetary sanction meets its
burden of proof, the burden shifts to the opposing party attempting to avoid a
monetary sanction to show that it acted with ‘substantial justification.’” Doe
v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1435.
Here, the motions show that Defendants failed to serve
discovery responses to properly served requests, and no oppositions have been
filed to show substantial justification for failing to serve responses beyond
the statutory time limits.
Therefore, the Court grants the unopposed motions, as
prayed. The Court will sign and file proposed orders lodged by Plaintiffs.
