Legal Standard
 
The Civil Discovery Act provides
for an escalating and “incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting
with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.”
(Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)¿Discovery sanctions should be
appropriate to and commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)
“If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted:
continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher
sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.;
see also, e.g.,¿Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem¿(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
279-280.)¿“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not
be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history
of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing
the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.
App. 4th 377, 390 [citation omitted].)
 
The primary purpose of discovery
sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s
orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct.¿(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613;¿Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los
Angeles¿(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction
should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better
position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with
its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge
v. Hewlett-Packard Co.¿(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil
& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶¿8:2214-2220.)¿“[T]the trial court has broad discretion in selecting
the appropriate sanction, and we must uphold the trial court's determination
absent an abuse of discretion.” (Dept. of Forestry & Fire
Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 19.)
 
Discussion
On September 19, 2022,
Plaintiff filed this case alleging injuries from a forklift accident due to
Defendant Escalante's improper setup of various equipment. On March 19, 2024,
the Court heard Plaintiff’s motion to compel deposition and ordered Escalante
to sit for his deposition and pay $2,000 in sanctions to Plaintiff within 20
days. Plaintiff alleges Defendant has not complied with these orders and now
moves the Court for terminating, issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions. Defendant
provided evidence of payment of the sanctions (by defense counsel) on April 9,
2024. However, the deposition of Defendant Escalante remains unresolved. This
has been a longstanding issue between the Parties, as defense counsel lost
contact with Escalante and could not produce him for the previously scheduled
depositions, prompting a motion to compel deposition. Even after the Court
issued an order for his deposition, defense counsel still was not able get in
contact with Escalante, and his deposition remains outstanding.
Monetary sanctions have
not addressed the discovery abuse and, given counsel’s numerous failed attempts
in the past to reach Defendant Escalante, it appears that Defendant Escalante
has abandoned his defense, failing to communicate with his own counsel and
failing to file any document or appear when his counsel moved to withdraw as
his counsel.  As such, an appropriate
sanction is warranted.  The Court will
discuss with the parties the appropriate sanction(s).
