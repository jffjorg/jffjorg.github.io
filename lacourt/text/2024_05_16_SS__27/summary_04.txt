And here is the summary text:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Silvercar Inc.'s motion for summary judgment, finding that Plaintiff's claim against Silvercar is barred by the Graves Amendment, which shields owners of leased vehicles from vicarious liability for the alleged negligence of their lessee's drivers. The court also grants Defendant's motion for sanctions against Plaintiff's attorney, ordering the attorney to pay $2,500 in sanctions. The court notes that the Plaintiff failed to oppose the motions or introduce any evidence raising a triable issue of fact, and that the lawsuit against Silvercar is factually frivolous.
