Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Court will hear argument on the Motion for Sanctions regarding the Plaintiff's motion for terminating, issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions against the Defendants. The Judge notes that the primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court's orders, and that a discovery sanction should not create a "windfall" for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations. The Judge finds that the Defendant, Francisco Escalante, has failed to comply with the Court's orders, including failing to produce himself for a deposition, and has abandoned his defense. The Judge intends to discuss with the parties the appropriate sanction(s) to address this discovery abuse.
