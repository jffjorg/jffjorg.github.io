And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the motion to reopen discovery filed by Defendants Mar Pizza, Inc. and Maria De Los Angeles Sanchez. The motion was filed due to the limited time Defendants had to conduct discovery, with the trial date being continued from April 10, 2024 to August 19, 2024. The Court finds the request to extend the discovery cutoff date reasonable, especially considering the Plaintiff underwent major surgeries in December 2023. The Court also notes that Defendants did not request the extension too late, and therefore grants the motion. As a result, all pretrial deadlines are hereby adjusted to align with the new trial date of August 19, 2024.
