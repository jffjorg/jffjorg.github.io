ANALYSIS
 
Defendant Dawn
Dupont Kinkade moves the court for an order compelling verified Responses to
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand for Production of
Documents. Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her
attorney of record, Kevin M. Maki, Esq. and Maki Law Firm, for $360.00 per
motion. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).) Under California law, unsworn responses
are tantamount to no responses.  (See Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 (holding that unverified responses are
tantamount to no responses) 
 
On April 17, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand for Production of
Documents. (Yun Decl. ¶2, Exh. A.) Responses were due May 19, 2023. (Yun Decl.¶
3.) On June 1, 2023, Defendant followed up with Plaintiff informing them t that
no responses had been received and asked if the responses had been served. (Yun
Decl. ¶3, Exh. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel responded that the responses had not
been served and that plaintiff’s counsel was going to follow up with his
client. (Yun Decl. ¶4, Exh. B.) On June 8, 2023, Defense Counsel counsel sent a
meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel advising that discovery responses
had not been received and requested responses within 10 days; if not, Defense
counsel would go forward with a motion to compel responses and request monetary
sanctions. (Yun Decl. ¶5, Exh. C.) Defense counsel followed up once more on
June 26, 2023 and on September 28, 2023, Plaintiff sent unverified responses.
(Yun Decl. ¶¶6-7, Exhs. D-E.) The responses were also not signed. (Yun Decl.
¶7.) To date, no proper, verified responses to any of the discovery have been
served by Plaintiff. (Yun Decl. ¶8.) 
 
The court finds Plaintiff’s failed to timely serve verified responses
to Defendant’s properly served discovery requests. The court therefore grants Defendant’s
motions to compel discovery responses to Defendant’s form interrogatories,
special interrogatories, and demand for production of documents. Plaintiff is
ordered to provide verified, signed responses within20 days.. 
 
Sanctions
 
The
court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories or response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (CCP §§2030.090(c), 2031.300(c).) 
 
Defendant requests monetary sanctions
in the amount of $360.00 per motion ($225/hr x 1/hr motion preparation; $75
motion appearance fee [$225 x 1/hr divided between 3 motions = $75]; $60 motion
filing fee). (Yun Decl. ¶10.) 
 
The
court GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions in the total amount of
$1080 as no opposition was filed.  Sanctions payable, jointly and severally, by
plaintiff and plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days.
