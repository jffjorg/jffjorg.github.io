And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Farzaneh Tabibian, had filed a complaint against the defendant, McCarthy Building Companies, Inc., alleging negligence-premises liability. The complaint alleges that the plaintiff slipped and fell on a pathway under construction due to the defendant's failure to maintain the floor, which was in a hazardous condition with loose gravel. The defendant argued that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against it, and that the complaint is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible. The judge agreed with the defendant, finding that the complaint has not sufficiently alleged a duty owed to the plaintiff nor how that duty was breached, and that the complaint does not sufficiently allege causation. The judge granted the defendant's request for judicial notice and ordered the plaintiff to amend the complaint to address the defendant's concerns.
