And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion to compel the deposition of Thomas Norris as London Towne Center, LLC's person most qualified (PMQ). The motion is granted because Norris has failed to appear for deposition prepared to answer questions, or produce documents responsive to the deposition notice. The judge has also granted the request for sanctions against London Towne Center, LLC and Thomas Norris in the sum of $9,424.05, which represents the time spent trying to depose Norris and in drafting the motion. The judge has ordered Norris to appear for deposition as the PMQ and to produce documents responsive to the deposition notice within 15 days of this order.
