[1] The court previously declined
Plaintiff’s request for terminating sanctions. 
The court already ordered Defendant’s compliance.  The court will not “compel” again.  Rather the motion must be directed to alternative
sanctions, such as issue or evidentiary sanctions.  Those are not the subject of this motion.
