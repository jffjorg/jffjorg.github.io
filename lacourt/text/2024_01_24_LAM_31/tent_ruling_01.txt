I.          INTRODUCTION
 
This
is a dispute concerning real property located at 910 Torrance Blvd. in Redondo
Beach, California (the “Subject Property”). 
910 Torrance Blvd., LLC (“910 Torrance”), owns a one-third (1/3)
interest as a tenant in common of the Subject Property.  London Towne Center, LLC (“LTC”) owns a
two-thirds (2/3) interest in the Subject Property.  Thomas Norris (“Norris”) is the sole member
and manager of LTC.  
 
On
March 12, 2021, Plaintiffs, 910 Torrance, Leslie H. Winner, and Lynda Winner,
individually and as trustees of the Winner Family Living Trust, filed a
Complaint against Defendants, LTC and Norris. The Complaint alleges causes of
action for: (1) Partition of Real Property; (2) Accounting; (3) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty; (4) Constructive Trust; (5) Declaratory and Injunctive Relief;
and (6) Unfair Business Practices (Civil Code § 17200).  Defendants answered the Complaint on October
27, 2021.
 
On
June 22, 2023, the court struck LTC’s answer to the Complaint because it had
not obtained counsel.  On the same day,
default was entered against LTC.
 
On
October 2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this motion to compel the deposition of Norris
as LTC’s person most qualified, and to produce documents at deposition.  Plaintiffs also seek an order compelling
Norris’s compliance with the court’s discovery orders issued on 2/21/2023,
3/03/2023, 4/25/2023, 6/09/2023, and 6/20/2023. 
Additionally, Plaintiffs seek sanctions against LTC and Norris.
 
The
motion is unopposed.
 
As
a threshold issue, Plaintiffs improperly seek to compel LTC’s PMQ deposition
and Norris’s compliance with prior discovery orders.  These matters should be the subject of
separately noticed motions.[1]  Accordingly, the court addresses only Plaintiffs
motion to compel LTC’s PMQ deposition.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
 
            Any party
may obtain discovery by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)¿ “If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action…without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to
produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)¿¿¿ 
 
            Monetary Sanctions¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery
sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes (without
limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial justification,
an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to
discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification making or
opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            If sanctions are sought, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity
of the person against whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction
requested, that the motion be supported in the points and authorities, and the
facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the amount of any monetary
sanction.¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
            “If a motion under [Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.450] subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor
of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party
with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿¿¿¿

·        
Exhibit R – Order of July 3, 2023 Re
Trial Scheduling, OSC Re Sanctions and Order to Comply. (Request for Judicial
Notice (RJN) 1.)
·        
Exhibit S– Plaintiffs’ Application
For Order of Publication of Summons and Complaint and Request for Judicial
Notice.  
 
            The request
as to Exhibit R is GRANTED.  (Evid. Code,
§ 452, subd. (d).)  The court declines to
rule on the remaining requests as they are not relevant to the court’s ruling.
 
IV.       DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiffs properly noticed LTC’s PMQ
deposition on four occasions.  (See Cohon
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 6, 9.)  On the first
occasion, Norris, as LTC’s PMQ, was unprepared to answer questions at the
deposition.  The deposition was
re-noticed twice.  Norris did not appear
each time.  On July 3, 2023, the court
ordered Norris to appear for deposition. 
(RJN 7.)  Norris appeared for
deposition on July 21, 2023, but was yet again unprepared to be deposed.  (Cohon Decl., ¶ 18.)  As such, Plaintiffs seek an order compelling
Norris to appear for deposition and to produce documents identified in the
deposition notice.
 
As
it is undisputed that Norris has not appeared for deposition prepared to answer
questions, or produced documents responsive to the deposition notice, Plaintiffs
are entitled to an order compelling Norris to appear for deposition as LTC’s
PMQ, and to produce documents responsive to the deposition notice.
 
Monetary
Sanctions 
 
            Plaintiffs request sanctions against
LTC and Norris in the sum of $15,199.05, which represents the time spent trying
to depose Norris and in drafting this motion. 
Given that the Court has granted this motion, sanctions are warranted.   Accordingly, sanctions are imposed
against LTC and Norris in the reduced amount of $9,424.05, representing 10
hours spent trying to depose Norris at defense counsel’s hourly rate, 2 hours for
preparing this motion at defense counsel’s hourly rate, $5,140 incurred in
deposition costs, and $84.05 in filing and service fees. (See Cohon Decl.,
¶¶ 23, 25; Breman Decl., ¶¶ 5, 6.) 
 
V.        CONCLUSION
 
            The
unopposed motion is granted.¿ Defendant Thomas Norris is ordered to appear for
deposition as LTC’s PMQ and to produce documents responsive to the deposition
notice within 15 days of this order. 
 
            The request for sanctions is
granted.  Norris and LTC are ordered to pay, jointly and severally,
sanction in the sum of $9,424.05, to be paid to Plaintiffs, by and through their
counsel within 30 days of this order.¿¿
