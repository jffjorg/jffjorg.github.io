And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Elena Jahnke v. Blue Cross of California, et al. (Case No. 23STCV13973). The case involves a dispute over delays in medical treatment and alleged bad faith by the defendant, Anthem Blue Cross.

The court ruled that the demurrer to the entirety of the complaint is overruled, as is the demurrer to the first and second causes of action. However, the court sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges a violation of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL).

The court also ruled that the motion to strike punitive damages is denied, as the allegations of bad faith and malice are adequately pleaded. The court granted the motion to strike attorney fees.

The court ordered the plaintiff to serve and file a first amended complaint within 30 days of the order, and the defendant to serve and file a responsive pleading within 30 days of service of the amended pleading.
