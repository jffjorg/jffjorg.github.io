of Arizona, LLC, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV19904            
 
MOTION
TO QUASH THIRD PARTY SUBPOENA FOR RECORDS

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Melanie Lewis
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 10/21/24
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action that was filed on August 18,
2023. Plaintiff was employed by Defendants as a long-haul truck driver.
Plaintiff alleges that she was systematically discriminated against and
ultimately terminated on the basis of her gender and an injury sustained in a
vehicle accident on the job.
 
Plaintiff moves to quash a third-party
deposition subpoena for records propounded to Opus Virtual Offices, LLC. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves to quash a third-party
deposition subpoena for records propounded to Opus Virtual Offices, LLC.  However, Plaintiff’s moving papers consist in
their entirety of four pages of argument without a shred of evidence. Mere
argument is not sufficient to demonstrate good cause to quash a deposition
subpoena. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1987.1.) 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Quash Third-Party Subpoena is DENIED. This ruling is without prejudice to a
procedurally proper motion which is supported by admissible evidence. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
