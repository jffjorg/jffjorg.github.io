And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant's motion to deem the truth of matters stated in requests for admissions as admitted, and grants Defendant's motions to compel responses to special interrogatories and requests for production. The judge orders Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections to the interrogatories and requests for production within 30 days of the order. The judge also grants Defendant's request for sanctions against Plaintiff in the total amount of $1,575, payable to Defendant's counsel within 20 days of the order. The judge finds that Plaintiff's failure to respond to Defendant's requests was unjustified, and that sanctions are warranted.
