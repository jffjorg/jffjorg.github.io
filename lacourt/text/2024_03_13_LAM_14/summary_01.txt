And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Attorney Kenneth G. Ruttenberg to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendant Looptify. The motion was denied without prejudice, meaning that Ruttenberg can re-file the motion if he provides a sufficient explanation for his withdrawal. The judge's decision is based on California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362, which requires counsel to provide a valid reason for withdrawal. Ruttenberg's explanation that the client would not agree to relieve him is not sufficient, as the client's desire is not one of the permissible reasons for ending a representation listed in California Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 1.16.
