Commercial Unlawful Detainer. 
 
On November 2, 2023, Plaintiff
filed its form Complaint in Unlawful Detainer against Defendants Looptify, Inc.
(“Looptify”) and DOES 1-20.
 
On November 8, 2023, Defendant Looptify
filed its Answer.
 
On December 18, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Notice of Settlement.
 
Instant Motion
 
Attorney Kenneth G. Ruttenberg (“Ruttenberg”)
now seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendant Looptify. 
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is DENIED, without prejudice. 
 
Governing Rule
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 requires that counsel fill out forms MC-051, MC-052,
and MC-053. These forms serve two basic functions: (1) ensuring that notice is
given to the client and (2) providing the court with an adequate explanation of
why the matter is being handled via motion rather than mutual consent. See Code
of Civil Procedure § 284; California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362.
 
Discussion
 
            Counsel Ruttenberg
has completed the required forms. Those forms indicate that the client has been
personally served with the moving papers. 
 
            Counsel Ruttenberg
indicates that he wishes to withdraw because the client would not agree to
relieve him.
 
            This
explanation is not sufficient. California Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 1.16
contains the permissible reasons for ending a representation. The client’s
desire that the representation continue is not on that list.
 
Conclusion
 
            Because
there is no adequate explanation of the reason for withdrawal, the motion is
DENIED, without prejudice.
