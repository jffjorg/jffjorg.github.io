ANALYSIS:
 
On June 30, 2022, Plaintiff 1105 Adams, LLC dba Audrey
Apartments (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence
against Defendants Kevin Pelico (“Defendant”). Following Defendant’s failure to
file a responsive pleading, the Court entered their default and default
judgment on December 13, 2023 and December 19, 2023, respectively. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment on May 9, 2024, concurrent with a request to dismiss the
action. The action was dismissed on the same date. No opposition has been filed
to date.
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves to vacate the default and default judgment
in this action on the grounds that the parties have now entered into a
settlement agreement. However, the action was dismissed on May 9, 2024 and Motion
is not supported by any legal authority for the order sought. “The memorandum
must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and
arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks
cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1113(b).) Indeed, Plaintiff’s failure to provide a memorandum as required by
the Rule is an “admission that the [request] is without merit and cause for its
denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of
Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff 1105 Adams, LLC dba Audrey Apartments’
Motion to Vacate Entry of Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
