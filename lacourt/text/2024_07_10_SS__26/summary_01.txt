The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the default and default judgment. The Plaintiff, 1105 Adams, LLC dba Audrey Apartments, filed the instant action against Defendant Kevin Pelico for motor vehicle negligence, but failed to file a responsive pleading. As a result, the Court entered default and default judgment on December 13, 2023, and December 19, 2023, respectively. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to vacate the default and default judgment, citing a settlement agreement between the parties. However, the action was dismissed on May 9, 2024, and the Plaintiff failed to provide a memorandum as required by the Rules of Court. The Judge found that this failure was an "admission that the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial." Therefore, the motion to vacate is denied.
