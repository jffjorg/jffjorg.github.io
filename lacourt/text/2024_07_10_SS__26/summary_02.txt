And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling of this case grants the defendant's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, and also grants the request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Bin Yang, is ordered to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of service of this order. Additionally, the plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions of $570.00 to defense counsel within 20 days of service of this order.

The judge's analysis is based on the fact that the defendant served the discovery requests on the plaintiff on January 9, 2024, and despite a meet and confer effort, the plaintiff has not served responses to the discovery. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to serve initial responses constitutes a misuse of the discovery process, and therefore awards sanctions against the plaintiff. The amount of the sanctions is calculated based on two hours of attorney time billed at $225.00 per hour and costs of $60.00 per motion.
