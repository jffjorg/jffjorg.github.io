ANALYSIS:
 
On January 26, 2023,
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action for automobile subrogation against Defendants
Imani Singleton (“Defendant Singleton”) and Jahlani Thompson aka Jalhani
Thompson (“Defendant Thompson”). Defendants filed an answer on April 10, 2023,
and an amended answer on April 12, 2023. On November 6, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Monetary
Sanctions against Defendant Singleton. (Minute Order, 11/06/23.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Defendant Singleton on April 12,
2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The standard for ruling on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable
to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with
matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.  (Bezirdjian
v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322, citing Schabarum v.
California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.)  Matters which are subject to mandatory
judicial notice may be treated as part of the complaint and may be considered
without notice to the parties. Matters which are subject to permissive judicial
notice must be specified in the notice of motion, the supporting points and
authorities, or as the court otherwise permits. (Id.)  The motion may not be supported by extrinsic
evidence. (Barker v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 236.)
 
While a statutory motion for
judgment on the pleadings brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
438, et seq. must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, there is no
such requirement for a motion for judgment on the pleadings brought pursuant to
the common law. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 439 [moving party must file declaration
demonstrating an attempt to meet and confer in person or by telephone, at least
five days before the date a motion for judgment on the pleadings is filed].) 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion is accompanied
by a request for judicial notice of the matters deemed admitted in Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and this Court’s
November 6, 2023 order deeming the Requests for Admission admitted against
Defendant Singleton. The Court takes judicial notice of these facts pursuant to
Cal. Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d). (Cal. Evid. Code, § 452, subd.
(d); Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999; Evans
v. California Trailer Court, Inc. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 540, 549) [holding
that the court may take judicial notice of matters that cannot be reasonably
controverted, including “admissions and concessions.”].) 
 
The admissions in the Request for
Admissions directly contradict the general denial and affirmative defenses
asserted in Defendant Singleton’s Answer. The admissions admit that Defendant Singleton
failed to drive with reasonable care. (RJN, Exh. 2, Request for Admission No.
4.) They also admit that Defendant Singleton was the sole cause of the accident
with Plaintiff’s insured and as a result, Defendant Singleton caused
Plaintiff’s insured to incur damages. (Id. at Request for Admission Nos.
5-7.) The admissions admit that Defendant Singleton caused Plaintiff to incur
damages of at least $23,086.22. (Id. at Request for Admission No. 8-9.)
Finally, Defendant Singleton admits that the affirmative defenses asserted in
the Answer lack merit and evidentiary support. (Id. at Request for
Admission No. 10.)
 
By this Motion, Plaintiff has demonstrated that it served
Defendant Singleton with Requests for Admissions that effectively establish the
truth of the allegations in the Complaint, as detailed above. The admissions
establish the facts upon which Plaintiff based its Complaint and that Defendant
Singleton has not alleged a defense to Plaintiff’s Complaint in the Answer.
However, the Motion does not address whether Plaintiff intends to further
pursue this action against Defendant Thompson. The Court cannot enter judgment
against Defendant Singleton while the case remains pending against Defendant
Thompson.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
against Defendant Imani Singleton
is CONTINUED TO JULY 25, 2024 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET
COURTHOUSE. BY JULY 15, 2024, PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A SUPPLEMENTAL
DECLARATION EXPLAINING THE STATUS OF THE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO DEFENDANT
THOMPSON. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
