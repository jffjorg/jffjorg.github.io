ANALYSIS:
 
On January 9, 2024, Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the
Automobile Club (“Defendant”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special
Interrogatories on Plaintiff Bin Yang (“Plaintiff”). (Motions, Vallone Decl., Exh. 1.) Despite a meet and confer effort
extending the deadline to serve verified responses without objections,
Plaintiff has not served responses to the discovery. (Id. at ¶¶5-7 and
Exh. 2.) Defendant filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on
June 7, 2024. No oppositions have been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motions to Compel Responses to Interrogatories, are granted.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) There is no requirement for a prior meet and
confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Furthermore, the motion can be brought at any time
after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Therefore, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff to
serve verified responses to the interrogatories without objections.
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for
simple and unopposed motions. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $570.00 based on two hours of
attorney time billed at $225.00 per hour and costs of $60.00 per motion.
(Motions, Vallone Decl.,
¶¶10.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s
(1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request
for Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set
One, and Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF BIN YANG IS TO SERVE
VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF BIN YANG IS ALSO ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $570.00 TO DEFENSE
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
