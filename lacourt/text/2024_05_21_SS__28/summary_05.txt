Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Plaintiff Peter Loprimo's application for default judgment against Defendant Arby's. The court finds that the application is incomplete and does not meet the necessary requirements for a default judgment. Specifically, the court notes that the Plaintiff failed to complete sections of the CIV-100 form, failed to submit a copy of the statement of damages, and failed to explain the relevance of attached documents. The court also finds that the Plaintiff's damages are unclear and that the complaint is unclear about the alleged cause of the damages. As a result, the court denies the Plaintiff's application for default judgment and orders the Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
