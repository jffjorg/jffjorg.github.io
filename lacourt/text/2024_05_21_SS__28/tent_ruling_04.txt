 Case Number:  22STCV01663    Hearing Date:   May 21, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
A.   Previous proceedings 
On
January 14, 2022, Plaintiff Marguerita Ludwig (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Richard Lam (“Richard Lam”), Helen Lam (“Helen Lam”), Amy
Lam (“Amy Lam”), 380 Sierra Madre, LLC (“380 Sierra Madre”), Lam Property
Management (“Management”), Estate of William Jordison, and Does 1-45 for
premises liability. 
On
October 11, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to change the name of
Defendant Estate of William Jordison to Estate of William Jordison, Deceased. 
On
December 16, 2022, Defendant Estate of William Jordison, Deceased (“Estate”)
filed an answer. 
On
March 15, 2023, Richard Lam, Helen Lam, Amy Lam, 380 Sierra Madre, and
Management filed an answer and a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants
Estate and Roes 1-10 for declaratory relief, implied partial indemnity, and
equitable apportionment. On May 19, 2023, the Estate filed an answer to the
cross-complaint. 
On May
20, 2024, the Court granted Estate’s motion for a determination that its
settlement with Plaintiff was in good faith. The Court dismissed all pending
and future claims against Estate by the parties served with Estate’s motion (to
the extent those claims arise from the facts giving rise to this case),
including cross-complaints for equitable indemnity. 
B.   This motion 
On
February 29, 2024, Richard Lam, Helen Lam, Amy Lam, 380 Sierra Madre, and
Management (“Lam Defendants”) filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition
and for monetary sanctions, to be heard on May 21, 2024.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for August 27, 2024.  
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
The
Lam Defendants ask the Court to order Plaintiff to appear for a deposition and
pay monetary sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. 
* * *
 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. 
“(2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by
attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in
the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
in favor of that party and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450.) 
DISCUSSION 
Counsel
for the Lam Defendants served six deposition notices on Plaintiff. The
deposition dates were July 25, 2023, August 10, 2023, September 22, 2023,
December 29, 2023, February 22, 2024, and February 28, 2024.  Plaintiff’s counsel canceled each deposition shortly
before the deposition date.  (Zurek dec. ¶
3.) 
On
January 24, 2024, the Lam Defendants’
counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel to provide dates when Plaintiff and her
counsel would be available for the deposition. 
Counsel agreed to schedule the deposition on February 28, 2024. 
On
February 27, 2024 at 3:46 p.m., Plaintiff’s counsel sent the Lam Defendants’
counsel an email stating: “I regret to inform you that I am currently too ill
to attend tomorrow's scheduled deposition of Ms. Ludwig which, therefore, will
not go forward.  I will be happy to coordinate a new date with you once I have
recovered.”  (Zurek dec. ¶ 4 & exh. C.) 
Based
on these undisputed facts, the Court grants the motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450.  However, the Court denies the Lam Defendants’
request for sanctions.  While the Lam
Defendants express “doubt[ ]” that Plaintiff’s counsel was really too ill to attend
the February 28, 2024 deposition, they have provided no evidence to support
their suspicion.  Therefore, the Court
finds that an award of sanctions would be unjust.  
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion to compel Plaintiff Marguerita Ludwig’s deposition
filed by Defendants Richard Lam, Helen Lam, Amy Lam, 380 Sierra Madre, LLC, and
Lam Property Management. 
The
Court DENIES the request for sanctions of Defendants
Richard Lam, Helen Lam, Amy Lam, 380 Sierra Madre, LLC, and Lam Property
Management.
