```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court grants the motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Marguerita Ludwig, filed by the Lam Defendants. However, the Court denies the request for sanctions. The Lam Defendants' counsel sent six deposition notices to Plaintiff's counsel, but each time, Plaintiff's counsel canceled the deposition shortly before the scheduled date. On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff's counsel sent an email stating that they were too ill to attend the scheduled deposition on February 28, 2024. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's counsel's excuse of being too ill to attend the deposition is credible, and therefore, an award of sanctions would be unjust.
