And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The Plaintiffs, Ana Maribel Garcia and Brian Osorto, have asked the Court to reconsider or grant relief from the dismissal of their case. The Court has found that the Defendant, Jose Alberto Perez, has been in default since October 14, 2020, and that Plaintiffs have been diligent in pursuing a default judgment against Defendant. However, the Court has also found that Plaintiffs never submitted a default judgment packet suitable for Court approval, and therefore, the time during which Defendant was in default is not excluded from the time within which Plaintiffs were required to bring the action to trial. Therefore, the Court denies the motion for reconsideration and dismisses the case with prejudice.
