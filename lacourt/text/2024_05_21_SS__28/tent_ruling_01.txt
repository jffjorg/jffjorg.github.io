On

against Defendants SPR Trucking, Inc. (“SPR Trucking”),
Rafael Maldonado (“Maldonado”), and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and
general negligence. 
On
February 4, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service
of the summons, complaint, and other documents on a person authorized to accept
service of process for SPR Trucking on January 20, 2021. 
On

of a statement of damages on a person authorized to accept service of process
for SPR Trucking on September 12, 2022. 
On

on Maldonado of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other

proof of service. 
On
October 17, 2022, the clerk entered SPR Trucking’s default. 
On November 15, 2022, the clerk entered Maldonado’s

On

damages for medical expenses to date, $50,000.00 in general damages for pain,

On
January 17, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On April

Maldonado and SPR Trucking.  Plaintiff filed
proofs of service showing service of the amended statements of damages on Maldonado
and SPR Trucking on April 23, 2024 and April 25, 2024.  The amended statements of damages listed general
damages of $25,000.00 (consisting of $15,000.00 for pain, suffering, and inconvenience
and $10,000.00 for emotional distress) and special damages of $100,000.00
(consisting of $6,685.00 for past medical expenses and $68,315.00 for future
medical expenses). 
On
April 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on May
21, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendants Rafael Maldonado
and SPR Trucking, Inc., and award Plaintiff $107,696.07.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to award special damages of $75,000.00, general damages of $25,000.00, and $1,011.07 in
costs (amounts which total less than $107,696.07). 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 

“In
personal injury and wrongful death actions, the complaint must not state the
amount of damages sought [citations]. 
Therefore, before a default may be entered, plaintiff must serve
defendant with a statement of ‘the nature and amount of damages being sought.’
”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶
5:82, p. 5-27, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11.)  “Proof of service of a [statement of damages
under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11] must accompany any request for
entry of default to assure that defendants received actual notice of their
potential liability.”  (Ibid.) 
In the
Court’s March 22, 2024 order, the Court asked Plaintiff to clarify the basis
for his request for $100,000.00 in general damages. The Court added: “If
necessary, Plaintiff should serve new statements of damages and obtain new
defaults before submitting a new application for default judgment.”  (Emphasis added.) 
Plaintiff
subsequently served new statements of damages on Defendants which modified the “nature”
of the damages being sought against them. 
The original statements of damages listed $100,000.00 in general damages
and $6,685.00 in special damages for past medical expenses.  The amended statements of damages reduced the
general damages to $25,000.00 but added $68,315.00 in special damages for
future medical expenses.  The amended
statements of damages “opened” the defaults, requiring that the Court vacate the defaults to give Maldonado and SPR
Trucking an opportunity to decide whether to contest the case based on the
revised information about their potential liability. 
The
Court vacates Maldonado’s default entered on November
15, 2022 and SPR Trucking’s default entered on October
17, 2022. 
The
Court denies Plaintiff’s application for entry of default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Navid Nourmand’s application for default judgment
against Defendants Rafael Maldonado and SPR Trucking, Inc. filed on April 29,
2024. 
The
Court VACATES Defendant Rafael Maldonado’s default entered on November 15, 2022. 
The
Court VACATES Defendant SPR Trucking, Inc.’s default entered on October 17,
2022. 
The
Court sets an OSC Re: Dismissal for Failure to Enter Default for June 28, 2024,
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
