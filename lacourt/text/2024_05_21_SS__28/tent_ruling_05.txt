 Case Number:  22STCV11168    Hearing Date:   May 21, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 4, 2022, Plaintiff Peter Loprimo (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants John Doe, Inspire Brands, Inc., Arby’s (“Arby’s”),
and Does 1-20 for negligence, battery, and assault. 
On
August 25, 2023, the clerk entered Arby’s’ default.  The same day, Plaintiff filed a proof of service
showing personal service on Arby’s’ authorized agent of the summons, complaint,
and statement of damages on June 1, 2023. 
On
April 15, 2024, the Court dismissed Defendants John Doe, Inspire Brands, Inc.,
and Does 1-20 without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on May
21, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Peter Loprimo asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant
Arby’s and award Plaintiff $25,000.00, consisting of $14,350.00 in general damages and $10,650.00 in special damages. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 

Plaintiff requests $10,650.00 in special damages and $14,350.00 in general
damages, for a total of $25,000.00 in damages. 
To support the request, Plaintiff must submit a declaration describing his
damages.  The declaration of Plaintiff’s
counsel cannot provide this information because Plaintiff’s counsel is not a
percipient witness to Plaintiff’s damages. 
Section
6 of Plaintiff’s CIV-100 form is not completed. 
In addition, counsel has not signed two sections of the CIV-100 form. 
Plaintiff
has not submitted a copy of the statement of damages served on Arby’s.  The Court needs to review the statement of
damages served on Arby’s to make sure that Arby’s was given notice of the
amount of damages Plaintiff is seeking. 
The
application does not explain the relevance of several documents attached to
counsel’s declaration (emails, screenshots, an Arby’s receipt, photographs, a
paramedic card).  If the documents are relevant
to Plaintiff’s request for default judgment, Plaintiff should explain the
relevance. 
Finally,
the complaint is unclear about the alleged cause of Plaintiff’s damages.  The complaint alleges that John Doe “threw
change” at Plaintiff but it also alleges that Plaintiff was injured in a “collision.”
 The Court
cannot dismiss these concerns by reasoning that Arby’s is in default and waived
these issues.  “A defendant who defaults
admits only facts well pleaded in the complaint.  Thus, if the complaint fails to state a cause
of action, a default judgment is erroneous and will be set aside on
appeal.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra,
¶ 5:228, p. 5-58.)  As the gatekeeper for
default judgments, the Court cannot grant this motion in its current form. 
The
Court denies Plaintiff’s application for entry of default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Peter Loprimo’s application for default judgment against
Defendant Arby’s filed on April 22, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
