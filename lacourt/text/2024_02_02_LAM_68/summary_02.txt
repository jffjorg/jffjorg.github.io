Summary in English text:

The Judge rules that the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by ADB Global Trade, LLC dba Classic Stone, LLC (Classic Stone) is GRANTED. Classic Stone, an LLC with its principal place of business in Illinois, moves to quash service of summons and complaint on grounds of lack of general or specific jurisdiction. The court finds that Classic Stone has no substantial and systematic contacts in California, and therefore, no basis for general jurisdiction. Additionally, the court finds that the plaintiff lacks any basis for association between the decedent's alleged exposure to hazardous materials and Classic Stone, and therefore, no basis for specific jurisdiction. The court notes that the plaintiff has failed to establish a nexus between the decedent's alleged exposure to hazardous materials and Classic Stone, and therefore, the motion to quash is granted.
