And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Heidy Garcia's motion for entry of default against Defendant LA Rentals. The motion was filed on August 8 and 12, 2024, and Plaintiff provided a proof of service on August 14, 2024. However, the Court has concerns about whether proper notice was given to Defendant, as the motion had incorrect hearing dates and department numbers. Moreover, even if proper notice was given, the Court cannot grant the motion because Defendant filed an answer on March 6, 2024, which means default cannot be entered under California Code of Civil Procedure section 585, subdivision (a). The Judge has directed the Judicial Assistant to give notice of the ruling.
