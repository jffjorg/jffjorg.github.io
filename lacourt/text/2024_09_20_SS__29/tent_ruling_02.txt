Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Ilsa Miranda 
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Bryan Miranda 
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Erick Ojeda
Tentative
The hearing on the motions is continued.
Background
On May 17, 2022, Ilsa Miranda, Bryan Miranda,
and Erick Ojeda (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Vardui
Melkonian (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 for motor vehicle negligence
arising out of an automobile accident occurring on December 19, 2019.
Erick Ojeda is a minor and brings this action by
and through his guardian ad litem, Ilsa Miranda.
Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on
July 17, 2023.
On October 4, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.
In December 2023 and February 2024, Plaintiffs
amended their complaint to name Wanda Ivascyn as Doe 1 and John Ivascyn as Doe
2.
On March 22, 2024, Wanda and John Ivascyn filed
an answer and cross-complaint against Defendant. The cross-complaint was
dismissed on May 1, 2024.
On August 15, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel Anthony
T. Nehme, Esq. (“Counsel”) filed these three motions to be relieved as attorney
of record for each of the Plaintiffs.  No
opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (b).) An attorney is permitted to
withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable
to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct
3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Super. Ct. (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration of Order to be Relieved as Counsel on all parties
in this matter. Counsel contends he can no longer ethically represent
Plaintiffs after reviewing written discovery.  
There are,
however, procedural issues with the motion. 

First, for all
three motions, there is a conflict in the moving papers regarding the manner of
service.  The proofs of service state that
the moving papers were served electronically (only), but the attorney
declarations state that the moving papers were served by mail.  Service by mail (or personal service) is
required.  The Court cannot grant the
motion until this conflict is resolved.
Second, for the
motion as to Bryan Miranda, the proof of service states that service was made
not on the client but on Ilsa Miranda. 
Mr. Miranda must be served.
Third, for the
motion as to Erick Ojeda, when this action was filed, Mr. Ojeda was a minor,
and Ilsa Miranda was appointed as his guardian ad litem.  According to the application, however, Mr.
Ojeda’s birthdate is 9/21/05, which means that Mr. Ojeda reached the age of
majority approximately one year ago, and he no longer needs to be represented
by a guardian ad litem.  Accordingly,
service of the motion must be directed to him, not Ms. Miranda.  
Accordingly, the
hearing is continued for approximately 30 days so that Counsel may effect
proper service on each of the three plaintiffs and file corrected and updated
proofs of service.
Conclusion
The hearing is continued
to October __, 2024, at 1:30 pm in Department 29 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.
Moving Counsel
is ordered to give notice.
