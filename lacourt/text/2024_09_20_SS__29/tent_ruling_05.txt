22STCV31520
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel Ilia Borisov of
Martinian Lawyers, Inc.

Tentative
The Court will call this matter.
Background
On September 26, 2022, Dehnys Valenzuela
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Stadco LA, LLC., Hollywood Park Land
Company, LLC, and Does 1 to 10 for premises liability arising out of an
incident on August 20, 2022, in which Plaintiff was allegedly attacked by other
attendees of an event at Sofi Stadium.
On April 28, 2023, Stadco LA, LLC and Hollywood
Park Management Company, LLC filed an answer to the complaint.
On April 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
substitution of attorney.
On August 21, 2024 Ilia Borisov of Martinian Lawyers, Inc. (“Counsel”)
(Plaintiff’s new counsel) filed this motion to be relieved as counsel.
Plaintiff filed an objection to the application on September 4,
2024.  
The hearing on this motion was initially set for September
11.  The Court continued the hearing to
September 20.  
 Trial is scheduled for August 18, 2025.
Legal Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at
any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request by either
client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts between
the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial
Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and
MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client and all
other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
Discussion
Counsel has filed the required
documents.  In the supporting declaration, Counsel states that the
filing of this motion “has become necessary” because Plaintiff “by other
conduct, renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the
representation effectively.”
In the Objection, Plaintiff states that Counsel
has “refused to litigate this case in a reasonable manner,” has not communicated
with Plaintiff about critical dates, “refuses to propound discovery,” and “just
wants to send a demand letter without doing any work.” 
The Court will call this matter and inquire,
among other things, about whether the attorney-client relationship is damaged
beyond repair and whether there are conflicts between the attorney and
client that make it unreasonable for the attorney to continue the representation.
Conclusion
The Court will call this matter.
