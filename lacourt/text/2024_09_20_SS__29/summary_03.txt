Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendants' motion to continue trial, citing the Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests and the need for further discovery. The Judge also denies the Defendants' motion to compel the Plaintiff to allow a vehicle inspection without prejudice. The Judge grants the Defendants' motions to compel the Plaintiff to respond to Special Interrogatories (Set Two), Requests for Production (Set Two), Supplemental Interrogatory, and Supplemental Request for Production. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to serve code-compliant, verified, written responses to these discovery requests within 15 days of notice.
