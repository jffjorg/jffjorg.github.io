And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiff, Pamela Maxine Simuel, had failed to timely post jury fees and had subsequently waived her right to a jury trial. However, the judge has found that the waiver was inadvertent and that no party would suffer undue or unfair prejudice from granting relief. The court has exercised its discretion under California Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g) to grant relief from waiver and allow a trial by jury.
