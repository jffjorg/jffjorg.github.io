And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will consider a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's Counsel Ilia Borisov, who claims that the attorney-client relationship is damaged beyond repair and that it is unreasonable for him to continue representing the plaintiff. The plaintiff has objected to the application, alleging that Counsel has refused to litigate the case reasonably, has not communicated with them about critical dates, and has not propounded discovery. The court will inquire about these allegations and determine whether the attorney-client relationship is irreparably damaged and whether Counsel can still continue to represent the plaintiff. The court will also consider whether the required forms have been properly filed and served. The hearing will be held on September 20, 2024.
