And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiff, Amayel Garfias, filed a complaint against the County of Los Angeles and Deputy Miguel Leon, alleging assault and battery, negligence, interference with civil rights, and harassment and hostile work environment. The plaintiff initially demanded a jury trial, but failed to timely post jury fees, which resulted in the waiver of the right to a jury trial. The plaintiff then filed a motion for relief from waiver of jury trial, which the court has granted. The court found that the plaintiff's failure to post jury fees was inadvertent and that no party would suffer undue or unfair prejudice from a court order granting relief from waiver. The court exercised its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g), to grant relief from waiver and to allow a trial by jury.
