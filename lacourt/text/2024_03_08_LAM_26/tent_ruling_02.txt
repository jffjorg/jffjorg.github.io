 Case Number:  BC701437    Hearing Date:   March 8, 2024    Dept:  26 On April 9, 2018, Ticor Title Company of California
(“Ticor”) filed the instant complaint in interpleader concerning funds from the
purchase and sale of real property.  The
complaint names the following defendants who assert a claim in interest in said
funds: Lina Minkovitch, Yan Minkovitch, and the United States of America.  
 
The United States has since released its claims to the
disputed funds and was dismissed from the complaint on December 16, 2020.
 
On October 30, 2023, Yan Minkovitch filed a motion for
jury trial.  On November 30, 2023, the
Court denied Yan Minkovitch’s motion for jury trial on the grounds that the law
is well settled that there is no right to a jury trial in an interpleader
action.  (Order 11/30/23; See also, Shopoff
& Cavallo LLP v. Hyon (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1489, 1514, [“The
California Supreme Court long ago established the principle ‘ “that a suit in
interpleader, such as this one, and involving like issues, is an equitable
proceeding in which the rights of the parties as between themselves are
governed by principles of equity [citations], and ... in such cases the right
to a trial by jury does not exist ....” [Citations.]’  Even if the underlying controversy was one of
law, the gravamen of an interpleader action between rival claimants to the
proceeds is ‘of an equitable nature,’ and denial of an application for a jury
trial is not error.”].)  
 
On December 1, 2023, Yan Minkovitch filed a notice of
appeal of the Court’s November 30, 2023 Order.
 
On December 21, 2023, Yan Minkovitch filed an ex parte
application to stay the proceedings.  Department
26 was dark during that period.  On
December 26, 2023, the Honorable Michelle Williams in Department 1 denied the
ex parte application for a stay of the proceedings.
 
On January 2, 2024, the Court commenced the hearing on
the disposition of interpleaded funds. 
The hearing was not completed on January 2, 2024.  The Court continued the remainder of the hearing
to January 11, 2024.  (Minute Order
1/2/24.)
 
On January 11, 2024, the Court was engaged in a jury
trial.  The disbursement hearing was
further continued to February 20, 2024. 
(Minute Order 1/11/24.)  During
the January 11, 2024 hearing, Yan Minkovitch claimed that he had filed a writ
of supersedeas.  The Court records indicated
that the Court of Appeal had issued a default. 
The Court ordered Yan Minkovitch to file and serve a declaration including
a copy of writ of supersedeas together with a docket and any other evidence
that indicates the status of any pending appellate proceeding by February 13,
2024.  (Minute Order 1/11/24.)  The Court further ordered Lina Minkovitch to
file and serve a declaration with a copy of any exhibits showing the status of
any pending appellate proceedings by February 15, 2024.  (Minute Order 1/11/24.)
 
On February 13, 2024, Yan Minkovitch filed a
declaration stating that he had filed an appeal of this court’s decision on the
motion for a jury trial in the Court of Appeal, Case No. B334330 and attached a
screen printout of the online docket indicating that the Civil case information
was to be filed on February 13, 2024 and the record on appeal was to be filed
on May 28, 2024.  Lina Minkovitch did not
file any declaration regarding the appellate proceedings.
 
On February 20, 2024, the Court was still engaged in a
jury trial.  The disbursement hearing was
continued to March 8, 2024.  (Minute
Order 2/20/24.)  The Court noted that if
any party wished to move for a stay, that party must obtain a CRS reservation
and file and serve a properly noticed motion with a hearing date reserved on
CRS.  (Minute Order 2/20/24.)
 
On February 27, 2024, Yan Minkovitch filed the instant
motion to stay the action pending the appeal of the order denying Yan
Minkovitch’s motion for a jury trial.  On
March 1, 2024, the Court granted Yan Minkovitch’s ex parte application to
advance the hearing on the instant motion to stay the action and advanced the
instant hearing to March 8, 2024. 
(Minute Order 3/1/24.)
 
No opposition or reply has been filed.
 
Yan Minkovitch contends that contends that the instant
action is automatically stayed pending appeal pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 916(A).  This contention is
incorrect.
 
An order denying a request for jury trial is not itself
an appealable order.  Rather, “a trial
court's denial of a request for jury trial may be reviewed prior to trial by a
petition for an extraordinary writ.”  (Shaw
v. Superior Court (2017) 2 Cal.5th 983, 992.)  
 
“If an appeal from the court's order is perfected, by
statute the trial court generally loses subject matter jurisdiction over any
matter affected by the appeal. (§ 916, subd. (a); Varian Medical Systems, Inc.
v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 196–197.) This automatic stay provision does
not, however, apply to writ proceedings. (In re Brandy R. (2007) 150
Cal.App.4th 607, 609–610.) Statutes governing petitions for writs of mandate
contain no analogous automatic stay provision.” 
(Paul Blanco's Good Car Company Auto Group v. Superior Court of
Alameda County (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 86, 97–98.)
 
Here, Yan Minkovitch is appealing the Court’s November
30, 2023 Order denying Yan Minkovitch’s motion for a jury trial.  Under the authority noted above, a denial of
a request for jury trial can only be reviewed by a writ proceeding.  The automatic stay provided from under CCP
section 916 does not apply to writ proceedings. 
Thus, the automatic stay provision does not apply to any writ or appeal that
Yan Minkovitch has filed.  Absent a
discretionary stay by this Court or a stay by writ of supersedeas by the Court
of Appeal, the instant action is not stayed.
 
Yan Minkovitch does not provide any evidence
suggesting that the Court of Appeal has granted a writ of supersedeas or issued
a stay.  Nor has this Court received any
stay by writ of supersedeas from the Court of Appeal.  
 
Moreover, Yan Minkovitch fails to provide any basis
for why this Court should exercise its inherent power to stay the instant
action.  (See e.g., Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489, [“Trial courts generally have the inherent power to
stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial
efficiency.”].)
 
First, Yan Minkovitch fails
to indicate any merit to the appeal.  As
noted in the November 30, 2023 Order, long standing case law establishes that
interpleader actions are equitable actions and that there is no right to a jury
trial in such actions.  Yan Minkovitch
does not provide any reasoning indicating that the Court was erroneous in its
holding or that the Court of Appeal would overturn this long-standing precedent.
 
Second, any stay would be
plainly and extremely prejudicial.  As the
U.S. Supreme Court has explained, significant delay is
prejudicial as it results “the loss of evidence, including the inability of
witnesses to recall specific facts, or the possible death of a party.”  (Clinton v. Jones (1997) 520 U.S. 681, 708.)  Here, the instant action has been pending for
nearly six years since its initiation in 2018. 
There has been a pattern gamesmanship causing undue delay.
 
In sum, Yan Minkovitch fails to present any basis as
to why a stay should be issued in the instant action.  Accordingly, Yan Minkovitch’s motion for a
stay is DENIED.
