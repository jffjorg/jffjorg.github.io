  Case No.:  22STCV34215
 
  Hearing Date:  March 8, 2024
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER PERMITTING ALEXANDER J.
  DURST AS COUNSEL PRO HAC VICE 
 



 
Alexander J. Durst (“Durst”) applies
as counsel pro hac vice for Plaintiff
Ryan Gunches.  The application is unopposed.

Under CRC Rule 9.40, attorneys licensed and in
good standing in other states may, upon the California court’s approval, appear
as counsel pro hac vice in a pending
case if an active member of the state bar is associated as attorney of
record.  (CRC 9.40(a).)  Durst is an active
member, in good standing, of Ohio state courts, the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Ohio, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. (Durst Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.)  In addition, Durst states that he is not a
resident of California or regularly engaged in business in California.  (Durst Decl. ¶ 2.) Durst is a resident of Cincinnati,
Ohio with an office in Cincinnati, Ohio.  (Durst
Decl. ¶ 1.)  Durst states that states that he has not practiced
law in any manner in a California proceeding in the last two years.  (Durst Decl. ¶ 2.)  Thus, counsel satisfies the
eligibility requirements of CRC 9.40(a).
Durst’s application successfully addresses all six
content requirements outlined in CRC 9.40(d). 
Specifically, Durst provides
in his application: (1) his residence and office address (Durst
Decl. ¶ 1); (2) the courts to which Durst has been admitted to practice and the dates
of admission (Durst Decl. ¶ 3); (3) that Durst is a member in good standing in
those courts (Durst Decl. ¶ 4); (4) that he is not currently suspended or
disbarred in any court (Durst Decl. ¶ 5); (5) the title of each court and cause
in which the applicant has filed an application to appear as counsel pro
hac vice in this state in the preceding two years, and whether or not
it was granted if any (Durst Decl. ¶ 2); and (6) the name, address, and
telephone number of an active member, Theodore Monroe of the State Bar of
California who is the current counsel of record for Plaintiff Ryan Gunches (Durst
Decl. ¶ 6).
Furthermore, Durst demonstrates that he has met the requirement of CRC 9.40(c)(1). That rule
provides: “a person desiring to appear as counsel pro hac vice in a superior court must file with the court a
verified application together with proof of service . . . of a copy of the
application and of the notice on all parties who have appeared in the cause and
on the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office.”  (See Durst Decl. ¶¶ 7-8, Exh. A.)
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
The application of Alexander J. Durst to appear as counsel pro hac vice for Plaintiff Ryan Gunches is GRANTED.
Moving
Party is ordered to provide notice of this order and file proof of service of
such.
