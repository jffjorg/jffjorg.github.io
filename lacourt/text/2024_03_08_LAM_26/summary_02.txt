```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Yan Minkovitch's motion to stay the interpleader action pending appeal. The court finds that the automatic stay provision does not apply to writ proceedings, and therefore the action is not stayed. The court also finds that Yan Minkovitch has failed to present any basis for why a stay should be issued, as his appeal is based on a denial of a request for jury trial, which can only be reviewed by a writ proceeding. The court notes that any stay would be prejudicial and cause significant delay, and therefore denies the motion for a stay.
