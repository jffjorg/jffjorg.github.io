MOTIONS TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 
Hearing Date: 9/30/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV07412 MARISOL MERCADO
vs ALISON AGOSTI
Moving Party: Defendant Alison Agosti 
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTIONS TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 
ARE DENIED
 
On April 3, 2023,
Plaintiff filed her auto accident case. On March 12, 2024, Defendant Alison
Agosti propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set
One, and Requests for Production, Set One[1],
on Plaintiff. Defendant granted Plaintiff several extensions, and on May 6,
2024, Plaintiff served timely responses consisting solely of objections. The
deadline for Defendant to file her motion to compel further (MTCF) was
originally set for June 20, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the parties agreed to
extend Defendant’s MTCF deadline to July 22, 2024. (Exhibit G.) The last
communication between the parties, as presented in the moving papers, is an
email exchange in which Plaintiff’s counsel requested an indefinite extension
to provide discovery responses due to difficulties locating Plaintiff.
Defendant denied this request, stating, "I’ll have to file my motion, but
I will not request sanctions." (Exhibit H.) On August 28, 2024, Defendant
filed and served the present motions.
Defendant has demonstrated
an ongoing cooperative approach to this case. 
Unfortunately, Defendant waived her right to file the present motions.
"Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of
the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before
any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party
have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a
further response to the interrogatories.” (CCP 2030.300(c).)  Defendant and Plaintiff specifically agreed
to a date of July 22, 2024, to serve and file her motion.  She did not did not serve and file it until
August 28, 2024.  The motions are therefore
denied because they are late.  (See
Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410. (although
45-day limitation is not 'jurisdictional' in the fundamental sense, it is
'jurisdictional' in the sense that it renders the court without authority to
rule on motions to compel other than to deny them).) 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS
COUNSEL  
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel Astghikc Ghevondyan
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS
COUNSEL IS GRANTED.
 
Attorney Astghikc
Ghevondyan represents Plaintiff. Ghevondyan moves to be relieved as counsel,
citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and communication.
No opposition has been filed. ¿ 
The Court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398,
403-407.) 
¿       A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial
Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and
MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c),
(e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that
have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd.
(d).) 
Ghevondyan has filed
Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). Ghevondyan seeks to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship and communication. The Court finds this to be
proper grounds for withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188
Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is
grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw).)  
Counsel has expended
reasonable efforts in obtaining Plaintiff's mailing address by using TLO search
and hiring an investigator to locate Plaintiff. 
The next hearing is an
FSC set for 2/18/25, which should be sufficient time for Plaintiff to retain
new counsel. Alternatively, if Plaintiff or new counsel needs additional time
to prepare for trial, sufficient time exists for Plaintiff to take action to
seek a continuance of the trial. Thus, the present motion to be relieved as
counsel is GRANTED effective upon service on Plaintiff.
