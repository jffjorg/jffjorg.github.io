And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to deem its Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted against the plaintiff. The defendant served the requests on the plaintiff on May 17, 2024, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendant then moved to deem the contents of the requests admitted, and the judge has granted the motion. The plaintiff's failure to respond to the requests waived any objections it may have had, and the judge has deemed the contents of the requests admitted against the plaintiff.
