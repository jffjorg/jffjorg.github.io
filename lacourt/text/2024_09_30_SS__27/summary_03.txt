And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiff failed to pay jury fees in a timely manner, but promptly paid them after discovering the oversight. The defendant did not oppose the motion, and the court finds that granting relief would not result in serious hardship to the objecting party. The court cites relevant California law and case precedent, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 631(a), (c)(2), (f), and (g), and cases such as Mackovska v. Viewcrest Road Properties LLC and Boal v. Price Waterhouse & Co.
