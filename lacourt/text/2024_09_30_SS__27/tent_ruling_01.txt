Motion to Enforce Settlement¿¿ 
 
CCP § 664.6 states: “If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence
of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part
thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of
the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement.”¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Strict compliance with the statutory
requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement agreement
under this statute.¿ (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)¿ To
enforce a written settlement agreement under CCP section 664.6, the following
three elements must be met: (1) the parties must have come to a meeting of the
minds on all material points; (2) there must be a writing that contains the
material terms of the agreement; and (3) the writing must be signed by the
parties.¿ (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998)
60 Cal.App.4th 793, 797-98.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
CCP § 664.6 “require[s] the signatures of the
parties seeking to enforce the agreement under [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 664.6 and against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced.”¿ (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 974, 985.)¿ CCP §
664.6’s “requirement of a ‘writing signed by the parties’ must be read to apply
to all parties bringing the section 664.6 motion and against whom the motion is
directed.”¿ (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 299, 306; see Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman
Const., Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 35-37 [“A written settlement
agreement is not enforceable under section 664.6 unless it is signed by all of
the parties to the agreement, not merely the parties against whom the agreement
is sought to be enforced.”].)¿ “A
procedure in which a settlement is evidenced by one writing signed by both
sides minimizes the possibility of … dispute[s] and legitimizes the summary
nature of the section 664.6 procedure.”¿ (Robertson
v. Chen (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1293.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
Discussion
 
On January 28, 2021, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendant Inri
Jesus Diaz Encarnacion AKA Inri Encarnacion AKA Jesus Encarnacion AKA Jesus
Diaz for property damages in the sum of $33,036.02.
 
On May 23, 2022, the parties entered into a written Stipulation for
Entry of Judgment in which Defendant agreed to have judgment entered in
Plaintiff's favor in the sum of $33,036.02. Alliance United Insurance Company,
Defendant’s insurance carrier, paid a total of $6,935.43 for Defendant’s policy
limit. Defendant was required to pay a monthly amount of $50 under the
settlement agreement.
 
Defendant made monthly payments totaling $800.00 before stopping.
The last payment was made on March 25, 2024. On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff sent
Defendant a letter advising Defendant of the default but received no response.
Plaintiff now moves the Court to enforce the settlement agreement and enter
judgment against Defendant.
 
When the case was dismissed on June 13, 2022, the Court retained
jurisdiction to enforce the settlement under section 664.6, so there is no need
to set aside the dismissal. All requirements to enforce the settlement have
been met. There is a meeting of the minds on all material terms, including the
amount, scope, and payment terms of the settlement. The parties signed and filed
a stipulation containing all the material terms. The stipulation/agreement is
signed by all parties. Thus, the Court grants the present motion and enters
judgment in the amount of $33,036.02 against Defendant Inri Jesus Diaz
Encarnacion, less $7,735.43 for payments received, for a total amount due of
$25,300.59.
