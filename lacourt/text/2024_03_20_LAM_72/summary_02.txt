And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, CVD Diamond, Inc., seeks a default judgment against the defendants, Fair Gems, Inc. and Gidi Uzan, for an amount of $51,077.75. The plaintiff sold diamonds to the defendants on an open book account, but the defendants have refused to pay the outstanding amount of $36,615.84. The court continues the plaintiff's request for default judgment so that the plaintiff can correct its damages and interest calculations. The court notes that the plaintiff must calculate the requested interest as interest, and not as damages. The court also finds that the plaintiff has adequately pleaded its causes of action in the complaint and has provided sufficient evidence to support its damages and costs. The court orders the defendants to pay the outstanding amount, plus interest and costs, and grants the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees. The court also notes that the plaintiff must submit the original written agreement to the court in order to obtain a clerk's note across the face of the writing.
