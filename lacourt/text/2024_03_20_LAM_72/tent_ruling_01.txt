Background
 
Plaintiff licenses seating at the Arena, a sports and
entertainment venue in downtown Los Angeles.
 
On October 26, 2021, Plaintiff and Defendant entered a
licensing agreement (the “Agreement”) whereby Defendant licensed the use of a
premium lounge in exchange for annual licensing fees which Defendant was to pay
in installments on set dates.
 
On October 11, 2022 and October 25, 2022, Defendant failed
to pay installments that were then due under the Agreement. Defendant failed to
cure after being given notice under the Agreement. 
 
Plaintiff demanded that Defendant arbitrate the dispute with
JAMS, but Defendant refused. Plaintiff incurred some arbitration fees in
attempting to secure arbitration.
 
Plaintiff filed this case on October 19, 2023.
 
Defendant was served on November 1, 2023.
 
Default was entered against Defendant on December 4, 2023.
 
Plaintiff filed this request for default judgment on January
12, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7));
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the complaint
or cross-complaint.  (Molen v.
Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
             
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
            According
to the proof of service filed on November 7, 2023, Defendant was served on November
1, 2023 at 7533 S Center View Ct Ste R, West Jordan, Utah 84084-5526, via its
registered agent for service of process.
 
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed from the action on January
18, 2024, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Richard D. Buckley, Jr. avers to Defendant’s non-military
status.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in its Summary
of Case. Plaintiff adequately pleads its causes of action in the Complaint.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 580 prohibits the entry of
a default judgment in an amount in excess of that demanded in the complaint.”  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.) Moreover, “a statement of damages cannot be relied
upon to establish a plaintiff's monetary damages, except in cases of personal
injury or wrongful death.” (Ibid.) “In all other cases, when recovering
damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages
specified in the complaint.” (Ibid.)
 
The Agreement provides that Plaintiff shall be treated as a
lost-volume seller for damages which accrue while other lounges or premium
tables remain unlicensed. (Cockrell Decl. ¶ 14.) The lounges and premium tables
were not fully licensed for the 2022-2023 year and are not fully licensed for
the 2023-2024 year. (Cockrell Decl. ¶ 15.)
 
            Chris
Cockrell avers that $49,500.00 in license fees were outstanding when the
agreement was terminated on December 14, 2022. (Cockrell Decl. ¶ 17(A).) 
 
The Agreement also provides that license fees which would
have become due from the time of termination until a judgment is obtained on
the Agreement are also recoverable. (Cockrell Decl. ¶ 13.) Cockrell avers that
Defendant owes an additional $179,775.00 in that capacity. (Cockrell Decl. ¶
17(B).) 
 
Defendant also incurred $2,000.00 in
attempting to arbitrate the dispute pursuant to the Agreement. (Cockrell Decl.
¶ 17(D).)
 
Thus, the total amount of damages is $222,275.00.
 
 
Interest
 
The Complaint requests interest.
 
Richard D. Buckley, Jr. avers that the total interest owed
on the unpaid amount is $21,168.02 and provides his calculations. (Buckley
Decl. ¶ 8, 9.)
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff includes a memorandum of costs in the submitted
Form CIV-100, averring that it expended $592.75 in costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiff
does not seek attorney’s fees.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
has submitted a proposed form of judgment consistent with the foregoing.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
            California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation to pay money requires a clerk’s note across the face of the
writing that there has been a judgment. Here, Plaintiff has not submitted the
original documents. The Court does not discern any practical need for such a
clerk’s note on the written obligation in the current case and therefore orders
that it need not be included. If this causes any issues for any party or
non-party they are authorized to bring the matter to the Court’s
attention.  
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
