 Hearing Date:  March 20, 2024
 Calendar Number:  9



 
 
 
Plaintiff CVD Diamond, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) seeks default
judgment against Defendants Fair Gems, Inc. (“Fair Gems”) and Gidi Uzan (collectively,
“Defendants”).
 
Plaintiff requests:
 
(1) money judgment in the amount of $51,077.75, consisting
of:
 
(a) damages in the amount of $46,905.90;

 
(b) interest in the amount of $1,750.85;
 
(c) costs in the amount of $1,221.00;
and
 
(d) attorney’s fees in the amount
of $1,200.
 
The Court CONTINUES Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
so that Plaintiff may correct its damages and interest calculations in the
CIV-100 and JUD-100. Plaintiff must calculate requested interest as interest,
and not as damages.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff sold and delivered diamonds to Defendants on an
open book account. Defendants agreed to pay for the diamonds that they
purchased from Plaintiff. Defendant provided Plaintiff with a memorandum of
goods for each sale stating the cost. Defendants
owe an outstanding amount of $36,615.84. Plaintiff has demanded that Defendants
pay this amount, but Defendants have continually refused to pay.
 
Plaintiff filed this case on November 7, 2023.
 
Default was entered against Fair Gems on January 26, 2024.
Default was entered against Uzan on February 6, 2024.
 
Plaintiff filed this request for default judgment on
February 13, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7));
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
             
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
            Plaintiff
provides proofs of service indicating that Fair Gems and Uzan wer served on
December 15, 2023 via substitute service at 5713 Cedros Avenue, Van Nuys,
California 91411.
 
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed from the action on February
15, 2024, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Timothy Krantz avers to Defendants’ non-military status.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in the
Declaration of Alpesh Ramani. Plaintiff adequately pleads its causes of action
in the Complaint.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 580 prohibits the entry of
a default judgment in an amount in excess of that demanded in the complaint.”  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.) Moreover, “a statement of damages cannot be relied
upon to establish a plaintiff's monetary damages, except in cases of personal
injury or wrongful death.” (Ibid.) “In all other cases, when recovering
damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages
specified in the complaint.” (Ibid.)
 
            Alpesh
Ramani avers that Defendants owe a principal sum of $36,615.84. (Ramani Decl. ¶
13.)
 
Alpesh Ramani avers that the principal accrues contractual
interest at the rate of 1.5 percent per month from 90 days after each of the
invoices, totaling $10,290.06. (Ramani Decl. ¶ 14.) Plaintiff appears to
include this interest in its damages calculation. This figure must be included
under interest, and not damages, in the CIV-100 Form.
 
Interest
 
The Complaint requests interest.
 
Alpesh Ramani avers that the principal accrues contractual
interest at the rate of 1.5 percent per month from 90 days after each of the
invoices, totaling $10,290.06. (Ramani Decl. ¶ 14.) Plaintiff appears to
include this interest in its damages calculation. This figure must be included
under interest, and not damages, in the CIV-100 Form.
 
Timothy Krantz clarifies that the above interest ran from
the time of the invoices through the time when the Complaint was filed. (Krantz
Decl. at p. 2:1-5.) Krantz further declares that the requested prejudgment
interest accrued since the filing of the Complaint amounts to $1,750.85. 
 
Plaintiff may properly request these amounts, but they must
both be included in the interest calculations in the CIV-100 and JUD-100 forms,
and not in damages.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff includes a memorandum of costs in the submitted
Form CIV-100, averring that it expended $1,221.00 in costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
Plaintiff requests $1,200.00 in
attorney’s fees.
 
This is an action on a contract.
Because the judgment is between $10,000.01 and $50,000, the maximum recovery of
attorney’s fees is equal to $690 plus 3% of the excess over $10,000. (Local
Rule 3.214.)
 
            The
requested attorney’s fees are within this amount.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
has submitted a proposed form of judgment. The form must be corrected as
discussed under damages and interest.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
            California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation to pay money requires a clerk’s note across the face of the
writing that there has been a judgment. Here, Plaintiff has not submitted the
original documents. The Court does not discern any practical need for such a
clerk’s note on the written obligation in the current case and therefore orders
that it need not be included. If this causes any issues for any party or
non-party they are authorized to bring the matter to the Court’s
attention.  
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
