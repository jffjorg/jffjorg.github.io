BACKGROUND
            On March 11, 2019, American Express
National Bank filed a complaint against Leon Thompson aka Leon Thomspon Jr for
common counts.  
            On July 9, 2019, the parties
stipulated and the court ordered that the case be dismissed and that the court
retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP §664.6.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Pursuant to CCP §664.6:  “If parties to pending litigation stipulate,
in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” 
“Section 664.6 was enacted to
provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract
without the need for a new lawsuit.”  Chan v. Lund (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165-66 (quoting Weddington Productions,
Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809-10).  Under CCP
§664.6, a court may determine disputed factual issues regarding the settlement
agreement and even permits the court “to entertain challenges to the actual
terms of the stipulation, that is, whether there actually was a settlement . .
. and to interpret the terms of the settlement agreement.”  Fiore
v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal. App. 3d 561, 566. 
DISCUSSION
            Under CCP §664.6, plaintiff American
Express National Bank requests an order to set aside and vacate the dismissal
and enter judgment against defendant Leon Thompson aka Leon Thomspon Jr in the
amount of $31,446.82.
            On July 9, 2019, the case was
dismissed, and the court retained jurisdiction under CCP §664.6.
            Plaintiff explains that the parties
entered into a settlement agreement on May 15, 2019.  As set forth in the agreement, defendant
agreed that defendant was indebted to plaintiff in the amount of $42,278.83 on
defendant’s account ending 1008 and $10,004.99 on defendant’s account ending
3006, for a total of $52,283.82. 
Paragraph 5 of the agreement states that the court can enter a judgment
for $52,283.82 less credits for any payments made if defendant fails to make
payments consistent with the agreement. 
The repayment schedule was set forth in paragraph 6.  Plaintiff asserts that defendant has failed
to make payments consistent with the agreement, and that defendant has not made
a payment since at least May 2021.  On
November 17, 2021, plaintiff’s counsel sent a cure letter to defendant.  Defendant has not cured the default.  Defendant has made payments totaling
$21,400.  See Scott Dyle decl.
            Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.

aside and vacated.  Judgment is entered
in the amount of $31,446.82 in favor of plaintiff and against defendant.  See judgment.
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
