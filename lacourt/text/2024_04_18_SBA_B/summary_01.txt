And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to vacate the conditional dismissal and enter judgment in favor of American Express National Bank (Plaintiff) against Leon Thompson (Defendant). The case was previously dismissed on July 9, 2019, with the court retaining jurisdiction under CCP ยง664.6. The parties stipulated to a settlement agreement on May 15, 2019, which required Defendant to repay $52,283.82. However, Defendant has failed to make payments consistent with the agreement, and Plaintiff's counsel sent a cure letter in November 2021. Since Defendant has not cured the default, the court grants the motion and enters judgment in the amount of $31,446.82 in favor of Plaintiff.
