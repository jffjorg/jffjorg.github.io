English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment in a case involving a tenancy at will. The plaintiff, Adrienne L. Spruth, requested summary judgment on the ground that there is no triable issue of fact and as a matter of law, the plaintiff prevails. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, Mark J. Spruth, occupied the premises at 26202 Grayslake Road, Rancho Palos Verdes, California 90275, as a tenant at will from June 30, 2019. The plaintiff served the defendant with a 30-day notice to quit on July 15, 2021, but the defendant failed to vacate the premises. The court found that the plaintiff had met her burden of showing that there is no defense to the unlawful detainer cause of action based on tenancy at will, and granted the motion for summary judgment. The court awarded the plaintiff judgment for possession of the property and $165,000 in holdover damages plus costs.
