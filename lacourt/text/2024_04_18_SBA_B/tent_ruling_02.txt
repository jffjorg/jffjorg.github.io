BACKGROUND
            On August 20, 2021, plaintiff
Adrienne L. Spruth filed an unlawful detainer complaint against Mark J. Spruth
based on tenancy at will and a 30-day notice to quit as to property at 26202
Grayslake Road, Rancho Palos Verdes. 
On October 8, 2021, the court
denied defendant’s motion to quash service of summons.
On December 17, 2021, the court
sustained with leave to amend defendant’s demurrer as to proper service of the
30-day notice to quit.
On December 22, 2021, plaintiff
filed a FAC.
On June 9, 2023, Dept. 1 declined
to relate the herein case with probate law case 21STPB12155.
On October 12, 2023, the court
granted plaintiff’s motion to reclassify the case to an unlimited civil case.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
The purpose of a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.
“On a motion for summary judgment,
the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing
that there are no triable issues of material fact.”  Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.  “A plaintiff or cross-complainant has met his
or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that
party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to
judgment on the cause of action.  Once
the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts to
the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto. The
defendant or cross-defendant shall not rely upon the allegations or denials of
its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,
instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of
material fact exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.”
“When deciding whether to grant
summary judgment, the court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the
papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection), as well
as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light
most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.”  Avivi
v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 463, 467.  “’An issue of fact can only be created by a
conflict in the evidence.  It is not
created by speculation, conjecture, imagination or guesswork.’”  Lyons
v. Security Pacific National Bank (1995) 40 Cal. App. 4th 1001, 1014
(citation omitted).
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff Adrienne Spruth requests
summary judgment on the ground that there is no triable issue of fact and as a
matter of law, plaintiff prevails.
            The FAC alleges that plaintiff’s
interest in the premises at 26202 Grayslake Road, Rancho Palos Verdes,
California 90275 is as owner.  On June
30, 2019, defendant agreed to rent the premises as a tenancy at will.  The oral agreement was made with
plaintiff.  Defendant was served with a
30-day notice to quit on July 15, 2021. The fair rental value of the premises
is $166.67 per day.  Plaintiff requests
damages from August 17, 2021.
“A tenant of real property, for a
term less than life, . . . is guilty of unlawful detainer:  1. 
When he or she continues in possession, in person or by subtenant, of
the property, or any part thereof, after the expiration of the term for which
it is let to him or her; . . . but in case of a tenancy at will, it must first
be terminated by notice, as prescribed in the Civil Code.”  CCP §1161.
Tenancy at will “is an estate which
simply confers a right to the possession of premises leased for such indefinite
period as both parties shall determine such possession shall continue. . . .
The tenant at will is in possession by right with consent of the landlord
either express or implied, and he does not begin to hold unlawfully until the
termination of his tenancy.  His estate
is a leasehold and he holds in subordination to the title of the
landlord.’  And ‘A permission occupation
of real estates, where no rent is reserved or paid and no time agreed on to
limit the occupation, is a tenancy at will.’” 
Covina Manor, Inc. v. Hatch (1955) 133 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 790,
792.   “A tenancy or other estate at
will, however created, may be terminated by the landlord’s giving notice in
writing to the tenant, in the manner prescribed by Section 1162 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, to remove him from the premises within a period of not less
than 30 days, to be specified in the notice.” 
Civil Code §789.   
            Plaintiff presents evidence that
defendant began to occupy the premises as a tenant at will on June 30,
2019.  Plaintiff’s decl., ¶¶7-9.  On January 13, 2021, plaintiff acquired
ownership of the premises from the Trust. 
Plaintiff’s decl., ¶12.  On July
15, 2021, plaintiff terminated defendant’s tenancy at will at the premises by
causing a written 30-day notice to quit to be served upon defendant by posting
and mailing.  Plaintiff’s decl., ¶14,
Exhs. 1-2; defendant’s depo., at 45-46. 
Defendant failed to vacate the premises pursuant to the notice to quit,
and continues to occupy the premises.  Plaintiff’s
decl., ¶15.  The fair rental value of the
premises is $5,000 a month, or $166.67 a day. 
Plaintiff’s decl., ¶16; defendant’s depo., at 105.  See Plaintiff’s Separate Statement.
            Plaintiff states in her declaration
that for many years the premises was the residence of her mother, Dolores L.
Spruth, who passed away in 2017, and that the time of her passing, the premises
was part of Dolores’ Trust.  Plaintiff’s
decl., ¶¶3-4.  Dolores was survived by
her four children:  plaintiff, defendant,
Steven Spruth (trustee of the Trust), and Scott Spruth (who passed away in
2021).  Id., ¶5.  During the period between Dolores’ death and
June 30, 2019, no one was residing at the premises and title was still in the
name of the Trust.  Id., ¶6.  On June 30, 2019, plaintiff was visiting the
premises with Steve and other family members, when defendant appeared at the
premises without prior notice.  Id., ¶7.  Defendant, plaintiff, and Steve discussed
whether defendant could stay at the premises temporarily, and Steve and
plaintiff agreed to let defendant stay at the premises under a temporary living
arrangement.  Id., ¶8.  A rental agreement was never entered into,
and defendant never paid rent.  Id., ¶9.  On January 13, 2021, plaintiff acquired
ownership of the premises from the Trust. 
Id., ¶12.
            There is no opposition.
            The court finds that plaintiff has
met her burden that there is no defense to the unlawful detainer cause of
action based on tenancy at will because she has proved each element.  The court calculates holdover damages in the
amount of $165,000 ($5,000 x 33 months).
            The motion is GRANTED.
 
ORDER
            The motion for summary judgment is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff is awarded judgment
for possession of the property and $165,000 in holdover damages plus costs.
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
