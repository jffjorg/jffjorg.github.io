And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the motion to compel arbitration filed by defendants Scott Hoffner and Jon Rodriguez. The arbitration agreement provides that Ecolab and its subsidiaries, including the defendants, are bound by the agreement. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants were agents, employees, or joint employers of other defendants and acted within the scope of their agency or employment. The judge notes that the plaintiff does not assert that the defendants propounded discovery or noticed depositions, and that the defendants filed an ex parte application for an order shortening time to hear their motion to compel arbitration. The judge is considering the plaintiff's argument that the defendants have waived their right to arbitration, citing the case of Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., which held that a finding of harm is essential for waiver of the right to arbitrate. The judge will consider the plaintiff's opposition and make a final ruling on the motion to compel arbitration.
