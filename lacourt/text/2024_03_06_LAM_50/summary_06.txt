And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck approximately 24 years ago, which developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price without litigation. The judge does not believe her experience will bias her in this case, but she allows any party to file a verified statement of disqualification within 14 calendar days if they believe otherwise. The Case Management Conference will be continued to May 31, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement. The plaintiff is ordered to notify any new parties added to the case and file proof of service with a courtesy copy to the court.
