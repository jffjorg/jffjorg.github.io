And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs, but reducing the amount to $40,860.94. The plaintiff is entitled to this amount because they have already won a judgment against the defendant and are now seeking to recover the costs of enforcing that judgment. The judge has reviewed the evidence and finds that the plaintiff's work was reasonable and necessary, and that the costs they incurred were necessary to enforce the judgment. The judge is awarding the plaintiff $37,635.00 in attorney fees and $3,225.94 in costs, plus an additional $1,300.00 for fees incurred in court appearance and reply to the motion.
