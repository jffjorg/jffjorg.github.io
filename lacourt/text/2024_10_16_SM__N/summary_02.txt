And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to consolidate related actions brought by defendant Antonio Alcazar Barragan. The motion is granted in part, with the present case (Case No. 23SMCV02234) being consolidated with two other related cases (Case Nos. 23SMCV02935 and 23STCV15212) for pretrial purposes only. The consolidated cases will involve common questions of law and fact, and will promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of procedure. The judge notes that the cases share common issues of law and fact, and that consolidation will save time and costs and avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts. The ruling does not address the issue of whether the cases should be consolidated for trial, and defendant or any other party may renew the request at a later date.
