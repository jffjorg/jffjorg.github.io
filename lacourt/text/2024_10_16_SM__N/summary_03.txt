And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is sustained, with 30 days leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff, Courtney Johntrell Rawls, must revise the complaint to address the issues raised by the defendant. The judge has assumed that the allegations in the complaint are true, but has not considered any extrinsic evidence presented by the defendant.

The judge has also noted that the alleged assault by the defendant's employee may have been made possible by the circumstances of the examination, but that the employee's decision to engage in the assault did not arise out of the performance of the examination. The judge has concluded that the defendant is not liable for the alleged assault under a respondeat superior theory, as the employee's conduct was not foreseeable and was not connected to their work.

The judge has also rejected the plaintiff's claims of negligent hiring, retention, or supervision, as the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant had reason to believe that the employee was unfit or that the defendant knowingly hired an unfit employee. The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to revise the complaint and has instructed that any revisions must be made in accordance with the court's order and may not add new parties or causes of action without permission.
