Ruling: Deny 
 
TENTATIVE 
 
The Court excuses the personal
appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by
telephone or video conference call. 
 
The petition
states that Defendants Coastal R.O. and Kim + Casey Property Management are the
settling defendants; however, in the proposed judgment, only Coastal R.O. is
listed as the settling defendant. Petitioner needs to fix this discrepancy.
 
Section 8a(4) of the
proposed judgment is checked but not filled in.
The terms of the
settlement in attachment 8b(2) and the settlement with Kaas Settlement
Consulting are inconsistent. Petitioner is ordered to explain the discrepancy.
Petitioner is further ordered to clarify how and when attorney's fees, medical
expenses, and costs will be paid from the settlement, as attachment 8b(2)
states that $131,708.00 will be paid upon initial settlement, but the fees and
expenses from the settlement or judgment exceed $189,000.00.
Petitioner is hereby ordered to
correct the deficiencies noted above no less than 5 days prior to the new court
date set below. Failure to do so may result in sanctions.¿
