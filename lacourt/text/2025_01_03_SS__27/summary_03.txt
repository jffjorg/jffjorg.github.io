And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to approve the minor's compromise due to several issues. The petitioner needs to fix a discrepancy between the petition and the proposed judgment, which only lists one defendant as a settling party. The terms of the settlement are also inconsistent, and the petitioner must explain the discrepancy. Additionally, the petitioner must clarify how and when attorney's fees, medical expenses, and costs will be paid from the settlement, as the proposed judgment exceeds the amount to be paid initially. The petitioner is ordered to correct these deficiencies at least 5 days before the new court date, failure to which may result in sanctions.
