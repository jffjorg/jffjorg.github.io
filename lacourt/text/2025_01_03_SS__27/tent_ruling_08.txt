[TENATIVE]
  MOTION TO REOPEN DISCOVERY IS GRANTED
 
 




 


)


 



 
Background
On
January 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the present slip-and-fall case against
Defendant Ralphs Grocery Company, alleging that she slipped on a floor in the
store's deli section, which was wet and covered with corn kernels in front of
the hot food bar where corn is served to customers. On July 18, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved, and Plaintiff has been proceeding in pro per
since. On November 15, 2024, the Court continued the trial from November 19,
2024, to April 9, 2025. However, the pretrial deadlines remained closed and
were not extended to align with the new trial date. Plaintiff now requests that
the Court reopen discovery to follow the new trial date. Defendant Ralphs filed
an opposition. 
 
Legal Standard
“The purpose of imposing a time limit
on discovery is to expedite and facilitate trial preparation and to prevent
delay.¿ Without a cutoff date, the parties
could tie up each other and the trial court in discovery and discovery disputes
right up to the eve of trial or beyond. Furthermore, . . . to be effective the
cutoff date must be firm or some litigants will manipulate the proceedings to
avoid the cut-off date.”¿ (Beverly Hosp. v. Superior Court¿(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1289, 1295.)  The reopening of discovery is a matter that is committed to
the trial court’s sound discretion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050(a), (b).)¿ In exercising that discretion, the
trial court considers “any matter relevant to the leave
requested,” including:¿ 
(1)  
The
necessity and the reasons for the discovery.¿ 
(2)  The diligence or lack of diligence of the
party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the
reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was
not heard earlier.¿ 
(3)  Any likelihood that permitting the discovery
or hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on
the date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in
prejudice to any other party.¿ 
(4)  The length of time that has elapsed between
any date previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the
action.¿ 
        (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2024.050(b).)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff
alleges that she recently obtained a video recording from her former attorneys,
which purportedly shows the store’s condition one hour before her fall. She
contends that the video is crucial in proving the existence and duration of the
hazardous condition (corn kernels and water on the floor) and Defendant’s
knowledge of it. Plaintiff seeks to propound new discovery requests related to
this video and obtain expert analysis. Additionally, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant has not fully complied with prior discovery requests, specifically
regarding maintenance logs, safety procedures, and records of prior similar
incidents. She requests the production of these documents. Plaintiff further
seeks to serve additional requests for production related to store maintenance,
cleaning procedures, and safety protocols that she believes were inadequately
addressed during prior discovery. Plaintiff also wishes to depose additional
witnesses, including Defendant’s expert witnesses.
In
opposition, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s recent discovery requests,
including the 3rd set of requests for production and 2nd set of special
interrogatories, are largely duplicative of discovery previously propounded by
Plaintiff’s prior counsel and already responded to by Defendant. Defendant
asserts that extensive discovery has been completed, and Plaintiff’s former
counsel served significant discovery before being relieved. Defendant further
argues that Plaintiff had ample opportunity to complete discovery both while
represented by counsel and after proceeding in pro per in July 2024. Despite
this, Plaintiff failed to notice any depositions of Defendant’s employees or
expert witnesses and waited until September 11, 2024, to serve duplicative production
demands.
Analysis
In considering the arguments from both
sides, the Court acknowledges that Defendant’s opposition raises some valid
points. However, in the context of Plaintiff being without counsel as of July
18, 2024, and needing to familiarize herself with the facts of the case,
procedural requirements, court processes, and applicable law within a short
timeframe of just three months before the discovery cut-off date, the Court
finds sufficient justification to reopen discovery under these circumstances.
Plaintiff has demonstrated the necessity
of requested discovery. Specifically, key depositions, including Defendant’s
deposition and expert depositions, remain outstanding. Additionally, Plaintiff
recently obtained video footage of the premises showing the condition of the
store one hour prior to the incident, which she had not previously reviewed.
Plaintiff is entitled to conduct discovery related to this newly acquired
evidence to fully develop her case. Moreover, denying Plaintiff the opportunity
to depose Defendant’s expert witnesses, particularly when Defendant has already
deposed Plaintiff’s expert, would result in undue prejudice to Plaintiff, who
is navigating legal requirements on a relatively short time frame.
As to diligence, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff, despite being without counsel since July 2024, waited until
September 11, 2024, to serve additional discovery requests, and that some
discovery requests were not served after the October 2024 discovery cut-off
date. However, the Court recognizes that Plaintiff, as a self-represented
litigant, faced significant challenges in navigating complex legal procedures. Plaintiff
had to familiarize herself with the details of the case, review discovery
responses previously provided by Defendant, and attempt to obtain new legal
representation during this period.
Given the circumstances, the Court finds
that Plaintiff acted with reasonable diligence. Moreover, Plaintiff’s efforts
to serve discovery, pursue necessary depositions, and file the present motion
demonstrate her intent to advance the case rather than cause unnecessary delay.
Furthermore, trial is currently set for
March 10, 2025, and reopening discovery at this stage will not disrupt the
trial schedule or prevent the case from proceeding as planned. Defendant has
indicated that the majority of discovery has already been completed, and the
remaining discovery is limited in scope. The time period before trial is
sufficient for Plaintiff to conduct the requested discovery. However, on that
same basis, the Court emphasizes that it will be reluctant to grant any further
continuances of the trial or additional reopening of discovery beyond what is
currently requested.  All pretrial
deadlines will follow the present trial date.
