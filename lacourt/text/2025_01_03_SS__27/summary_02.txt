And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to transfer venue filed by Defendant Maximillian A. Huff. The case was filed by Plaintiff Alisa Garth on November 17, 2020, and the Defendant filed an answer on February 4, 2021. The Defendant seeks to transfer the venue to San Diego County, citing the convenience of witnesses.

The Judge finds that the motion was not made within a reasonable time and would not promote the ends of justice. The Court notes that the case has been pending for over four years, and the Defendant has failed to identify specific non-party witnesses, their locations, or their availability. The Judge also finds that granting the motion at this late stage would cause a delay in the trial and potentially push the action beyond the five-year statutory deadline, which could result in dismissal.

The Judge denies the motion and will consider it if a party intends to submit a written argument.
