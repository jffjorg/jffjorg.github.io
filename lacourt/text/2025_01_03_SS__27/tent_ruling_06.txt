[1] This dispute
regarding which gun Finley fired is one of the issues Plaintiff points to as a
basis to deny summary judgment, arguing that it is one of several disputed
facts that need to be decided by a jury. 
But, it, like others Plaintiff contends require the insight of a jury,
is immaterial to the issue of whether Defendants had a duty.  And, duty (or, more accurately, lack thereof)
is the basis for the Court’s ruling.
