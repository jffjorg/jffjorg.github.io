And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Defendant) has moved to compel initial responses from Plaintiff Gladys Portillo in Case No. 22STCV29888. The Defendant served the Plaintiff with form and special interrogatories on September 25, 2024, but the Plaintiff has failed to serve responses. The Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $2,350, which the Court reduces to $1,000 due to the Plaintiff's failure to act with substantial justification. The Court grants the motion and orders the Plaintiff to serve complete and verified responses within 20 days. The Plaintiff is also ordered to pay the reduced sanctions of $1,000 to the Defendant within 20 days.
