```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed by Hirschfeld Kraemer, the law firm representing Cartage West, Inc. The firm cites a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and nonpayment of attorney fees as the reason for seeking to withdraw as counsel. The judge notes that the firm has filed the required forms and has personally served the client with the motion papers, but not the defendant. However, the proof of service shows that the motion was served electronically, and there is no evidence that the defendant actually received service, particularly given that the defendant is not responding to communications. The judge also notes that trial is set for January 7, 2025, only four days away, and that withdrawing as counsel at this time would result in prejudice and disrupt the orderly process of justice. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to be relieved as counsel.
