And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed a motion filed by Attorney Anthony T. Nehme to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Charles Edward Anderson. Nehme cites an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship as the reason for his request. Since there is no opposition to the motion, the court will hear from the parties regarding the potential prejudice to Plaintiff, particularly with an upcoming hearing set for February 27, 2025. The court notes that Nehme has properly filed the required forms and seeks to withdraw as counsel. However, the court is concerned about the potential impact on the case and will consider the parties' input before making a final decision.
