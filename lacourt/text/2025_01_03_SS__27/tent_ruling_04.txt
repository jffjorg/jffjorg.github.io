CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV28004
CHARLES EDWARD ANDERSON vs. HERTZ Corporation, et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel
Anthony T. Nehme
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: COURT
WILL HEAR FROM THE PARTIES
 
Background 
 
Attorney Anthony T. Nehme
represents Plaintiff. Nehme moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an
irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has
been filed. 
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion¿ 
¿ 
Nehme has filed Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). Nehme seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff on the
grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. (See Estate of
Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw).)  
 
The Court
notes that within the past 30 days, Plaintiff's address was confirmed to be
current by counsel through a phone call. The next hearing is an MSJ set for 2/27/25.  The Court is concerned that granting this
motion at this time given the upcoming MSJ would be prejudicial to
Plaintiff.  The Court will hear from the
parties regarding this concern.
