And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Plaintiff's Counsel, Joseph Nazarian, to be relieved as counsel. Nazarian cited an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship as the reason for his motion. No opposition was filed.

The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and this motion is granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. Nazarian has filed the required forms and declarations to support his motion.

The Court notes that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is a proper ground for allowing the attorney to withdraw, and that sufficient time exists before the next hearing (set for April 29, 2025) for Plaintiff to retain new counsel. Therefore, the motion is granted effective upon service on Plaintiff.

Please note that this is a tentative ruling, and parties may submit or appear at the hearing on January 3, 2025, to argue the motion. If all parties submit, the Court may adopt the tentative ruling as the final order.
