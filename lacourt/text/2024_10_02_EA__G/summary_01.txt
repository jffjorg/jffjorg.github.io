  - "To establish a prima facie case of harassment, [Plaintiff] must show that (1) [Plaintiff] is a member of a protected class; (2) [Plaintiff] was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on [Plaintiff's] protected status; (4) the harassment unreasonably interfered with [Plaintiff's] work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (5) defendants are liable for the harassment."

Summary:
The judge has granted the County's motion for summary judgment or adjudication as to the first, fourth, fifth, and ninth causes of action. The first cause of action for harassment based on race fails because Simpson cannot establish severe or pervasive conduct. The fourth and fifth causes of action for racial and age discrimination fail because Simpson cannot establish a prima facie case, the County had legitimate reasons for its actions, and Simpson lacks substantial evidence of pretext. The ninth cause of action for failure to prevent harassment and discrimination in violation of FEHA fails because Simpson's underlying harassment and discrimination claims fail.
