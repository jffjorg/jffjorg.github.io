And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Plaintiff Juan Zhao against Defendant Min Zhou's Answer to the First Amended Complaint is continued to a date to be determined at the hearing in Department G (Pomona). The judge also orders Plaintiff's counsel to meet and confer with Defendant's counsel regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts, including the means by which the meet-and-confer took place, at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing on the demurrer. The judge's ruling is based on the parties' failure to adequately meet and confer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41.
