BACKGROUND
This is a premises liability action. Defendants
Pomona Office Tower LLC (Pomona Office Tower); WG Kupka LLC (WG Kupka); and
Mike Han, doing business as Pacific Commercial Co., are the alleged owners,
possessors, or lessors of a commercial property in Pomona. In January 2021,
Plaintiff Joseph Michael Parslow slipped and fell on a wet floor at the Pomona
property.
On October 26, 2022, Plaintiffs Joseph Parslow and Donna
Parslow filed a complaint against Pomona Office Tower, WG Kupka, Han, and Does
1-100, alleging causes of action for (1) negligence and (2) loss of consortium.
On November 29, 2022, Pomona Office Tower filed a
cross-complaint against Han and Roes 1-50, alleging causes of action for (1)
indemnification, (2) apportionment of fault, and (3) declaratory relief.
On December 27, 2022, the Parslows amended the Complaint to
replace Doe 1 with Defendant Jamison Services, Inc. (Jamison Inc.) and Doe 2
with Jamison Services, LP (Jamison LP).
On July 26, 2023, Jamison Inc. filed a cross-complaint
against Han and Roes 1-50, alleging causes of action for (1) indemnification,
(2) apportionment of fault, and (3) declaratory relief.
On September 9, 2024, Joseph Parslow filed the present
motion. A hearing on Parslow’s motion is set for October 2, 2024, with a
further status conference re: informal discovery conference on November 6,
2024, and a post-mediation status conference/trial setting conference on
December 4, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Joseph
Parslow moves to deem requests for admissions admitted against Jamison Inc. In
addition, Joseph Parslow seeks sanctions.
Legal Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivisions (b) and (c) allow the
requesting party to file a motion requesting that the truth of any matters
specified in the request for admissions be deemed admitted unless the party to
whom the requests have been directed has served a response that is in
substantial compliance before the hearing. A response to requests for
admissions is timely if provided within 30 days of service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250.) Monetary sanctions must be imposed pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c) for failure to timely respond to
requests for admissions. While the imposition of sanctions is mandatory, the
court “has discretion to reduce the amount of fees and costs requested as a
discovery sanction in order to reach a reasonable award.” (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791 (Cornerstone).)
Discussion
On May
7, 2024, Joseph Parslow’s counsel electronically served on Jamison Inc. a first
set of request for admissions. (Wong Decl., ¶ 3.) After Jamison Inc. failed to
provide timely responses, Joseph Parslow’s counsel sent another request for
responses on July 9, 2024, that gave Jamison Inc. until July 19, 2024, to
reply. (Wong Decl., ¶ 5.) In response to Jamison Inc.’s promise to provide
responses as soon as possible, Joseph Parslow gave Jamison Inc. an additional
extension to respond by July 26, 2024. (Wong Decl., ¶ 6-7.) After Jamison Inc.
failed to provide responses by the new deadline, Joseph Parslow filed a request
for an informal discovery conference on July 29, 2024. (Wong Decl., ¶ 8-9.) At
an informal discovery conference on August 27, 2024, the court ordered Jamison
Inc. to provide verified responses without objection on or before September 6,
2024. (Wong Decl., ¶ 14-17.) While Jamison Inc. provided responses on September
6, 2024, their responses included objections and lacked verifications. (Wong
Decl., ¶ 20-21.)
In
opposition, Jamison Inc.’s counsel states Jamison Inc. served the required
verifications for their responses on September 9, 2024. (Vega Zamudio Decl., ¶ 9-10.)
Although the responses include objections despite such objections being waived,
the court finds Jamison Inc. has served responses in substantial compliance
before the hearing on the present motion. Thus, the court deems Joseph
Parslow’s motion MOOT.
Sanctions
Joseph
Parslow also requests an award of sanctions for the present motion. To the
extent Joseph Parslow requests issue and evidentiary sanctions, the court finds
they are not warranted. Nevertheless, since Jamison Inc. failed to respond timely
to Joseph Parslow’s request for admissions, the court finds Joseph Parslow is
entitled to mandatory sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280, subdivision (c). Accordingly, utilizing a lodestar approach and in
view of the totality of the circumstances, the court awards sanctions and finds
reasonable attorney fees and costs in the total of amount of $847.50 ($787.50
for 3.0 hours drafting the moving/reply papers and 0.5 hours attending the
hearing at an hourly rate of $225.00, plus $60.00 in filing fees).
