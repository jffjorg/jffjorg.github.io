And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in plain English:

The court has made a preliminary decision on a motion filed by Joseph Parslow, the plaintiff in a premises liability case. The motion asked the court to deem certain requests for admissions (which are like written questions) as admitted by the defendant, Jamison Services, Inc. The plaintiff also requested issue and evidentiary sanctions, and monetary sanctions.

The court has denied the motion to deem the requests for admissions admitted because Jamison Services, Inc. has now provided responses to those requests, even if they are late. However, the court has granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions because Jamison Services, Inc. failed to provide timely responses to the requests for admissions. The court has ordered Jamison Services, Inc. to pay the plaintiff $847.50 in sanctions.
