And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of his complaint. The plaintiff's counsel, Nicholas Dagher, had failed to appear for a case management conference and an OSC Re: Dismissal on September 3, 2024, due to personal and technical issues. The judge does not fault Dagher for prioritizing the care of his daughter over attending the hearing in person, but finds that Dagher should have attempted to call the court directly prior to the hearing. The judge finds that relief is warranted based on Dagher's sworn affidavit attesting to his mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect.

The judge also orders Dagher to pay $742.50 in attorney fees to the defendants, Amador and JR Express, for their attendance at the case management conference, drafting an opposition to the motion, and attending the hearing. The fees are payable within 30 days of the issuance of the order.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of his complaint and orders the plaintiff's counsel to pay attorney fees to the defendants.
