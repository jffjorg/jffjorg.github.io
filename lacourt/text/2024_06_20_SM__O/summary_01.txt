And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, sustaining the demurrer to Citadel's cross-complaint without leave to amend. The demurrer is based on the argument that Citadel's claim for professional negligence fails to state a cause of action. The judge found that Citadel did not plead a fiduciary duty between itself and City National Bank, and that the relationship between a bank and its depositor is contractual, not fiduciary. Additionally, the judge ruled that Citadel did not plead damages beyond purely economic loss, which is barred by the economic loss rule. The judge did not grant Citadel leave to amend the complaint because the plaintiff did not show how amending the complaint would state a cause of action.
