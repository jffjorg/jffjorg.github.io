I.               
General Demurrer to Cross-Plaintiff’s Claim for
Professional Negligence – SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
            To state a cause of action for professional
negligence, a party must show “(1) the duty of the professional to use such
skill, prudence and diligence as other members of the profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) breach of that duty; (3) a causal connection between
the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage
resulting from the professional negligence.” (Giacometti v. Aulla, LLC
(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1137, citing 
Nichols v. Keller (1993)
15 Cal.App.4th 1672, 1682, 19 Cal.Rptr.2d 601.) “The threshold element of a
cause of action for negligence is the existence of a duty to use due care
toward an interest of another that enjoys legal protection against
unintentional invasion.” (Bily v. Arthur Young & Co. (1992) 3
Cal.4th 370, 397, 11 Cal.Rptr.2d 51, 834 P.2d 745 (Bily ).) “Where there
is no legal duty, the issue of professional negligence cannot be pled because
with the absence of a breach of duty, an essential element of the cause of
action for professional negligence is missing.” (Major Clients Agency v.
Diemer (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1132, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 613.) In this case,
the duty element is the employees' obstacle.
 
            The
relationship between a bank and its depositor is not fiduciary in character
but, rather, founded on contract, [citation] which is ordinarily memorialized
by a signature card that the depositor signs upon opening the account. (Kurtz-Ahlers,
LLC v. Bank of America, N.A. (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 952, 956, citing Chazen
v. Centennial Bank (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 532, 537 [“banks ‘are not
fiduciaries for their depositors’ ”].)
 
            Citadel does
not state facts to claim a fiduciary duty exists between CNB and Citadel.
Citadel alleges: 
 
Cross-Defendant acted in a fiduciary capacity
for Cross-Complainant, in which Cross-Complainant entrusted large amounts of
funds to Cross-Defendant for the purpose of managing and paying employees and
bills from their accounts. This includes making payments to the Credit Card and
Promissory Note.
 
(Cross-Complaint, ¶ 7.)
 
            A fiduciary duty is generally not
created between a bank and a customer as a depositor, rather this relationship
is usually “founded on contract, [citation] which is ordinarily
memorialized by a signature card that the depositor signs upon opening the
account.” (Chazen, supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at p. 537.) “This
contractual relationship does not involve any implied duty to supervise account
activity [citation] or to inquire into the purpose for which the
funds are being used” (Ibid.) In order to state a claim that a fiduciary
duty exists Citadel needs to allege more facts that would give rise to a
fiduciary relationship between a bank and a customer. (See Chazen v.
Centennial Bank (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 532, 540 [”banks may in some extreme
circumstances engage in wrongdoing affecting a fiduciary account that would
merit the imposition of liability.”]


            Additionally,
Citadel does not plead damages beyond purely economic loss for their negligence
claim. The economic loss rule states, “[i]n general, there is no recovery in
tort for negligently inflicted “purely economic losses,” meaning financial harm
unaccompanied by physical or property damage.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 922, reh'g denied (June 1, 2022).)
This economic loss rule bars “claims in negligence for pure economic losses in
deference to a contract between litigating parties.” (Ibid.)
 
            Citadel
pleads: 


“Cross-Defendants multiple breaches
caused significant damages to Cross-Complainant as they could not pay their
employees or their bills, resulting in the foreclosure issue brought by
Cross-Defendant in this action”
 
(Cross-Claim, ¶ 31.)
 
            Not being able to pay “employees or
their bill” is pure economic loss, and Citadel does not allege any non-monetary
harm within the cross-complaint. Furthermore, Citadel does not plead a “special
relationship” to circumvent the economic loss rule. (See Sheen, supra,
12 Cal.5th at p. 938 [“Where a special relationship exists between the
parties, a plaintiff may recover for loss of expected economic advantage
through the negligent performance of a contract although the parties were not
in contractual privity”]; see also Greystone Homes, Inc. v. Midtec, Inc.
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1229 [“Determining whether such a relationship
exists involves an examination of the following criteria:“(1) the extent to
which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff, (2) the
foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, (3) the degree of certainty that the
plaintiff suffered injury, (4) the closeness of the connection between the
defendant's conduct and the injury suffered, (5) the moral blame attached to
the defendant's conduct and (6) the policy of preventing future harm.
[Citation.]”].)
 
            Leave to
amend should not be granted unless plaintiff can establish that facts exist
sufficient to state a cause of action.  (Community Assisting Recovery, Inc. v. Aegis
Security Ins. Co. (2001) 92 Cal. App. 4th 886, 895.)  Plaintiff has
the burden of establishing in what manner it would be possible to amend the
complaint.  (Fuller v. First Franklin Financial Corp (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 955,
962-963.)  Citadel did not file an
opposition and therefore has not shown how amending the complaint would state a
cause of action. CNB’s general demurrer to Citadel’s professional negligence
cause of action is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
