And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in response to defendants' anti-SLAPP motion to strike the first and third through fifth causes of action and demurrer to the complaint. The plaintiff, Askari, alleges that neighbors' tennis court creates a noise nuisance and that the City of Beverly Hills and its employees did not enforce a zoning ordinance. The defendants argue that the anti-SLAPP motion should be granted because the conduct underlying the plaintiff's causes of action arises from their constitutional rights of free speech. The court agrees with the defendants and grants the anti-SLAPP motion.

The court also sustains the demurrer in its entirety, without leave to amend, because the plaintiff failed to timely present a government claim to the City and the defendants are protected by statutory immunities. The court finds that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the Government Claims Act and that the defendants are immune from liability. The court denies the plaintiff's leave to amend because there is no reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
