And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted plaintiff Freeman's motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against defendant Lannes. The parties had entered into a written stipulation on December 21, 2023, which included a clause allowing the court to retain jurisdiction if the settlement was breached. However, the defendant failed to make a $20,000 payment due by January 5, 2024, breaching the settlement agreement. As there is no opposition to the motion, the court will sign the proposed order.
