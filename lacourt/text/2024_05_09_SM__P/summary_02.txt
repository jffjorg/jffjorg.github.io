And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Carla, LLC v. Schwarz, in which the plaintiff obtained a default judgment against the defendant for $106,766.52. The defendant has moved to set aside the default judgment, arguing that she was not properly served and had no notice of the action. The court has found that the plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proof regarding service and has concluded that the defendant was not properly served. The court is inclined to set aside the default judgment in favor of litigating the matter on its merits. However, the defendant has been given the opportunity to provide supplemental evidence regarding how and when she discovered the default and default judgment, and how she promptly moved to set aside the default and default judgment. The matter may be continued to allow the defendant to submit such supplemental declaration.
