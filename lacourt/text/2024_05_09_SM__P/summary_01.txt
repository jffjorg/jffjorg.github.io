Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of WVM Holdings, LLC v. Victor Franco Noval, et al. The plaintiff, WVM Holdings, LLC, is seeking to set aside allegedly fraudulent transfers related to the Upland property and any other assets received by the Noval brothers. The defendant, Secured Capital Partners, LLC, has moved to strike punitive damages sought by the plaintiff.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's request for punitive damages is stricken, but the request for punitive damages is properly alleged. The judge has also granted Secured Capital's motion to strike the specific amount of damages requested in the complaint.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, as the plaintiff failed to attach a copy of the settlement agreement and did not allege the substance of its relevant terms.

The case involves allegations of fraudulent transfer of assets by the Noval brothers and their use of shell companies to conceal and protect the proceeds of the sale from creditors. The judge has ruled that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages at the pleading stage.
