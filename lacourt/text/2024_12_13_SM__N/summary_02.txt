And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preferential trial setting. The plaintiff, Pirooz Yadegar, is over 70 years old and has health conditions, including high blood pressure, hypertension, and muscle atrophy. He claimed that his health condition is such that an expedited trial is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to establish that his health condition is sufficient to warrant an expedited trial. The judge noted that the plaintiff's declarations and medical conditions do not demonstrate that a preferential trial date is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. As a result, the motion for preferential trial setting is denied.
