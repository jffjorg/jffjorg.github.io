Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed Defendant Richard McCoy's Motion for Summary Judgment and has granted it. The motion was filed in an unlawful detainer proceeding, in which Defendant McCoy is seeking to recover possession of the Subject Premises from Plaintiff Joseph Rechtman. The Court found that Defendant McCoy had made a prima facie showing that Plaintiff Rechtman is not entitled to recover rent from Defendant McCoy because the City of Los Angeles has determined that the Subject Premises are an illegal dwelling, and that any rental agreement between the parties is void. The Court also found that Plaintiff Rechtman has failed to carry his burden on summary judgment, as he did not present evidence that he is lawfully entitled to receive rent for the Subject Premises from Defendant McCoy. As a result, the Court granted summary judgment in Defendant McCoy's favor.
