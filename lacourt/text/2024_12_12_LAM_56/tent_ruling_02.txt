RESPONDING PARTY: None.

 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.
No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
             Petitioner has filed a First Amended Petition
for approval of transfer of certain structured settlement payment rights (the
“Petition”) belonging to Real Party-in-Interest/Transferor Sean Daniels
(“Transferor”). Specifically, Petitioner seeks the transfer of $69,000.00 in future
annuity payment rights belonging to Transferor to be paid on January 29, 2029,
the present discounted value of which is $56,299.57, to be transferred in
exchange for a purchase price of $33,677.87. 
            
            Petitioner first filed a Petition on
October 2, 2024. On October 4, 2024, Petitioner filed a notice of hearing for
December 12, 2024. 
 
On November 18, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant First Amended Petition, a declaration of payee in support of
Petitioner’s Petition, and proof of service via mail and email. The proof of
service shows serving of the notice of hearing, verified Petition, First
Amended Petition, notice of case assignment, declaration of payee and proof of
service on Transferor, the annuity issuer and the annuity obligor. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A transfer of structured settlement payment rights is void unless a court
reviews and approves the transfer and finds that (a) the transfer of the
structured settlement payment rights is fair and reasonable and in the best
interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of his or
her dependents, and (b) the transfer complies with the requirements of
Insurance Code (“Ins. Code”) sections 10134 to 10139.5, will not contravene
other applicable law, and that the court has reviewed and approved the transfer
as provided in Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10137, subds. (a)-(b).)
 
Section 10136
Requirements
            No direct or indirect transfer of
structured settlement payment rights by a payee to which Section 10136 applies
shall be effective, and no structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer
shall be required to make any payment directly or indirectly to a transferee,
unless all of the provisions of Section 10136 of the Insurance Code are
satisfied. (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (a).)
 
            The petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10136 as follows (Ins. Code, § 10136, subds. (b)-(e)): 
            
            First, the transfer agreement
satisfies the disclosure form requirements set out in Insurance Code section
10136, subdivision (b) because the transfer agreement is accompanied by a
disclosure addressed to Transferor and the disclosure contains all the statutorily
required language of section 10136, subdivision (b).) (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (b); Petition, Ex. A, California Purchase
Contract, § 10.)
 
Second, the
transfer agreement satisfies the transfer-agreement requirements set out in
Insurance Code section 10136, subdivision (c) because the transfer agreement
contains all the necessary language required from this statutory subdivision.
(Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (c); Petition, Ex. A, California Purchase Contract,
§§ 2 [amount and due date of payment rights to be sold], 10 [remaining
requirements].)
 
Third, the
transfer agreement does not violate Section 10138 as none of the contents
prohibited by this statutory section are contained in the transfer agreement.
(Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (d); Petition, Ex. A, California Purchase Contract.)
 
Fourth, Transferor
has not sought cancellation of the transfer agreement as of the date of this
hearing. (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (e); Decl. of Payee ¶ 13.)
 
Accordingly, the
Court finds that Petitioner’s proposed transfer of Transferor’s settlement
rights satisfies the requirements of Insurance Code section 10136, subdivisions
(a) through (e).
 
Section 10139.5
Requirements
A direct or indirect transfer of
structured settlement payment rights is not effective and a structured
settlement obligor or annuity issuer is not required to make any payment
directly or indirectly to any transferee of structured settlement payment rights
unless the transfer has been approved in advance in a final court order based
on express written findings by the court subject to Section 10139.5. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a).)
 
            Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)
The petition must
satisfy the findings requirements set out in Insurance Code section 10139.5,
subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(6). These findings, which the Court expressly makes
by the following language, are that: 
 
(1) The Court
cannot determine whether the transfer is fair and reasonable in the best
interests of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee’s
dependents. When determining whether the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in
the payee’s best interests, the Court must consider the totality of the
circumstances. Transferor is collecting $33,677.87 for future payment of $69,000.00,
the discounted present value of which is $56,299.57. Payee is an unmarried, unemployed,
thirty-five-year-old, states he is experiencing financial hardship and would
use the transfer funds to pay off accrued debts. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(a)(1) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(1)-(15)]; see also Petition,
Ex. A, California Purchase Contract, ¶ 10; Decl. of Payee ¶¶ 8, 11.)
 
The Court notes
that between December 2019 and September 2024, Transferor has received $1,041,122.64 from nineteen separate
transactions; however, despite this, he states that he is still experiencing
financial hardship. To determine whether the transfer
is in Transferor’s best interest, more information is needed to fully
understand his financial situation. Specifically, the Court requests testimony
from Transferor as to how the $1,041,122.64
was spent and why Transferor requires additional funds to “pay off
hospital bills, medical bills, credit card debt and other outstanding bills,
pay for physical therapy, take acting classes and work with a financial advisor
to make investments.” The Court also further requests explanation of how much
of the annuity would remain after this proposed transfer. 

 
The petition
otherwise satisfies the remaining findings requirement set out in Insurance
Code section 10139.5, subdivisions (a)(2) through (a)(6). These findings, which
the Court expressly makes by the following language, are that:
 
(2) The payee has been advised in writing
to seek independent professional advice
regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived,
in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2); Petition,
Ex. A, California Purchase Contract [Transferor was advised to obtain
independent legal advice and professional tax advice about the sale of the
Purchased Payments]; Decl. of Payee, ¶ 12 [“I did not receive independent legal
or financial advice regarding the proposed transaction. A copy of the waiver is
attached to Exhibit ‘E’ of the petition.”].)
 
            (3) Petitioner has complied with the
notification requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), has
provided the payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136 and
the transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3); Ins.
Code, § 10136, subds. (b)-(e) discussion supra & Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f) discussion infra at “Second, …” & Petition Ex. A,
California Purchase Contract.)
 
            (4) The transfer does not contravene
any applicable statute or the order of any court or other government authority.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(4).)
 
            (5)
The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms
set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a)(5); Decl. of Payee, ¶ 13 [“I understand the terms of the
transfer agreement, including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement
…”].)
 
(6) The payee
understands and does not wish to exercise the right to cancel the transfer
agreement. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(6); Decl. of Payee, ¶ 13 [“I … do
not wish to exercise my right to cancel the agreement”].)
 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)
            Except
as noted below, the Petition satisfies all the payee information required from
Section 10139.5, subdivision (c) as follows ((Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)):
 
(1) Included the
payee’s name and age. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(1); Decl. of Payee, p.
1:19-20 [Sean Daniels] & [35 years old].)
 
(2) Included the
payee’s marital status, and, if married or separated, the name of Payee’s
spouse. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(2); Decl. of Payee, ¶ 8 [“I am not married.”].)
 
(3) Included the
names, ages, and place or places of residence of the payee’s minor children or
other dependents, if any. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(3); Decl. of Payee,
¶ 8 [“I have no minor children.”].)
 
(4) Included the
amounts and sources of the payee’s monthly income and financial resources. (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(4); Amended Decl. of Payee, ¶ 8 [“I am currently unemployed.
I also receive payments of $3,316.38 per month from (my annuity/SSI, etc.”].) 
The Court requests clarification as to the source of the
$3,316.38 monthly payments. 
 
(5) Included
information permitting the determination of whether the payee is currently
obligated under any child support or spousal support order, and, if so, the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or agency
that is receiving child or spousal support from the payee under that order or
that has jurisdiction over the order or the payments in question. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (c)(5); Decl. of Payee, ¶ 8 [“I am not married.”; “I do not have
any court-ordered child support obligations”].) The Court notes that there is nothing in the declaration specifying that Transferor
was never married, or more to point, that he has no obligation for spousal
support. The Court would accept sworn testimony to that effect at the time of
the hearing. 
 
(6) Included
information regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers, as described
in paragraph (11), (12), or (13) of subdivision (b). (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (c)(6) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring
information only for petitions in last five years]; Petition,
¶¶ 7-8; Decl. of Payee, ¶¶ 9-10 [twenty-four prior petitions since December 2019,
nineteen approved, with case numbers and transfer information provided for the
approved petitions only].) The Insurance Code requires Transferor to provide
information regarding attempted transfers as well. The Court would accept case
numbers as sufficient. 

 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)
            The
amended petition satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (f)
as follows (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)):
 
First, the
transfer agreement satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision
(f)(1), because Petitioner made the instant Petition and the Petition was
brought in the county in which the Payee resides. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(1); Petition, p. 1 [showing Petitioner J.G.
Wentworth brings this Petition]; Decl.
of Payee, ¶ 1 [“I reside in Los Angeles County, California”].)
 
            Second,
the Petition satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5,
subdivision (f)(2).
 
            Formal notice of this transfer and a
copy of the Petition itself was filed by Petitioner with the Court and served
on all interested parties no later than November 22, 2024—i.e., original
Petition, notice, First Amended Petition, declaration in support of
Petitioner’s Petition, notice of case assignment, and proof of service were
served on Transferor, the annuity issuer, and the annuity obligor. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2) [notice of the proposed transfer and the petition
for its authorization to be filed with the court and served on all interested
parties within 20 days of hearing]; see also 11/18/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
Further, the notice and Petition have
attached all the necessary documents required from this subdivision. (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(A)-(L).) The notice and petition: 
 
(A) Include a
copy of the instant petition and need not attach prior petitions made outside
of five years from the date of this petition. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(f)(2)(A) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(6), which in turn is
framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring information
about petitions in last five years]; Decl. of Payee, ¶¶ 9-10 [twenty-four prior
petitions since December 2019, nineteen approved, with case numbers and
transfer information provided for the approved petitions only].)
 
(B) Include a
copy of the proposed transfer agreement and disclosure form required by
paragraph (3) of subdivision (a). (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(B); Petition,
Ex. A, California Purchase Contract &, Ex. B, California Disclosure
Statement.)
 
(C) Include
information regarding Transferor’s dependents and their ages. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(C); Decl. of Payee ¶ 8 [not married; no minor children].)
 
(D) Include a
copy of the disclosure required in subdivision (b) of Section 10136. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(D); Petition, Ex. B, California Disclosure
Statement.)
 
(E) Include
copies of the annuity contract, any qualified assignment agreement, and
underlying structured settlement agreement, if available, and if not available,
a showing of reasonable efforts to locate and secure a copy of the document
have been made, including making inquiry with Payee. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subds. (f)(2)(E)-(H); Petition, Exs. C & D.)
 
(F) Include
copies of the proofs of service made for notice of this petition. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(I); 11/18/24 Proof of Service.)
 
(G) Include a
notification that any interested party is entitled to support, oppose, or
otherwise respond to the transferee’s petition, either in person or by counsel,
by submitting written comments to the court or by participating in the hearing.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(J); Petition, p. 5; 11/18/24 Proof of
Service.)
 
(H) Include a
notification of the time and place of the hearing and notification of the
manner in which and the time by which written responses to the petition must be
filed, which may not be less than 15 days after service of the transferee’s
notice, in order to be considered by the court. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(2)(K); Petition, p. 5; 11/18/24 Proof of Service.)
 
(I) If the payee
entered into the structured settlement at issue within five years prior to the
date of the transfer agreement, then the transferee shall provide notice to the
payee’s attorney of record at the time the structured settlement was created,
if the attorney is licensed to practice in California, at the attorney’s
address on file with the State Bar of California. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(2)(L).)
 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g)
The Petition satisfies the requirements of
Section 10139.5, subdivision (g) requiring that transferees bear the costs of
transfer petitions of structured settlement rights. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (g); Petition, Ex. A, California
Purchase Contract [“We have charged [Sean Daniels] for the following
expenses: [¶] … $0.00 [¶] for a total of $0.00 in expenses”] & Ex. B, California Disclosure
Statement, p. 1 [same].)
 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h)
The amended petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (h) because, when the petition was
filed, Petitioner advised Transferor of his right to seek independent counsel
and financial advice in connection with this transfer petition and advised Transferor
of his right to a reimbursement of $1,500 for incurring such costs. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h); Petition,
Ex. A, California Purchase Contract [Sean Daniels was advised to receive independent representation and elected not to
seek out such independent professional representation]; Decl. of Payee, ¶ 12
[“I did not receive independent legal or financial advice regarding the
proposed transaction. A copy of the waiver is attached to Exhibit ‘E’ of the
petition.”].)
 
Requirements
Conclusion
            The
Court seeks (1) clarification as to the
source of the $3,316.38 monthly payments, (2) confirmation that Transferor has
no spousal support obligations, (3) further explanation of how the $1,041,122.64
already transferred was spent and why Transferor requires additional funds, and
(4) how much of the annuity this proposed transfer will remain if this
transaction is approved. The Court will take sworn testimony from Transferor
on these issues at the hearing, and based on that testimony will determine
whether or not to grant this Petition.
