And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the motions filed by Plaintiff Judith Sandoval to compel Defendant Azteca Import LLC to respond to discovery requests. The motions were filed because Defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests, which were served on June 17, 2024. The Judge notes that Plaintiff did not file proofs of service showing service of the motions on Defendant, and the requests for sanctions were not properly noticed.

The Judge finds that Plaintiff has established that the discovery requests are within the scope of discovery and that Defendant's nonresponse to the discovery requests is a sanctionable discovery abuse. Therefore, the Judge grants the motions to compel responses to the discovery requests.

The Judge orders Defendant to serve full, Code-compliant, verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of the order. The Judge also deems the requests for admissions admitted.

However, the Judge denies the requests for sanctions because they were not properly noticed. The Judge orders Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.

The parties are ordered to submit any objections to this tentative ruling by email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org. If no objections are filed, the motions will be placed off calendar.
