MOVING PARTY: Judith
Sandoval (“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None.

 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.
No opposition has been filed. Any opposition was required to have been filed at
least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civil Procedure (“CCP”), §
1005, subd. (b).) 
 
BACKGROUND
            This is a premises liability action.
Plaintiff alleges that she slipped and fell, suffering injuries, at premises
owned and operated by Defendant Azteca Import LLC (“Defendant”). On April 11,
2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging causes of action
for: (1) negligence; and (2) premises liability. 
 
            On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff served first
sets of form interrogatories (“FIs”), special interrogatories (“SIs”), requests
for production (“RFPs”), and requests for admission (“RFAs”) on Defendant. The
parties agreed on a response deadline of September 2, 2024. (All Motions, Keshmiri
Decl. ¶ 5.) Based on Defendant’s nonresponse to the discovery, Plaintiff filed
the instant motions to (1) compel responses to FIs, Set One, (2) compel
response to SIs, Set One, (3) compel responses to RFPs, Set One, and (4) deem RFAs,
Set One, admitted (collectively, the “Motions”).  
 
PROCEDURAL DEFECTS

First, the Court
notes that Plaintiff has not filed proofs of service showing service of the
four motions on Defendant. Second, while all four motions request monetary
sanctions, the requests for sanctions are not properly noticed. (CCP, §
2023.040 [“A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify
every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and
specify the type of sanction sought.”].) 
 
DISCUSSION
Motions
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses or Deem Admissions Admitted
A motion to compel an initial response can
be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response to
interrogatories or a demand to produce. (CCP, §§ 2030.290, subd. (a) [interrogatories],
2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce]; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) To
establish this ground, a movant must show:
 
(1) Proper service (CCP, §§ 2030.080,
subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce], 2033.070 [admission
requests]);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for the
initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (CCP, §§
2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260, subds. (a), (b) [demand
to produce], 2033.250, subds. (a), (b) [admission requests]); and
(3) No timely response (CCP, §§ 2030.290
[interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce], 2033.280, subd. (b) [admission
requests]).
 
A court must deny a motion to compel
initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of discovery.
(CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; CCP, §
2017.010 [scope of discovery].) 
 
Plaintiff provides proof of service of:
(1) FIs, Set One, (2) SIs, Set One, (3) RFPs, Set One and (4) RFAs, Set One.
(All Motions, Keshmiri Decl., Exs. 1 [discovery and proof of service].) Plaintiff
provides evidence that the agreed upon deadline for the initial responses has
passed. (All Motions, Keshmiri Decl., Exs. 2) Plaintiff further provides
evidence that Defendant never responded to the discovery that Plaintiff served
on June 17, 2024. (All Motions, Keshmiri Decl., ¶ 6.) Last, a brief review
shows that the first set of discovery contains requests within the scope of
discovery for this action because the interrogatories, production requests, and
admission requests at issue involve issues germane to the claims before the Court.
 
Thus, if at or before the hearing,
Plaintiff provides proofs of service for all four Motions which show they were
properly served on Defendant, the Motions will be GRANTED.
 
Request for
Sanctions 
            The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes the motion. As relates to interrogatories and production requests,
the Court can deny sanctions if it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanctions unjust, a standard not applicable to admission requests. (CCP, §§
2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand to produce],
2033.280, subd. (c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404 [interrogatories and demand to produce]; Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [admission request
sanctions are mandatory; no discretion].)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
The failure to respond to authorized
methods of discovery is a sanctionable discovery abuse. (CCP, §§ 2023.010,
subd. (d), 2023.030, subd. (a).) Such an abuse has occurred here through
Defendant’s nonresponse to: (1) FIs, Set One, (2) SIs, Set One, (3) RFPs, Set
One and (4) RFAs, Set One. As discussed above, however, Plaintiff did not
properly notice the request for sanctions. (CCP, § 2023.040.) Thus, the requests for sanctions are DENIED. 
 
 
            Contingent upon confirmation of
proper service of the Motions upon Defendant, the Court will make the following
Orders:
 
Plaintiff Judith Sandoval’s Motion to
Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED. Defendant Azteca
Import LLC is ordered to serve full, Code-compliant, verified responses,
without objections, within 20 days of this Order. 
 
Plaintiff Judith Sandoval’s Motion to
Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED. Defendant
Azteca Import LLC is ordered to serve full, Code-compliant, verified responses,
without objections, within 20 days of this Order.
 
Plaintiff Judith Sandoval’s Motion to
Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One is GRANTED.
Defendant Azteca Import LLC is ordered to serve full, Code-compliant, verified
responses and production, without objections, within 20 days of this Order.
 
Plaintiff Judith Sandoval’s Motion to Deem
Request for Admissions, Set One, Admitted is GRANTED. The truth of matters
specified in RFAs are deemed admitted. 
 
            Plaintiff Judith Sandoval’s Requests
for Sanctions are DENIED.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
