And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to produce documents at deposition without prejudice. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to submit a separate statement in support of the motion, which is a procedural requirement under the California Rules of Court. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to meet and confer in good faith with the defendant's counsel before filing the motion. The judge noted that the plaintiff's failure to meet and confer in good faith was a significant factor in the denial of the motion. The judge did not deny the motion solely on this basis, but found that the procedural deficiencies were sufficient to deny the motion without prejudice.
