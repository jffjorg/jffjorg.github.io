Legal StandardCCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has failed to timely answer after being properly served. A party seeking judgment on the default by the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought oran application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.

There is a Case Management Conference scheduled for 5/14/24]Here, Plaintiff has complied with all requirements for a default judgment.Plaintiffs submitted the declaration of Mary Pacini, the Credit Services Manager of Avnet Inc., Plaintiff’s Assignor. Attached to Pacini’s declaration is the invoice showing the past due payment. (Pacini Decl., Ex. 2.) Plaintiff also submitted a calculation of the costs. Here, the outstanding invoice balance owed by the Defendant is $79,544.24. (Pacini Decl., Ex. 3.) Therefore, using Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.214, the attorney's fees are $2,480.88 (as calculated $1,890 + [.02 x $29,544.24] = $5,378.60). In addition, interest on the invoice was calculated based on the maximum statutory interest rate of 10% since December 30, 2022, totaling $10,177.30.The Court notes that the request for entry of judgment provides conflicting amounts requested for attorney’s fees. The CIV-100 form requests $2,480.88 in attorney’s fees, but the case summary submitted with the default judgment package specifies attorney’s fees in the amount of $10,177.30. However, the attorney’s fees noted on the case summary appears to be a typographical error.Calculating the attorney’s fees based on Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.214 totals $2,480.88 as requested on the CIV-100 form.Since Plaintiff has complied with the requirements, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for default judgment.III. CONCLUSIONThe Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for default judgment.
