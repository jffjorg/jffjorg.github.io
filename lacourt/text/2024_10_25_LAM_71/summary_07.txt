The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and instead set a hearing to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250. The reason for this decision is that the plaintiff failed to provide an interest calculation for the breach of contract claim. According to California law, breach of contract claims have a default prejudgment interest rate of 10%, and the plaintiff failed to demonstrate why the interest rate should be 15%. The hearing is set for November 26, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
