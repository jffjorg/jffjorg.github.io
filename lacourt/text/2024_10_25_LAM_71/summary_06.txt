And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the events that occurred on August 27, 2024, during a status conference and hearing on an Order to Show Cause. The plaintiff's counsel failed to appear, and the cross-complainant's counsel failed to file proof of service of the cross-complaint. The judge is now ruling on the sanctions and future proceedings. Specifically, the judge orders the plaintiff's counsel to pay $250 for their failure to appear, discharges the Order to Show Cause related to the cross-complaint's proof of service, and sets a new hearing on an Order to Show Cause regarding the cross-complaint's dismissal and potential sanctions for the cross-complainant's counsel. The judge also sets a separate hearing on December 6, 2024, to address the cross-complainant's failure to request entry of default against certain defendants.
