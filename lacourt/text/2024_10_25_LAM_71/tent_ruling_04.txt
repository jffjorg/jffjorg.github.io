Meet and Confer
On June 5, 2024, the parties engaged in an IDC

Minute Order; 6/4/24 Defendant’s Notice of Outcome Re IDC.)
 
1.    
Motion to Compel Further RFP 1
Having reviewed Cross-Complainant’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses from Blackburn to Cross-Complainant’s RFP 1,
the Court rules as follows:
          On April 12, 2024, Cross-Complainant served RFP 1 on Blackburn.  (Decl. of Riley ¶5, Exh. 2.)  Blackburn’s response was due on or before May
14, 2024.  On May 14, 2024, Blackburn served
its untimely response that was unaccompanied by a proof of service and
contained a single objection to the entire set of production.  (Decl. of Riley ¶6, Exh. 3.)
On July 16, 2024, Blackburn
served its further verified response, which failed to produce documents
requested.  (Decl. of Riley ¶12, Exh. 8.)  On July 27, 2024, Blackburn served a second
supplemental response that also failed to produce documents in response to RFP
1.  (Decl. of Riley ¶15, Exh. 11.)  As of the date of this motion no production
has been made.  (Decl. of Riley ¶16.)  Cross-Complainant now moves to compel further responses.  
          Cross-Complainant’s motion to compel further responses from
Blackburn to RFP 1 is granted.  Blackburn
failed to produce responsive documents in accordance with its statement of
compliance.  Blackburn also waived all
objections by failing to timely respond to Cross-Complainant’s RFP 1.  Blackburn is ordered to produce all
responsive documents within 20 days of this ruling.
Cross-Complainant requests
monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,908.91 against Blackburn and its counsel
of record, Robert Gentino (“Gentino”).  In
Blackburn’s untimely opposition, Gentino declares that “[o]n August 14, 2024, I
received an email from Mr. Riley with no attachments and only a Dropbox Link”
and “I have never given consent to Mr. Riley, nor any other counsel, to serve
court filings by Dropbox due to my limited Dropbox storage.”  (Decl. of Gentino ¶¶1-2.)  The Court questions why Plaintiff’s counsel
continues to serve Gentino via Dropbox links after Gentino explicitly asked for
documents to not be delivered in this manner, and further why Plaintiff’s
counsel cannot simply attach the documents as a PDF attachment to an email.  However, Gentino demonstrates that he took no
proactive measures for two months to receive a copy of the PDF document.
          The Court awards sanctions against Blackburn and its
counsel pursuant to C.C.P. §§2023.010(d), 2023.010(e), and 2031.310(h) in the reduced
amount of $1,868.91, calculated as follows:
([2.5 hours to prepare
instant motion + 0.5 hour to attend hearing on motion] x $600.00) + $68.91
filing fee = $1,868.91
The sanctions are payable,
jointly and severally, by Blackburn and its attorney, Robert Gentino, within 20
days of this order.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
2.    
Motion to Compel Further FROG 1
Having reviewed Cross-Complainant’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses from Blackburn to Cross-Complainant’s FROG
1, Response No. 15.1, the Court rules as follows:
          On April 12, 2024, Cross-Complainant served FROG 1 on
Blackburn.  (Decl. of Riley ¶5, Exh. 2.)  Blackburn’s response was due May 14, 2024.  On May 28, 2024, Blackburn served its untimely
response.  (Decl. of Riley ¶6, Exh. 3.)  Blackburn’s response did not include a proof
of service or separate responses as to each affirmative defense as required by
the Code.  (See Decl. of Riley ¶6,
Exh. 3.)  
On July 16, 2024, Blackburn
served its supplementary response to FROG 1, Request No. 15.1, and did not
include separate responses as to each affirmative defense as required by the
Code.  (See Decl. of Riley ¶12,
Exh. 8.)  
On July 27, 2024, Blackburn
served a second supplemental response that still lacks separate responses as to
each affirmative defense.  (See Decl.
of Riley ¶15, Exh. 11.)  Cross-Complainant
now moves to compel further responses.  
          Cross-Complainant’s motion to compel further Code-compliant
responses from Blackburn to FROG 1, Request No. 15.1 is granted.  Blackburn waived all objections by failing to
timely respond to Cross-Complainant’s FROG 1. 
Blackburn is ordered to provide Code-compliant responses to FROG 1,
Request No. 15.1, within 20 days of this ruling.
Cross-Complainant requests
monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,968.91 against Blackburn and its counsel
of record, Robert Gentino.  In light of
the fact that the instant motion is unopposed, the Court declines to grant
Cross-Complainant’s request for fees in anticipation of reviewing an opposition
and drafting a reply.
          The Court awards sanctions against Blackburn and its
counsel pursuant to C.C.P. §§2023.010(d), 2023.010(e), and 2030.300(d) in the reduced
amount of $2,168.91, calculated as follows:
([3.0 hours to prepare
instant motion + 0.5 hour to attend hearing on motion] x $600.00) + $68.91
filing fee = $2,168.91
The sanctions are payable,
jointly and severally, by Blackburn and its attorney, Robert Gentino, within 20
days of this order.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
