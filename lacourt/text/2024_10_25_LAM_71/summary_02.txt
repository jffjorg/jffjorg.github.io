And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling regarding the entry of a judgment in the case of Barboza v. Howard Management. The case involves a settlement agreement between the parties, which was entered into on August 4, 2024. The settlement agreement requires the defendant to pay the plaintiff $195,000. The defendant filed a motion to enforce the settlement, which the court granted on August 19, 2024. The court ordered the defendant to submit a judgment within 10 days and set a hearing on an Order to Show Cause regarding the entry of the judgment for September 25, 2024. At the hearing, the plaintiff did not appear, but the defendant's counsel did. The court continued the hearing to October 25, 2024. The defendant has since filed a proposed judgment and a declaration from its counsel, Christina Newell, Esq., regarding her attempts to communicate with the plaintiff. The plaintiff has filed a request for a proposed order outlining her objections to the settlement. Based on the information presented, the judge is inclined to enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the amount of $195,000.
