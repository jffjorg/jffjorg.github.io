And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Cross-Complainant Robert Yager's motion to compel further responses from Cross-Defendant Blackburn Holdings, LLC to his Request for Production of Documents (Set One) and his Form Interrogatories (Set One), Request No. 15.1. Blackburn is ordered to produce all responsive documents within 20 days of this ruling.

The court has also granted Cross-Complainant's request for sanctions against Blackburn Holdings, LLC and its counsel, Robert Gentino, in the reduced amount of $1,868.91 and $2,168.91, respectively. The sanctions are payable within 20 days of this order.

The court found that Blackburn's responses to RFP 1 and FROG 1 were untimely and incomplete, and that Blackburn failed to produce responsive documents. The court also found that Blackburn waived all objections by failing to timely respond to Cross-Complainant's requests.

The court notes that Gentino, counsel for Blackburn, took no proactive measures for two months to receive a copy of a PDF document, despite knowing that the document was being served via Dropbox link. The court questions why Plaintiff's counsel continues to serve Gentino via Dropbox links after Gentino explicitly asked for documents to not be delivered in this manner.
