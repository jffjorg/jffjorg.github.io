  defendant’S demurrer 
  to Third amended complaint
 
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from an allegedly abusive
relationship.  Plaintiff Guzy Regev is an
Israeli immigrant studying to be a nurse. 
(Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) ¶8.) 
Defendant Niv Levy is a lawyer b. 
(Id., ¶¶8, 13.)  Regev
alleges Levy schemed to make her completely dependent on him, so that he could
more easily manipulate and control her. 
(Id., ¶14.)  
The TAC alleges that Levy pressured Regev to
move in with him, which she eventually agreed to do after Levy proposed.  (Id., ¶¶18-20, 22, 52.)  By having Plaintiff move in with him, Levy
could more easily control Plaintiff because she would have nowhere else to
go.  (Id., ¶22.)  During the move, Levy destroyed all of
Regev’s furniture and dishes, leaving her with only her clothes and some small
items.  (Id., ¶¶53-54.)  To render Regev even more dependent on him,
Levy also offered Regev financial assistance, convincing her not to apply for
student loans and giving her his credit cards to use for various expenses
including a gym membership and vet bills. 
(Id., ¶¶20, 23.)  
The TAC further alleges that the relationship
eventually soured when Levy discovered Regev had killed one of her dogs (Lila)
and maimed another (Teddy).  Regev set up
a nanny cam which showed Regev repeatedly strangling and throwing Teddy.  (Id., ¶¶ 67-69.)  Prior to that, when Regev would leave her
dogs with Levy, she would come home and find them with bloodshot eyes, broken
ribs, a broken leg, blood mixed with urine, vomit all around them, whimpering
in pain, limping, and soaked in a puddle of water.  (Id., ¶¶ 28, 31, 35, 36, 38, 40, 41,
46, 60, 62, 65.)  She did not know what
was causing the injuries, and Levy would attribute them to other causes
including chemicals used by Levy’s landlord to treat pest infestation.  (Id., ¶47.)  
The TAC also alleges that after seeing the
nanny cam video, Regev reported Levy to the police and immediately moved out of
their apartment.  (Id., ¶72.)   Regev went several weeks without a place to
live, having to ask friends to let her sleep on their couch because she could
not afford to get her own place right away. 
(Id., ¶77.)  After she
moved out, Levy would call and harass Regev to return (id., ¶73), and
when that failed, he accused her of credit card fraud and reported his cards
stolen to businesses where Regev had being using Levy’s card, including her gym
and the vet.  (Id., ¶¶78-82.)       
The TAC alleges claims for (1) intentional
infliction of emotional distress, (2) negligent infliction of emotional
distress, (3) liability for injuries to pets, (4) conversion, (5) quantum
meruit, (6) fraud and (7) breach of fiduciary duties.
The Court previously sustained a demurrer to
Plaintiff’s claims for breach of contract, fraud, and unfair business practices
in the first amended complaint.  The
Court also sustained a demurrer to Plaintiff’s claims for breach of contract and
unfair business practices in the second amended complaint.  
This hearing is on Defendant’s demurrer to the
TAC.  Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
claim for quantum meruit fails because the claim is only available to a service
provider and not the alleged recipient of the service.  Defendant also argues Plaintiff’s claim for
breach of fiduciary duties fails because the Court has concluded there is no attorney-client
agreement, and therefore, there can be no breach of fiduciary duties.  
MEET AND CONFER  
Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41 requires that before
the filing of a demurrer, the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or
by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and
confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code
Civ. Proc § 430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter,
the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and
confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)  
Defendant submits the Declaration of Mark
Waecker which fails to show the parties met and conferred in “person or by
telephone.”  Rather, Defendant sent counsel
for Plaintiff a letter.  Notwithstanding,
the Court cannot overrule a demurrer due to an insufficient meet and
confer.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.41(a)(4).)  However, the Court
cautions the parties that any future failures to comply with their meet and
confer obligations will result in the continuance of their motions.    
LEGAL STANDARD
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235
Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A demurrer can be
used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under
attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 (in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not
consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not
accepted for the truth of their contents).) 
For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint
are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of
conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
967.)         
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is
a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment”); Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency
(2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A demurrer should not be sustained without
leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of
action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can
be cured by amendment.”).)  The burden is
on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
DISCUSSION
Quantum Meruit
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not
properly alleged a claim for quantum meruit because she is not seeking
compensation for any services she performed. 
Plaintiff does not oppose the demurrer to this claim.  
“Quantum meruit refers to the
well-established principle that the law implies a promise to pay for services
performed under circumstances disclosing that they were not gratuitously
rendered.  To recover in quantum meruit,
a party need not prove the existence of a contract, but it must show the
circumstances were such that the services were rendered under some
understanding or expectation of both parties that compensation therefor was to
be made.”  (Chodos v. Borman (2014)
227 Cal.App.4th 76, 96.)  “[A]
plaintiff must establish both that he or she was acting pursuant to either an
express or implied request for such services from the defendant and that the
services rendered were intended to and did benefit the defendant.”  (Day v. Alta Bates Medical Center (2002)
98 Ca.App.4th 243, 248.)
Plaintiff’s quantum meruit claim does not
identify any services Plaintiff performed for which she now seeks to recover
the reasonable value.  Rather, the claim
alleges Defendant provided legal services to Plaintiff, whose
reasonable value Plaintiff claims is only $500 while Defendant charged $2,500
(TAC ¶¶141-145).  This does not support a
claim for quantum meruit.  Accordingly,
the Court sustains the demurrer to Plaintiff’s quantum meruit claim.  
 
 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot assert
a breach of fiduciary duty claim because the Court has already concluded there
is no contract between the parties.  The
Court disagrees.
An attorney-client relationship can be
created without a contract.  Although the relationship usually arises from
an express contract between the attorney and the client, it may also arise by
implication. (1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1996) Attorneys, § 68, p. 101;
3 Levy et al., Cal. Torts (1999) Attorneys, § 32.02[1], pp. 32-7 to 32-8; 1
Mallen & Smith, Legal Malpractice (4th ed. 1996) § 8.3, p. 568.)  “Neither contractual
formality nor compensation nor expectation of compensation is required” to
establish an attorney-client relationship. 
(Miller v. Metzinger (1979) 91 Cal. App. 3d 31, 40.) 

Here, the Complaint sufficiently alleges the
existence of an attorney-client relationship. 
(Compl. ¶157.)  And as Plaintiff’s
attorney, Defendant owed her a fiduciary duty. 
(Slovensky v. Friedman (2006)
142 Cal. App. 4th 1518, 1534-1535; Mirabito
v. Liccardo (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 41, 45.)  The Complaint further alleges Defendant
breached that duty by keeping settlement monies owed to Plaintiff.  (Id. ¶158.)    
Accordingly,
the Court overrules the demurrer to Plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty
claim.  
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court OVERRULES
IN PART and SUSTAINS IN PART Defendant’s demurrer to the Third
Amended Complaint.  
IT IS SO ORDERED.
