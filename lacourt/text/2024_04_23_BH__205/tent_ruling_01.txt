  FILED:  January 25, 2021
 



 
 
PROCEEDINGS:                  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF
DEFAULT JUDGMENT
MOVING PARTY:               Amy Lloyd and Todd Benton
RESPONDING
PARTY:      Pablo Ortiz dba Ortiz Construction &
Associates,
One Day Builders Inc.
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Todd Benton and
Amy Lloyd were the owners of the real property located at 435 Pier Avenue,
Santa Monica, California 90405 (the “Property”).  They entered into a written agreement with
Defendants Pablo Ortiz dba Ortiz Construction & Associates (“Ortiz”) and
Abel Mendoza (“Mendoza”) for the remodeling of the Property.  
Plaintiffs allege that Ortiz
was not a licensed contractor, and accordingly, pursuant to Cal. Bus. &
Prof. Code 7031(b), Plaintiffs are entitled to all amounts they paid to him,
totaling $180,000.  Plaintiffs also
claims Defendant One Day Builders, Inc. is liable for fraud and violation of
the Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 as it allowed Ortiz to use
ODBI’s license number to secure the contract with Plaintiffs.  
On January 25, 2021, Plaintiffs
filed a Complaint against Defendants. 
The Complaint alleges claims for (1) disgorgement, (2) breach of
contract, (3) fraud, (4) negligence, (5) unfair competition, and (6) breach of
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  Plaintiffs claim damages in the amount of $180,000
plus interest, costs and attorneys’ fees.  
  
Plaintiffs filed a proof of service showing Ortiz
and ODBI were substitute served on February 1, 2021.  Defendants were obligated to respond within
30 days. Defendants did not do so. Plaintiff successfully requested the entry
of Defendants’ default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on March 18,
2021 and August 7, 2023.  Plaintiff is
now seeking a default judgment.  Plaintiff
served Defendants by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and
Request for Default Judgment.  
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
 
Default judgment against
Defendants for a total of $257,438.02 consisting of (1) $180,000 in damages, (2)
$60,712.92 in interest, (3) $14,332.50 in attorneys’ fees and (4) $2,402.60 in
costs. 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 585
sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment. First, where the
plaintiff’s complaint seeks compensatory damages only, in a sum certain
which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or
statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount.
However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated,
consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which
require either an accounting, additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment
to ascertain, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court. In
such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the
specific judgment requested.  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc.
(2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.) Section 585 also allows for interest, costs
and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc. §585(a).)
 
Multiple specific documents
are required, such as:
(1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest
computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a
proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.) 
Here, Plaintiffs have met
the procedural and substantive requirements for entry of a default
judgment.  Substantively, Plaintiffs
declare via declaration and supporting exhibits that there have been damages in
the amount of $180,000.  (Lloyd Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. B to Lloyd Decl.)  Plaintiffs have set forth a
calculation for prejudgment interest (of $60,712.92).  (Case Summary at p.4.)  Plaintiffs have also articulated a statutory
basis for attorneys’ fees (Bus. & Prof. Code §
7160), and
provided a declaration quantifying the amount of attorneys’ fees ($14,332.50). (Urbach
Decl. ¶11.)  Plaintiffs
have also provided a calculation of their costs (of $2,402.60) in item 7 of the
CIV 100 form.  Procedurally, Plaintiffs properly
served Defendants more than 30 days prior to requesting entry of default and
default judgment, correctly completed JC Form CIV-100 in a manner that would
not void or put at issue the entry of default, provided a declaration of
non-military status, requested damages in amounts supported by the filings and
not in excess of the amount stated in the Complaint, filed a proposed judgment
(JUD-100) and filed a request for dismissal of the doe defendants.  Accordingly, default is appropriate
here.  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs
Todd Benton and Amy Lloyd’s Request for Default Judgment is GRANTED as
to Defendants Pablo Ortiz and One Day Builders, Inc.  Default judgment in the amount of $257,438.02
is
awarded in favor of Plaintiffs.
