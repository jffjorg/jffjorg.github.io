And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Guzy Regev, alleges that the defendant, Niv Levy, engaged in an abusive relationship, including physical and emotional abuse, and that Levy schemed to make Regev dependent and controlled her. The plaintiff claims that Levy provided financial assistance and offered to help with expenses. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims for quantum meruit and breach of fiduciary duty are not properly pleaded. The court has sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's quantum meruit claim, finding that the claim does not identify any services that the plaintiff performed for which she seeks to recover the reasonable value. However, the court has overruled the demurrer to the plaintiff's breach of fiduciary duty claim, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the existence of an attorney-client relationship and that Levy owed Regev a fiduciary duty.
