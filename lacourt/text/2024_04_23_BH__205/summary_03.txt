And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the case, which arose from a dispute over a loan modification. The plaintiff, Sharon Driben, obtained a loan from Homebridge Financial Services and later sought a modification. Defendant Servicemac LLC, which services the loan, offered a modification, but then withdrew the offer and informed Driben that it was made in error. Driben made loan payments in reliance on the withdrawn offer. Defendant reported Driben's mortgage status to credit reporting agencies, which caused harm to Driben's credit score.

The judge granted defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's claims, including claims under the Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Unfair Competition Law. The judge also sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's breach of contract and fraud claims. The judge struck the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages due to lack of allegations of malice, oppression, or fraud.
