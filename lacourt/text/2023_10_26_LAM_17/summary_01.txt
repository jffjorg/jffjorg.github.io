And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions. The motion is denied in part and granted in part. The judge finds that the defendants did not comply with the court's order to provide verified discovery responses, and therefore grants monetary sanctions against all defendants. Each defendant is sanctioned $1,750, due within 20 days of the entry of this judgment. The judge also notes that the defendants' failure to comply with the court's order was not justified, and that they should have sought relief with the court if they had issues that prevented them from complying with the deadlines.
