 Hearing
  Date:  October 26, 2023



 
            Crusader
Insurance’s special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP) Vitar’s cross-complaint is
DENIED.
 
            On
5/26/2023, Plaintiff Crusader Insurance Company (Crusader) filed suit against
Aurora Vitar individually and as trustee of the Aurora Vitar Survivors Trust
(Vitar), seeking reimbursement.  
 
            On
7/18/2023, Vitar filed a cross-complaint against Crusader, alleging: (1) breach
of written contract; (2) insurance bad faith; (3) intentional
misrepresentation; (4) elder abuse; and (5) declaratory relief. 
 
            Now,
Crusader moves to specially strike Vitar’s cross-complaint. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
On a
special motion to strike pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section
425.16, also known as an anti-SLAPP motion, moving parties have the initial
burden to demonstrate that a cause of action is subject to a special motion to
strike. (Martinez v. Metabolife Inter.
Ins. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 181, 186; Fox
Searchlight Pictures Inc. v. Paladino (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 294, 304.)
First, the court must determine whether moving parties have
made a prima facie showing that the attacked claims arise from a
protected activity, including defendants’ right of petition, or free speech,
under a constitution, in connection with issues of public interest. (Healy
v. Tuscany Hills Landscape & Recreation Corp., (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th
1, 5; Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006)
39 Cal.4th 260, 278; Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(e).) Moving parties can satisfy this burden by showing (1) statements made
before legislative, executive or judicial proceedings, or made in
connection with matters being considered in such proceedings, or (2) statements
made in a public forum, or other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the
constitutional rights of petition or free speech, in connection with issues of
public interest. (Code Civ. Proc.,­ § 425.16, subd. (e); Equilon Ent.,
LLC v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 66.) 
 
If the
court finds this showing has been made, it must dismiss the cause of action
unless the plaintiff meets its burden to demonstrate a probability of
prevailing on the claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(b)(1); Balzaga v.
Fox News Network, LLC (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1325, 1336.)
This means that the plaintiff must state a legally sufficient claim and
must then present evidence that substantiates or sustains the claim. (Equilon Enterprises
v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 61; see also Wilson
v. Parker, Covert & Chidester (2002)
28 Cal.4th 811, 821 [plaintiff “must demonstrate that the complaint is both
legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts
to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited”].) 
 
Factual Background 
 
Aurora Vitar
is a real estate investor who owns and manages properties in Southern
California. One of her properties included an eighteen-unit apartment building
located on 450 S. Benton Way in Los Angeles. This building was the subject of a
tenant lawsuit in 2019, based on allegations that Vitar had failed to correct
the substandard conditions on the property. 
 
The lawsuit
was tendered to Crusader on February 24, 2020. On April 22, 2020, Crusader
agreed to defend Vitar, subject to a reservation of rights, and appointed
defense counsel, Rick Peterson of Bremer, Whyte, Brown & O’Meara.
 
In December
of 2020, Vitar and her tenants agreed to a mediation. Defense counsel evaluated
a reasonable settlement value ($300,000 or less) based on the tenants’
discovery responses and available evidence. At the time, Crusader believed most
of the tenants’ damages were not covered under the policy. However, Crusader
would fund a reasonable settlement, even if it included what Crusader believed
to be noncovered claims. 
 
Following the
procedures set forth in Blue Ridge Ins. v. Jacobsen, (2001) 25 Cal.4th
489, Crusader informed Vitar on December 17, 2020, that it would accept a
settlement within the reasonable settlement value ($300,000 or less). If Vitar
believed her case was defensible, or if she objected to Crusader negotiating
the settlement at $300,000 or less, and subject to a reservation of the right
to seek reimbursement from Vitar, Vitar could object to the settlement and take
over the defense of the tenants’ lawsuit at her own expense (as outlined in Blue
Ridge). (Rindt Dec., Exh. 3).
 
The tenants
ultimately agreed to release Vitar for $290,000. Vitar did not contribute to
the settlement amount, and did not opt to assume and mount her own defense, at
her own expense.
 
On December
17, 2020, Crusader sent a letter (the Pre-Litigation Settlement Letter) to
Vitar proposing a compromise of its reimbursement claim to Vitar, in an attempt
to informally resolve the reimbursement issue. 
 
            Vitar
declined the informal offer. As a result, Crusader now seeks reimbursement for
what it contends are uncovered claims under the policy, based on its previous
reservation of rights. 
 
            In
the cross-complaint, Vitar alleges that Crusader acted in bath faith because it
created a conflict of interest and required the appointment of independent of Cumis
counsel by Crusader for Vitar. (San Diego Navy Federal Credit Union v.
Cumis Insurance Society, Inc. (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 358.)
 
Discussion 
 
            Crusader
argues that Vitar’s cross-complaint should be specially struck because each of
the causes of action arise out of Crusader’s attempt to negotiate its
reimbursement claim and its decision to seek a coverage determination of its
settlement payment, and Vitar does not have a reasonable probability of
prevailing. 
 
            As
for the first contention, filing a lawsuit is fundamentally protected activity
for anti-SLAPP purposes. (See Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope &
Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1115) (“The constitutional right of
petition . . . includes the basic act of filing litigation”). The California
Supreme Court recently clarified that pre-lawsuit settlement negotiations are
also protected activity under Section 425.16: “We deal here with a claim
arising out of settlement negotiations preceding the filing of any suit. But we
nevertheless conclude such negotiations, no less than postfiling settlement
negotiations or communications in anticipation of filing, are protected
activity for anti-SLAPP purposes.”
 
            In
determining whether Vitar’s claims arise from or are based on protected
petitioning activity (in this case, pre-lawsuit settlement negotiations), the
Court considers “the principal thrust or gravamen of a plaintiff's cause of
action.” (Ramona Unified School Dist. v. Tsiknas (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
510, 519-20.) 
 
            Here,
Vitar’s cross-claims arises out of Crusader’s attempt to negotiate its
reimbursement claim and its decision to seek a coverage determination of its
settlement payment. For example, Vitar’s cross-complaint alleges the following:
 
-        
“On December 17, 2020, Crusader . . .
notified Cross-Complainant that, in Crusader’s opinion, substantial portions of
the damages alleged by plaintiffs in the Rivera action were not covered. Values
were assigned to the purportedly covered and non-covered claims, and Crusader
demanded Cross-Complainants contribute 86% of any future settlement.” (Cross-Complaint
¶ 11)
 
-        
“Prior to settling the Rivera suit,
Crusader arbitrarily determined that Cross-Complainant pay 86% of defense costs
and fees and indemnity payments prior to and subsequent to settlement. That
demand, coupled with the denial of Cumis counsel representation, breached the
policy terms, and were contradicted by applicable case law.” (Cross-Complaint ¶
18).
 
-        
“By denying Cross-Complaint the full
coverage provided in the Crusader policies, and by demanding an 86% settlement
contribution from CrossComplainant without the protection of Cumis counsel at
mediation, Crusader breached its contracts with Cross-Complaint.”
(Cross-Complaint ¶ 20.) 
 
-        
“The covenant was breached by, among
other things, Crusader’s failure to provide Cross-Complaint with Cumis counsel
or notify Cross-Complaint of the existence of a conflict of interest, arbitrary
allocation of fees, costs and damages into covered and un-covered claims . . .
.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 23).
 
-        
“Those representations included the
representation that a defense would be provided to Cross-Complainant and
indemnity paid for covered claims . . . .” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 27.) 
 
In
opposition, Vitar cited a number of cases where the Court found that an
insured’s bad faith claim against its insurer, based on the failure to provide
independent counsel and breach of the duty to defend, was not subject to
anti-SLAPP provisions.  
 
For example,
in Miller v. Zurich American Ins. Co. (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 247, the
basis of the suit brought by Miller against Zurich was breach of contract in
failing to appoint independent counsel; and bad faith in handling an underlying
action. The suit alleged Zurich breached its duty to defend by not providing
conflict-free counsel. Zurich filed an anti-SLAPP motion, claiming the actions
alleged by the Millers arose from “petitioning activity” and asserted the
Millers could not prevail in their suit, as all evidence was protected by the
litigation privilege of Civil Code section 47.
 
The court
first recognized the Miller’s claims did not arise from Zurich’s protected
activity. In reaching this conclusion, the court observed: “‘[a]lthough a
party's litigation-related activities constitute “act[s] in furtherance of a
person's right of petition or free speech,” it does not follow that any claims
associated with those activities are subject to the anti-SLAPP statute’” (Miller,
supra, at p. 257, citing Freeman v. Schack (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th
719, 729–730).)
 
The court
then noted that breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
may occur through litigation-related communications independent of liability
issues in the underlying action. However, there, the gravamen of the claim was
the claimed denial of the benefit of panel counsel’s independent professional
judgment in rendering legal services to them. As such, what gave rise to
liability was not that the defendant spoke, but that the defendant denied the
plaintiff a benefit, or subjected the plaintiff to a burden…” (Id.) The
court found “the lawsuit concerns a breach of duty that [did] not depend on
[Zurich’s] exercise of a constitutional right.” (Id. at pg. 258, citing Chodos
v. Cole (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 692, 702.)
 
Similarly, in
Trilogy Plumbing, Inc. v. Navigators Specialty Ins. Co. (2020) 50 Cal.
App. 5th 920 the Court there held that specific bad faith allegations regarding
conflicted defense counsel were not protected by the anti-SLAPP statute because
the claims asserted did not rely on issues under issues under consideration or
review by a judicial body. 
 
Vitar also
cited the following cases wherein bad faith claims survived anti-SLAPP motions:
RLI Ins. Co. v. Langan Eng’g, Env’t, Surveying & Landscape Architecture,
D.P.C. (9th Cir. 2021) 834 F. App’s. 362, 363-64 (citing Park v. Bd. Of
Trustees of California State Univ. (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057, 1065.); Beach
v. Harco National Ins. Co. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 82, 93-94; and Gallimore
v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Ins. Co. (2002)102 Cal.App.4th 1388.
 
Here, like in
Trilogy, Vitar alleges she was represented by conflicted defense
counsel, and like in Miller, Vitar alleges she did not receive the
benefit of a proper defense from panel counsel. While this case involves
litigated-related communications, what gives rise to Crusader’s alleged
liability is not that the Crusader spoke, but that Crusader allegedly denied Vitar
an owed benefit. In other words, Vitar does not challenge Crusader’s right to
seek reimbursement or to engage in settlement negotiations. Rather, Crusader
claims “address the manner in which Vitar was treated by Crusader-appointed
defense counsel; and the manner in which coverage decisions were made in the
absence of independent counsel.” (Opp, 5: 19-21.) 
 
 The Court agrees, based on the analysis of Miller
and Trilogy, that Defendant has not met its burden to show Vitar’s
claims arise out of protected activity. 
 
This
conclusion is further reinforced by the fact that Vitar’s claim is brought as a
compulsory cross-complaint. Compulsory cross-complaints “rarely, if ever,
qualify as a SLAPP suit arising from petitioning activity.” (Church of
Scientology v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628,651. See also
Kajima Engineering & Construction v. City of Los Angeles (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 921.)
 
Based on the
foregoing, Crusader’s special motion to strike is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
