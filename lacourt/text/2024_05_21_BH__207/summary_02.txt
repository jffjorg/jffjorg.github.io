The Court finds that Cadish complied with the standard of care in relation to the treatment and care of Plaintiff Lamar Hawkins. The Court holds that Cadish did not breach the standard of care, and that no alleged negligent act or omission on the part of Cadish caused, contributed to, or was a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries alleged by Plaintiff. The Court concludes that there are no triable issues of material fact, and determines, as a matter of law, that Cadish is entitled to judgment.
