MATTER


Request for Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff Dawn Robertson (“Plaintiff”) requests for default judgment
against Defendant Doub Hanshaw (“Defendant”) in the amount of $272,421.10,
which is composed of special damages in the amount of $258,547.33; costs in the
amount of $1,506.27; and attorneys’ fees in the amount of $12,367.50.
 
            a.         Damages 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges four causes of action for (1) Fraud; (2) Negligent Misrepresentation;
(3) Violation of Civil Code § 1102; and (4) Breach of Residential Purchase
Agreement. Defendant was served with the summons via publication, effective
September 4, 2023, in accordance with the Court’s July 31, 2023 Order for
Publication. Default was entered against Defendant on October 10, 2023, and the
Doe defendants were dismissed on February 21, 2024. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint seeks $233,000 in special damages. (See Compl.) Plaintiff now seeks
special damages of $258,547.33.   However, the Court cannot award damages that
are in excess of what is pled in the Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580,
subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot
exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v. Smith (2006)
145 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default
judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            Therefore, the Court cannot award
Plaintiff’s requested damages. 
 
            d.         Attorney Fees and Costs 
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs to a prevailing party under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the recovery of attorneys’ fees
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides
“[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the
measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to
the agreement, express or implied, of the parties [….]”  Similarly, Civil Code section 1717 provides
“[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall
be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the
party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he
or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.”  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines the “prevailing party” as follows:

 
[T]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief
and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
            
            Paragraph 22 of
the Residential Purchase Agreement provides:
 
22. ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS:
In any action, proceeding, or arbitration between Buyer and Seller arising out
of this Agreement, the prevailing Buyer or Seller shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney fees and costs from the non-prevailing Buyer or Seller,
except as provided in paragraph 30A.
 
(Ex. 1 to Robertson Decl.) 
Further, counsel declares to have incurred $10,167.50 in attorneys’
fees, as well as an estimated $2,200 additional fees to complete the default
package.  (Robertson Decl. ¶ 30.)
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has substantiated the request for attorneys’
fees.
 
            Plaintiff also requests $1,506.27 in costs composed of $698.40 in filing fees, $422.50 in process server fees, and $385.37
in service by publication fees. (CIV-100.) Plaintiff’s request for costs is
granted as Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Because Plaintiff
seeks damages in excess of those demanded in the Complaint, Plaintiff’s request
for default judgment is denied without prejudice.  
 
            Further, the
Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default Judgment is continued to July 29,
2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207. 
Plaintiff’s renewed Request for Default Judgment in conformance with the
Court’s ruling shall be filed on or before July 8, 2024.  
 
            The Clerk of the
Court shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling.
