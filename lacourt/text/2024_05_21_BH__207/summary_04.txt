Here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court denies the Plaintiff's request for default judgment because Plaintiff seeks damages in excess of those demanded in the Complaint. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $12,367.50, as the Plaintiff has not substantiated the request. However, the Court grants the Plaintiff's request for costs in the amount of $1,506.27. The Court continues the Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default Judgment to July 29, 2024. The Plaintiff is required to file a renewed Request for Default Judgment in conformance with the Court's ruling by July 8, 2024.
