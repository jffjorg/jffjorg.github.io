  Case Number:  20STCV39869    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  74 Dwayne J. Chomyk v. Christina Development
Corporation
Plaintiff Dwayne J. Chomyk’s Motion for
Monetary Sanctions 
The court considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
October 16, 2020, Plaintiff Edwayne Chomyk (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant Christina Development Corporation (Defendant) alleging
wrongful termination under Labor Code section 1102.5, wrongful termination
under Labor Code section 6310, wrongful termination in violation of public
policy, and fraud.
            On
June 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for sanctions.
DISCUSSION 
            Plaintiff
seeks sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98, subdivision (c)
and 1281.99, subdivision (a). 
            Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98, subdivision (a), if the party who
drafted an arbitration agreement fails to pay fees and costs while an
employment arbitration proceeding is pending, the drafting party is in material
breach of the arbitration agreement and is in default of the arbitration. If
the drafting party breaches the agreement or is in default, the employee may
withdraw his or her claim from arbitration and proceed in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subd. (b)(1).) And if
the employee withdraws his or her claim from arbitration, the employee may
bring a motion to recover attorney’s fees and costs associated with the
abandoned arbitration proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subd. (c)(1).)
Moreover, the court shall impose sanctions on the drafting party in accordance
with Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.99. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98,
subd. (c)(2).) 
            On
September 21, 2021, the court granted Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration
and stay proceedings in this action. But on May 9, 2023, the court granted
Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the stay in this action on the grounds that
Defendant did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98,
subdivision (a). As a result, the court found that Plaintiff could exercise his
right to withdraw from arbitration. Defendant thereafter appealed the court’s
May 9 ruling, and the appeal is still pending. Because Plaintiff’s motion for
sanctions depends on Plaintiff’s proper withdrawal of his claims from
arbitration, a ruling on this matter before the Court of Appeal issues its
decision would be premature.
CONCLUSION  
            The
court continues this hearing to a later date.
            Plaintiff
shall give notice.
