And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for sanctions filed by Plaintiff Dwayne J. Chomyk against Defendant Christina Development Corporation. The dispute arises from an employment dispute, and Plaintiff is seeking sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99. The court has previously granted Defendant's motion to compel arbitration, but later granted Plaintiff's motion to vacate the stay on the grounds that Defendant failed to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98. As a result, Plaintiff was able to withdraw from arbitration. The court has decided to continue the hearing to a later date, and Plaintiff will be given notice. The court will wait for the Court of Appeal to issue its decision on Defendant's appeal before making a final ruling on the motion for sanctions.
