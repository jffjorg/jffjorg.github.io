 Case Number:  22STCV21788    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  74 Harmik
Abrahamian v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Brigitte Brown to Appear for Deposition and Produce Documents and Request for
Sanctions.
 
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
July 6, 2022, Plaintiff Harmik Abrahamian (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Defendant). The complaint alleges
retaliation, disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, failure to
engage in the interactive process, wrongful discharge in violation of public
policy, and failure to allow inspection of personnel files.
            On
November 29, 2023, Plaintiff served a notice for Brigitte Brown to appear at
deposition and produce documents. The deposition was set for January 4, 2024. 
            On
December 27, 2023, Defendant served objections to the deposition notice and
document requests.
            On
January 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel the deposition and
production of documents.
            On
January 8, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for a protective order that would
prevent Plaintiff from taking the deposition.
            On
February 6, 2024, the court denied Defendant’s motion for a protective order.
LEGAL STANDARD
            “The
service of a deposition notice . . . is effective to require any deponent who
is a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee
of a party to attend and to testify, as well as produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) “If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action . . . without having served a valid
objection . . . fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, the
party giving notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff wishes to compel Brigitte
Brown’s appearance at deposition and production of documents. The court finds
Plaintiff has shown good cause for the testimony and documents sought. 
            However,
Defendant argues the court should deny Plaintiff’s motion as moot because
Defendant has agreed to produce the deponent. (Papania Decl., ¶¶ 13; Ex. H.)
But Defendant has not provided available deposition dates or expressly agreed
to produce the documents. Thus, the motion is not moot. Defendant also claims
Plaintiff cannot bring this motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450, subdivision (a), because Defendant served timely, valid objections to
the deposition notice on December 27, 2023. (Soleymani Decl., ¶ 28; Ex. 23.)
The court finds Defendant’s boilerplate objections to the deposition notice and
document requests improper, though. (Korea Data Systems v. Superior Court (1997)
51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516.) Defendant also objected that Plaintiff
“unilaterally selected” the deposition date without sufficiently meeting and
conferring. In addition, Defendant objected on the grounds of unavailability.
But Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to schedule the deposition with Defendant’s
counsel, who never provided available dates. (Soleymani Decl., ¶¶ 11-14, 20-21,
27; Ex. 9; Ex. 12, pp. 1-7.) Thus, Plaintiff’s motion to compel is proper. 
            Given
the foregoing, the court grants Plaintiff’s motion. As the prevailing party,
Plaintiff seeks sanctions as well. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
The court finds that Defendant did not act with substantial justification
because its objections to the deposition were unavailing. Plaintiff’s counsel’s
proposed hourly rate was reasonable preparing what amounted to a template for
the multiple motions filed on January 3 (and for which the court awarded $4,810.00
in sanctions on March 4, 2024) but excessive for what amounted to copying that template
for the motions filed in addition to the first motion. The court orders $500 in
attorney’s fees as discovery sanctions.
CONCLUSION
            The court grants Plaintiff’s motion
to compel. Defendant shall produce Brigitte Brown for deposition and produce
documents responsive to Category Nos. 1-15 by April 5, 2024. The court grants
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel $500
in attorney’s fees as discovery sanctions by April 5, 2024. 
            Plaintiff
shall give notice.Harmik
