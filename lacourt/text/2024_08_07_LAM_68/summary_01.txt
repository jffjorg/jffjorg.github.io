And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Gavrielli Brands, LLC (Plaintiff) to compel the deposition of Susana Maximo, general manager of Empire Container Freight Station, Inc. (Defendant). The Plaintiff claims that Maximo was aware of the storage conditions and underlying facts regarding the damage to the merchandise. The Plaintiff served a notice of deposition to which Maximo purportedly failed to appear. The Defendant objected to the deposition on grounds of a unilaterally set date and lack of availability on that date. The judge finds that the unopposed motion sufficiently complies with all procedural requirements and that the Defendant appears uncooperative in scheduling a mutually agreeable deposition date. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer on a new deposition date, with the deposition to be completed within 20 days. If the parties are unable to agree, the Plaintiff may unilaterally pick a date and attempt to conduct the deposition. The judge also grants the motion as a sanction against the Defendant for their prior non-appearances and orders sanctions in the amount of $1,000.
