And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, City of Los Angeles, to the second amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Abet Security Services, Inc. The plaintiff alleges that the city breached a contract for security services and seeks damages of $803,537.92.

The judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the plaintiff's claim for breach of contract is invalid. The judge has also granted the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to alleged terms within the legally operative scope of the incorporated contracts.

The judge found that the plaintiff's claim is invalid because the complaint does not adequately plead the terms of the contract, including the payment terms and the identity of the authorized employees. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations, as the alleged breach occurred more than two years ago.

The judge declined to consider the plaintiff's argument that the city ratified the contract by continuing to receive services from the plaintiff. The judge also declined to consider the plaintiff's argument that the city's failure to pay for the services constitutes a breach of contract.

The judge ordered the plaintiff to file a new complaint that includes the necessary terms and allegations to state a valid claim for breach of contract. The judge also ordered the plaintiff to file a notice of intent to amend the complaint within 20 days.
