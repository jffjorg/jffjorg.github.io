SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Gavrielli Brands, LLC imported certain footwear
for sale in the United stated under the “Tieks” brand. Third party Catrone
Freight Logistics coordinated the importation of the shipment(s) from the Port
of Long Beach and storage of the merchandise from the with defendant Empire
Container Freight Station, Inc. While Plaintiff utilized the services of
Defendant, beginning in 2017, Plaintiff began to discover missing merchandise appearing
for sale on eBay. When Plaintiff confronted Defendant, a counter demand for
$732,915.50 in storage charges was presented, and denial of access to the
property without payment. Plaintiff contends Defendant “stole” at least 21,528
pairs of shoes from the shipments at a retail value of $4.3 million. 
 
On March 7, 2022, plaintiff filed its complaint for Possession
of Personal Property, Conversion, Negligence, Promissory Fraud, and Unfair
Competition. A 170.6 challenge led to reassignment from Department 51 to 68. On
June 14, 2022, Defendant answered and filed a cross-complaint for Breach of
Contract, Open Account, and Unfair Business Practices. On December 7, 2022, a
first amended cross-complaint was filed. The court sustained the demurrer to
the first amended cross-complaint with 20 days leave to amend on February 6,
2023. The second amended cross-complaint was filed on March 2, 2023. On May 16,
2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the second amended cross-complaint
without leave to amend. 
 
On January 30, 2024, Empire Container Freight Station, Inc.
filed a 170.6 peremptory challenge to the court. The challenge was accepted and
the case reassigned. On February 23, 2024, the court (Department 1) entered a
subsequent stipulation rescinding the second filed 170.6 peremptory challenge
brought by Empire Container Freight Station, Inc., and restoring previously
vacated hearings and the trial.
 
On April 23, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff leave to file
a first amended complaint. On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint for Possession of Personal Property, Conversion, Negligence,
Promissory Fraud, and Unfair Competition.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff
Gavrielli Brands, LLC moves to compel the deposition of Susana Maximo, general
manager of the Empire Container Freight Station, Inc. warehouse. Plaintiff
moves on grounds that Maximo, as manager of the warehouse, was aware of the
storage conditions and underlying facts regarding the damage to the
merchandise. The court electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply on
file at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
A party may file a motion to compel deposition of a
defendant company employee. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.010, 2025.280, subd.
(a).) “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action …
without having served a valid objection … fails to appear for examination, or
to proceed with it … the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony…” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§2025.450, subd. (a).) A party must object to a deposition no less than three
calendar days before deposition date. (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.410, subd. (b).)
Defendant timely objected but only grounds of a unilaterally set date and lack
of availability on set date. 
 
The basis of the motion relies on a served notice of
deposition to which Maximo purportedly failed to appear. The court finds the
unopposed motion sufficiently complies with all procedural requirements,
including a showing of the necessity of the deposition and efforts to meet and
confer. Defendant appears uncooperative in scheduling a mutually agreeable
deposition date. The motion is granted.
 
The court orders to meet and confer on a new deposition
within 10 days of this order, with the deposition to be completed no later than
20 days from the date of this order. If the parties are unable to agree and/or the
deponent fails to appear again after the setting of the date, Plaintiff may
unilaterally pick a date, attempt to conduct the deposition, and take a
subsequent notice of non-appearance, if applicable. Any subsequent
non-appearance may constitute grounds for an evidentiary, issue or even terminating
sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (h).)
 
Given the apparent unwillingness to cooperate, the court
additionally grants the motion in order to compensate Plaintiffs for the prior
non-appearances. Sanctions in the amount of $1,000, in order to cover any
potential expenses associated with the deposition itself and the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., §2025.450, subd. (g).) Sanctions entered against Empire Container
Freight Station, Inc. and counsel of record joint and severally. Payable within
30 days.
 
Plaintiff
to give notice.
