Summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The City of Santa Monica has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the alleged defect in the base of a delineator/sign post is trivial and does not create a dangerous condition. Lobanov, the plaintiff, has objected to various exhibits and declarations and argues that the defect is not trivial and creates a dangerous condition. The Court finds that the City has met its initial burden to show that the defect is trivial, but Lobanov has disputed the City's measurement of the base height and has provided admissible expert testimony that the base is not flush with the street. Therefore, the Court denies the City's motion for summary judgment, finding that there is a triable issue of material fact as to the dangerous condition element.
