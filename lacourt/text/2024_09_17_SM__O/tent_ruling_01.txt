TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant
City of Santa Monica’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. Plaintiff meets
her burden to prove the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to the
existence of a dangerous condition.. 
 
            Plaintiff
Victoria Lobanov’s Objections to the Wolfe Declaration are OVERRULED as to No.
1–4, and SUSTAINED as to No. 5 (legal conclusion), 6, 7.
 
            Plaintiff
Victoria Lobanov’s Objections to the Flores Declaration are OVERRULED as to No.
1, 2.
 
Plaintiff Victoria Lobanov’s
Objections to the Luna Declaration are OVERRULED as to No. 1–4. 
 
Plaintiff Victoria Lobanov’s
Objections to the Defendant’s Exhibits are OVERRULED as to No. 1–8, and
SUSTAINED as to No. 9–12 (lack of foundation, authentication)
 
Defendant’s objections to the
declaration of Mark J. Burns nos. 1-15 and nos. 16 and 17 (ex. 6 and 7) are OVERULLED.
 At the summary judgment stage, courts
must construe the opposing party's evidence liberally. (Garrett v. Howmedica
Osteonics Corp. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 173, 189.) “In light of the
rule of liberal construction, a reasoned explanation required in an expert
declaration filed in opposition to a summary judgment motion need not be as
detailed or extensive as that required in expert testimony presented in support
of a summary judgment motion or at trial.” (Ibid.; see also Michaels
v. Greenberg Traurig, LLP (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 512, 524 [“a reasoned
explanation required in an expert declaration filed in opposition to a summary
judgment motion need not be as detailed or extensive as that required in expert
testimony presented in support of a summary judgment motion or at trial”]
 
  
REASONING
            “A party is
entitled to summary judgment only if it meets its initial burden of showing
there are no triable issues of fact and the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. This is true even if the opposing party fails to
file any opposition. The court's assessment of whether the moving party has
carried its burden—and therefore caused a shift—occurs before the court's
evaluation of the opposing party's papers. Therefore, the burden on the motion
does not initially shift as a result of what is, or is not, contained in the
opposing papers.” (Mosley v. Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (2020)
49 Cal.App.5th 417, 434–435 [landlord’s failure to address issue of whether
they were aware of their tenant’s marijuana growing operation was not grounds
to grant summary judgment where moving party failed to satisfy its initial
burden as to the issue]; Thatcher v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (2000) 79
Cal.App.4th 1081, 1086-1087 [court cannot grant summary judgment based merely
on lack of opposition; court must first determine if the moving party has
satisfied its burden].) 
 
            In
addition, the evidence and affidavits of the moving party are construed
strictly, while those of the opponent are liberally read. (Government
Employees Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 100. “All doubts
as to the propriety of granting the motion (whether there is any issue of
material fact [Code of Civil Procedure] § 437c) are to be resolved in favor of
the party opposing the motion (i.e., a denial of summary judgment).” (Hamburg
v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 497, 502.)
 
 
I.               
Defendants Meet Their Burden to Show that
Plaintiff cannot establish the Dangerous Condition Element of the causes of
action
 
            
            Where a
defendant seeks summary judgment or adjudication, he must show that either “one
or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot
be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.”
(Code Civ. Proc. §437c(o)(2).) A defendant may satisfy this burden by showing
that the claim “cannot be established” because of the lack of evidence on some
essential element of the claim. (Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31
Cal.App.4th 574, 590.) Once the defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts
to plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists
as to that cause of action or defense thereto.” (Id.) If unable to prove
the existence of a triable issue of material fact, summary judgment or summary
adjudication in favor of the defendant is proper. (Id.)
 
Defendant City Santa Monica (the
“City”) moves for summary judgment Plaintiff Victoria Lobanov’s (“Lobanov”)
entire complaint arguing that the dangerous condition element cannot be met and
thus the complaint fails as matter of law. The Complaint contains two causes of
action including: 1. Dangerous Conditions of Public Property in violation of
Government Code § 835 et seq, and 2. Negligence, assumed to be based on a
violation of Government Code § 835 due the incorporation of all previous
allegations within the cause of action. (See generally FAC.) 
 
Section 835 provides as follows: 
 
Except as provided
by statute, a public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous
condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in
a dangerous condition at the time of the injury, that the injury was
proximately caused by the dangerous condition, that the dangerous condition
created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred,
and that either: 
 
(a) A negligent or
wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope
of his employment created the dangerous condition; or 
 
(b) The public
entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition under
Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to
protect against the dangerous condition.


(Gov. Code, § 835.)
 
            To prevail
on this type of claim, Lobanov must establish four elements: (1) the existence
of dangerous condition; (2) proximate cause; (3) foreseeability of type of
harm; and (4) negligence in the creation of, or notice of, the dangerous
condition. (See Frazier v. County of Sonoma (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 454,
458.)
 
            Government
Code § 830 defines a “Dangerous condition” to mean “a condition of
property that creates a substantial (as distinguished from a minor, trivial or
insignificant) risk of injury when such property or adjacent property is used
with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be
used.” (Gov. Code, § 830.) “A public entity is not liable for minor or trivial
property defects that do not create a substantial risk of injury when the
property is used with due care.” (Castro v. City of Thousand Oaks (2015)
239 Cal.App.4th 1451, 1457, citing Gov. Code, § 835.2.) “The existence of a
dangerous condition is ordinarily a question of fact but can be decided as a
matter of law if reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion. (Id.
at p. 1458.)
 
            “The rule
which permits a court to determine “triviality” as a matter of law rather than
always submitting the issue to a jury provides a check valve for the
elimination from the court system of unwarranted litigation which attempts to
impose upon a property owner what amounts to absolute liability for injury to
persons who come upon the property.” (Ursino v. Big Boy Restaurants
(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 394, 399.)
 
            “Sidewalk
elevations ranging from three-quarters of an inch to one and one-half inches
have generally been held trivial as a matter of law.” (Huckey v. City of
Temecula (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1092, 1107, collecting cases.) “The court's
analysis of whether a walkway defect is trivial involves as a matter of law two
essential steps. First, the court reviews evidence regarding type and size of
the defect. If that preliminary analysis reveals a trivial defect, the court
considers evidence of any additional factors [bearing on whether the defect
presented a substantial risk of injury]. If these additional factors do not
indicate the defect was sufficiently dangerous to a reasonably careful person,
the court should deem the defect trivial as a matter of law.” (Id. at p.
1105.) Such other factors the courts may consider are the following:
"whether there were any broken pieces or jagged edges in the area of the
defect, whether any dirt, debris or other material obscured a pedestrian's view
of the defect, the plaintiff's knowledge of the area, whether the accident
occurred at night or in an unlighted area, the weather at the time of the
accident and whether the defect has caused any other accident." (Ibid.)

 
Size of the defect is “[t]he most
important of these factors—for determining whether a given defect may be deemed
trivial as a matter of law.”(Stathoulis v. City of Montebello (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 559, 568.) “[I]t is also true that as the size of the depression
begins to stretch beyond one inch the courts have been reluctant to find that
the defect is not dangerous as a matter of law.” (Ibid.)
 
            The City
argues that Lobanov testified, and the evidence shows, that Lobanov’s “shoe got
stuck under the [. . .] plate” of a delineator/sign base (“base”) 15 inches
outside and east of a marked cross-walk while crossing California Avenue
causing Lobanov’s alleged injury. (SSUF, ¶¶ 15–22; ; Chung Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 18,
Lobanov Depo., 26:24-27:21, 30:4-22, 43:23-44:19, 53:15- 57:8) The City argues that
from the Lobanov’s testimony, the plate to which Lobanov refers to is just the
plastic housing of the base, which “is only one inch in height,” with the
tallest screw on the base sitting at “1.25 inches from the asphalts surface.” (SSUF,
¶¶ 7–8; Wolfe Decl., ¶¶ 9, 10; Ex. 20, Haro Dep., 59:1-7, 59:25-61:16.) 
 
The City argues that the Court
should only look at the base height of one inch, and not the height of the
screws protruding from the base, citing to Huckey to explain that the
height differential between the base and the screws is not a tripping hazard
since the place where Lobanov tripped was no more than 1 inch high.” (See Huckey,
supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1108 [“The City met its initial burden by
making a prima facie showing that the height differential was not a tripping
hazard, because plaintiff likely tripped on it where it was no more than one
inch high, that there were no broken concrete pieces or jagged concrete edges
in the height differential or seam between the two concrete panels at the time
plaintiff fell, and that, as far as the City knew, no other persons other than
plaintiff had tripped or fallen on the height differential.”].) The City argues
that even if the Court were to consider the full height of the base with the
screws, the maximum height is “less than an inch and half in height” thus still
considered trivial by some trial courts. (SSUF, 4–9, 22.)
 
The City argues the additional
factors show the condition was trivial as well as the height of the base. The
City argues and provides evidence including:
 
1.    
“The plastic body of the base is intact and undamaged.”
(SSUF, ¶ 9; Wolfe Decl., ¶ 9.)
2.    
“In the year before the incident, Plaintiff had visited
her mother at her residence at this location almost every day,” Plaintiff had parked
in the same area previously, and had visited her mother the night before the
incident. (SSUF, ¶¶ 17. 23; Chung Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 18, Lobanov Depo., at pp. 20:18-20,
27:22-28:3–8.)
3.    
“there were no shadows or any debris blocking
[Lobanov’s] view of the base.” (SSUF, ¶ 28; Chung Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 18, Lobanov
Dep. at p. 26:18-23.) 
4.    
The intersection was illuminated by a streetlight,
however “Lobanov does not recall the lighting in the intersection at the time.”
(SSUF, ¶ 30; Chung Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 18, Lobanov Depo., at pp. 64:6–65:25,
67:15–18.)
5.    
“The City has no record or information of any prior
complaints of any trip and falls involving the sign base at 7th and California,”
the site of the incident. (SSUF, ¶ 14; Mack Decl., ¶ 3; Bagnard Decl., ¶ 4;
Peterson Decl., ¶ 4; Issagholian Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
The Court finds that the Defendants
have met their initial burden to show that the defect is trivial and that
Lubanov cannot meet the dangerous condition element of her claims. The total
height of the base at less than one and a half inches, plus the lack of other
defects, the intersection was illuminated, Lubanov’s familiarity with the area,
and the lack of prior complaints of any trip and falls, all weigh in favor of
finding the defect was not a dangerous condition. 
 
Additionally, The City argues that
the 2nd cause of action for Negligence fails as matter of law because
only common law negligence is alleged, which is not actionable against a public
entity. (See Gov. Code § 815, legislative committee comments [In the
absence of a constitutional requirement, public entities may be held liable
only if a statute (not an ordinance or regulation) is found declaring them to
be liable.].) The City argues Lubanov fails to allege vicarious liability of
the City’s employees, i.e there are no allegations of the City’s employees
committing a tort or other actionable act within the scope of employment, or
that there was some statutory basis for the claim. (Motion, pp. 15–16.) 
 
The Court is not persuaded. It is
true that the FAC does not include the specific statute within the negligence
cause of action, however, the negligence cause of action incorporates all
previous allegations and causes of action including the 1st cause of
action for violation of Gov. Code § 835. (See FAC, ¶ 17.) Thus, the City
was put on notice of the statutory violation through incorporation of all
allegations. Additionally, Lubanov alleges vicarious liability through the
City’s employees’ actions, naming the employees as DOES 1–50, and, that the
City had constructive or actual notice of the alleged defect. (See FAC, ¶¶ 11,
12, 17–24.) Thus, the City’s argument that the FAC fails to properly allege a
negligence cause of action fails. The FAC states a negligence claim against the
City pursuant to a violation of Gov. Code § 835.
 
However, the City still met their
burden showing that one element of an Gov. Code § 835 violation cannot be
met. Thus, the burden now shifts to the Plaintiff to show a triable issue of
fact as the dangerous condition element of their claims. 
 
II.            
Plaintiff Meets Their Burden To Show a Triable
Issue of Material Fact as to the Dangerous Condition Element. 
 
Lobanov argues and points to the
same deposition the City provided to show that Lobanov stated she is ‘not a
hundred percent sure” where her foot hit on the base and that she “can’t
speculate,” and as to where her foot contacted the base. (See SSUF, ¶ 22; Plaintiff’s
Compendium of Evidence (“Plaintiff’s Evidence”), Binder Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 13
(“Lobanov Depo”) at pp. 57:10-25; 58:9-14.) Lobanov points to testimony within
the deposition where she states she did not recall how bright the lights were
at the intersection, the “lightbulb was not as bright” as shown in the picture
of the intersection at the deposition, and stated where she fell was “dark” and
“[t]here was no lights there.” (SSUF, ¶ 30, 31; Lobanov Depo., at pp. 26:18-23;
64:18-21.) 
 
Lobanov provides expert testimony
that the subject delineator base was not flush with the street, and “as high as
1- 3/8 inch” in height differential, disputing the City’s testimony that the
base was 1.25 inches high. (SSUF, ¶¶ 6, 8; Plaintiff’s Evidence, Burns Decl., ¶
8, Ex. 2, 8; Binder Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 14 (“Haro Depo”) at pp. 27:10–25, 29:21–25,
30:1–8.) 
 
Lobanov provides additional
disputed facts via admissible expert testimony that the City bolted the subject
delineator to the ground at the incident intersection, normally a procedure
reserved for major roadways not near pedestrian walkways in residential areas,
when it is standard procedure for the City to epoxy the delineator base to the
ground in residential areas. (Additional Disputed Facts (“ADF”), ¶¶ 8–10;
Plaintiff’s Evidence, Burns Decl., ¶ 10; Binder Decl., ¶ 4, Haro Depo., at pp. 11:16-25,
31:5-12, 26:9-10, 27:5-21, 40:1- 13, 43:12-17; 56:8-12, 62:22-25, 63:1-12,
64:10-16.
 
Lobanov provides enough admissible
evidence to show a dispute of material fact as to the dangerous condition
element of the alleged defect. The Court cannot as a matter of law state that
the delineator base was trival and thus not a dangerous condition. The over one-inch
base height, the possible lighting issue at the intersection, and the fact that
the base should have been epoxied instead of bolted, could lead a reasonable
juror to decide the defect was not trivial. Lubanov also disputes the City’s heigh
measurement argument, since Lubanov’s testimony does not definitively state she
tripped on the base plate which measures only one inch high. Lubanov stated
that she does not recall where her shoe made contact with the place and thus,
Lubanov may have made contact with the bolts measuring between 1.25 and 1-3/8’s
inches high. Since most trial courts are reluctant to state a defect over one
inch is trivial as a matter of law, this Court cannot as well. 
 
            The City’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
