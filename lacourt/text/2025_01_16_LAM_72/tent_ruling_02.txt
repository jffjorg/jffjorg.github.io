 Case No: 24STCV19399
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: January 16, 2025
 Calendar Number: 8



 
 
 
Defendant Brandi D’Amore (“Defendant”) moves for an award of
attorney’s fees and costs against Plaintiff 5959 Franklin Bliss, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) under Code of Civil Procedure, section 425.15, subd. (c)(1).
 
The Court tentatively grants Defendant’s motion in the
amount of $43,237.39, consisting of $42,560 in attorney’s fees and $677.39 in
costs.
 
The Court requests that Campbell provide further information
on the nature of defense counsel’s fee arrangement with Defendant in order to
confirm that fees are not being split with a non-attorney.
 
Background
 
This is a private nuisance case.
 
Plaintiff is the owner of real property located at 5959
Franklin Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90028 (the “Franklin Property”) and 1915 N.
Tamarind Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90068 (the “Tamarind Property”). (Complaint ¶¶
5, 13.)
 
Plaintiff filed this action on August 2, 2024. Based on the
three sets of alleged complaints by Defendant described above, Plaintiff raised
claims for (1) private nuisance; and (2) injunctive relief including temporary
restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction.
 
On October 11, 2024, Defendant moved to strike the complaint
under Code of Civil Procedure, section 425.16. Plaintiff filed an opposition
and Defendant filed a reply.
 
            On
November 26, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion. Judgment
was entered in Defendant’s favor on December 10, 2024.
 
            On
December 12, 2024, Defendant moved for attorney’s fees. Plaintiff filed an
opposition and Defendant filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
A defendant who prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion is
generally entitled to recover attorney fees and costs. (Code Civ. Proc., §
425.16, subd. (c)(1).)
 
Attorney’s fees in anti-SLAPP motions are determined using
the lodestar method. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “Under
the lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the lodestar
figure—the reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate—based on a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly
compensation of each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Glaviano
v. Sacramento City Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744,
751.) 
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.) 
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff does not contest liability for attorney’s fees.
Plaintiff argues that the attorney’s fees sought are excessive.
 
Defendant requests attorney’s fees and costs in the total
amount of $51,244.89.
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
Lodestar
 
“[T]he major factors to be considered in determining the
reasonableness of attorneys’ fees [are]: the nature of the litigation, its
difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required and the skill employed in
handling the litigation, the attention given, the success of the attorney's
efforts, his learning, his age, and his experience in the particular type of
work demanded; the intricacies and importance of the litigation, the labor and
the necessity for skilled legal training and ability in trying the cause, and
the time consumed.” (Clejan v. Reisman (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 224, 241 [internal
citations and quotation marks omitted].) “Testimony or other direct evidence of
the reasonable value of the services need not be introduced, the knowledge and
experience of the trial judge being sufficient.” (Ibid.)
 
Defendant requests a lodestar amount of $42,560.00. This
amount consists of 17 hours for Frances Campbell at $750.00 per hour, 49.1
hours for Alexander Boone at $550.00 per hour, and 2.1 hours for JoAnne Belisle
and $550.00 per hour. The Court finds this amount to be reasonable on the facts
of this case. 
 
Plaintiff raises concerns that Defendant’s counsel may be
splitting fees with Defendant. Defense counsel Frances Campbell states in this
declaration that “[a]lthough this matter was undertaken on a contingency basis,
our firm still tracks time spent in the same manner as our hourly cases.”
(Campbell Decl. 15.) A defendant does not ordinarily obtain a recovery, and
Plaintiff has not filed a cross-complaint in this action. Thus, a defendant does
not ordinarily have a contingent fee arrangement in the ordinary sense of the
word.
 
The Court requests that Campbell clarify the nature of
defense counsel’s fee arrangement with Defendant in order to confirm that fees
are not being split with a non-attorney.
 
Lodestar Multiplier
 
Defendant requests a lodestar multiplier of 1.25. There is
nothing so exceptional about this case that a lodestar multiplier is warranted.
In fact, Plaintiff has provided evidence, and Defendant has admitted, that
defense counsel relied in significant part on templates in assembling the
motion. The Court has considered the various factors relating to a multiplier
and does not believe one is appropriate in this case. The Court does not grant
a multiplier.
 
Costs
 
Defendant requests $677.39 in costs. The Court finds these
costs to be reasonable.
