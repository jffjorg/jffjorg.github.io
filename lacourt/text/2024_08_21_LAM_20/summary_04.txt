```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against her. The defendant argues that the default is void because the plaintiff failed to serve her with a statement of damages prior to taking her default, and that the plaintiff's attempt at substituted service was defective. The judge agrees, finding that the plaintiff failed to establish proper substituted service by a preponderance of evidence. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's counsel's failure to warn the defendant of the default and the defendant's lack of notice of the lawsuit until after the default was entered was caused by counsel's mistake or negligence. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the default is set aside. The judge declines to award fees and costs to the defendant's counsel. The plaintiff is allowed to reattempt service.
