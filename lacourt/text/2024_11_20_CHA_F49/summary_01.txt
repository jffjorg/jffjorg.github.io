And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the pleadings and evidence in this case and has made a tentative ruling granting FCA US LLC's motion for summary judgment as to the first cause of action in the complaint. The dispute is about whether the Subject Vehicle qualifies as a "new motor vehicle" under the Song-Beverly Act and whether FCA US LLC has any liability for breach of express warranty.

The judge has found that FCA US LLC has provided undisputed evidence demonstrating that the Subject Vehicle was sold to Plaintiffs as a used vehicle, with 15,243 miles on it, from a retail seller, and does not qualify as a "new motor vehicle" under the Song-Beverly Act. The Court has also determined that undisputed material facts support the finding that no new warranties were issued by FCA US LLC to Plaintiffs at the time of the sale of the Subject Vehicle.

As a result, the Court concludes that FCA US LLC has met its initial burden to establish a prima facie showing that Plaintiffs cannot establish their first cause of action. The burden now shifts to Plaintiffs to demonstrate a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable material factual issue. However, Plaintiffs have failed to submit an opposition to the motion, thereby waiving any arguments in response to FCA's claims.

The Court finds that Plaintiffs have entirely failed to satisfy their burden, and as a result, the motion for summary judgment is granted.
