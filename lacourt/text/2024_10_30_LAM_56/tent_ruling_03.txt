MOVING PARTY: Defendant
and Cross-Complainant VST 2020-NPL1 REO, LLC (“VST”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
ESCROW OF THE WEST (“Plaintiff” or “Escrow”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint in interpleader against VST; Awal Investment, LLC; and Yona
Investment Group, LLC, related to the escrow transaction opened for the sale of
a property, for which Plaintiff provided escrow services.  
 
            On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion
for Discharge, Dismissal and Deposit of Funds (“Motion for Discharge”), seeking
an order allowing it to deposit disputed funds, to be discharged from further
liability, and to recover attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
On
July 9, 2024, the Court issued a Minute Order granting Plaintiff’s Motion for
Discharge, which provided, in relevant part, as follows:
 
For good cause
shown, relief is proper per CCP sections 386 and 386.5. Plaintiff is awarded
fees and costs in the amount of $5,423.98. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6) Plaintiff
is to be discharged from liability and dismissed from the action for
interpleader upon deposit of $63,000. The funds are to be deposited within 10
days.
 
(07/09/2024
Minute Order.)
 
            On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel filed a declaration requesting a correction to the 7/9/2024 Minute
Order to state that Plaintiff is to deposit $63,000 less the attorney’s fees
award of $5,423.98, which amounts to $57,576.02.  On July 12, 2024, the Court entered the Order
Granting Plaintiff’s Motion For Discharge, Dismissal And Deposit Of Funds By
Escrow Of The West (the “Order”).
 
            On July 29, 2024, VST filed the
instant Motion for Clarification of Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Discharge,
Dismissal and Deposit of Funds by Escrow of the West (the “Motion”).  Escrow filed an opposition on October 2,
2024, and VST filed a reply on October 11, 2024.  
 
DISCUSSION
            A trial court has inherent authority
to control its proceedings and enforce its orders. (See Code of Civ.
Proc., § 128 et seq.; Cal. Const. Art. VI, §§ 1, 4, & 10.)  Code of Civil Procedure section187 provides
the Court with “all the means necessary to carry [its jurisdiction] into
effect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 187 [“When jurisdiction is, by the Constitution or
this Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court or judicial officer,
all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also given; and in the
exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be not specifically
pointed out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process or mode of
proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of
this Code.”].)
 
In
reviewing a motion for a clarification of a prior order, the court has
the discretion to either approve the clarifications or reject them.  (See, e.g., Colonial Life &
Accident Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal. 3d 785; Center for
Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 185 Cal. App. 4th
866; and Lopez v. Larson (1979) 91 Cal. App. 3d 383.)
 
Here,
VST requests clarification of this Court’s July 12, 2024 Order (the “Order”).  Specifically, VST seeks to clarify whether,
through the Order, the Court intended to order that: (1) Escrow is discharged and
dismissed from the entirety of the dispute between the parties, including VST’s
Cross-Complaint; and (2) that the parties are restrained from further
prosecuting any actions against Escrow as to the events, acts, or omissions
underlying the interpleader complaint, including VST’s Cross-Complaint.
 
The
Court finds that clarification is necessary to accurately reflect its ruling in
the Minute Order dated July 9, 2024.  July 9, 2024 ruling, which discharged Escrow
from liability and dismissed it from the interpleader action only.  A correction to the Order is required to ensure
due process for VST and to preserve its right to pursue any claims it may have against
Escrow that do not relate to or arise from Escrow’s interpleader of funds.
            
RULING
            Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the
Motion, and clarifies that Escrow is discharged 
from liability in the interpleader action only.  The July 12, 2024 Order is amended as
follows: 
 
Paragraph
1 should read: “That Plaintiff, ESCROW OF THE WEST’s, motion for discharge and
dismissal is GRANTED, and ESCROW OF THE WEST, is discharged from any liability
to defendants arising from the funds interpleaded with the court, and dismissed
from the interpleader action.”
 
Paragraph
2 is stricken.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
