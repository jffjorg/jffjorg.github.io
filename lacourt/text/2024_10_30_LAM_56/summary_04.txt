And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff had filed a complaint against the LA Canada Unified School District, but failed to file proof of service, which led to the case being dismissed. The plaintiff's counsel claimed that he was injured in a fire and had extenuating circumstances that prevented him from filing the proof of service. The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to file the proof of service was due to excusable neglect and granted the motion. The case is reinstated, and the defendant must file a responsive pleading within 30 days. A case management conference is scheduled for November 13, 2023.
