And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for clarification of the previous order granting the plaintiff's motion for discharge, dismissal, and deposit of funds. The defendant seeks clarification of whether the court intended to discharge and dismiss the plaintiff from the entirety of the dispute, including the cross-complaint, and whether the parties are restrained from further prosecuting any actions against the plaintiff. The court finds that clarification is necessary to accurately reflect its ruling in the minute order dated July 9, 2024. The court grants the motion and clarifies that the plaintiff is discharged from liability in the interpleader action only. The court strikes paragraph 2 of the previous order and amends paragraph 1 to reflect the clarification.
