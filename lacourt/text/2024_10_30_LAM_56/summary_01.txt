The judge finds that the proposed amendments are justified and that allowing the amendment will not prejudice the defendants. The judge also notes that the liberal policy regarding amendment prevails, and it is an abuse of discretion to refuse the amendment. The Second Amended Complaint is to be separately filed and served within 15 days from the date of this order.
