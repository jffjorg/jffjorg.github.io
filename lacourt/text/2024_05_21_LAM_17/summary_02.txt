Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Ford Motor Company's motion for a protective order, which aims to limit the use of confidential documents in the case. The dispute centered on the form of the protective order, with Ford seeking modifications to the standard LASC Model Order. The judge found that good cause exists to grant the requested relief, as Ford's proposed order presents reasonable limitations on the use and maintenance of confidential materials. The judge's tentative ruling will become the final order unless a party submits an opposition or the court receives no response to the tentative ruling.
