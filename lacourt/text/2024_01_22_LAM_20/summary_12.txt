Significant Statements:
* The Court does not see why preemption or res judicata would apply to the extent that the subject transfer of assets never took place pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings.
* The idea that Defendants cannot be sued simply because MS filed a bankruptcy petition and there was a determination of no assets makes little sense.
* Responsibility for those debts and liabilities may still be imposed.
* A fraudulent conveyance is a transfer by the debtor of property to a third person undertaken with the intent to prevent a creditor from reaching that interest to satisfy its claim.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion for summary judgment or adjudication brought by the Defendants, namely M.S. Namazikhah D.M.D, Essential Endodontics, Inc., and Robert Hindin. The Plaintiff alleges that the transfer of assets from M.S. Namazikhah D.M.D to Essential Endodontics, Inc. was fraudulent. The Judge finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether the transfer was made with fraudulent intent and whether Essential Endodontics, Inc. acted in good faith and gave reasonably equivalent value. The Judge also finds that the bankruptcy court never ruled on the issue of whether the transfer was appropriate.

The Judge denies the motion for summary judgment or adjudication brought by the Defendants, as there are triable issues of fact regarding the fraudulent transfer claims. The Judge also grants the motion for summary judgment brought by Robert Hindin, finding that there is no evidence to establish a conspiracy between him and the other Defendants.

The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's contention is that Essential Endodontics, Inc. continued M.S. Namazikhah D.M.D's business debt-free with the same principal in the same location after making a transfer without sufficient consideration. The Judge finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether this was appropriate and whether Essential Endodontics, Inc. is an alter ego of M.S. Namazikhah D.M.D.

The Judge also notes that the bankruptcy proceedings did not result in a discharge of M.S. Namazikhah D.M.D's debts, and that the Plaintiff's claims do not actually call into question the bankruptcy proceedings. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's contention is that Essential Endodontics, Inc. is responsible for M.S. Namazikhah D.M.D's debts and liabilities, and that the transfer of assets was made to avoid paying those debts.
