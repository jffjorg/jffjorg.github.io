And here is the English-text summary:

This is a habitability matter involving a complaint filed by five minor children (Yandel Liliana Montoya, Francisco Javier Becerra, Melanie Becerra, Isaiah Joseph Becerra, and Nylah Leanne Becerra) against defendants L&B Real Estate, William Little, and William Little Co. on December 27, 2022. The children are seeking a trial preference under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36(b), which allows for a preference in cases involving wrongful death or personal injury where the party is under 14 years old and has a substantial interest in the case. The court finds that the minor children have a substantial interest as tenants of the subject premises and have suffered lead poisoning. Despite defendants' argument that the children do not have a substantial interest, the court rules that the motion for trial preference is granted. The trial date is set for May 20, 2024.
