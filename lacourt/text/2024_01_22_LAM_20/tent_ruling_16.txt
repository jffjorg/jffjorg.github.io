 This is an employment matter.  Defendant Riko Weimer International, LLC seeks to compel further responses to its requests for admission and form interrogatories from Plaintiff Jeremy Pfau. The Motions are denied without prejudice because Defendant failed to sufficiently meet and confer, only having sent a meet and confer letter the day before Plaintiff’s counsel was set to leave for holiday vacation.  Plaintiff’s counsel stated that he would meet and confer upon returning.  The Motions, however, were then filed without any further discussion.  Defendant merely states, “It is anticipated that meet and confer may resume at the end of the first week in January.”  This is not adequate or appropriate.  A substantive meet and confer effort is to take place before a discovery motion is filed.  The Court will not award sanctions at this time. Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
