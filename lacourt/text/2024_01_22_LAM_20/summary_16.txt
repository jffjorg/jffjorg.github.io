And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Riko Weimer International, LLC's motion to compel further responses to its requests for admission and form interrogatories from Jeremy Pfau without prejudice. The defendant failed to sufficiently meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel before filing the motion, despite the counsel stating he would meet and confer upon returning from holiday vacation. The court finds that a substantive meet and confer effort is necessary before filing a discovery motion, and therefore denies the motion. The court also does not award sanctions at this time. The moving party is directed to give notice. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, counsel are strongly encouraged to appear via LACourtConnect rather than in person if they do not submit on the tentative ruling.
