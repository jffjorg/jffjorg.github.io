BACKGROUND 
On
August 21, 2023, Plaintiff Michele Woodward (“Plaintiff”), by and through her
guardian ad litem, Mari Woodward, filed this action against Defendants Easter
Seals Southern California, Inc. (“Easter Seals”), Kathy Azzam (“Azzam”), City
of Los Angeles (“City”), and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises
liability. 
On
September 28, 2023, the Court appointed Mari Woodward to serve as Plaintiff’s
guardian ad litem. 
On
November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
December 4, 2023, the City filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Roes 1-10 for indemnification, apportionment of fault, and
declaratory relief. 
On
December 11, 2023, the City filed a first amended answer to the complaint. 
On
February 26, 2024, the Court granted the request of Easter Seals and Azzam for
a good faith settlement determination. 
On
June 20, 2024, Petitioner Mari Woodward (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to
approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s action. The petition was set for hearing
on July 31, 2024. On July 31, 2024, the Court spoke with Plaintiff and
Petitioner and continued the hearing to August 27, 2024. 
On
August 27, 2024, the Court issued an order and continued the hearing to October
22, 2024. The Court ordered Petitioner to file (1) a revised petition to
approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s action, (2) revised special needs trust
paperwork, and (3) a revised proposed order. The Court specified that the
revised submissions should address the issues raised in the Court’s order. 
On
October 8, 2024, Petitioner filed an amended petition to approve the compromise
of Plaintiff’s action.  On October 22,
2024, the Court issued an order and continued the hearing to November 25, 2024. 
On
November 27, 2024, Petitioner filed a revised petition to approve the
compromise of Plaintiff’s action.  The
petition was set for hearing on December 10, 2024.  The Court continued the hearing to January
21, 2025. 
On
January 3, 2025, Petitioner filed another revised petition to approve the
compromise of Plaintiff’s action. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for February 18, 2025. 
PETITIONER’S REQUESTS 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s pending action,
including placement of the net settlement proceeds in a special needs trust. 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Revised petition to approve minor’s compromise 
The revised petition addresses the issues raised in the Court’s prior orders. 
B.   Special needs trust 
1.    Notice to State agencies 
On October 2, 2024, Petitioner obtained an order in Plaintiff’s limited conservatorship
case in the Court’s Probate division (case number BP154977) to establish a special needs trust that will be funded with the settlement proceeds and for payment of attorney
fees relating to the trust.  Petitioner provided notice to
the three State agencies in connection with that petition.  The trust supervision already has been opened
(Probate case number 24STPB13247).  
2.    Proposed trust instrument 
The
proposed trust instrument meets the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule
7.903(c), and LASC rule 4.116(b) and has been approved by the Probate court in Plaintiff’s
limited conservatorship case. 
3.    Trustee and bond 
The
proposed initial co-trustees are Mari Woodward (parent/petitioner) and Andrew
Woodward (relationship unknown).  Consent
to serve as co-trustees is attached to the petition at Attachment 1.  
Normally,
bond is required of a trustee unless the trustee is a corporate fiduciary.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.903(c)(5); Prob. Code, § 2320.)  The proposed
co-trustees do not meet that definition and the Court therefore requires a bond.  The Probate Court has already required a $113,250.00 bond. 
4.    Proposed order 
Petitioner
should add the following language to Section 13 of the proposed order: 
(a)  “The net settlement proceeds ($107,961.46) shall be funded
into the approved special needs trust.” 
(b) “The Court finds under Probate Code section 3604,
subdivision (b), that: 
“The SNT beneficiary has a disability which substantially impairs the
individual’s ability to provide for her own care or custody and constitutes a
substantial handicap; 
“The SNT beneficiary is likely to have special needs that will not be met
without the trust; 
“The money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears
reasonably necessary to meet the SNT beneficiary’s special needs.” 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS the revised petition to approve the compromise
of Plaintiff Michele Woodward’s claim filed by Petitioner Mari
Woodward on January 3, 2025 subject to Petitioner’s submission of a revised
order. 
The
Court sets an OSC in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse in 60 days or
on the next available date to ensure funding of net settlement funds into the special
needs trust. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
