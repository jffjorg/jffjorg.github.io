 Case Number:  BC686132    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
December 8, 2017, Plaintiff Barbara Andrews (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Mark Judaken (“Judaken”), Kalnel Gardens, LLC (“Gardens”),
Nissan Woodworks, LLC, Garth Street, LLC (“Garth”), Cocal Real Estate
Investments, LLP (“Cocal”), Moko Management, LLC (“Moko”), and Does 1-99 for
premises liability, negligence, breach of contract, fraud/deceit/intentional
misrepresentations, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Plaintiff asserted each cause of action
against each defendant. 
On
February 16, 2018, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing substituted
service of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on
Defendants Judaken, Gardens, Garth, Nissan Woodworks, LLC, Cocal, and Moko on
February 13, 2018. 
On
September 18, 2018, the clerk entered the defaults of Defendants Judaken, Gardens, Garth, Nissan Woodworks, LLC, Cocal, and
Moko. 
On
October 24, 2019 and July 26, 2021, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants
without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
January 23, 2020, the Court granted the motion of Defendant Nissan Woodworks,
Inc. (“Nissan”), erroneously named as Nissan Woodworks, LLC, to set aside the
default of Defendant Nissan Woodworks, LLC. 
On
February 13, 2020, Nissan filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Roes 1-100 for implied indemnity, contribution and indemnity,
declaratory relief, negligence, and express indemnity. 
On
October 15, 2020, the Court dismissed Nissan’s cross-complaint without
prejudice at its request. 
On
October 16, 2020, Plaintiff filed a notice of lodging of a statement of damages.  The attached statement of damages was
prepared on pleading paper, not the mandatory Judicial Council statement of
damages form.  The statement of damages listed
$10 million in special damages, $25 million in general damages, and $100
million in punitive damages. 
On
January 6, 2021, the Court dismissed Nissan from Plaintiff’s complaint with
prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On September 27, 2021, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
motion for default judgment and entered judgment against Judaken, Gardens, Garth, Cocal, and Mok.  The Court awarded Plaintiff $559,354.61. 
Plaintiff
subsequently assigned the September 27, 2021 judgment to Guaranty Collection
Co., Inc. (“Guaranty”). 
On
June 26, 2024, the Court issued an abstract of judgment.  On October 9, 2024, the Court issued a writ
of execution. 
On
October 21, 2024, more than three years after the Court entered judgment, Judaken and Gardens (“Moving Defendants”) filed a motion to (1) vacate the default judgment, (2) vacate the default, (3) recall
the writ of execution, and (4) cancel the abstract of judgment.  The motion was set for hearing on December
12, 2024.  On November 14, 2024, Guaranty
filed an opposition.  On December 5, 2024, Moving Defendants filed a reply.  The Court continued the hearing to January
21, 2025. 
No
trial date is currently set. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Moving
Defendants asks the Court to (1) vacate the default judgment, (2) vacate the
default, (3) recall the writ of execution, and (4) cancel the abstract of
judgment. 
Guaranty
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
GUARANTY’S REQUEST FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
Granted:       4-8
Denied:        1-3LEGAL STANDARD
A.   Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d)
  Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), provides: 
“The court . . . may, on motion of either party after
notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) 

          “There
is no time limit to attack a judgment void on its face.”  (Pittman v. Beck Apartments Ltd.
(2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1021 (Pittman).)  A default that is void on the face of the
record when entered is subject to challenge at any time irrespective of the
lack of diligence in seeking to set it aside within the six-month period of
Code of Civil Procedure section 473.  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 5:490, p. 5-143
(Cal. Practice Guide).) 
          “ ‘A
judgment is considered void on its face only when the invalidity is apparent
from an inspection of the judgment roll or court record without consideration
of extrinsic evidence.  When a default
judgment has been taken, the judgment roll consists of the summons, with the
affidavit or proof of service; the complaint; the request for entry of default
. . . , and a copy of the judgment.’ ” 
(Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:490.1, p.
5-144, quoting Kremerman v. White (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 358, 370-371.) 
          “If the
[judgment’s] invalidity can be shown only through consideration of extrinsic
evidence, such as declarations or testimony, the order is not void on its
face.  Such an order must be challenged
within the six-month time limit prescribed by [Code of Civil Procedure] section
473, subdivision (b), or by an independent action in equity.”  (Pittman, supra, 20 Cal.App.5th
at p. 1021.) 
B.   Equitable authority to vacate judgment 
“Apart from any statute, courts have the inherent
authority to vacate a default and default judgment on equitable grounds such as
extrinsic fraud or extrinsic mistake.”  (Bae
v. T.D. Service Co. of Arizona (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 89, 97 (Bae),
citing Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981 (Rappleyea);
Olivera v. Grace (1942) 19 Cal.2d 570, 575.)  “ ‘Extrinsic fraud usually arises when a
party is denied a fair adversary hearing because he has been “deliberately kept
in ignorance of the action or proceeding, or in some other way fraudulently
prevented from presenting his claim or defense.” ’ ” (Ibid., quoting Kulchar
v. Kulchar (1969) 1 Cal.3d 467, 471 (Kulchar ).)  “In contrast, the term ‘extrinsic mistake’ is
‘broadly applied when circumstances extrinsic to the litigation have unfairly
cost a party a hearing on the merits. [Citations.] “Extrinsic mistake is found
when [among other things] ... a mistake led a court to do what it never
intended. . . .” ’ ” (Id. at pp. 97-98, quoting Rappleyea, supra,
8 Cal.4th at p. 981.) 
A party may file a motion seeking equitable relief
from a default and default judgment “ ‘even though the statutory period [for
relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)] has run.’ ”
(Bae, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 98, quoting County of San
Diego v. Gorham (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1229.) 
To set aside a default judgment based on extrinsic
mistake, the defaulted party must show (1) it has a meritorious case, (2) a
satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense, and (3) diligence in seeking
to set aside the default once the defaulted party discovered it.  (Bae, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at
p. 100.) 
C.   Statement of damages 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.11 provides in part: 
“(b) When a complaint is filed in an action to recover
damages for personal injury or wrongful death, the defendant may at any time
request a statement setting forth the nature and amount of damages being
sought. The request shall be served upon the plaintiff, who shall serve a
responsive statement as to the damages within 15 days. In the event that a
response is not served, the defendant, on notice to the plaintiff, may petition
the court in which the action is pending to order the plaintiff to serve a responsive
statement. 
“(c) If no request is made for the statement referred
to in subdivision (b), the plaintiff shall serve the statement on the defendant
before a default may be taken. 
“(d) The statement referred to in subdivision (b)
shall be served in the following manner: 
“(1) If a party has not appeared in the action, the
statement shall be served in the same manner as a summons. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11,
subds. (b), (c), (d)(1).) 
The
Legislature instructed the Judicial Council to “develop and approve an official
form for use as a statement of damages pursuant to [Code of Civil Procedure
sections] 425.11 and 425.115.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.12, subd. (b).) The Legislature also authorized the Judicial
Council to “prescribe by rule the form and content of forms used in the courts
of this state.”  (Gov. Code, § 68511.) 
Exercising
its statutory authority, the Judicial Council adopted form CIV–050 for
mandatory use for statements of damages. 
“Wherever applicable, [forms adopted by the Judicial Council for
mandatory use] must be used by all parties and must be accepted for filing by
all courts.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
1.31(a).) 
The
relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed
the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases where
damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in the statement
of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).) “The notice
requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker
v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures
that “defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have adequate notice
of the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment
other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has
been deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the matter
adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.)  A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction
if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or
statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494.) 
“Defaulting
parties have a constitutional right to adequate notice of the maximum judgment
that may be assessed against them [citation].” 
(Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:250, p. 5-66.)  However, “[i]n personal
injury and wrongful death actions, the complaint must not state the amount of
damages sought [citations].  Therefore,
before a default may be entered, plaintiff must serve defendant with a
statement of ‘the nature and amount of damages being sought.’ ”  (Id., ¶ 5:82, p. 5-27, citing Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.11.)  “[S]ervice [of
the statement of damages] after default but before prove-up [is] not
sufficient.”  (Ibid.) “The purpose
is to give defendant ‘one last chance’ to respond, knowing exactly what
judgment may be entered if he or she fails to appear.”  (Id., ¶ 5:83, p. 5-28.)  “Absent such statement, defendant lacks
notice of the actual liability threatened, so that any default judgment is
void.”  (Ibid.) 
Even
when a statement of damages is required, however, “improper allegations of
damages in the complaint may satisfy due process notice requirements.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:84.1,
p. 5-28.)  “Defendant has various
remedies (e.g., a motion to strike) to challenge improper pleadings.  Failure to pursue such remedies waives the
objection.”  (Ibid.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.  Moving Defendants' contention that the judgment and default are void 
          On February 16, 2018, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing substituted service of a statement of damages on each defendant on February 13, 2018.  On September 18,
2018, the clerk entered each defendant’s default.  On September 27, 2021, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for default
judgment and entered judgment against Moving Defendants, Garth, Cocal, and Mok for $559,354.61.  The judgment consisted of $400,000.00 in
general damages, $158,809.61 in special damages, and $545.00 in costs. 
Moving
Defendants argue the judgment against them is void and must be set aside
because Plaintiff did not serve a statement of damages using the mandatory
Judicial Council form but instead prepared the statement of damages using
pleading paper.  The statement of damages stated: 
“NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN to the Defendants herein, and
through their attorneys of record, that Plaintiff BARBARA ANDREWS claims the
following special, general and punitive damages: 
SPECIAL DAMAGES: $10,000,000.00
GENERAL DAMAGES: $25,000,000.00
PUNITIVE DAMAGES: $ 100,000,000,00”
           Moving Defendants observe that while the CIV-050 form requires
the plaintiff to list the damages sought against “one defendant only” (CIV-050),
Plaintiff’s statement of damages lists the damages sought against all
defendants.  In addition, while the
CIV-050 form requires the plaintiff to specify the nature of the special and
general damages (e.g., past medical expenses, emotional distress), Plaintiff’s
statement of damages contains only the special and general damages categories.           Based on the differences between Plaintiff’s statement of
damages and the CIV-050 form, Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiff violated
their due process right to notice of the potential damages sought against them,
rendering the default and default judgment void. 
The
Court finds that the default and default judgment are not void. 
As noted, Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11, subdivision (c),
provides, “the plaintiff shall serve the statement on the defendant before a
default may be taken.”  But the failure
to serve this notice does not render a default or resulting default judgment
void when the defendant received notice that satisfied due process
requirements—that is, formal notice of the potential consequences of failing to
defend the action.  As a result, while
entry of a default where the plaintiff failed to serve a statement of damages
under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11 may be voidable, it is not
necessarily void.  (See Greenup v.
Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 829-830 (Greenup).) 
In Greenup,
supra, 42 Cal.3d 822, the plaintiff filed a complaint against the
defendants alleging, among other things, infliction of emotional distress. The
plaintiff claimed damages “ ‘in a sum that exceeds the jurisdictional
requirements of this court.’ ” (Id. at p. 825.) “[T]he only specific sum
requested was $100,000 in exemplary and punitive damages: all other damages
were to be ‘subject to proof at time of trial’ or ‘as the court deems just.’ ”
(Ibid.) The trial court struck the defendants’ answer as a discovery
sanction and entered default judgment in the amount of $676,000. (Id. at
pp. 825–826.) On appeal, the Supreme Court observed that “[Code of Civil
Procedure] [s]ection 580, and related sections 585, 586, 425.10 and 425.11, aim
to ensure that a defendant who declines to contest an action does not thereby
subject himself to open-ended liability.” (Id. at p. 826.)
The
issue before the Supreme Court was whether the default judgment could stand
when the plaintiff “conced[ed] that she omitted to state an amount of damages
in her demand for judgment as section 425.10, subdivision (b), requires ....” (Greenup,
supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 826.) The plaintiff also had not complied with Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.11. The court explained “that due process
requires notice to defendants, whether they default by inaction or by willful
obstruction, of the potential consequences of a refusal to pursue their
defense. Such notice enables a defendant to exercise his right to choose—at any
point before trial, even after discovery has begun—between (1) giving up his
right to defend in exchange for the certainty that he cannot be held liable for
more than a known amount, and (2) exercising his right to defend at the cost of
exposing himself to greater liability.” (Id. at p. 829.) The court concluded
“[i]t would undermine this concern for due process to allow the judgment herein
to stand despite plaintiff’s failure to meet the requirements of [Code of Civil
Procedure] sections 425.10 or 425.11.” (Id. at p. 827.) 
The
court did not, however, find the entire default judgment invalid.  The court rejected the defendants’ argument
that because the “plaintiff stated no amount of damages in her prayer, she
[was] entitled to no compensatory damages whatever.” (Greenup, supra,
42 Cal.3d at p. 829.) The court instead concluded the allegation in the
complaint that the plaintiff “suffered damage ‘in an amount that exceeds the
jurisdictional requirements of this court[ ]’ ... gave sufficient notice to
defendants that she claimed at least $15,000 in compensatory damages.” (Id.
at p. 830.) The Supreme Court therefore reduced the compensatory damages award
to that amount. (Ibid.; see also Schwab v. Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991)
53 Cal.3d 428, 430-435 [distinguishing Greenup]; Cummings Medical
Corp. v. Occupational Medical Corp. (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1296-1297; Uva
v. Evans (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 356, 360-361; Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc.
(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1302.)           
Here,
too, even though Plaintiff did not use the mandatory CIV-050 form, Plaintiff gave
Moving Defendants notice of the special and general damages for which they
could be held liable.  This is not a case
where the plaintiff asserted different claims against different defendants, preventing each defendant from determining its potential
liability.  Instead, Plaintiff asserted
each claim in her complaint against all defendants.  As a result, Plaintiff’s statement of damages
listed amounts for which all defendants allegedly were liable.  Because Moving Defendants were
not denied due process, the default and default judgment are not void. 
Moving
Defendants make other arguments concerning ownership of the property and
relationship between the parties.  These
arguments would require consideration of extrinsic evidence.  “If the [judgment’s] invalidity can be shown only through consideration of extrinsic evidence, such as declarations or testimony, the order is not void on its face.  Such an order must be challenged within the six-month time limit prescribed by [Code of Civil Procedure] section 473, subdivision (b), or by an independent action in equity.”  (Pittman, supra, 20 Cal.App.5th at p. 1021.)  Moving Defendants filed their motion more than three years after the Court entered judgment.  The Court therefore does not consider these arguments
in deciding if the judgment is void on its face. 
B.   Request for equitable relief 
Moving
Defendants state that they are relying on the Court’s “inherent equitable power
to prevent an injustice” as well as Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(d).  (Motion p. 2.)  However, Moving Defendants have presented no argument
or authorities supporting an argument based on extrinsic fraud, extrinsic
mistake, or other ground for equitable relief. In their reply, Moving Defendants clarify that
they do not contend that the default judgment was the result of extrinsic
fraud.  (Reply p. 10.)  “Rather, [Moving] Defendants contend the
default judgment is void on the face of the record.”  (Reply p. 10.)  Moving Defendants have waived any request in this motion for
equitable relief. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the motion of Defendants Mark
Judaken and Kalnel Gardens, LLC to vacate the default judgment, vacate the
default, recall the writ of execution, and cancel the abstract of
judgment.  
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
