Here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for a protective order filed by Defendant Elvira's Wedding Chapel. The motion seeks to limit the scope of further sessions of Arnoldo Dheming's depositions and bar Plaintiff's daughter, Janet Orellana, from attending future depositions. The judge grants the motion in part and denies it in part. The judge orders that Plaintiff may question Dheming about both businesses (Elvira's Wedding Chapel and Escritorio Publico) which shared the restroom at the premises where Plaintiff allegedly slipped and fell, but only within the scope of the questions listed in the deposition notice. The judge also denies Defendant's request to exclude Janet Orellana from the depositions.
