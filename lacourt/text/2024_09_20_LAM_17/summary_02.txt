And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mural Media, LLC 401 K Plan (Plaintiff) vs. Linda J. Maultsby (Defendant). The Plaintiff has moved to compel responses to six sets of discovery, and the Defendant has moved for a protective order from the discovery. The judge has granted the Plaintiff's motions to compel discovery and denied the Defendant's motion for a protective order. The Defendant is sanctioned $350 per motion. The judge finds that the Defendant lacks standing to sue, and therefore, there is no good cause to grant the Defendant's request for a protective order. The case will proceed to a hearing on September 20, 2024, where the parties may submit on the tentative ruling.
