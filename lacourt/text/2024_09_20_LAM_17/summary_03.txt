And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are no material facts in dispute. The plaintiff, VIG Private Lending, Inc., brought an unlawful detainer action against the defendant, Ilan Kenig, after a foreclosure sale was held on January 17, 2024. The plaintiff submitted evidence showing that it is the owner of the property, that it properly served the defendant with a notice to quit on March 12, 2024, and that the daily fair market value of the property is at least $1,000.00.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has established its ownership of the property and its right to possession of the property through the foreclosure sale. The defendant did not oppose the motion and did not raise any triable issues as to title, service of notice, or market value.

The judge also finds that the defendant's affirmative defenses are inapplicable because they are based on the defendant's claims of being a tenant, which are contradicted by the defendant's own sworn declarations and loan application. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted, and the defendant is entitled to judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
