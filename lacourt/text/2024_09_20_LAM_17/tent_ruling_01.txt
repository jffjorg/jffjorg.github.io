CLAUDIA
  MARIA NUNEZ 
  
         vs.
 
FCA US
  LLC      

 


 Case No.: 
  23STCV20504 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 20, 2024




 
Plaintiff’s motion is MOOT. Defendant is sanctioned, jointly and
severally with counsel, $350.00 payable within 30 days.
 
            On 8/25/2024, Plaintiff Claudia
Maria Nunez (Plaintiff) filed suit against FCA US LLC (Defendant), alleging:
(1) breach of express warranty; (2) breach of implied warranty; (3) violation
of Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2; (4) violation of Tanner Consumer Protection
Act.
 
            On 6/21/2024, Plaintiff moved to
have its Requests for Admission (RFAs) (Set One) deemed admitted as to
Defendant. 
 
Discussion
 
            On 11/17/2023, Plaintiff served
Defendant with RFAs (Set One). Despite responses being due on or before
12/22/2023, no such responses were received. 
 
            In opposition, Defendant indicated
that responses were served on 9/4/2024. Accordingly, the substance off
Plaintiff’s motion is moot. 
 
Defendant also contended that its failure to timely respond was due
to excusable mistake: “Amidst the exponential increase in Song-Beverly matters,
a substantial increase in emails contributed to the oversight. While there are
protocols in place to try to avoid such errors, this is the type of excusable
human error can occasionally occur, especially in light of the overwhelming
increase in emails related to the unlimited growth of volume in these matters.
As a result, the error in failing to provide timely responses went unnoticed
and the deadline lapsed.” (Opp., 5: 12-16.) 
 
However, if this were sufficient to meet the substantial
justification standard for sanctions, sanctions would only be appropriate for
bad faith failures to respond. Here, Defendant failed to timely respond by
nearly nine months, and only provided responses after this motion was filed.
Accordingly, sanctions are appropriate. 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion is moot. Defendant is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel,
$350.00. ($350/hr x 1 hr.) 
 
It is so
ordered.
