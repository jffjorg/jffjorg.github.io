And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Claudia Maria Nunez (the plaintiff) and FCA US LLC (the defendant). The plaintiff had moved to have certain requests for admission (RFAs) deemed admitted as to the defendant, but the defendant failed to respond to these requests in a timely manner. The defendant claimed that its failure to respond was due to an "excusable mistake" caused by an overwhelming increase in emails related to a large volume of cases. However, the judge found that this was not sufficient to justify the defendant's failure to respond, and that the defendant had failed to provide responses for nearly nine months after the RFAs were served. As a result, the judge has imposed sanctions on the defendant, requiring it to pay $350.00 to the plaintiff. The judge has also ordered that the plaintiff's motion is moot, meaning that it is no longer necessary to consider the motion as the outcome has already been resolved.
