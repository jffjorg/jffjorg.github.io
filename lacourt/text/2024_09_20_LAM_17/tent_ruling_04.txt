GRAND
  PROMENADE 
 
         vs.
 
BERNARDO
  MORETTI 
  


 Case No.: 
  24STCV11638 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  September 20, 2024




 
 
Defendant’s
demurrer is OVERRULED.
 

On 5/9/2024, Plaintiff Grand Promenade
(Plaintiff) filed an unlawful detainer action against Benardo Moretti
(Defendant). 
 
            On
8/26/2024, Defendant demurred to Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
 
Discussion
 
            Defendant,
who is representing himself in propria persona argues that Plaintiff has
failed to state a claim because he claims that he paid Plaintiff rent. 
 
The Court
accepts well-pled allegations as true at the pleading stage. While it may be
that Defendant did, in fact, pay all rent due to Plaintiff, this is a factual
determination not properly made at this stage.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer is overruled. 

 
It is so ordered.
