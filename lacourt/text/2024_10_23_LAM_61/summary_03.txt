And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc., Ogletree Deakins Nash Smoak & Stewart, and Gabriel Medel, have filed a special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP) the plaintiff's malicious prosecution complaint. The court has granted the motion, finding that the complaint arises from protected activity under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The court has also found that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim. The plaintiff's claim is based on the defendants' filing of a petition for a restraining order and their offering of testimony in support of the petition, which the court has determined is protected activity. The court has therefore granted the defendants' motion to strike the complaint.
