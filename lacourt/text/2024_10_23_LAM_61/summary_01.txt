And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for protective order filed by Hexadyne Corporation and Robert Sanchez, which sought to prevent pre-trial discovery into Sanchez's alleged alter ego relationship with Hexadyne. The court found that the discovery was permissible because it was relevant to the determination of the alter ego issue. The motion also denied Hexadyne's request to bifurcate the trial and try its claim for quasi-contract in a bench trial before jury trial on Mason Electric Company, Inc.'s crossclaims. The court found that the claims should be tried together, and that if they are not presently ready for trial, a continuance of trial should be ordered.
