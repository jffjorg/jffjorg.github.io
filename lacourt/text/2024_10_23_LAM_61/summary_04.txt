And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Nicole Bechahed and Sami Bechahed, have moved to quash the service of summons, arguing that it was made by an impermissible means. The judge has granted the motion. The defendants were served by certified mail, but this method is only valid for out-of-state service. Since the service addresses are in California, the notice of acknowledgment of receipt required by California Code of Civil Procedure § 415.30 was not included. The plaintiff has filed no opposition to the motion. The judge has held that the service of summons was invalid and has granted the defendants' motion to quash.
