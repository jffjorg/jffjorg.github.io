Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Alexander Ghatan's motion to deem the truth of his requests for admission admitted. The Judge finds that Defendant Sherman Oaks-B, Inc. dba BMW of Sherman Oaks has substantially complied with the requests and has served responses prior to the hearing, which waives any objections to the requests. The Judge also denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against Defendant and its counsel. The Judge concludes that the motion is moot and that Defendant would suffer even if it had not served substantially compliant responses. The Judge notes that sanctions are mandatory against the party whose failure to serve a timely response necessitated the motion, but in this case, the Judge does not find that Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions.
