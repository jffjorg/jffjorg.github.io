And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a cross-complaint filed by Loren Properties, LLC, Westside Habitats, LLC, and John Patrick Graham against Sean Rose. The demurrer argues that the cross-complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to support a cause of action for breach of contract, assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and elder abuse. The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the cross-complaint sufficiently alleges a claim for breach of contract and that the allegations are sufficient to support claims for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and elder abuse. The Judge has also found that the cross-complainants have sufficiently alleged physical abuse of an elder under the Elder Abuse Act. The Judge's ruling is tentative and subject to change following the hearing on March 25, 2024.
