```

Here is a summary in English:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant/Cross-Complainant USG's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff's Complaint and Kamkar's Cross-Complaint. The ruling also denies USG's motion to bifurcate the trial. The court finds that USG owes a duty of care to Plaintiff under the Biakanja v. Irving factors, and that Kamkar's Cross-Complaint should not be dismissed. The court concludes that bifurcation would not expedite or simplify the trial, and therefore denies USG's motion to bifurcate.
