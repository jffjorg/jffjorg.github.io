And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling relates to a demurrer to a Cross-Complaint filed by Lootably, Inc. against Patrick Muh-En Lu. The Cross-Complaint alleges six causes of action, including recission of employment agreement, recission of stock restriction agreement, intentional and negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. The Plaintiff demurred to the Cross-Complaint, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The court notes that the parties have chosen Delaware law to govern the agreements at issue, but the Plaintiff has failed to show that Delaware law should be applied to this action. The court orders that the parties submit supplemental briefs on whether Delaware law should be used to interpret the employment agreement and stock restriction agreement, and whether Delaware law applies to this entire action.

The hearing on the demurrer is continued to February 9, 2024, with supplemental briefs due on January 24, 2024, and January 31, 2024.
