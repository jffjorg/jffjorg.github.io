And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants 147-151 W. 25th St., LLC's motion to tax costs in part, but denies it in part. The judge finds that the prevailing party, Tenants (CJWorld-LA and Chang Lee), are entitled to costs as a matter of right. The court also finds that the costs incurred by Tenants were reasonably necessary to the litigation.

The judge grants the motion to tax costs in part because some of the filing fees incurred by Tenants were unreasonable and resulted in sanctions against them. The judge denies the motion to tax costs in part because the costs incurred by Tenants were reasonably necessary to the litigation and were incurred in good faith.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, the California Rules of Court, and the case law cited in the ruling.
