147-151 W. 25th

Procedural
Background        
            On March 4, 2019, Plaintiff 147-151
W. 25th St., LLC filed the action numbered 19STCV07425 (“Lead
Action”).  On December 16, 2019, 147-151
W. 25th St., LLC filed the operative First Amended Complaint against
Chang Lee, CJWorld-LA and GRG Collective, LLC[1]
asserting causes of action for (1) Breach of Written Contract, (2) Vandalism,[2]
[Violation of Penal Code § 594], (3) Intentional Misrepresentation, and (4)
Declaratory Relief.
            On
October 31, 2019, Plaintiffs CJWorld-LA, Chang Lee, and Eric Lee (collectively “CJWorld
Parties” or “Tenants”) initiated the 19STCV39298 action (“Related Action”).  On January 29, 2021, CJWorld Parties filed
the operative Third Amended Complaint asserting claims against Defendants 25th
St. LLC, Babak Aframian, and Avi Aframian (collectively, for purposes of this
motion, “Defendants” or “Landlords”), as well as Downtown Natural Caregivers,
Inc., Lex W. Yoo[3];
Christopher James Giordano; Yun T. Kang; Charles Dunn Company, Inc.; William
Christopher Steck; and Brent Yoonmoo Koo. The Third Amended Complaint in the
Related Action asserted thirteen causes of action for: (1) Fraud; (2)
Negligence; (3) Breach of Written Contract; (4) Breach of the Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing; (5) Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; (6)
Wrongful Eviction; (7) Trespass to Chattels; (8) Intentional Interference with
Contractual Relations; (9) Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic
Relations; (10) Specific Performance; (11) Violation of the Unfair Competition
Law; (12) Unjust Enrichment; and (13) Return of Security Deposit.[4]
            On December 16, 2019,
Cross-Complainants 147-151 W. 25th St., LLC, Babak Aframian, and Avi Aframian (the Landlords) filed a cross-complaint in
the related action against William Christopher Steck,
Christopher James Giordano, Charles Dunn Company, Downtown Natural
Caregivers, Inc. (“DNC”), Yun T. Kang (“Kang”), Brent Yoonmo Koo, Lex W. Yoo,
and Sperry Commercial Global Affiliates. 
The cross complaint alleged causes of action for
(1) breach of written contract, (2) intentional misrepresentation, (3) fraud in the
inducement, (4) professional negligence, (5) breach of fiduciary duty, (6)
Violation of Civil Code § 2079.16 et seq., (7) breach of covenant of good faith
and fair dealing, (8) implied indemnity, (9) comparative indemnity, (10)
equitable indemnity, and (11) declaratory relief.
On October 9, 2020, the Court sustained
cross-defendants DNC and Kang’s demurrer to the second, eighth, ninth, tenth,
and eleventh causes of action of the Landlords’ cross-complaint.  In doing so, the Court granted leave to amend
as to the second and eleventh causes of action. 
(Order 10/9/20.)
On October 14, 2020, 147-151 W. 25th
St., LLC, Babak Aframian, and Avi Aframian filed the operative First Amended Cross-Complaint
(“FACC”) asserting the same causes of action[5]
for (1) breach of written contract, (2) intentional misrepresentation, (3)
fraud in the inducement, (4) professional negligence, (5) breach of fiduciary
duty, (6) violation of Civil Code § 2079.16 et seq., (7) breach of covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, (8) implied indemnity, (9) comparative indemnity,
(10) equitable indemnity, and (11) declaratory relief.  Only the first, second, and eleventh causes
of action were asserted against cross-defendants DNC and Kang.  On April 7, 2021, the Court sustained DNC and
Kang’s demurrer to the second cause of action without leave to amend.  (Order 4/7/21.)
            On December 4, 2019, the Court
deemed the cases related and designated 19STCV07425 to serve as the lead
action.  (Minute Order 12/4/19.)  On June 1, 2021, the Lead Action and Related
Action were consolidated for all purposes. 
(Order 6/1/21.)  On June 2, 2022, Plaintiff
147-151 W. 25th St., LLC, Babak Aframian, and Avi Aframian dismissed
Defendants Christopher James Giordano, Charles Dunn Company, Inc., and William
Christopher Steck from their complaint in the Lead Action.  On June 2, 2022, Cross-Complainants
Christopher James Giordano, Charles Dunn Company, Inc., and William Christopher
Steck dismissed their cross-complaint filed on December 2, 2020.  On June 2, 2022, CJWorld Parties dismissed Christopher
James Giordano from their complaint in the related action.  On June 3, 2022, CJWorld Parties dismissed Brent
Koo from their complaint in the related action.
            On November 28-30, 2022, December
5-8, 2022, and December 12-14, 2022, the Lead and Related Actions came on for two
phases of a consolidated jury trial.  On
the breach of contract claim of Landlords’ First Amended Complaint, the jury found
in favor of Landlord 147-151 W. 25th St LLC and against Tenants and
awarded $17,500 of unpaid rent for September 2019 bur declined to award any
clean up costs or repairs/reconstructions/renovation/
remedial
work for damages sustained at the subject property.  On Tenants’ Third Amended Complaint, the jury
found in favor of CJWorld-LA and Chang Lee and against 147-151 W. 25th
St LLC and Avi Aframian as to Tenants’ claims for concealment, intentional
misrepresentation, breach of written contract, breach of implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and
wrongful eviction, and the jury awarded $20,250 for lost plants and $337,609
for lost profits, and $30,000 for emotional distress on Chang Lee’s wrongful
eviction claim, but the jury declined to award any amount for additional rent
at the Tenants’ new warehouse or for the security deposit.  The jury also found in favor of Eric Lee and
against 147-151 W. 25th St LLC, Avi Aframian, and Babak Aframian as
to Eric Lee’s claim for trespass to chattels, but the jury declined to award
any amount for Eric Lee’s emotional distress resulting from the trespass to
chattels.  The jury made findings of
oppression, fraud, or malice, thereby necessitating a second phase of trial on
punitive damages.  At the conclusion of
phase 2, the jury declined to award any amount of punitive damages against Landlords.
Following the jury trial, the Court held an
uncontested prove up hearing regarding 25th Street LLC’s claims
against DNC and Kang on December 14, 2022. 
On December 14-15, 2022, the Court held an uncontested prove up hearing
regarding CJWorld and Chang Lee claims against DNC and Kang.  
On February 14, 2023, after an offset, the
Court entered judgment on the Third Amended Complaint in the Related Action in
favor of Plaintiff CJWorld-LA against Defendants 147-151 W. 25th
St., LLC and Avi Aframian, jointly and severally, in the sum of $340,359.00 and
in favor of Plaintiff Chang Lee, jointly and severally in the amount of
$370,359.00 against Defendants 147-151 W. 25th St., LLC and Avi
Aframian.  As to the Third Amended
Complaint in the Related Action, the Court entered judgment in favor Plaintiffs
CJ-World LA and Chang Lee and against Defendants Downtown Natural Caregivers,
Inc. and Yun T. Kang, jointly and severally in the sum of $357.859.00.  As to the First-Amended Cross-Complaint in
the Related Action, the Court entered judgment in favor of 25th St LLC against
Cross-Defendants DNC and Kang jointly and severally for a total judgment of
$958,725.62.  
On February 28, 2023, CJWorld-LA and Chang
Lee (jointly “Tenants”) filed a memorandum of costs.  On March 20, 2023, 147-151 W. 25th
St., LLC (“Landlord”) filed a motion to tax costs.  On October 26, 2023, Tenants filed an
opposition.  On November 1, 2023, Landlord
filed declarations in support of the reply, but no reply was timely filed.
 
Legal Standard
“A prevailing party is entitled ‘as a
matter of right’ to recover costs in any action or proceeding unless a statute
expressly provides otherwise.”  (Segal v.
ASICS America Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 658.)  “Section 1033.5 sets forth the types of
expenses that are and are not allowable as costs under section 1032.
Specifically, subdivision (a) of section 1033.5 describes items that are
‘allowable as costs,’ subdivision (b) describes items ‘not allowable as costs,
except when expressly authorized by law,’ and section 1033.5(c)(4) provides
that ‘[i]tems not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon application
may be allowed or denied in the court's discretion.’”  (Ibid.)
For a cost to be recoverable, it must be
reasonably necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s
Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) If
the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is
on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)  On the other
hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue, and the
burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.)  
California Rule of Court, Rule 3.1700
requires that “[a]ny notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served
and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum
was served by mail, the period is extended” by up to 20 days. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).) Additionally, “[T]he court may extend the times for
serving and filing the cost memorandum or the notice of motion or tax costs for
a period not to exceed 30 days.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(3).)  
 
Discussion
Timeliness of the Instant Motion
California Rule of Court, Rule 3.1700
requires that “[a]ny notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served
and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum
was served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code
of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum was served
electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)  Additionally, “the court may extend the times
for serving and filing the cost memorandum or the notice of motion or tax costs
for a period not to exceed 30 days.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1700(b)(3).)  
            Here,
Tenants served the memorandum of costs electronically on February 28,
2023.  Accordingly, Landlord had until
March 17, 2023 to file a timely motion to tax. 
Landlord did not file the instant motion until March 20, 2023, which is untimely.  However, the accompanying declaration of
Danny Tamayo notes that the delay in filing was due to an error with the
electronic filer.  (Tamayo Decl. ¶¶
2-4.)  Moreover, the proof of service
denotes that Landlord timely served Tenants with the instant motion on March
15, 2023.  Accordingly, the Court will extend
the time by three days for filing of the instant motion, and the Court will consider
the untimely filing on the merits.
 
Tenants are Entitled to Costs
            Landlord
contends that the entire memorandum of costs should be stricken as Tenants are
not the prevailing party.  The Court
disagrees.
            “Code
of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (a)(4) defines the ‘prevailing
party\’ in litigation to include ‘the party with a net monetary
recovery’[.]”  (DeSaulles v. Community
Hospital of Monterey Peninsula (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1140, 1144.)  “A ‘prevailing party,’ so defined, ‘is
entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.’ (§
1032, subd. (b).)”  (DeSaulles, supra,
62 Cal.4th at p.1144.)
            As
noted in the procedural history above, on February 14, 2023, after an offset,
the Court entered judgment on the Third Amended Complaint in the Related Action
in favor of Plaintiff CJWorld-LA against Defendants 147-151 W. 25th
St., LLC and Avi Aframian, jointly and severally, in the sum of $340,359.00 and
in favor of Plaintiff Chang Lee, jointly and severally in the amount of
$370,359.00 against Defendants 147-151 W. 25th St., LLC and Avi
Aframian.  Thus, Tenants have obtained a
net monetary recovery, making them the prevailing party.  Tenants are entitled to costs as a matter of
right.
 
Apportionment
            Landlord
contends that the costs should be apportioned because the instant action
involved numerous different parties.  However,
the Court lacks authority to apportion such costs.
            “Apportionment
of costs is authorized, at the court's discretion, only under those
comparatively unusual circumstances when the court must determine which party
prevailed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)”  (Smock v. State of California (2006)
138 Cal.App.4th 883, 889.)  Here, Tenants
clearly prevailed, and as such, a determination of apportionment is unnecessary
and improper.  Moreover, Landlord fails
to cite any statutory authority permitting such apportionment.  “[T]he prevailing party is entitled to all of
his costs unless another statute provides otherwise. [Citation.] Absent such
statutory authority, the court has no discretion to deny costs to the
prevailing party.”  (Nelson v.
Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) 

 
Reasonably Incurred Costs
            “If
items on a memorandum of costs appear to be proper charges on their face, those
items are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services are
proper and necessarily incurred. [Citation.] The burden then shifts to the
objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.”  (Doe v. Los Angeles County Dept. of
Children & Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 675, 693.)  “[T]he objecting party has the burden to show
that a cost item is unrecoverable because it was not necessary to the
litigation.”  (Hooked Media Group,
Inc. v. Apple Inc. (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 323, 338.)  “It is not necessary that the [moving party],
…, accompany the motion to tax cost with any affidavit.”  (State of California v. Meyer (1985)
174 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1075.)  However,
more than a bare objection is needed to rebut the presumption that fees were
reasonable and necessarily incurred.”  (State
of California, supra, 174 Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)
            Landlord
contends that the (1) filing fees, (2) deposition costs, (3) service of process
fees, (4) court reporter fees, (5) interpreter fees, and (6) other fees should
be taxed.
            Filing
fees, deposition costs, service of process, and court reporter fees are
expressly permitted as costs.  (CCP §
1033.5(a)(1), (3)-(4), (11).)  Thus, the
burden falls on Landlord to show that these claimed costs are unreasonable.  Landlord fails to do so and merely argues that
some of the fees were incurred against other parties.  However, as noted above, apportionment is not
authorized, and Tenants are entitled to all costs reasonably incurred.  Moreover, the interpreter fees were incurred
as deposition costs and thus are expressly permitted by statute.  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(3)(B).)  
            As
to some of the filing fees, such as the deposition subpoena costs and filing
fees opposing the motion to quash, the Court agrees that the costs are
unreasonable as they were improperly incurred and resulted in sanctions against
Tenants.  (Masjedi Decl. ¶ 15.)  Accordingly, Landlords motion to tax is
granted as to the filing costs for $305.45.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Based
on the foregoing, 147-151 W. 25th St., LLC’s motion to tax is
GRANTED IN PART as to $305.45 in filing fees and otherwise DENIED.
            Moving
Party to give notice and file proof of service of such.
