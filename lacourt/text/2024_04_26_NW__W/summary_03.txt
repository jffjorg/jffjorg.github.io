And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by plaintiff Nancy Shawish against defendant Homegoods, Inc. The complaint alleges assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and negligence.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the entire complaint on respondeat superior grounds, finding that the conduct complained of occurred within the scope of employment or was ratified by the employer. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the allegations are conclusory and fail to state a cause of action. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a duty of care and a breach of that duty by the defendant.

The judge has also addressed the issue of whether Homegoods, Inc. is vicariously liable for the actions of its employee, Doe Defendant, citing various California court cases on the doctrine of respondeat superior.
