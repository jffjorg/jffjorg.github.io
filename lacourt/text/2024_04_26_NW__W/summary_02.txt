And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants plaintiff Allan Martia's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to modify the complaint by replacing the existing causes of action and prayers for relief, adding new causes of action for quiet title and cancellation of instrument, and naming new defendant Reel West, Inc. The court finds that the plaintiff has fulfilled the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, and that the proposed amendments are based on the same general set of facts and will not prejudice the opposing party. The court grants the motion and allows the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint.
