And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by JJC Construction, Inc. The court finds that service was proper and that the plaintiff, Patrice Kaufman, made reasonable efforts to serve the defendant's agent, Anthony Johnson. The defendant claims that service was made to an unknown and unauthorized California Secretary of State designee, but the court finds that the service was made in accordance with a court order and that the plaintiff demonstrated diligence in serving the defendant's agent. The court has previously granted an application to serve the defendant through the Secretary of State. The denial of the motion to quash means that the lawsuit will proceed as scheduled.
