And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the second amended cross-complaint (SACC) filed by Cross-Defendant Camras against Cross-Complainant Morgan. The SACC alleges causes of action for breach of lease, ejectment, fraud, and financial elder abuse.

The judge has sustained the demurrer as to each of the causes of action, with leave to amend. The judge has concluded that the SACC fails to state a cause of action for breach of lease because it does not attach a copy of the lease or sufficiently allege the terms and conditions of the lease. The judge has also concluded that the SACC fails to state a cause of action for fraud because it does not allege that Cross-Defendant knew of the falsity of the representations made about Ric St. John.

The judge has also concluded that the SACC fails to state a cause of action for financial elder abuse because it does not establish a breach of the lease or fraud, and instead relies on unsupported conclusions about Cross-Defendant's intentions. The judge has granted leave to amend the SACC to cure these defects.

The judge has noted that the court may sustain a demurrer for insufficient pleading, and that plaintiff must allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim. The judge has also noted that the sham pleading doctrine is intended to prevent an abuse of process, and that the court may take judicial notice of prior pleadings and disregard any inconsistent allegations.
