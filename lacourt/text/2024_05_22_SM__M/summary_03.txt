And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by the defendants is overruled. The plaintiff's complaint is not time-barred by the statute of limitations, as the defendants failed to properly address the denial notice. The plaintiff's claim was timely filed, and the two-year period from the date of injury applies. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled.

The second cause of action for negligent hiring, training, supervision, and retention is dismissed without leave. The defendant is ordered to file an answer within 10 days.
