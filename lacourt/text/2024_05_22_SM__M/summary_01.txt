And here is the summary in English text:

The court is considering a motion to consolidate two cases: 22SMCV00063 (breach of lease action) and 23SMCV05806 (fraudulent transfer action). The plaintiff, Cienega Ventures LLC, argues that the cases involve common factual issues and substantially the same evidence and witnesses. However, the court finds that the cases are at different stages, with the breach of lease action approaching trial in September 2024 and the fraudulent transfer action recently filed in December 2023 with no trial date set. The court denies the motion to consolidate, finding that it would unduly delay the resolution of the breach of lease action and increase costs on the parties and burden on the court.
