ANALYSIS
Motion To Deem Admitted Requests For Admission           
            Plaintiff
Strategic Funding Source, Inc. d/b/a Kapitus, a New York corporation moves for
an order deeming admitted requests for admission.
When a party to whom a request for
admissions are directed fails to respond, under Civ. Proc. Code, § 2033.280(b)
a party propounding the request for admission may move for an order that the
truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted.  “The court shall make this order [deem
admitted], unless it finds that the party to whom the request for admissions
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the request for admission that is in substantial compliance with
section 2033.220.” (Civ. Proc. Code, § 2033.280(c).) 
There is no meet and confer
requirement prior to bringing a motion to deem admitted requests for admission.
Defendant William Sutherland did not serve timely responses, or any response,
as of the filing of this motion. (Motion at Page 1: 17-20.) As such, Plaintiff
is entitled to an order deeming admitted the matters set forth in the requests
for admission.
The motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff
did not request any sanctions.
