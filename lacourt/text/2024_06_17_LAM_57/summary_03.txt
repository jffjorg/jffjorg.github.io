And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to grant Plaintiffs' motion in limine #6, deny Defendant's motion in limine #1, and give Plaintiffs' proposed special jury instructions #1 and 2. The Court also intends to spend the day on June 17 working with counsel to resolve the disputed exhibits. The trial in Ingram v. American Honda Motor Co will not begin on June 17, 2024, as there are objections to more than half of the exhibits on the joint exhibit list. The Court will not start the trial until the disputes are resolved.
