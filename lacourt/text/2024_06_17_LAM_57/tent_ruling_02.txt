 Case Number:  21STCV13572    Hearing Date:   June 17, 2024    Dept:  57 To counsel in Reyes v. Matian Law Group, Inc.  The Court is not engaged in trial on June 17, 2024.  A projected long jury trial in one case settled last week.  The Court conducted and almost finished a bench in another case  last week; that trial has been continued to next month.   Your case has priority for trial if you are ready for trial and are not in the settlement posture that was described at the last court date.  If you are ready for trial, the Court would need to spend time with counsel reviewing the exhibit and witness lists, jury instructions, and statement of the case on Monday.
