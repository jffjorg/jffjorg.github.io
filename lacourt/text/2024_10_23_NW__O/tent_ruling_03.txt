LEGAL STANDARD
“A party
is entitled to an award of¿attorney¿fees¿if there
is a specific authorization therefor by statute or private agreement.” (Beverly Hills Properties v.
Marcolino (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 7, 10.)  
 “With respect to attorney fees
incurred to litigate a contract claim, the recovery of such fees are governed
by¿Section 1717.”
(Intelligent Investments Corp. v. Gonzales (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1,
4.) Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a)
provides in, pertinent part, “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides that¿attorney's¿fees¿and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the¿prevailing¿party, then the party who is determined
to be the¿party¿prevailing¿on the contract, whether he or she is
the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable¿attorney's¿fees¿in addition to other costs.”
“California
courts liberally construe the term ‘on a contract’
as used within¿section
1717. As long as the action involves a contract it is ‘on
the contract’
within the meaning of¿Section
1717.”
(Dell Merk Inc. v. Franzia (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 443, 455, (internal
citations omitted).) 
“The court…shall determine who is the
party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section, whether or not
the suit proceeds to final judgment…the party prevailing on the contract shall
be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract. The
court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for
purposes of this section.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1717(b).)
Code of Civil Procedure § 1032(b)
provides that, “[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled … to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”
Attorneys’ fees awarded pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1717 are
allowable as costs under Code of Civil Procedure § 1032 as they are attorneys’
fees authorized by contract. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B); Code
Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) Attorneys’ fees are therefore recoverable as an
element of costs.
IV.         
ANALYSIS
A.            
Plaintiff is Entitled to an Award of Reasonable Attorney’s
Fees and Costs Under Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a).
Plaintiff requests a
total of $9,625.00 for fees and costs incurred in connection with this action and instant Motion. 
Plaintiff is the
prevailing party as the court ordered judgment entered for Plaintiff against
Defendant on June 25, 2024. (See Minute Order dated June 25, 2024.) Reasonable attorney’s
fees are also authorized pursuant to Paragraph 31 of the lease agreement
between the parties. (See Declaration of Kenny Lim filed August 26, 2024
(“Lim Decl.”), ¶ 7, Ex. 2, ¶ 31.) 
Plaintiff is therefore entitled
to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs under Code of Civil
Procedure § 1717(a) as the prevailing party in this action. 
B.      Plaintiff’s Fees Are Granted in Part.
1.        Plaintiff’s Counsels’ Rates are Reasonable.
The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsels’ (“Mr. Lim” and
“Mr. Azizyan”) hourly rates of $350.00 reasonable given the prevailing rates in
the Greater Los Angeles Area for an attorneys with Mr. Lim and Mr. Azizyan’s
level of experience.  
///
2.       Not
All of Mr. Lim’s Hours Are Reasonable.
The Court finds Mr. Azizyan’s requested 2.3 hours of
legal work reasonable. The Court finds most of Mr. Lim’s hours reasonable, however,
the Court finds 1.2 hours of Mr. Lim’s hours to be excessively billed. 
With this finding in mind, the Court has adjusted Mr.
Lim’s task fees as follows:

Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court concludes
Mr. Azizyan and Mr. Lim’s reasonable hours total 26.3 hours, amounting to $9,205.00
in fees. 
3.       Plaintiff
is Not Entitled to Costs.
Mr. Lim’s in his Declaration states “[a]ttorney’s
fees are requested to be determined by this motion, and costs were requested by
memorandum of costs,” however, Plaintiff did not list what costs it is
requesting, nor did it file a memorandum of costs as required by California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700. (Lim Decl., ¶ 6.)
Plaintiff is therefore not entitled to its costs. 
V.       CONCLUSION
          Based on
the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Plaintiff Prevailing
Party and Fix Attorney’s Fees in the amount of $9,205.00. Accordingly, the Court orders Plaintiff to prepare and
submit an Amended Judgment that reflects these additional fees.
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
