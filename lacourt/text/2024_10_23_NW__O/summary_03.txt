And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants in part Plaintiff Elshir Enterprises, LP's motion for attorney's fees. The court finds that Plaintiff is the prevailing party in an unlawful detainer action against Defendant Jechonias Williams, who failed to pay rent on a commercial property. The court awards Plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees in the amount of $9,205.00, which is based on the reasonable hours worked by Plaintiff's counsel, Mr. Lim and Mr. Azizyan. The court also finds that Plaintiff is not entitled to costs because it did not list what costs it is requesting or file a memorandum of costs as required by California Rules of Court. The court concludes that Plaintiff's motion is granted in part and orders Plaintiff to prepare and submit an amended judgment that reflects the additional fees.
