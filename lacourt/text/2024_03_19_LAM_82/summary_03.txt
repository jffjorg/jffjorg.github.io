And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants plaintiff 8912 W Pico Blvd LLC's unopposed application for a right to attach order against defendant Alain Cohen. The judge finds that the claim is one upon which attachment may be issued, and that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim. The judge also finds that attachment is not sought for any purpose other than recovery on the claim, and that the amount to be attached is greater than zero.

The plaintiff is seeking to attach defendant's assets in the amount of $115,789.22, which is the amount of the judgment against KFU, as well as an additional $50,000 for attorney fees and $10,000 for costs. The judge reduces the request for attorney fees from $50,000 to $36,237.50, and reduces the request for costs from $10,000 to $3,000. The judge also reduces the request for fees for preparation of the application for right to attach order, filing a motion for summary judgment and trial, and trial.

The judge orders that the amount to be attached is $155,026.72, which includes the judgment amount, the reduced amount of attorney fees, and the reduced amount of costs. The judge also orders that the writ shall issue upon the posting of a $10,000 bond.
