[1]           Subdivision (a) of section 17701.13
states, in relevant part: “A limited liability company shall designate and continuously
maintain in this state both of the following: [¶] (1) An office, which need not
be a place of its activity in this state….”


[2]           Petitioner’s declaration is unsigned
and not under penalty of perjury. Although subject to striking for such defects,
even if the declaration were properly executed pursuant to CCP § 2015.5, the
averments in the declaration are unavailing for the reasons explained herein. 
 


[3]           Although this Court is not a Delaware
court, the Operating Agreement provides that all actions and proceedings under
the agreement shall be brought in Los Angeles County. (Akerley VOI Decl. ¶ 2
& Ex. C at § 18.13 [Choice of Law provision].)


[4]           Petitioner’s assertions that VOI and
R&T negligently or intentionally breached a fiduciary duty to prepare
documentation evidencing his membership is of little help.  (See Opening Br. at 3:5-25.)  To begin with, petitioner cites no authority
to support his claim such allegations could excuse the requirements of the
Operating Agreement.  Contentions
unsupported by citation to authority are generally disregarded. (Niko v.
Foreman (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 344, 368; Valov v. Department of Motor
Vehicles (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1132.)  In any event, even if petitioner’s failure to
be listed as a Member in the books and records of VOI could be excused,
petitioner still fails to demonstrate the existence of any Subscription
Agreement making him a member of VOI.
