And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in response to a petition brought by the petitioner against VOI and R&T. The petitioner asserts that VOI and R&T negligently or intentionally breached a fiduciary duty to prepare documentation evidencing his membership in VOI. However, the judge finds that the petitioner's unsigned declaration is unavailing, and that his assertions of breach of fiduciary duty are unsupported by authority. Additionally, the judge notes that even if the petitioner's failure to be listed as a member in VOI's books and records could be excused, the petitioner still fails to demonstrate the existence of any Subscription Agreement making him a member of VOI. The judge is not persuaded by the petitioner's arguments and finds that his claims are without merit.
