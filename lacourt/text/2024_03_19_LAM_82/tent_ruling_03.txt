Case:                           8912 W Pico Blvd
LLC v. Alain Cohen (23STCV30610)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff 8912 W Pico Blvd LLC’s UNOPPOSED
application for right to attach order with respect to defendant Alain Cohen is
GRANTED. 
 
Pursuant to CCP §484.090, the Court finds:
 
1)     
the claim is one upon which attachment may be issued;
2)     
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim;
3)     
attachment is not sought for any purpose other than
recovery on the claim;
4)     
the amount to be attached is greater than zero.
 
Plaintiff’s claim is for amounts owed under a commercial
lease (“Lease”) between plaintiff’s predecessor-in-interest, Stanley R. Romain,
and Kosher Foods Unlimited, Inc (“KFU”). (Hecht Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7 & Ex. 1.)
Under the Guaranty of Lease, defendant Alain Cohen guaranteed KFU’s payments
under the Lease. (Hecht Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 2.) 
 
In 2022, after having been assigned Romain’s rights and
interest in the Lease, plaintiff claimed that KFU defaulted on payment of rent
under the Lease, which KFU disputed. (Hecht Decl. ¶¶ 7, 11 & Ex. 5 at 2.)
The dispute was arbitrated on December 5, 2022 before the Beth Din of America
(“Beth Din”). (Hecht Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex. 5.) On January 26, 2023, the Beth Din
issued an arbitration award in favor of plaintiff and against KFU. (Hecht Decl.
¶ 13 & Ex. 5.) On September 28, 2023, the Court (Hon. Stephen I. Goorvitch)
confirmed the arbitration award in the amount of $115,789.22. (Hecht Decl. ¶ 16
& Ex. 8.) Defendant has not paid any portion of the judgment. (Hecht Decl.
¶¶ 18, 20.) 
 
In addition to assigning his rights under the Lease, Romain
also assigned to plaintiff his interest in the Guaranty of Lease. (Hecht Decl.
¶ 7.) Because the judgment reflects the amount owed to plaintiff under the
Lease, defendant’s obligation under the Guaranty of Lease to pay “all rents and
other sums payable” under the lease demonstrates the validity of plaintiffs
claim against defendant and entitlement to attach defendant’s assets in the
amount of $115,789.22, the amount of the judgment. 
 
In addition, plaintiff seeks to attach an additional $50,000
for attorney fees and $10,000 for costs. (Rosenbaum Decl. ¶¶ 14-16.) 
 
With respect to attorney fees, the Guaranty of Lease allows
for the recovery of fees should plaintiff be required to bring suit to enforce
the guaranty. (Hecht Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 2 [“In the event any action be brought
by said Lessor against Guarantors hereunder to enforce the obligation of
Guarantors hereunder, the unsuccessful party in such action shall pay to the
prevailing party therein a reasonable attorney’s fee”].) However, the request
for $50,000 is excessive. 
 
The request to attach fees for 6 hours for preparation of
the application for right to attach order is reduced by 3 hours, or $1,950
based on the asserted $650 hourly rate, as 6 hours for this task is excessive.
(Rosenbaum Decl. ¶ 14(b).) The request to attach fees is also reduced by $2,025,
because defendant did not file any opposition to which plaintiff was entitled
to reply. (Rosenbaum Decl. ¶ 14(c).) With respect to the hearing on the
application for writ of attachment, the request to attach fees is reduced by
1.5 hours, or $1,012.50, based on the asserted $675 hourly rate, as 0.5
hours is sufficient for attending the hearing. (Rosenbaum Decl. ¶ 14(d).) 
 
Further, because proof of defendant’s obligation to
guarantee amounts due under the Lease appears straightforward on its face, it
is unclear why plaintiff needs 6 hours to depose defendant. The request to
attach fees is reduced by $2,025 for 3 hours of fees based on the
asserted $675 hourly rate. (Rosenbaum Decl. ¶ 14(f).)
 
In addition, plaintiff seeks fees for filing a motion for
summary judgment and trial. (Rosenbaum Decl. ¶ 14(h-j).) For a relatively
simple breach of written guaranty case, the total 25 hours of time that
plaintiff claims for preparation of motion for summary judgment, preparation
for trial, and trial is excessive. The Court attaches fees for 5 hours for the
MSJ, 5 hours for preparation of trial, and 5 hours of trial, resulting in a
reduction of 10 hours, or $6,750 based on the asserted $675 hourly rate.

 
Based on the foregoing, the request to attach $50,000 for
fees is granted in part.  The amount of
attachment shall be reduced by $13,762.50, resulting in the right to attach $36,237.50
for fees. 
 
With respect to the request for costs, plaintiff seeks
attachment in the amount of $10,000, including $3,000 for the transcript for
two depositions and the remainder for filing fees, service of process, bond
fees, levy, motion fees, potential expert fees, and the court reporter for one
to two days of trial. (Rosenbaum Decl. ¶ 16.) Without having the remaining
$7,000 of the costs broken down or the need for experts explained, the
remaining $7,000 is insufficiently justified. Accordingly, instead of the $10,000
requested, the Court will permit attachment of $3,000 for costs. 
 
Accordingly, the amount to be attached is $155,026.72
($115,789.22 rent owed under the judgment + $36,237.50 fees + $3,000 costs). Within
five days hereof, plaintiff 8912 W Pico Blvd LLC shall submit a proposed right
to attach order consistent with the ruling herein. 
 
The Writ shall issue upon the posting of bond in the amount
of $10,000. (CCP §489.220.)
