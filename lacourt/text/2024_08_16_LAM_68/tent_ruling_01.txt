SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Dwain Lammey requires the use of a wheelchair. On January 31, 2023, Plaintiff
sought to enter the premises of a “restaurant” (Cold Stone Creamery) owned
and/or operated by Defendants, but maintains non-compliant counters and tables
to accommodate protected persons entering public establishments. 
 
On
June 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a verified complaint for Violation of the
Americans with Disabilities Act, and Violation of the Unruh Act. On July 14,
2023, an answer was filed by Marlan Cooper, presumably in pro per, and
purportedly on behalf of Maresp Corporation. On July 21, 2023, GG LA Figueroa,
LLC, filed a verified answer to the complaint. On August 29, 2023, a default
was entered against Maresp Corporation. 
 
On
October 13, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the answer of GG LA
Figueroa, LLC, and denied the. motion to strike. GG LA Figueroa, LLC filed an
amended answer on November 3, 2023. On January 16, 2024, GG LA Figueroa, LLC
filed a cross-complaint against both Cold Stone Creamery, Inc. and Maresp
Corporation for Express Contractual Indemnity, Implied Indemnity, and Declaratory
Relief. 
 
On November 15, 2023, the action was transferred from the
personal injury hub court to Department 55. Plaintiff filed a 170.6 challenge
thereby leading to reassignment to Department 36. All hearings were vacated in
a series of orders from both Departments 55 and 36. On December 11, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a SECOND 170.6, which was accepted, and the case was
transferred to Department 68.  
 
RULING: Denied without Prejudice.
Defendant Maresp Corporation (Maresp) moves to vacate the
August 29, 2023, entered default. Plainiff in opposition challenges the
timeliness of the request and failure to meet the standard for relief. Maresp
in reply challenges the opposition as being filed six days late. 
 
Other than a notice of motion which references a memorandum
of points and authorities, the motion consists of said notice and two (2)
declarations. The motion lacks any stated legal basis for relief.
 
Assuming the motion seeks relief under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473 subdivision (b) however, as presented in the opposition,
the court considers the standard.
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may
be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the
judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”
 
“The six-month
time limit for granting statutory relief is jurisdictional and the court may
not consider a motion for relief made after that period has elapsed.
(Citation.) The six-month period runs from entry of default, not entry of
judgment.” (Manson, Iver & York v.
Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) The April 22, 2024, motion was
filed seven (7) months and 24 days after August 29, 2023, entry of the default.
The motion is therefore untimely, and the court lacks jurisdiction to consider
the basis of relief under the mandatory standard. 
 
“[A] trial court is obligated
to set aside a default, default judgment, or
dismissal if the motion for mandatory relief (1) is filed within six months of
the entry of judgment, (2) ‘is in proper form,’ (3) is accompanied by
the attorney affidavit of fault, and (4) demonstrates that
the default or dismissal was in fact caused by
the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.’” (Martin Potts & Associates, Inc. v.
Corsair, LLC (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 432, 443.) Given the answer was
filed by Cooper, and counsel only substituted into the case after entry of the
default, the court considers the self-represented party standard. 
 
Even if the court was able to consider the application, the
admission by Marlan Cooper of filing the answer on behalf of the corporate
entity, at least in part removes consideration from the mandatory standard. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1251-1252; see Rodriguez v. Brill (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 715,
727.) Public policy favors adjudication of claims on the merits. Nevertheless,
where conduct by the party acting in pro per represents a deliberate, strategic
decision, public policy vests the court with discretion to find no basis for
relief. (Benedict
v. Danner Press (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 923, 929-930; Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1251-1252.) 
 
The court also notes that while
attorney Sahelian represents substitution into the case on February 20, 2024,
five (5) months and 22 days from the date of entry of judgment, the declaration
lacks any explanation for the nine (9) day delay thereby leading to the waiver
of the jurisdictional deadline. 
 
The motion is therefore denied without prejudice.
 
Motion for summary judgment currently set for November 12, 2024.
 
Defendant
Maresp Corporation to give notice.
