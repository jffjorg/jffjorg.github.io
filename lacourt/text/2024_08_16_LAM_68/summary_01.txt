"The six-month time limit for granting statutory relief is jurisdictional and the court may not consider a motion for relief made after that period has elapsed."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion by Maresp Corporation to vacate the default entered against it on August 29, 2023. The motion was filed seven months and 24 days after the entry of default, which is beyond the six-month deadline set by Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b). The judge also found that the motion lacked a stated legal basis for relief and that the defendant's failure to meet the standard for relief was not excused. Additionally, the judge noted that the defendant's conduct in filing the answer on behalf of the corporate entity, at least in part, removed consideration from the mandatory standard. The judge denied the motion without prejudice, and a motion for summary judgment is currently set for November 12, 2024.
