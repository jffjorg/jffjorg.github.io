And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the petition to change name, but with conditions. The petitioner must ensure that the new name on the proposed decree is clearly written and correctly spelled. If satisfied, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
