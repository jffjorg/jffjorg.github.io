The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the petition for name change. The petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If satisfied, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written, the petitioner must appear at the hearing on May 20, 2024, to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
