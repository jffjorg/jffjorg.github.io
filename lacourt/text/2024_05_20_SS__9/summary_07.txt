Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

"The petition has been granted. The petitioner must review the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the name is acceptable, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing."
