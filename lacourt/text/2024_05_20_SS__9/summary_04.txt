And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling ordered the Petitioner to provide identification verified by a fingerprint to enable the Court to run a criminal history assessment. The Petitioner failed to provide the necessary identification, which is required for the Court to verify their identity. The Court ordered the Petitioner to provide one of three forms of identification: a California driver's license number, a driver's license number or ID number from another state, or to have fingerprints taken for a California Record Review Live Scan and results sent to the Court Clerk. If the Petitioner fails to provide sufficient information prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. The Court Clerk is ordered to run and complete a criminal history assessment prior to the continued hearing.
