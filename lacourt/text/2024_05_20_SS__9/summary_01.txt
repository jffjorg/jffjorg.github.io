The judge rules that the petition to change name is granted. However, the judge emphasizes the importance of ensuring the clarity and correctness of the new name on the proposed decree. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. If the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing.
