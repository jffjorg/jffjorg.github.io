And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to approve a compromise of a disputed claim between Liam Marquez-Garcia, a minor, and Amadou Lamine Diatta. The parties have agreed to a settlement amount of $15,000.00, with $1,131.00 designated for medical expenses, $6,000.00 for attorney's fees, and $0.00 for non-medical expenses. The court finds the settlement fair and reasonable, but is continuing the hearing due to inconsistencies in the petition and the lack of existing guardianship of the estate. The court is requiring the Guardian Ad Litem, Mileena Marquez, to appear at the hearing, but finds that Liam Marquez-Garcia's appearance is not necessary. The parties must submit on the tentative ruling by email to the court, and if there are no appearances at the hearing, the court may adopt the tentative as the final order.
