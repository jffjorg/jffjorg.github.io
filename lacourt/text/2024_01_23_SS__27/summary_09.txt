The tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Lee S. Arian grants the plaintiff's application for default judgment against defendants Jeffrey Abed and Mikhael Monica. The plaintiff, Wawanesa General Insurance Company, filed the uninsured motorist motor vehicle negligence action on February 22, 2022, and served the defendants with the summons, complaint, and related papers in March 2022. Default was entered against the defendants on November 3, 2023. The plaintiff is seeking a total judgment of $293,783.21, consisting of $293,180.21 in damages and $603 in costs. The court finds that the plaintiff has submitted sufficient evidence of the payments supporting the amount of damages sought.
