I.           
INTRODUCTION
On
August 9, 2023, Plaintiffs Nancy Gloria Mayen-Hernandez and Jadelyn Francheska
Ventura (“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendants Yanik R. Camarillo,
Helga C. Camarillo, Manuel Camarillo (“Defendants”), and DOES 1 to 100, for (1)
general negligence and (2) premises liability. The complaint alleges on or
about February 20, 2023, Defendants negligently maintained their property
resulting in a fire, where Plaintiffs suffered personal injuries, including but
not limited to smoke inhalation, burn injuries, and damage to their personal
property.
On
November 13, 2023, Parkinson Benson and Potter (“PBP”) filed and served a
motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs. The Court denied the motion
without prejudice on December 19, 2023. The Court noted the MC-053 Form did not
set forth any of the hearing dates scheduled in this action and Section 3(b)(2)
on the MC-052 Form was left blank. 
On
December 21, 2023, PBP filed this instant motion to be relieved as counsel. 
II.         
LEGAL STANDARD
The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or
attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., §
284(2).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as
counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) 
An
application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form
MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)),
MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053
(Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must
specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the
date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
Further,
the requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)
III.       
DISCUSSION
Bree
Durso of Parkinson Benson and Potter declares there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. Counsel also states that Plaintiffs are aware and
consent to the request to be relieved as counsel.
Counsel  has stated a valid basis to be relieved as
counsel. Furthermore, the MC-053 Form indicates the Final Status Conference is
scheduled for January 22, 2025, the Non-Jury Trial is scheduled for February 5,
2025, and the Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal is scheduled for August 6,
2025. Lastly, Counsel declares that the service address of Plaintiffs is the
current residence address and that Counsel confirmed the service address was
current within the past 30 days through conversation with Plaintiffs. Accordingly,
the motion is granted. 
IV.        
CONCLUSION
PBP’s
motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED. The motion is granted as of the time
of effective service of this ruling and filing of the proof of service.  
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at

tentative and elect not to appear at the hearing, the opposing party may

other parties in the matter, you should assume that others might appear at the
hearing to argue.  If the Court does not

adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
Dated this 23rd day of January 2024
