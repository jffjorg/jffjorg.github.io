      CASE NO.: 22STCV06314
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: PLAINTIFF’S
  APPLICATION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 27
8:30 a.m.
January 23, 2024



 
I.         BACKGROUND
On
February 22, 2022 Plaintiff Wawanesa General Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
filed this uninsured motorist motor vehicle negligence action against Defendants
Jeffrey Abed and Mikhael Monica (“Defendants”).
Defendants
were served with the summons, complaint, and related papers including the
statement of damages by substituted service in March of 2022. 
On
November 3, 2023, default was entered against Defendants.
Plaintiff
now moves for default judgment against Defendants. 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
When a defendant has been served and no
answer, demurrer, or certain motion has been filed within the time specified in
the summons, the clerk shall enter the default of the defendant. (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 585, subd. (b).) The court shall then render judgment in the
plaintiff’s favor, not exceeding the amount stated in the statement of damages,
as appears by the evidence to be just. (Ibid.)
California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a) sets forth the required documents to be filed with the Court in order
to grant a default judgment.
III.      DISCUSSION
Plaintiff
requests a total judgment of $293,783.21 consisting of $293,180.21 in damages
and $603 in costs. 
Plaintiff
has submitted sufficient evidence of the payments supporting the amount of
damages sought. (See Sosa Decl.)
However,
the proposed judgment filed on January 11, 2024 does not reflect the correct
amount, i.e., $293,783.2 rather than $293,783.21. 
Accordingly,
the application for default judgment is GRANTED, conditioned upon Plaintiff filing
a revised proposed judgment with the correct amount within 5 court days of this
ruling.
 
Moving
party to give notice.  
            Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit
on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court’s
website at www.lacourt.org.  Please be
advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to appear at the
hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the hearing and argue
the matter.  Unless you receive a
submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume that others
might appear at the hearing to argue.  If
the Court does not receive emails from the parties indicating submission on
this tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the hearing, the Court
may, at its discretion, adopt the tentative as the final order or place the
motion off calendar.
 
        Dated this 23rd day of January 2024
