The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Southwark to provide a further response to RFA 4, and awards Plaintiff reasonable monetary sanctions in the amount of $760.00. The Court finds that Defendant Southwark's response to RFA 4 is improper, and that a further response is warranted. The Court also notes that the parties are engaging in wholly unnecessary discovery motion practice, seemingly more to make a point than to advance the case.
