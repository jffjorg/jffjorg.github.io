And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Artur Ghazaryant. The motion was opposed by the plaintiff, who argued that the defendants should have filed the cross-complaint earlier. The Judge found that the defendants had good cause to pursue the cross-complaint, as their claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's complaint, and it would be in the interests of justice and judicial economy to grant the motion. The Judge also noted that the plaintiff fails to provide any evidence to support the argument that the defendants were aware of Artur from the outset of the action, and that the plaintiff's arguments about the relevance of Artur inviting the plaintiff onto the subject property are unpersuasive. The Judge has granted the motion and has advanced and vacated the current trial and final status conference dates. The parties will be notified of new trial-related dates at the hearing on this motion.
