[1] Initially, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s motion is
brought pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, which concerns the failure to
appear for deposition. Here, Defendant appeared for deposition but refused to
answer questions and produce documents. Defendant does not raise this issue in
opposition to the motion. The Court therefore will assess the merits of the
motion as the Court finds that Defendant has waived such argument. (Moulton
Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)
