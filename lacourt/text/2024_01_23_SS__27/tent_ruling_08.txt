  SELECT INSURANCE COMPANY’S REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT/JUDGMENT

I.           
INTRODUCTION
On
December 13, 2021, Plaintiff Progressive Select Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Yonathan Maldonaldo Turcios, Nelson A.
Maldonaldo Velasquez (“Defendants”), and DOES 1 to 20, inclusive for motor
vehicle negligence. The complaint alleges on October 10, 2019, Plaintiff’s
insured Kimberly Gonzalez was involved in an automobile collision caused by
Defendants’ negligence and resulting bodily injuries and damages to Plaintiff. 
II.         
LEGAL STANDARD
When
a defendant has been served and no answer, demurrer, or certain motion has been
filed within the time specified in the summons, the clerk shall enter the
default of the defendant. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b).) The court
shall then render judgment in the plaintiff’s favor, not exceeding the amount
stated in the complaint or statement of damages, as appears by the evidence to
be just. (Ibid.) 
In
an action to recover damages for personal injury or wrongful death, the
plaintiff shall serve a statement of damages on the defendant before a default
may be taken. (Code of Civ. Proc., §425.11, subd. (c).) Plaintiff must submit a
copy of the Statement of Damages served on Defendant. (Cal. Rules of Court
3.250, subd. (a)(20).) “It is well settled that a plaintiff may not take a
default against a defendant without giving the defendant actual notice of the
amount of damages claimed.” (Department of Fair Employment & Housing v.
Ottovich (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 706, 712.) Where, as here, the action is
for personal injury, the amount of damages claimed may not be stated in the
complaint and must instead be stated in a separate statement of damages. (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 425.11). 
A
plaintiff cannot claim in her application for default judgment any award which
is greater than damages claimed in the complaint or statement of damages,
including even where the plaintiff claims no specific damages in the complaint.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 425.11, 585, subd. (a); see Falahati v. Kondo
(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831; see also Parish v. Peters (1991) 1
Cal.App.4th 202, 216 (awarding default damages to a party whose complaint seeks
damages ‘according to proof’ offends due process).)
When a
default is entered, the party who requested the entry of default must obtain a
default judgment against the defaulting party within 45 days after the default
was entered, unless the court has granted an extension of time.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.110(h).)
III.       
DISCUSSION
On May 31, 2023, this Court entered default against
Defendants. The Doe Defendants were also dismissed. Plaintiff requested default
judgment against Defendants seeking $49,331.28, consisting of $48,728.28 in
damages as demanded in the complaint and $603.00 in costs. 
On September 5, 2023, this Court denied Plaintiff’s
default judgment application without prejudice. The Court noted under Vehicle
Code section 17151, Defendant Velasquez, as the owner of the vehicle Defendant
Turcios operated in the incident, cannot be held liable for more than
$15,000.00 in bodily injury and $5,000.00 in property damage. Furthermore,
Plaintiff sought to recover the entire judgment requested from both Defendants
without apportioning liability in accordance with Vehicle Code section 17151.
The Court ordered Plaintiff to apportion liability between Defendants by either
indicating so at Item 7 of the JUD-100 Form or as an attachment to the JUD-100
Form.
On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a new default
judgment application. However, Plaintiff did not comply with the Court’s
September 5, 2023 order. Plaintiff neither apportioned liability between
Defendants by indicating so at Item 7 of the JUD-100 Form nor as an attachment
to the JUD-100 Form. 
 
IV.        
CONCLUSION
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. Plaintiff is ordered
to resubmit the JUD-100 Form in compliance with Vehicle Code section 17151 by
apportioning liability between Defendants on Item 7 of the JUD-100 Form or as
an attachment to the JUD-100 Form.  The
Court notes that Plaintiff’s further failure to follow court direction is
sanctionable and can lead to the Court denying the default judgment request and
denying the action.  The Court simply
does not have time to adjudicate actions in which a party wastes the Court’s
time by failing to follow clear and reasonably simple directions.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as
directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  Please be advised that if you submit on the
tentative and elect not to appear at the hearing, the opposing party may
nevertheless appear at the hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you receive a submission from all
other parties in the matter, you should assume that others might appear at the
hearing to argue.  If the Court does not
receive emails from the parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion,
adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
Dated this 23rd day of January 2024
