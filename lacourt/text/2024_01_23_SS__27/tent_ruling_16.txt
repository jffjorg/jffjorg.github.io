I.           
INTRODUCTION
This action arises from a premises
liability accident that occurred on October 8, 2021. On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff
Hector Robles Martinez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant El
Gallo Giro Corporation (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 30, alleging causes of
action for premises liability and general negligence.
On December 19, 2023, Anthony R. Lopez,
counsel for Plaintiff (“Counsel”), filed the instant motion to be relieved as
counsel. The motion is unopposed.
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The Court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 403-407.) 
A motion to be relieved
as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served
“on the client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
III.       
DISCUSSION
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 2.) The Court finds
this to be proper grounds for withdrawal.
A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing
the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco¿(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) Counsel has also provided the
appropriate Judicial Council forms, namely forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
The Court notes that the declaration (Form MC-052) contains an incorrect
date for the Final Status Conference. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 4.) However, the proposed
order (Form MC-053) does contain the correct date for the Final Status
Conference. Thus, the incorrect date on the declaration is not an issue.
Therefore, the
Court GRANTS the motion to be relieved as counsel.
IV.        
CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS
the motion to be relieved as counsel.  The
motion is granted as of the time of effective service of this ruling and filing
of the proof of service.  
Moving party to give notice.
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
Dated
this 23rd day of January 2024
