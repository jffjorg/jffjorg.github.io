And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the proposed settlement between Claimant Jose Sierra, a person with a disability, and Defendant Jordan Hernandez. The proposed settlement is for $4,000,000.00, with $708,668.87 allocated for medical expenses, $1,600,000.00 for attorney's fees, and $117,810.59 for non-medical expenses. The remaining balance of $1,573,520.54 will be used for a single-premium deferred annuity and a special needs trust. The court finds the proposed settlement reasonable and fair based on the circumstances of the case and supporting documentation. However, the court notes that Item 12.b(3) is incomplete, and the demand amount for Medicare appears to be less than the amount sought. The Petitioner is to attach the final demand letter or provide clarification to the court. The court will hear from counsel.
