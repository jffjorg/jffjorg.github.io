And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff. The motion was filed on January 25, 2024, and is based on Plaintiff's repeated failures to comply with court orders, including failing to appear for deposition and failing to pay monetary sanctions. The Court finds that Plaintiff's failures were willful and that sanctions short of terminating sanctions are unlikely to result in Plaintiff's compliant participation in the case. As a result, the Court hereby issues terminating sanctions against Plaintiff, effectively dismissing the action.
