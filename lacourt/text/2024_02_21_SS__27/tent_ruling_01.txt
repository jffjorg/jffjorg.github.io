I.           
INTRODUCTION
This is an auto accident case arising
out of an incident on July 6, 2017. On June 28, 2019, Plaintiff Rosemary E.
Cukurova (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Ernesto Hernandez
Galindo (“Galindo”), Avis Rent a Car Systems, LLC (erroneously named and served
as Budget Rent a Car System, Inc.) (“Avis”), and Does 1 to 100, alleging one cause
of action for motor vehicle.
On January 24, 2024, Defendant Avis
filed a motion to continue trial date and final status conference date.  The motion is unopposed.
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
A
party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial must make the request for
a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application as soon as
reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is
discovered.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd. (b).)  The
request for continuance may be granted on an affirmative showing of good
cause.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332.) 
III.       
DISCUSSION
Defendant Avis seeks to continue the
current trial date and the final status conference date on the grounds that counsel
for Defendant Avis had eye surgery on January 3, 2024, which requires a 30-day
recovery period.  (Rubin Decl., ¶2.)  Counsel for Defendant Avis also indicated in
the moving papers that he was scheduled for a second eye surgery on February 9,
2024, which also requires a 30-day recovery period.  (Id.) 
Defendant Avis further contends a continuance is justified on the
grounds that Defendant Galindo was recently located in Mexico and is
unavailable for the present trial date of February 22, 2024, but will otherwise
be available later in March 2024. (Id.)
The
Court finds good cause to continue the trial date and final status conference
date. Multiple eye surgeries understandably impact Defendant Avis’ counsel’s
ability to participate in the trial.  (See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd. (c)(3).)  Moreover, Defendant Galindo was recently
located in Mexico and is able to appear for trial in March 2024, which also
constitutes good cause to continue trial as requested.  (See Id., rule 3.1332, subd. (c)(1).)  Furthermore, the Court construes Plaintiff’s
lack of opposition as a tacit admission that the motion is meritorious.  (Holden v. City of San Diego (2019)
43 Cal.App.5th 404, 418; C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition,
Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10.)
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the motion.
Nevertheless,
the Court notes that there have already been multiple trial continuances in
this action. Thus, the Court will strongly disfavor any additional continuance
requests.
IV.        
CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS Defendant Avis’ motion
and continues the FSC and trial for 30 days.  The new trial date and final status conference dates are  XXXX, 2024 and XXX, 2024, respectively.
Moving party to give notice.

tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
