And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Plaintiff Stacie Williams' motions to compel responses to discovery requests and requests for admission from Defendant Rosemary. The motions were unopposed, and the court found that Defendant Rosemary had failed to provide timely responses to the discovery requests.

The court granted Plaintiff's motions to compel responses, ordering Defendant Rosemary to provide responses to the Special Interrogatories and Demand for Production of Documents within 30 days. The court also granted Plaintiff's motion to deem the Requests for Admission admitted, concluding that the truth of the matters specified in the requests is hereby deemed admitted and conclusively established as to Defendant Rosemary.

The court imposed monetary sanctions against Defendant Rosemary in the amount of $2260.00, to be paid within 30 days of the date of the order. The court also granted Plaintiff's request for sanctions in a reduced amount, citing the straightforward and unopposed nature of the motions.
