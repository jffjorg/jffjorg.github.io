On December 29, 2020, Plaintiff State of
California (“State”) filed this action against Defendant Gerald Moore and Does
1 through 10, alleging one cause of action for premises liability arising out
of an incident on January 7, 2019.  On January
6, 2021, Plaintiff Stacie Williams (“Williams”) filed a separate action against
Defendants Rosemary L. Bean-Moore (“Rosemary”), Gerald Moore, Carter of Moore
Living Trust, and Does 1 to 100, alleging causes of action for premises
liability and general negligence.  The
cases were consolidated on January 13, 2022, with Case Number 20STCV49532 being
designated as the lead case.
On August 29, 2023, Williams served Special Interrogatories,
Set One, Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, and Requests for
Admission, Set One, on Defendant Rosemary.  Having received no responses, Williams
proceeded to file the motions to compel Plaintiff to provide responses and for an
order deeming the Requests for Admission admitted or alternatively for an order
compelling answers without objections.  Williams
also requests monetary sanctions.  No oppositions to the motions have been filed.
Compel
Responses
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may
make an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  A party that fails to
serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones
based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).)  Unlike a motion to compel further responses,
a motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the
propounding party has no meet-and-confer obligations.  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404.)
Here, on August 29, 2023, Williams served Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, on Defendant
Rosemary.  (Declarations of Marine Khachoyan, ¶2; Ex. A.)  To date, Defendant
Rosemary has not provided responses.  (Id. at ¶ 3.)  Therefore,
Williams’ motions to compel Rosemary’s responses to Special Interrogatories,
Set One, and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, are GRANTED.  Defendant
Rosemary is ordered to provide responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, without objection, within 30
days of this order.
Deem Admitted
Where a party fails to
timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party may move for
an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the
demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response,
and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds.
(a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall grant a motion to deem admitted requests for
admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Here, on August 29, 2023, Williams served Requests for Admission,
Set One, on Defendant Rosemary.  (Declaration of Marine Khachoyan, ¶2; Ex. A.)  To date, Defendant
Rosemary has not provided responses.  (Id. at ¶ 3.)  Therefore,
Williams’ motion for an order deeming the Requests for Admission admitted is
GRANTED. The truth of matters specified in Requests for Admission, Set One, are
hereby deemed admitted and conclusively established as to Defendant Rosemary.
Monetary
Sanctions
Where the court grants a motion to
compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification, or the sanction would otherwise be
unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Where
a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Here, Defendant requests
sanctions in the amount of $1,110.00 for each motion based on 3.5 hours
incurred at Williams’ counsel’s hourly rate of $300.00, plus $60.00 filing fees. 
Plaintiff’s requests for sanctions are GRANTED in a reduced amount because the
motions are straightforward, unopposed, and nearly identical to one
another.  Sanctions are imposed against Defendant Rosemary in the total amount
of $2260.00, to be paid within 30 days of the date of this order.
Moving party to give notice.

the Court does not receive emails from the parties indicating submission on
this tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the hearing, the Court
may, at its discretion, adopt the tentative as the final order or place the
motion off calendar.
