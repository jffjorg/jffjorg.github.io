I.           
INTRODUCTION
This is a premises liability
action.  On July 30, 2020, Plaintiff
Sharon Devito (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Quixote
Studios LLC, Scott Robinson Honda, and Does 1 to 100. On March 16, 2021,
Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint against Defendants Scott
Robinson Honda, Galpin Studio Rentals, and Does 1 to 100, alleging one cause of
action for premises liability.  On July
7, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Doe amendment naming Defendant SirReel Studio Services
(erroneously sued as SirReel Studio Rentals) to this action.
On October 14, 2022, SirReel filed a
cross-complaint against The Famous Group, Inc., The Famous Group, and Roes 1
through 100.  On October 24, 2022,
SirReel filed the operative First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) against the
same cross-defendants, alleging causes of action for total indemnity, equitable
indemnity, express indemnity, breach of contract, breach of contract –
additional insured, breach of contract – defense, declaratory relief, breach of
implied warranty, negligence, and contribution. 
On October 26, 2022, SirReel filed a Roe amendment naming the Famous
Group LLC dba Hornet Animations as a cross-defendant.  On November 3, 2022, SirReel filed a Roe
amendment naming Hornet Animations, Inc. as a cross-defendant.  On March 13, 2023, SirReel filed a Roe
amendment naming Famous Group LLC (“Famous Group”) as a cross-defendant.
On January 18, 2024, SirReel filed a
motion for an order shortening time to hear its motion for summary
adjudication.  On February 6, 2024,
Famous Group filed an opposition.  On
February 13, 2024, SirReel filed a reply.
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
“Notice of the motion [for summary
adjudication] and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the
action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2).)  The Court may not shorten
the 75-day notice period without parties’ consent as the minimum notice period
is mandatory.  (Urshan v. Musicians’ Credit Union (2004) 120
Cal.App.4th 758, 763-64; McMahon v. Superior Court (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 112, 116.) 
“The motion shall be heard no later
than 30 days before the date of trial, unless the court for good cause orders
otherwise. The filing of the motion shall not extend the time within which a
party must otherwise file a responsive pleading.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(3).)
III.       
DISCUSSION
SirReel seeks for the Court to shorten the
time to hear its motion for summary adjudication against Famous Group, which is
currently set for hearing on February 25, 2025.  SirReel indicates that this was the earliest
date it could reserve, despite the previously set May 17, 2024 trial date.  (Yamabe Decl., ¶14.)
In opposition, Famous Group contends SirReel
has failed to establish good cause warranting the shortened time for hearing
the summary adjudication motion.  Famous
Group points to the stipulation signed and filed by the parties on February 9,
2024, as evidence that continuing the trial was the means for hearing SirReel’s
motion for summary adjudication.  Famous
Group also contends SirReel will not be prejudiced if the Court does not
shorten the time to hear SirReel’s motion for summary adjudication, and that
advancing the hearing does not serve the interests of justice.  Famous Group further contends that SirReel’s
motion for summary adjudication is fact dependent, which requires new and
extensive discovery, and that Famous Group will be severely prejudiced it is
not afforded time to conduct the discovery essential to oppose the motion for
summary adjudication.
The
Court finds SirReel has established good cause warranting an order shortening
the time for hearing on its motion for summary adjudication.  “As the statutory language indicates, a trial court
has discretion to shorten the initial 60–day period to bring a motion for
summary judgment on a showing of good cause. Similarly,
trial court has discretion to shorten the 30–day period in which a motion for
summary judgment must be heard before trial where circumstances warrant.”
 (Urshan, supra, 120
Cal.App.4th at p. 764, italics added; see Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(a)(3).)  SirReel has clearly
demonstrated, and Famous Group has not argued otherwise,[1] that the earliest date
SirReel could reserve for its motion for summary adjudication was February 25,
2025, approximately nine months after the previously set May 17, 2024 trial
date.  To rule otherwise would effectively
prohibit SirReel from bringing its motion for summary adjudication, despite
having timely filed it, and would otherwise punish SirReel for something beyond
its control.  Or, it would require an
extensive delay and the rescheduling of trial. 
Because an earlier date for the motion is now available that fits with
the current trial date, justice is best served to move the motion date.  
Additionally,
although not expressly addressed in either party’s respective briefs, the Court
notes that shortening time here is permitted only to the extent that it does
not improperly shorten the 75-day notice period provided under Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (a)(2), which is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  (See Urshan, supra, 120
Cal.App.4th at p. 764.)  This is not an
issue, as the Court will set the new hearing date to be July 19, 2024. 
The
Court also finds Famous Group’s arguments regarding the stipulation to be
unpersuasive.  Nothing in the stipulation
supports the contention that that was intended to be SirReel’s only means of
resolving the timing issue with the hearing on the motion for summary
adjudication.  It simply provides that
the hearing on the motion for summary adjudication is one of many bases for
continuing the trial date.  (See
Stipulation (2/9/24), ¶¶ 6, 9-11.)
The
Court further finds Famous Group’s concerns regarding discovery to be
unavailing.  The reason the statute
provides a mandatory 75-day notice period is precisely to permit the opposing
party time to conduct discovery and thereby oppose the motion.  (Lackner v. North (2006) 135
Cal.App.4th 1188, 1208.)  As long as the
hearing occurs more than 75 days after SirReel served the motion for summary
adjudication and at least 30 days before trial, which is now set for September
16, 2024, Famous Group will have sufficient time to conduct the discovery it
needs to oppose the motion.  The July 19
summary adjudication date provides sufficient time for discovery.
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS SirReel’s motion and moves the Motion for
Summary Adjudication to July 19, 2024, at 1:30p.m. 
IV.        
CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS SirReel’s motion for
order shortening time to hear its motion for summary adjudication.
