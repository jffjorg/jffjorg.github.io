And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Avis' motion to continue the trial date and final status conference date. The motion is unopposed. Defendant Avis seeks a continuance due to their counsel's eye surgery, which requires a 30-day recovery period. Additionally, Defendant Galindo was recently located in Mexico and is unavailable for the present trial date, but will be available later in March 2024. The judge finds good cause to continue the trial date and final status conference date, citing the impact of the eye surgery on counsel's ability to participate in the trial and Defendant Galindo's unavailability for the present trial date. The judge notes that there have already been multiple trial continuances in this action and will strongly disfavor any additional continuance requests. The new trial date and final status conference dates are set for [insert dates].
