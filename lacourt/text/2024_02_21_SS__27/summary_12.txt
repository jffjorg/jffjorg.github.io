The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike punitive damages from a complaint filed by Daryoush Chaharbakshielieh against John Jack Tannous. The motion was unopposed and seeks to strike certain allegations from the complaint regarding driving while intoxicated. The judge finds that the complaint's allegations of driving while intoxicated are conclusory and unsupported by facts, and therefore grants the motion with leave to amend. The judge also notes that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages based on driving while intoxicated. The judge declines to consider Defendant's contentions regarding the traffic collision report, which is outside the four corners of the complaint. The judge grants the motion to strike and orders Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days.
