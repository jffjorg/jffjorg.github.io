I.           
INTRODUCTION
This action arises from a motor vehicle
accident that occurred on July 8, 2020. On June 29, 2022, Plaintiff Ana Luisa
Matul Lopez Gomez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Aurelio
Sanchez (“Sanchez”), Joy Max Trading, Inc., a California Corporation, and Does
1 to 50, alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and general negligence. On
September 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint
against the same Defendants, alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle and
two causes of action for general negligence.
On December 12, 2023, Jacqueline
Bouche, counsel for Sanchez (“Counsel”), filed the instant motion to be
relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed.
On February 7, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on this motion to permit Counsel to correct deficiencies
noted in the Court’s prior tentative ruling on this motion. On February 8,
2024, Counsel submitted an amended declaration and proposed order.
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The Court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 403-407.) 
A motion to be relieved
as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served
“on the client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
III.       
DISCUSSION
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship. (Bouche Decl., ¶ 2.) The Court finds
this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. A breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of
Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.)
However, the Court still finds some issues with Counsel’s motion,
despite the amended declaration and proposed order. First, there is no proof of
service of these new documents on Plaintiff or on the other parties to this
action, whereas the moving papers contained such a proof of service. (See Motion
(12/12/23); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)
Second, paragraph 3, subdivision (a)(2), of Counsel’s declaration conflicts
with paragraph 6 of the new proposed order, the former of which indicates
service at Plaintiff’s last known address while the latter refers to
Plaintiff’s current address. (See Bouche Decl., ¶ 3, subd. (2); Proposed Order,
¶ 6.)
Third, paragraph 6 of the proposed order does not contain Plaintiff’s
telephone number. (Proposed Order, ¶ 6.) Paragraph 8 of the proposed order also
fails to provide the time and place of the hearings identified therein.
(Proposed Order, ¶ 8.)
Therefore, the
Court DENIES the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice.
IV.        
CONCLUSION
The Court DENIES
the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice.
Moving party to give notice.
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.

this 21st day of February 2024
