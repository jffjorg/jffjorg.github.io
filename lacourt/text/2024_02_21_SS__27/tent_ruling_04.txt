I.       INTRODUCTION
          Claimant
Jose Sierra (“Claimant”), a person with a disability, by and through his
Guardian Ad Litem, Maria Sierra (“Petitioner”), has agreed to settle their
claims against Defendant Jordan Hernandez in exchange for $4,000,000.00. If
approved, $708,668.87 will be used for medical expenses, $1,600,000.00 will be
used for attorney’s fees, and $117,810.59 will be used for non-medical
expenses, leaving a balance of $1,573,520.54 for Claimant with $1,000,000.00 to
be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only
upon authorization of the court and $573,520.54 to be paid or transferred to
the trustee of a special needs trust established under Probate Code section
3604. 
II.      DISCUSSION
          The Court has
reviewed the proposed settlement and finds that the amount is fair and
reasonable based on the circumstances of the case and supporting documentation.
The Court finds counsel’s fees in the amount of 40% of the total settlement
fair and reasonable in light of counsel’s declaration and retainer agreement. The
Petition attaches all relevant medical records and both Medicare and Medi-Cal
demand letters. However, Item 12.b(3) is incomplete, i.e., the reduction amount
is missing. Further, the demand amount for Medicare appears to be less than the
amount sought of $17,145.96. (See Attachment 12b(3).) While a demand letter is
attached, this does not appear to be the final demand letter or letter
agreement. Petitioner is to attach the final letter or provide clarification to
the Court.
          The Court will
hear from counsel. 
       Dated
this 21st day of February 2024
