And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Lee S. Arian regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Jacqueline Bouche on behalf of Defendant Aurelio Sanchez. The motion is unopposed. The Court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is proper grounds for Counsel's withdrawal, but denies the motion without prejudice due to deficiencies in the amended declaration and proposed order. The Court notes that there is no proof of service of the new documents on Plaintiff or the other parties, and that paragraphs 3 and 6 of the proposed order are inconsistent. The Court also requests that the parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling email the Court to indicate their intention to do so.
