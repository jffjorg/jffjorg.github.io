DATE:  N/A 
 
CASE:                         Ariana
Steinberg, et al. v. Uber, Inc., et al. 
 
CASE NO.:                     20STCV04823 
 
 
 
EXPEDITED PETITION TO APPROVE MINOR’S
COMPROMISE  
 
 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner Ariana
Steinberg 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 

Claimant Evelyn Steinberg
(“Claimant”), a minor, by and through her parent, Petitioner Ariana Steinberg
(“Petitioner”), has agreed to settle her claims against Defendant Uber
Technologies (“Defendant”) in exchange for a total of $7,500. If approved,
$878.34 will be used for medical expenses, and $1,875 will be used for
attorney’s fees, leaving a balance of $4,746.66 for Claimant to be deposited at
Chase Bank in North Hollywood, California, subject to withdrawal only on
authorization of the court.
 
Court approval is required for all
settlements of a minor’s claim. (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ.
Proc. § 372.) The petition must be verified and “must contain a full disclosure
of all information that has any bearing on the reasonableness of the
compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.950.)
 
This hearing was continued from
January 11, 2024. On that date, the Court noted the following defects in the
petition: 
·        
The terms of the settlement at Item 10 must be
filled out.
·        
Attachment 11b(3) does not sufficiently explain
the circumstances and the effect Petitioner’s claim and its disposition has on the
proposed compromise of the claim in the instant petition.
·        
A copy of the written fee agreement is not
attached as Attachment 17a.
·        
The amount stated at Item 15 should be
$4,746.66, not $5,625.
 
As of February
15, 2024, no new papers have been filed. 
 
Accordingly, the hearing on the
Petition is CONTINUED.
 
Petitioner is to resolve the
deficiencies raised above.
 
On the Court's own motion, the
Hearing on Petition to Confirm Minor's Compromise with Special Needs Trust and
Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement) scheduled for 02/21/2024, are
continued to [date]
at 01:30 PM in Department 27 at Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Judicial Assistant is to give
notice to moving party, who is ordered to provide notice to all other parties.
 
Certificate of Mailing is attached.
