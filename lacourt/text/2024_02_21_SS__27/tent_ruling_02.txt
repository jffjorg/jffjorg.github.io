I.           
INTRODUCTION
This
action arises from Plaintiff Vahe Leon Andonian (“Plaintiff”) tripping and
falling on a sidewalk. On September 24, 2019, Plaintiff filed a complaint
against Defendants City of Glendale (“Defendant”), County of Los Angeles, and
DOES 1 to 50, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Premises Liability
and (2) General Negligence. 
On
July 12, 2021, Defendant filed an answer to the complaint. 
On
April 25, 2022, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request for dismissal, Defendant County
of Los Angeles was dismissed from this action without prejudice. 
On
November 17, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition and ordered Plaintiff to appear for deposition within 30 days.
(11/17/23 Minute Order at p.3.) The Court also ordered Plaintiff to pay
monetary sanctions in the total amount of $500.00. (Id.) 
On
November 20, 2023, Defendant filed and served notice of the Court’s November
17, 2023 order. 
On
January 25, 2024, Defendant filed and served the instant motion to dismiss this
action pursuant to CCP § 2023.030(d)(3) on the grounds that Plaintiff disobeyed
this Court’s order compelling his deposition (the “Motion”). Alternatively, Defendant
requests issue and evidentiary sanctions against Plaintiff. Although filed and
captioned as a motion to dismiss, the Motion is effectively a motion for
terminating sanctions. 
Defendant’s
motion is unopposed. Any opposition brief was required to have been filed and
served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).)  
II.      LEGAL STANDARD 
          If a party
fails to obey a court order compelling such party’s deposition “[t]he court may
make those orders that are just against the disobedient party . . . including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (k).) A terminating sanction is
imposed when there is “[a]n order dismissing the action, or any part of the
action, of that party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3).) 
“The discovery statutes evince an
incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors,
Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992, internal quotations omitted.)
“Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.” (Ibid. internal quotations omitted.)
“[C]ontinuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher
sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.)
Where discovery violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Ibid.) A trial court has broad discretion to impose
discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally a prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004)
124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Where discovery sanctions are requested against a
party, there must be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure
must be willful. (Ibid.)  
III.    DISCUSSION 
Issue No.1: Terminating Sanctions    
          Carl B. Arias
(“Arias”), Counsel for Defendant, provides a declaration in support of the Motion.
Counsel declares that Defendant first noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for April
20, 2023; however, on April 19, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendant’s
counsel that she could not attend the deposition due to a family emergency.
(Arias Decl., ¶ 2.) The parties conferred on a new deposition date and such
deposition was scheduled for May 9, 2023. (Id.) On May 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel called Defendant’s counsel stating that Plaintiff could not attend the
May 9, 2023, deposition due to Plaintiff being ill. (Id., ¶ 3.) 
The parties met and conferred and set a
July 13, 2023, deposition date; however, on July 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel indicated
that Plaintiff could not attend the deposition due to a conflict. (Arias Decl.,
¶¶ 3-4.) Defendant then noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for August 16, 2023. (Id.,
¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s counsel e-mailed Defendant’s counsel on August 15, 2023,
stating that Plaintiff could not attend the deposition because counsel was ill.
(Id., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff failed to appear for his August 16, 2023, noticed
deposition. (Id., ¶ 6.) 
          On November
17, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition
and Plaintiff was ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days and pay
monetary sanctions in the amount of $500.00. (Arias Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff’s
counsel agreed to produce Plaintiff for deposition on December 28, 2023;
however, such date was rescheduled to January 16, 2024, at the request of Plaintiff’s
counsel who stated that Plaintiff was ill. (Id., ¶ 8; Exhibit.)
Plaintiff failed to appear for his January 16, 2024, deposition and has not
paid the monetary sanctions ordered by the Court pursuant to its November 17,
2023 order. (Id., ¶¶ 7-9; Exhibits B-C.) Counsel also states that
Plaintiff failed to appear for his noticed physical examination. (Id., ¶
10.) Defendant has been prejudiced due to the inability to depose Plaintiff or obtain
an IME. (Id., ¶ 11.)
          Analysis
as to Terminating Sanctions 
          The Court
finds Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court’s November 17, 2023 order.
Plaintiff had notice of this Court’s November 17, 2023 order and does not
present any evidence addressing his failure to comply. Thus, the Court finds
that such failure was willful. 
Beyond the willful failure to comply
with the court order re appearing for deposition, Plaintiff has also failed to
comply with the Court’s order to pay sanctions. 
Taken in concert with Plaintiff’s failure to appear at several noticed
depositions, the Court finds that sanctions short of terminating sanctions are unlikely
to result in Plaintiff’s compliant participation in this case.  That finding is supported by the fact that
Plaintiff did not even oppose the current motion.  The Court thus grants Defendant’s motion and
hereby issues terminating sanctions against Plaintiff.
IV.     CONCLUSION
Defendant’s motion, now deemed a motion
for terminating sanctions, is GRANTED.  
Moving party is ordered to give notice.

Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
