And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to quash the subpoena directed to Chris Tagawa, Betty Green, and Gardena Valley Baptist Church. The defendants argue that the subpoenas are overbroad and seek irrelevant information, but the judge finds that the subpoenas are relevant to the subject matter of the case and are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also notes that the defendants failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that the subpoenas are not relevant to the case and that the discovery requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
