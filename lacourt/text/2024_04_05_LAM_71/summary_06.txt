And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and instead set a hearing to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should not be sanctioned for failing to enter default judgment. The hearing is scheduled for August 12, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The reasons for the denial include the lack of a JUD-100 submitted for proposed judgment, the failure to provide an interest calculation, and the request for court judgment not properly seeking an amount equal to or less than the amount sought in the prayer of the complaint.
