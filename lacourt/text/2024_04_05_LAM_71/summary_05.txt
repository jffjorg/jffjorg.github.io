The hearing is scheduled for August 12, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The reasons for denial include the lack of a JUD-100 submitted for proposed judgment, no interest calculation provided, and the request for court judgment does not properly seek an amount equal to or less than the amount sought in the complaint. The court is acting in accordance with California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h) and the case law stated in Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823.
