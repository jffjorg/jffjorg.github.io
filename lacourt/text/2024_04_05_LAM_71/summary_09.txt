Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Andre Costa's motion to quash service of summons. The motion was filed on March 8, 2024, and argued that Plaintiff Hollywood 180 Holdco, LLC failed to serve the three-day notice of quit or pay rent. The judge found that Plaintiff properly served the summons by posting it on March 2, 2024, and mailing a copy to Defendant on the same day. The judge also noted that Defendant's argument that he was out of state on the day the notice was posted is unavailing and not supported by case law. The judge concluded that Plaintiff met its burden to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving the facts requisite to an effective service, and therefore denied Defendant's motion to quash.
