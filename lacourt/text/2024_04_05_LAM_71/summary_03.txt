Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained Hightechlending's demurrer to the 2nd and 4th causes of action with 20 days leave to amend. The 2nd cause of action alleges negligence, and the court finds that Plaintiffs failed to allege a legal duty of care owed to them by Hightechlending. The 4th cause of action alleges negligent misrepresentation, and the court finds that Plaintiffs failed to allege their cause of action with the requisite particularity. The court grants leave to amend, allowing Plaintiffs to clarify their allegations and re-file their complaint.
