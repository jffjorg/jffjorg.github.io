And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant, Andre Costa, argued that he was not properly served with the three-day notice of quit or pay rent, as he was out of the state on the day the notice was posted on his door. However, the judge found that the service was proper and that the plaintiff met its burden to prove personal jurisdiction. The judge cited various California statutes and case law to support its decision, including C.C.P. §415.45, which allows for service of summons by posting, and C.C.P. §1162(a)(3), which provides for service by posting and mailing. The judge also noted that the plaintiff filed its application for order to serve summons by posting and attached a non-service report of attempted personal service, and that the summons and complaint were served on March 2, 2024, and proof of service was filed on March 20, 2024. Overall, the judge ruled that the defendant's motion was denied and that the plaintiff's service of summons was valid.
