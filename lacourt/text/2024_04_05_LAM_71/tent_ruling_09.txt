 Hearing Date:  April 5, 2024



 
Specially Appearing Defendant
Andre Costa’s motion to quash service of summons is denied.

 
Specially Appearing Defendant Andre Costa (“Costa”) (“Specially
Appearing Defendant”) moves to quash Plaintiff Hollywood 180 Holdco, LLC’s (“Hollywood
180”) (“Plaintiff”) service of summons upon it, or in the alternative, strike
the Complaint, on the grounds Plaintiff failed to serve the three-day notice of
quit or pay rent.  (Notice Quash, pgs. 1-2.)
 
Procedural
History
Plaintiff
filed the operative Complaint for unlawful detainer (“UD”) on November 16,
2023.  On January 23, 2024, this Court
granted Plaintiff’s application for order to serve summons by posting for
unlawful detainer at the property located at 1619 N. La Brea Avenue #307, Los
Angeles, CA 90028.  (1/23/24 Application
for Order to Post.)  On March 20, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a proof of service of summons and notice of ODR-UD by posting a
copy of the documents and mailing a copy on March 2, 2024, at 6:35 am to the
abovementioned address.  (3/20/24 POS.)
Costa
filed the instant motion on March 8, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed its opposition on March 27, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
“A defendant, on or before the day of his or her time to
plead . . . may serve and file a notice of motion . . . [t]o quash service of
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (C.C.P. §418.10(a)(1).)  By filing such motion, “a defendant makes a
special appearance for the narrow purpose of contesting personal jurisdiction
where the summons is defective.”  (Stancil
v. Superior Court (2021) 11 Cal.5th 381, 393.)
“[A]n unlawful detainer defendant may properly file a motion
to quash to contest a summons. The accelerated five-day summons required under
section 1167 is applicable only in unlawful detainer cases. So where the
summons instructs the defendant to respond in five days but is not accompanied
with a complaint for unlawful detainer, the summons is improper and may be
challenged via a motion to quash. A complaint that fails to even allege the
defendant is guilty of unlawful detainer, as defined in the relevant subdivision
of section 1161, cannot support the five-day summons exclusive to unlawful
detainer cases. In those limited circumstances, which we expect to arise
infrequently, an unlawful detainer defendant may choose to use a motion to
quash to challenge the summons as improper. 
(Id. at pgs. 400-401.)
“In the absence of a voluntary submission to the authority
of the court, compliance with the statutes governing service of process is
essential to establish that court’s personal jurisdiction over a defendant.”  (Floveyer International, Ltd. v. Superior
Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 793; see also Calvert v. Al Binali
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 954, 961 [“To establish personal jurisdiction, it is essential
to comply with the statutory procedures for service of process.”].)  “When a defendant challenges that jurisdiction
by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.”  (Lebel v. Mai
(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160, internal quotations omitted.)
Proper service of a three-day notice to quit or pay rent (C.C.P.
§1162; Civ. Code §1946) is an essential prerequisite to a UD judgment awarding
possession to the landlord and must be alleged in the complaint: The complaint
must “[s]tate specifically the method used to serve the defendant with the
notice or notices of termination upon which the complaint is based.”  (C.C.P. §1166(a)(5); see Borsuk v.
Appellate Division of Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 607, 611; Palm
Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1425; Liebovich
v. Shahrokhkhany (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 511, 513.)
C.C.P. §415.45 provides,
(a) A summons in an action for unlawful detainer of real
property may be served by posting if upon affidavit it appears to the
satisfaction of the court in which the action is pending that the party to be
served cannot with reasonable diligence be served in any manner specified in
this article other than publication and that:
(1) A cause of action exists against the party upon whom
service is to be made or he is a necessary or proper party to the action; or
(2) The party to be served has or claims an interest in real
property in this state that is subject to the jurisdiction of the court or the
relief demanded in the action consists wholly or in part in excluding such
party from any interest in such property.
(b) The court shall order the summons to be posted on the
premises in a manner most likely to give actual notice to the party to be
served and direct that a copy of the summons and of the complaint be forthwith
mailed by certified mail to such party at his last known address.
(c) Service of summons in this manner is deemed complete
on the 10th day after posting and mailing.
(d) Notwithstanding an order for posting of the summons, a
summons may be served in any other manner authorized by this article, except
publication, in which event such service shall supersede any posted summons.
 
(C.C.P. §415.45,
emphasis added.)
 
Discussion
Costa’s
argument that he was not properly served by Plaintiff on the basis that he was
out of the state on the day the three-day notice and summons were posted on his
door is unavailing and not supported in his motion by case law.  
Personal
service may be effectuated pursuant to C.C.P. §1162(a)(3) if a person of
suitable age or discretion cannot be found at a tenant’s place of residence  by affixing a copy of the three-day notice in
a conspicuous place on the property, and also delivering a copy to a person
there residing, if such person can be found; and also sending a copy through
the mail addressed to the tenant at the place where the property is situated.  (C.C.P. §1162(a)(3).)  Service of a summons in this manner is deemed
complete on the 10th day after posting and mailing.  (C.C.P. §415.45(d).) The filing of a proof of
service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper.  (Floveyor International, Ltd. v. Superior
Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 795.)  However, the presumption arises only if the
proof of service complies with the applicable statutory requirements.  (Id., citing Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441-1442.)
Here,
Plaintiff filed its Application and Order to serve Summons by Posting for UD on
January 10, 2024, attaching a Non-Service Report of attempted personal service.
The Order was signed on January 23, 2024, by Commissioner Latrice G. Byrdsong.
The Summons and Complaint were thereafter served on March 2, 2024. Proof of
Service was filed on March 20, 2024.
Plaintiff met its burden to prove the existence of
jurisdiction by proving the facts requisite to an effective service.  (See Lebel, 210 Cal.App.4th at
pg. 1160.)  Accordingly, Costa’s motion
is denied.
 
Conclusion
Costa’s
motion to quash service of summons is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
