```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for terminating sanctions filed by the defendant, EGL Properties, Inc. The motion was filed due to the plaintiff, Corey Brown, violating several court orders related to discovery. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to appear for a deposition, failed to serve verified responses to form interrogatories, and failed to respond to meet-and-confer efforts. The court found that the plaintiff has abandoned the case, willfully failed to comply with court orders, and that less severe sanctions would not ensure compliance with discovery rules. As a result, the court has granted the motion for terminating sanctions, which means that the plaintiff's case will be dismissed.
