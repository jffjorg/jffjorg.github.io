And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment in the case of Kathryn Lewis vs Zoe Dimme-Alexeff, et al. The case involves a triathlon accident and the defendants' alleged gross negligence. The judge has identified several key issues to be addressed at the hearing, including:

* Whether the plaintiff has raised sufficient evidence to support a claim of gross negligence
* The location of the flagger at the time of the accident
* The effectiveness of the safety measures implemented by the defendants
* Whether the plaintiff's contentions that a flagger would have prevented the accident are speculative and dependent on the flagger's location

The judge has also highlighted the relevant law, citing City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4th 747, 754, which defines gross negligence as conduct that reflects a "want of even scant care" or "an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of conduct". The defendants implemented various safety measures, including barricades, cones, signs, and police presence, and the judge is seeking clarification on how these measures amount to "want of even scant care".
