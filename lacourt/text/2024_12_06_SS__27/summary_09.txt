```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration and vacating the previous order of dismissal. The Plaintiff filed the auto accident case on October 12, 2022, but failed to serve the Defendant with process. The Court issued an order stating that the case might be dismissed if no proof of service was filed by October 14, 2024. Despite this, the Defendant was not served, and the Court ultimately dismissed the case on October 14, 2024. The Plaintiff then moved for reconsideration, presenting new facts and evidence demonstrating diligence in prosecuting the case. The Judge has found that these new facts and evidence were not available to or relied upon by the Court when it made its previous decision, and therefore grants the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
