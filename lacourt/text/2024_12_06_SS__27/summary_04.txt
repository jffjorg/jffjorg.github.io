And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case without prejudice. The plaintiff, proceeding pro per, filed the present action against various defendants represented by counsel Fred Smith. However, the plaintiff failed to appear for trial on July 19, 2024, and the Court dismissed the action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581(b)(3). The plaintiff then filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, but failed to file proof of service, leaving the Court uncertain whether defendants had an opportunity to oppose the motion. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice. The parties are advised to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument on December 6, 2024.
