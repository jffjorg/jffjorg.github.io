Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the
court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of
the discovery process. Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond
to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) A court may impose
terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of
discovery or entering default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d).) A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of
terminating sanctions. Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620. Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court’s orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796.)
 
The court should consider the totality of the
circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater
sanction is warranted. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th
1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not
an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate sanction.” (Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.) Before any sanctions may be imposed the court
must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party
to serve the required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles
County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be deemed
willful where the party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply,
and failed to comply. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland
Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605,
610-611.) The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the
burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.)
 
A terminating sanction is a “drastic measure
which should be employed with caution.” (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But
where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence
shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) While the court
has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should be
appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo,
84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations.” (Ibid.)
 
Discussion
On August 19, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the present premises liability action against Defendant EGL
Properties. On June 11, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to
be relieved as counsel. Since that time, Plaintiff has been proceeding pro
per. Defendant now moves the court for terminating sanctions based on
Plaintiff’s violation of the following court orders:
On August 9, 2024, this
Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel and ordered Plaintiff to appear for
deposition within 30 days. Defendant served an amended deposition notice for
September 6, 2024, and personally delivered the remote deposition credentials
to Plaintiff’s last known address. Plaintiff failed to appear for the
deposition and did not respond to Defendant’s meet and confer efforts to
reschedule.
On September 17, 2024,
this Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel and ordered Plaintiff to serve
verified responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set Two, by October 7,
2024. Plaintiff has neither complied nor requested an extension.
Furthermore, Plaintiff
has failed to respond to Defendant’s meet-and-confer efforts or contribute to
trial preparations. Despite Defendant's attempts to collaborate on joint trial
documents, Plaintiff refused to provide any input. After the final status conference
was continued to October 2, 2024, Defendant again sent draft trial documents
requesting Plaintiff’s portions, but Plaintiff failed to respond.
It appears Plaintiff
has effectively abandoned this case following the Court’s order relieving his
counsel. Plaintiff failed to oppose Defendant’s motion to compel his deposition
and did not appear at the hearing on that motion. Despite the Court granting
Defendant’s motion and ordering Plaintiff to appear for deposition, Plaintiff
failed to comply and made no effort to reschedule or justify his noncompliance.
Similarly, Plaintiff
did not oppose Defendant’s motion to compel initial discovery responses, failed
to appear at the hearing, and disregarded the Court’s subsequent order
requiring him to serve verified responses. Plaintiff has also consistently
refused to engage in meet-and-confer efforts related to discovery or trial
preparation, including Defendant’s attempts to prepare and finalize joint trial
documents. Additionally, Plaintiff did not oppose Defendant’s present motion
for terminating sanctions.
The Court finds that
Plaintiff has abandoned his case, willfully failed to comply with the Court’s
orders, and that less severe sanctions would not ensure compliance with
discovery rules. Accordingly, the motion for terminating sanctions is granted.
