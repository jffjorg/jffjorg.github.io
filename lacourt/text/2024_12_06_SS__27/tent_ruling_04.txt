CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV39123 GUSTAVO PINA
REYNAGA vs HELEN M. LIN, et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Insufficient 
Ruling: DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE 
 
On October 22, 2021,
Plaintiff, proceeding pro per, filed the present action against various
Defendants represented by counsel Fred Smith. On July 19, 2024, Plaintiff
failed to appear for trial, and the Court dismissed the action pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 581(b)(3), which permits dismissal "when no
party appears for trial following 30 days' notice of the time and place of
trial."
On November 8, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal. However, no proof of service
was filed, leaving the Court uncertain whether Defendants had an opportunity to
oppose the motion. Accordingly, the motion is denied without prejudice.
