And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Three, and another to compel production of documents demanded in a deposition notice.

Regarding the motion to compel further responses, the Judge grants the motion in part. The Judge finds that the Defendant's objections to Special Interrogatory number 14 are without merit, and the Defendant must provide further responses to the interrogatory. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's delays in producing the information are reasonable and does not warrant sanctions.

Regarding the motion to compel production of documents, the Judge denies the motion. The Judge finds that the motion was not timely filed and is therefore denied.

The Judge sets a deadline for the Defendant to provide further responses to the interrogatory and finds that complaints after the incident do not appear relevant. The Judge also notes that the Defendant's claims manager, Ignacio Nunez, passed away, which delayed production, and the Defendant's counsel substituted into the case on July 29, 2024.
