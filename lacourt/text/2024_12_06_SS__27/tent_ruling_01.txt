Hearing Date: 12/5/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV18035 BENJAMIN LEISER
vs CITY OF LOS ANGELES 
Moving Party: Plaintiff 
Responding Party: Defendant City of Los
Angeles
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: Sustained with leave to amend
 
Background
On May 13, 2021,
Plaintiff filed his complaint against Shelter Clean Services and the City of
Los Angeles, alleging that he fell off his bicycle while traveling over broken
concrete in a bike lane owned and maintained by Defendants. On September 26,
2024, Plaintiff filed his Second Amended Complaint, which is the operative
complaint in this case. On October 31, 2024, Defendant City of Los Angeles
filed its amended answer to the operative complaint. The portion of the amended
answer at issue is Defendant's 12th Affirmative Defense, which states:
This answering Defendant is informed and
believes and on that basis alleges that to the extent that the Complaint herein
purports to state causes of action not specifically allowed by the Government
Code, this answering Defendant, which is a government entity, is immune from
liability herein under one or more of the following provisions of the
California Government Code: § 815 (and sub-sections, including but not limited
to § 815.2(b), § 815.4, § 815.6); § 818 (and sub-sections, including but not
limited to § 818.2, §818.4, §818.6); § 820 (and sub-sections, including but not
limited to § 820.2, § 820.4, § 820.8); § 821 (and sub-sections, including but
not limited to § 821.2, § 821.4); § 830 (and sub-sections, including but not
limited to § 830(a), § 830.2, § 830.6,§ 830.8); § 831 (and sub-sections,
including but not limited to § 831.4, § 831.7); § 835 (and sub-sections,
including but not limited to § 835.2, § 835.4, § 835.4(a), § 835.4(b)); and §
840 (and sub-sections, including but not limited to § 840.4, § 840.6).
Plaintiff now moves the
Court to sustain a demurrer to Defendant’s 12th Affirmative Defense on the
ground that it merely cites various portions of the Government Code granting
governmental immunity and, therefore, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute
a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (a).)
Legal Standard
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
430.20 in pertinent part provides: “A party against whom an answer has been
filed may object, by demurrer as provided in Section 430.30, to the answer upon
any one or more of the following grounds: (a) The answer does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a defense.
The
answer should contain any and all affirmative defenses or objections to the
complaint that defendant may have and that would otherwise not be in issue
under a simple denial.  Such defenses or objections are “new
matter.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (b).)  Generally, a
defendant bears the burden of proving “new matter” and, as such, must be
specifically pleaded in the answer.  (California Academy of Sciences v.
County of Fresno (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1436, 1442.)  “The phrase ‘new
matter’ refers to something relied on by a defendant which is not put in issue
by the plaintiff.”  (Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community College
District (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1546.)  Where the answer sets
forth facts showing some essential allegation of the complaint is not true,
such facts are not new matter but are denials.  (Ibid.) 
 
The
same pleading of “ultimate facts” rather than evidentiary matter or legal
conclusions is required as in pleading a complaint.  The answer must aver
facts as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which constitute the
cause of action and which are alleged in the complaint.  (FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashimi (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384.)  The
various affirmative defenses must be separately stated and must refer to the
causes of action to which they relate “in a manner by which they may be intelligently
distinguished.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30(g).)
 
Discussion
Defendant filed an
opposition. It does not dispute the rule that answers are subject to the same
pleading standards as complaints and that legal conclusions are insufficient to
plead an affirmative defense but argues that sufficient facts have been
alleged.
Defendant states, “The
overarching fact at issue that is central to the City's 12th Affirmative
Defense is that the City, as a government entity, has immunity as to
Plaintiff's claims under a variety of sections of the Government Code, as
listed in the 12th Affirmative Defense.” Defendant basically argues that it has
pleaded sufficient facts by alleging that it is a governmental agency.
Affirmative defenses
must not be pled as ‘terse legal conclusions,’ but ‘rather ... as facts
“averred as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which constitute the
cause of action and are alleged in the complaint.”’ (Department of
Finance v. City of Merced (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 286, 294.) While the fact
that Defendant is a governmental agency is a threshold requirement, it is
insufficient on its own to allege ultimate facts for each affirmative defense.
For example, Defendant cites Government Code section 831.7, which states that
neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable to any person who
participates in a hazardous recreational activity, including any person
assisting the participant or a spectator who knew or reasonably should have
known that the activity created a substantial risk of injury, for any damage or
injury arising out of that activity. However, this case concerns an incident
where Plaintiff, while riding his bike, hit broken concrete and fell. There is
nothing in the complaint or the answer to suggest that Plaintiff was
participating in a hazardous recreational activity. 
Defendant must plead
specific facts showing how the statutory immunities apply to the particular
claims alleged by Plaintiff. Without factual allegations connecting Plaintiff’s
claims to the statutory framework of immunity, Defendant’s affirmative defenses
are legally insufficient.
The City then argues
that it “included those Government Code immunities – including sections and
subsections of the Code – which the City, at this stage of the investigation
into Plaintiff's allegations, reasonably believes may potentially pertain.”
However, Defendant must articulate the facts supporting its belief that certain
immunities are applicable and others are not. Defendant has failed to do so in
its answer, which consists solely of a list of citations to Government Code
sections.
Furthermore, the fact
that Defendant is investigating the incident is not exclusive to Defendant. If
Plaintiff, despite ongoing investigations, is required to allege ultimate facts
to support the cause of action, there is no reason Defendant cannot do the same
for its affirmative defenses. Defendant must adhere to the same pleading
standards as Plaintiff at this stage. The requirement to plead "ultimate
facts" rather than legal conclusions applies equally to answers and
complaints. (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
367, 384.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 12th Affirmative Defense is sustained with leave to
amend within 30 days.
