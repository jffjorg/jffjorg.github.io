And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel initial responses to requests for production of documents and the request for sanctions. The case involves allegations of workplace discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, as well as wage and hour violations. The plaintiff, David Allen, served a request for production of documents on April 9, 2024, and the parties agreed to a response deadline of June 18, 2024. However, the defendant, Koso M-Mac International, Inc., did not submit responses until August 22, 2024, due to personal circumstances. The judge has denied the motion to compel as moot, as the defendant has submitted verified responses without objection. The judge has also denied the request for sanctions, finding that the defendant's delay was justified due to personal circumstances and that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
