  #3049]



 
I. Background
Plaintiff David Allen (Allen) sues
Defendants Pacific Seismic Products, Inc., Koso M-Mac International, (Koso
M-Mac), Koso International, Koso America, Rexa Inc., Nihon Koso Co. Ltd.,  Giovanny Martinez, and Does 1 through 20 (collectively,
Defendants) pursuant to a June 14, 2023, Second Amended Complaint (SAC)
alleging (1) FEHA Discrimination, (2) FEHA Harassment, (3) FEHA Retaliation,
(4) FEHA Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation, (5)
FEHA Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations, (6) FEHA Failure to Engage
in the Interactive Process, (7) Violation of California Family Rights Act, (8)
Denial of and Discrimination Based Upon the Use of Sick Leave, (9) Retaliation
in Violation of Labor Code § 6310, (10) Declaratory Judgment, (11) Wrongful
Termination in Violation of Public Policy, (12) Retaliation for Disclosing
Violations of Law under the Labor Code, and (13) Unfair Competition in
violation of the Business and Professions Code
The claims arise from allegations
that, in his employment with Defendants, among other things, Allen was
subjected to workplace discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Fair
Employment and Housing Act, as well as various wage and hour violations. 
On April 9, 2024, Allen served a request
for production of documents (set one) (RFPs) on Defendant Koso M-Mac. 
On August 8, 2024, Allen filed this
motion to compel initial responses to RFPs and requested sanctions in the
amount of $3,068.91. 
On August 22, 2024 Koso M-Mac, submitted
responses to Allen’s RFP and filed an opposition to the motion to compel. 
Allen has not filed a reply. 
 
II. Motion to Compel Responses to Production
A.   
Legal Standard
A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(a); see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish this ground, a
movant must show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.040); (2) Expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30
days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260, subds. (a), (b)); and (3) No timely response (see Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300).
The Court retains jurisdiction to rule on the merits of
discovery motions even after requested discovery was provided after the motion
was filed. (Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 409.) 
B.   
Analysis
Here, Allen served the request for
production of documents on April 9, 2024. The parties agreed to a response
deadline of June 18, 2024. (Mot. p. 4:7.) Due to circumstances in counsel’s
personal life, Koso M-Mac did not submit responses until August 22, 2024. (Latter
Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) Although the responses were tardy, Koso M-Mac has submitted
verified responses without objection. (Opp., Ex. A.)     
Accordingly, the motion to compel is
DENIED as moot. 
C.   
Sanctions
The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted with
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanctions unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); see Sinaiko,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404.)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Even after a party provides
discovery responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has
authority to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses
“as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, at
p. 409.)
Here, Koso M-Mac’s counsel was dealing
with substantial personal matters that justifiably delayed the response to the discovery
request. Additionally, Allen’s counsel and Koso M-Mac’s counsel have been in
communication throughout July and August to schedule and conduct depositions
and discuss the case. (Latter Decl. ¶ 6.) Allen’s counsel took three depositions
between August 14 and August 21, 2024. (Latter Decl. ¶ 6.) No reply is filed to
respond to counsel’s representations. Thus, the Court finds that in these
circumstances, imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
Accordingly, the request for
sanctions is DENIED. 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff David Allen’s Motion to
Compel Responses to Requests for Production, Set One and Request for Monetary
Sanctions Against Defendant, Koso M-Mac International, Inc. [Res ID #3049] is DENIED.
