  Case Number:  21STCV27825    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling:
Defendants Steven Loeb
and Rosen and Loeb’s Motion for Sanctions
Defendants
Steven Loeb and Rosen and Loeb move for sanctions against plaintiff Victor
Enright under Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7.
Legal
Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 128.5 applies to “ ‘actions or tactics’ which
are both frivolous and in ‘bad-faith.’ ”  (Summers v. City of Cathedral City (1990)
225 Cal.App.3d 1047, 1070 (Summers).) 
“ ‘Actions or tactics’ include, but are not limited to, the making or
opposing of motions or the filing and service of a complaint.”  (CCP § 128.5(b)(1).)  “ ‘Frivolous’ means totally and
completely without merit.”  (Id.,
subd. (b)(2).)  “[A] showing that a party’s
action or tactic is totally and completely without merit does not settle the
issue of whether that action or tactic was in bad faith.  …  [T]he
trial court may not be willing to draw that inference if it is convinced that,
despite the complete lack of merit, the party was acting in the good faith
(albeit erroneous and even unreasonable) belief that the action was meritorious.”  (Id. at p. 1073.)  Sanctions under section 128.5 “requir[e] subjective bad faith” (In re Marriage of
Sahafzadeh-Taeb & Taeb (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 124, 128), meaning they
were “committed with an improper motive, such as to harass or manipulate
opposing counsel or the court” (id. at p. 141).
Similarly,
Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 permits courts to “impose sanctions for filing
a pleading if the court concludes the pleading was filed for an improper
purpose or was indisputably without merit, either legally or factually.” 
(Peake v. Underwood (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 428, 440.)  “A claim is factually frivolous if it is ‘not
well grounded in fact’ and it is legally frivolous if it is ‘not warranted by
existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or
reversal of existing law.’ ”  (Ibid.)  “In either case, to obtain sanctions, the
moving party must show the party’s conduct in asserting the claim was
objectively unreasonable.  [Citation.]  A claim is objectively unreasonable if ‘any
reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is totally and completely without
merit.’ ”  (Ibid.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 should
be utilized only in ‘the rare and exceptional case where the action is clearly
frivolous, legally unreasonable or without legal foundation, or brought for an
improper purpose.’ ”  (Kumar v. Ramsey
(2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 1110, 1121.)
Discussion
Defendants contend plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is sanctionable under both sections 128.5 and 128.7.  The record does not include sufficient
evidence that plaintiff or his counsel acted with subjective bad faith as
required under section 128.5.  The court
also finds that plaintiff’s motion, though unsuccessful, was not so unreasonable
as to fall within the rare and exceptional circumstances subject to sanctions
under section 128.7.
Defendants’ motion for sanctions is denied.
