Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: Azul Vision, Inc.'s motion to set aside its defaults as to cross-complainants Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross and Accountable Health Care IPA, and Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross's motion for a protective order to postpone depositions.

Regarding the first motion, the judge grants the motion to set aside the defaults, finding that Accountable Health Care IPA's first amended cross-complaint materially amended the claims against Azul Vision, Inc. The judge orders Azul Vision, Inc. to respond to the first amended cross-complaint within 15 days.

Regarding the second motion, the judge grants the motion for a protective order, finding that proceeding with depositions at this time would result in undue burden and expense. The judge orders that no depositions shall be held until February 21, 2025.
