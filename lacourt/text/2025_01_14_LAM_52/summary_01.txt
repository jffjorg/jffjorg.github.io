And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Steven Loeb and Rosen and Loeb, are seeking sanctions against the plaintiff, Victor Enright, under Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7. The defendants claim that the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is sanctionable because it is frivolous and was filed in bad faith. However, the court finds that the record does not include sufficient evidence to support a finding of subjective bad faith under section 128.5. Additionally, the court does not believe that the plaintiff's motion was so unreasonable as to fall within the rare and exceptional circumstances subject to sanctions under section 128.7. Therefore, the defendants' motion for sanctions is denied.
