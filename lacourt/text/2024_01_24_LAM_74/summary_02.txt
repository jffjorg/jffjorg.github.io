And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to amend its Application for and Renewal of Judgment. The motion was filed on November 28, 2023, after the court informed Plaintiff's counsel that the answer to question 5(g) of the application was insufficient. Specifically, Plaintiff's counsel listed a fee of $30.00, but the required fee is $45.00, as stated in Government Code, § 70626, subd. (b). Despite this error, Plaintiff's counsel paid the required fee of $45.00. The court will grant the motion to amend the application because the error was clerical in nature, and the court has the authority to correct such mistakes under Code of Civil Procedure, § 473, subd. (d). The court grants the motion, and Plaintiff shall give notice.
