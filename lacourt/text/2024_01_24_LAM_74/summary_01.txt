Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories. The plaintiff, Andrew Leavenworth, seeks further responses to form interrogatories 12.4 and 17.1, while the defendant, Gurbir Maker and Ujjal Maker, seek to avoid further responses. The court finds that the defendant's initial boilerplate objections are too general and improper, and therefore will only consider the objections expanded upon in the opposition. The court finds that the defendant's response to interrogatory 12.4 is sufficient, but finds that the defendant's response to interrogatory 17.1 is not sufficiently straightforward and therefore orders the defendant to provide a further, code-compliant response. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for attorney fees, awarding the plaintiff's counsel $1,413.56 for attorney fees as discovery sanctions. The court orders the plaintiff to pay by February 24, 2024, the defendant's counsel $1,500 for attorney's fees as discovery sanctions.
