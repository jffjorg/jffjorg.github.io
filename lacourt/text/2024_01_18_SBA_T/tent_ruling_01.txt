  Case Number:  23VECV03615    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV03615
Gabriel v GASA
Tentative
ruling: Ex parte application for nunc pro tunc order.  Denied. 
Given that publication for 2 weeks has already occurred, the court is not inclined
to retroactively modify the order based on information that the court did not
have at the time it issued the order. 
The court is willing to vacate the prior order and issue a new order and
publication can start with the next two weeks as scheduled but there will still
need to be 4 consecutive weeks of publication.
