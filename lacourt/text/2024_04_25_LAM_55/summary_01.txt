And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions: one for an order compelling Plaintiff John Doe to submit to a physical exam, and another for an order compelling Plaintiff to submit to a mental exam. The physical exam is sought to determine if Plaintiff's sexual issues stem from a physiological condition or emotional injuries. The Judge grants the physical exam, with modifications to ensure it takes place within 75 miles of Plaintiff's home.

The mental exam is sought to assess Plaintiff's current emotional distress and whether prior trauma may have played a role. The Judge grants the mental exam, with conditions to limit the length and breadth of the exam, and to ensure it is relevant to the allegations of molestation.

The Judge also denies both parties' requests for sanctions. The Judge orders the parties to meet and confer to work out the details of the exams, and will continue the hearing to facilitate this process.
