And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court is denying the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the Defendant. The Plaintiff, Fabian Gonzalez, is seeking documents related to General Motors' internal investigation and analysis of defects in the 2022 GMC Yukon, as well as communications, notices, and recalls concerning the electrical defect in vehicles of the same year, make, and model. The Defendant, General Motors LLC, argues that it has fully responded and/or served valid objections.

The Court has ordered the case bifurcated for both discovery and trial. In phase one, the parties will focus on the basic Song Beverly Act claim arising from the claimed breach of that Song Beverly statutory obligations. The discovery sought by the Plaintiff in this motion is not relevant to the phase one trial. Phase two will involve the Plaintiff's claim to a civil penalty under Civil Code § 1794(c) for a willful violation of the statute. Discovery on the phase two issues, such as whether or not the Defendant knew that it could not repair the claimed defects, based on its knowledge learned from vehicles other than the Plaintiff's vehicle, shall be deferred until after the trier of fact has returned a verdict favorable to the Plaintiff in phase one.
