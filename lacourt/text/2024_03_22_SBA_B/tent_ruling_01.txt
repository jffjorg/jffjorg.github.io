  Case Number:  19TRCV00125    Hearing Date:   March 22, 2024    Dept:  B KURT BAKER, et al. vs REDONDO RIVIERA ASSOCIATES, LLC, A
CALIFORNIA LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY
Case No. 19TRCV00125
Motion for Summary Adjudication against Plaintiff Riviera
Fitness LLC
Yup, it happened again.  The Court does not have the moving papers and
therefore must continue the hearing on the Motion for Summary Adjudication
against Plaintiff Riviera Fitness LLC. 
The Court is advised by staff that the motions were rejected twice back
on 09/05/23 and 11/28/23 because the attorney had the wrong hearing date on the
motion.
The Court suggests that the hearing be continued to April
10, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  Moving party must
notice and file the moving papers no later than Wednesday, March 27, 2024.  They must be identical to the previously served
motion papers.  No additional briefs
shall be filed, as the responding party had fully briefed the motion.
