RULING

BACKGROUND
            On June 10, 2016, Craig Mizufuka
filed a complaint against Ronald Ikejiri for breach of contract. 
            On February 8, 2018, judgment
pursuant to stipulation for entry of judgment was entered, stating that
defendant shall pay plaintiff $217,233, comprised of $177,731 in principal,
$21,327 in interest, and $18,175 in attorney’s fees.
            On April 28, 2023, plaintiff filed a
writ of execution for $325,889, including $108,616 in accrued interest.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            “As a general rule, all property of
a judgment debtor is subject to enforcement of a money judgment. The California
Constitution, however, requires the Legislature to protect ‘a certain portion’
of a debtor’s property from forced sale. (Cal. Const., art. XX, § 1.5.) The
purpose of this requirement is to protect enough of the debtors’ property from
enforcement to enable them to support themselves and their families, and to
help shift the cost of social welfare for debtors from the community to
judgment creditors. [¶] To that end, California has enacted a ‘comprehensive
and precisely detailed scheme’ governing enforcement of money judgments. The
kinds and degrees of property exempt from levy are described in [Code of Civil
Procedure] sections 704.010 through 704.210. These provisions relate to
property of the debtor that would ordinarily be subject to enforcement of a
money judgment by execution or otherwise, but for the statute allowing the
debtor to retain all or part of it to protect himself and his family. These
exemptions are wholly statutory and cannot be enlarged by the courts. And
although the burden of proof lies with the party claiming the exemption,
exemption statutes are generally construed in favor of the debtor.”  Kilker v. Stillman (2015) 233
Cal.App.4th 320, 329–330. 
CCP § 704.225 provides “Money in a
judgment debtor’s deposit account that is not otherwise exempt under this
chapter is exempt to the extent necessary for the support of the judgment
debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor.”   
CCP § 704.220(a) provides “Money in
the judgment debtor’s deposit account in an amount equal to or less than the
minimum basic standard of adequate care for a family of four for Region 1,
established by Section 11452 of the Welfare and Institutions Code and as
annually adjusted by the State Department of Social Services pursuant to
Section 11453 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, is exempt without making a
claim.”  CCP § 704.220(a).  The minimum exemption is currently at
$2,080.00.  Form EJ-156.
The claimant has the burden of
proof to establish the exemption at the hearing.  CCP §703.580(b).   
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
Craig Mizufuka requests an order determining whether defendant Ronald Ikejiri’s
claim that the bank account with Bank of America is exempt from procedures to
enforce a money judgment.  Plaintiff also
opposes defendant’s claim of exemption.
            The
claim of exemption is dated June 14, 2023, and states that the property that
defendant claims to be exempt is “Bank of America all accounts including
accounts in name of spouse because there is no spouse,” citing to CCP §704.220 [levy
requirements] and CCP §700.160 [deposit accounts not exclusively in name of
judgment debtor].  The claim of exemption
further states, “automatic exemption and also have no spouse.”
            Plaintiff
asserts that he has not received any payment pursuant to the judgment entered
on February 8, 2018.  Plaintiff contends
that he lawfully levied upon the bank account of defendant’s wife Barbara
Ikejiri with Bank of America, “in which Defendant falsely alleges that he has
an automatic exemption and that he has no spouse.”  Plaintiff further contends that he and his
attorneys have conducted an investigation of the real property owned between
Barbara Ikejiri and defendant located at 15932 S. Manhattan Place, Gardena, and
the 2004 deed refers to Ronald as “spouse.” 

            On
July 6, 2023, the Sheriff’s Department filed a memo to court clerk that $0
funds were withheld and that the levy period expired on October 26, 2023.
            In
an opposition to the motion, defendant presents a copy of the September 30,
2013 Final Order of Divorce entered in Virginia and a copy of a April 12, 2022
grant deed and deed of trust for 15932 S. Manhattan Place indicating defendant
as an “unmarried man.”
            The
court rules as follows:  The claim of
exemption is GRANTED.  Defendant has
shown that the purported Bank of Account at issue is not his spouse’s as he
divorced in 2013.  Further, the levy
period expired, and the Sheriff’s Department is not holding funds. 
            The
motion is thus DENIED.
ORDER
The claim
of exemption is GRANTED.  The motion is
DENIED.
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
