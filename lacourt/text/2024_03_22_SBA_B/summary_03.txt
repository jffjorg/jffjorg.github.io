And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by plaintiff Craig Mizufuka against defendant Ronald Ikejiri. The plaintiff is seeking an order determining whether the defendant's claim of exemption from a bank account is valid. The defendant claims that the bank account, which is in the name of his ex-wife Barbara Ikejiri, is exempt from enforcement of a money judgment because he has no spouse and the account is not exclusively in his name.

The judge has granted the defendant's claim of exemption, finding that the defendant has shown that the bank account is not his spouse's as he divorced in 2013 and the levy period has expired. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's motion to determine the claim of exemption. The judge's ruling is based on California law, which provides that a judgment debtor may claim certain exemptions from enforcement of a money judgment, including a portion of their deposit account. The judge has concluded that the defendant has met his burden of proof to establish the exemption and that the bank account is exempt from enforcement of the money judgment.
