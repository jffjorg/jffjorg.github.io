And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to continue the hearing on the Motion for Summary Adjudication against Plaintiff Riviera Fitness LLC. The Court does not have the moving papers and the attorney had previously made mistakes with the hearing date, resulting in the motion being rejected twice before. The Court is suggesting that the hearing be continued to April 10, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. and the moving party must file the moving papers by March 27, 2024, identical to the previously served motion papers. No additional briefs will be accepted, as the responding party has already fully briefed the motion.
