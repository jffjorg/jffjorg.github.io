CASE:                         Stacey Velazquez v.
CEC Entertainment, LLC
 
CASE NO.:                 24STCV13234
 





















 
DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
CEC Entertainment, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Stacey
Velazquez
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On May 28,
2024, plaintiff Stacey Velazquez (Plaintiff) filed a representative Private
Attorneys General Complaint against Defendant CEC Entertainment, LLC (Defendant)
for Civil Penalties Pursuant to Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”),
Labor Code Sections 2698, et seq.  Plaintiff
alleges Defendant violated Labor Code sections 201, 202, 203, 204, 223,
226, 226.7, 510, 512, 1194, 1197and the applicable Wage Orders. 
 
            On August 19,
2024, Defendant filed a special demurrer in abatement pursuant to CCP § 430.10(c).  In the alternative, Defendant argues for
Demurrer under CCP § 430.10(c) on the basis of exclusive concurrent
jurisdiction. 
 
            On October
17, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.
 
            On October
23, 2024, Defendant filed a reply. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)¿ When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context, accepting the alleged facts as true.¿ (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)¿ “Because a demurrer
challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters
outside the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”¿ (Arce ex rel.
Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.)¿
 
III.       DISCUSSION           
 
Defendant moves for a Special Demurrer in Abatement pursuant
to CCP § 430.10(c). In the alternative, Defendant argues for Demurrer under CCP
§ 430.10(c) based on “exclusive concurrent jurisdiction.” 
 
The court notes this case and Case No. 24STCV07299 appear to
arise from the same dispute.  Case No.
24STCV07299, which was filed in Department 1 of the Spring Street Courthouse,
is the lower numbered case.  However, the
parties have not filed a Notice of Related Case.  The parties are directed to file notice.  The court will continue the hearing for this demurrer
to allow Department 1 to consider whether these actions are related.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            The
demurrer is CONTINUED to November 20, 2024, at 8:30 AM.
 
            Clerk of
the court to give notice.
 
 
Dated:   October 30,
2024
