Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Triller Hold Co. LLC's (THC) motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against it. THC merged into Triller Acquisition LLC (TA) on August 17, 2022, and Paracorp Incorporated was the Registered Agent for Service of Process for TA and Triller. Despite service of the complaint and summons on TA, THC was not put on actual notice of the lawsuit until January 26, 2024. THC shows good faith and reasonable efforts to resolve the default, including filing a proposed answer. The Judge finds that THC's lack of actual notice was not caused by its avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, and that the motion was timely made. Therefore, the motion to vacate the default and default judgment is granted, and THC's proposed answer is filed as of the date of this ruling.
