Relief under Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section
473(b) is either discretionary or mandatory. A motion for mandatory relief must
be made no more than six months after entry of judgment and be accompanied by
an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the attorney’s “mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) The attorney affidavit of
fault must contain a “straight forward admission of fault.” (State Farm Fire
& Casualty Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.) But it
need not contain an explanation of the reasons for the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence surprise or neglect. (Martin
Potts & Assocs., Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 432, 438-441.) Relief must be granted
“unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by
the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) If mandatory relief is
granted, the court must “direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs” to the
opposing counsel or parties. (CCP § 473(b).)
 
Where a party cannot obtain an attorney affidavit of
fault, the party may seek discretionary relief under section 473(b) due to
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) A
motion for discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable time but in
no instance exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the court may
in its discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including attorney fees,
incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers Cadillac (1992)
11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is granted,
the court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions up to
$1,000 to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client Security
Fund, or “[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP § 473(c)(1)(A), (B),
(C).)
 
A motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted. . .” (CCP § 473(b).)
However, this requirement is
not jurisdictional; substantial compliance may suffice. (Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving
papers].) 
 
CCP section 473.5(a) permits
the court to set aside a default or default judgment “[w]hen service of a
summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the
action and a default or default judgment has been entered against him.”¿ “The
notice of motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no
event exceeding the earlier of:¿ (i) two years after entry of a default
judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a
written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered .”¿ (Id.)
The phrase “actual notice” means “genuine knowledge of the party litigant” and
does not include constructive or imputed notice to the client.¿ (Tunis v.
Barrow (1986) 184 Cal. App. 3d 1069, 1077.) A defendant also must show that
his “lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his
inexcusable neglect or avoidance of service.”¿ (Id. at
1077-1078.) Further, the court is “not required to accept [a] self-serving
evidence contradicting the process server's declaration.” (Rodriguez v. Nam
Min Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 751.)
 
Analysis
 

Defendant Triller Hold Co. LLC
(sued as Triller Acquisition LLC) (hereinafter, “THC”) moves for an order
setting aside the default and default judgment entered against Defendant
Triller Acquisition LLC, a Limited Liability Company DBA Triller Fight Club ((hereinafter,
“TA”).
 
On September 25, 2023, Plaintiff
commenced this action against TA. TA’s default (the “Default”) was requested
and entered on November 14, 2023 (the day after the responsive pleading
deadline) and a default judgment (the “Default Judgment”) was entered against
TA on December 18, 2023.
 
Defendant demonstrates that the
service of Complaint and Summons did not put it on actual notice in time to
defend the action prior to default. Defendant explains that the named
defendant, TA, merged into THC on August 17, 2022. (Lee Decl., Ex. A.) Paracorp
Incorporated (“Paracorp”) was TA’s Registered Agent for Service of Process.
(Lee Decl., ¶ 7.) Paracorp was also the Registered Agent for Service of Process
for Triller and many other “Triller”-affiliated entities. (Lee Decl., ¶ 7.) The
founder and former manager of TA had designated himself as the designated
service recipient (“DSR”) with Paracorp, such that service earmarked for TA
went to him. (Lee Decl., ¶ 8.) Following the Merger, THC filed the Certificate
of Merger with Paracorp. (Lee Decl., ¶ 10.) Therefore, Triller was under the
impression that it would from that point on be the DSR for anything served on
the now-defunct TA. (Lee Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
According to the proof of service
on file, Plaintiff served the summons on TA via Paracorp on October 11, 2023. Unbeknownst
to Triller, Paracorp had not in fact updated its DSR for TA. (Lee Decl., ¶ 10.)
The former DSR ended up receiving notice of the suit, and because he no longer
had any incentive to defend the action, he did not promptly notify anyone at
Triller of the suit. (Lee Decl., ¶ 8.) Triller did not learn of this lawsuit
until January 26, 2024. Triller obtained a copy of the default judgment on
January 31, 2024. (¶ 9.) Upon inquiry, Trilled learned that the DSR for TA had
not actually been updated. (Lee Decl., ¶ 10.) Paracorp provided the Complaint
as well as documents related to the Default and Default Judgment. (Lee Decl., ¶
11.) Triller promptly noticed their appearance on January 31, 2024. (Woodland
Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.)
 
Defendant shows their good faith
and reasonable efforts to resolve the default without resorting to a motion. (See
Lee Decl., ¶12; Woodland Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B.) These efforts explain any delay
between Defendant’s discovery of this action at the end of January and its
filing of this motion on May 14, 2024. Thus, Defendant demonstrates that the motion
was timely made, and that its lack of actual notice in time to defend the
action was not caused by its avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect
required for relief under section 473.5. Defendant also shows a “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect,” such that discretionary relief under section 473(b) is appropriate. Plaintiff
filed a perfunctory opposition, suggesting that service was enough to put
Defendant on notice, but not materially disputing Defendant’s explanation. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to
vacate default and default judgment is GRANTED. Defendant’s proposed answer is
filed as of this date.
