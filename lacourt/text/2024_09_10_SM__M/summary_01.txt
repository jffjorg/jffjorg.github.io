And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from October 28, 2024, to some time in 2025. The defendant, Lyna N. Lax, wants to continue the trial to allow for additional settlement efforts and to complete discovery. However, the judge does not find that the defendant has shown good cause for the continuance and believes that firm trial dates provide the proper incentive for the parties to settle the action. The judge notes that the parties have conducted written discovery but have not started depositions and that the defendant's counsel has trials in other cases scheduled in October and December 2024. The judge also believes that the interests of justice are best served by keeping the trial date firm.
