LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
 
Defendant
Pitman Farms Welfare Benefit Plan requests judicial notice of Exhibit 1 to the
Declaration of David Rubinstein, the “Plan Document and Summary Plan
Description” (the “Plan Document”). The unopposed request is GRANTED. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant demurs
to Plaintiff Regents of the University of California’s complaint for quantum
meruit and breach of implied contract.  A
claim for quantum meruit must allege: 1) performance of services, work or
labor; 2) at defendant’s request; and 3) circumstances inferring defendant’s
promise to pay a reasonable value.  (Maglica v. Maglica (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 442, 449-450; Palmer v. Gregg (1967) 65 Cal.2d 657, 660; see
also MKB Management, Inc. v. Melikian (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 796,
805)  “ ‘The measure of recovery in quantum meruit is the
reasonable value of the services rendered provided they were of direct
benefit to the defendant.’ ” (Chodos v. Borman (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th
76, 96; quoting Palmer, supra, 65 Cal.2d at 660.) “The idea that
one must be benefited by the goods and services bestowed is thus
integral to recovery in quantum meruit.” (Maglica, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th
at 450.) Therefore, a plaintiff must establish both that he was acting pursuant
to either an express or implied request for such services from the defendant
and that the services rendered were intended to and did benefit the defendant;
further, the defendant must have retained the benefit with full appreciation of
the facts.  (Pacific Bay Recovery, Inc. v. California Physicians'
Services, Inc.¿(2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 200; Ochs v. PacifiCare of
California (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 782.) 
 
To
allege a breach of contract, a plaintiff must plead the contract, plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for non-performance, defendant’s breach, and damage to
plaintiff therefrom. (Acoustics, Inc. v. Trepte Constr. Co. (1971)
14 Cal.App.3d 887, 913.) “As to the basic elements, there is no difference
between an express and implied contract.¿While an express contract is defined
as one, the terms of which are stated in words (Civ. Code, § 1620), an implied
contract is an agreement, the existence and terms of which are manifested by
conduct (Civ. Code, § 1621).... [B]oth types of contract are identical in that
they require a meeting of minds or an agreement [citation]. Thus, it is evident
that both the express contract and contract implied in fact are founded upon an
ascertained agreement or, in other words, are consensual in nature, the
substantial difference being in the mode of proof by which they are established
[citation].” (Pacific Bay, supra, 12 Cal.App.5th at 215.)
Defendant argues that the claim fails because there exists a
written contract between Plaintiff and First Health PPO. (Compl., ¶¶ 16-20; see
Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic Indem. Co. (1996) 44 Cal. App. 4th
194, 203 [implied-in-fact or quasi-contract generally “cannot lie where there exists
between the parties a valid express contract covering the same subject matter”].)
Plaintiff argues that during the relevant
time period, UCLA Health and Pitman Farms did not have a direct, written contract.
(Compl., ¶¶ 10-12, 16-17.) Instead, the complaint alleges that Pitman Farms, through
its agents (EBMS), was a payor signatory to the First Health PPO Network. (Id.)
Pursuant to this network, UCLA agreed to render medical services to
beneficiaries of the Pitman Farms health plan and in exchange, Pitman Farms, being
a payer signatory through EBMS, agreed to pay UCLA Health the negotiated rates
pursuant to the Network terms. (Id.) The Court agrees that there is an
inconsistency between a claim that an authorization for emergency services
rendered created an implied-in-fact contract, and that a third-party written
contract’s terms inform the terms of a newly created implied contract. 
The Court, however, will permit Plaintiff to plead the alternative
theories, despite the existence of a potentially applicable written contract. A
plaintiff may plead such alternatives to a breach of contract claim where it
“in doubt about what actually occurred or can be established by the evidence.”
(Newport Harbor Ventures, LLC v. Morris Cerullo World Evangelism, (2016)
6 Cal. App. 5th 1207, 1222.) In any amended pleading, Plaintiff should explain
why there is a doubt as to the enforceability of the pled express written agreement.
(See Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., (2012) 202 Cal. App. 4th 1342, 1389.
Defendant next claims that as a matter of law, mere “verification
of benefits” and “authorizations” are legally insufficient to establish mutual
assent, and that there are no allegations showing an agreement to pay a certain
rate. “The consent of the parties to a contract
must be: 1. Free; 2. Mutual; and 3. Communicated by each to the other.” (Civ.
Code § 1565.) “Consent is not mutual, unless the parties all agree upon the
same thing in the same sense.” (Civ. Code, § 1580.) “[A plaintiff’s]
uncommunicated subjective intent is not relevant. The existence of mutual
assent is determined by objective criteria. The test is whether a reasonable
person would, from the conduct of the parties, conclude that there was mutual
agreement.” (Hilleary v. Garvin (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 322, 327.) “The
manifestation of assent to a contractual provision may be ‘wholly or partly by
written or spoken words or by other acts or by failure to act.’” (Merced
County Sheriff’s Employees Assn. v. County of Merced (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d
662, 670.) The totality of the circumstances determines whether a binding
contract has been formed. (California Food Service Corp., Inc. v. Great
American Insurance Co. (1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 892, 897 see Fowler v.
Security-First National Bank (1956) 146 Cal.App.2d 37, 47 [“If words are
spoken under circumstances where it is obvious that neither party would be
entitled to believe that the other intended a contract to result, there is no
contract”].)
In
Pacific Bay, an out-of-network medical services provider, Pacific Bay,
contacted Blue Shield, an insurer, “to obtain prior authorization,
precertification, and consent to render treatment to the subscriber and was led
to believe it would be ‘paid a portion or percentage of its total billed
charges, which charges correlated with usual, reasonable and customary
charges.’ ” (Id. at 205.) Pacific Bay submitted claims to Blue
Shield for services provided to a Blue Shield subscriber and Blue Shield paid
Pacific Bay, but Pacific Bay claims the amount of the payment was
insufficient. (Id. at 207.) The Pacific Bay Court held that
because the claim arose from an insurance payment dispute concerning claims
submitted by a medical provider to a health plan for processing and payment,
the Knox-Keene Act controlled. (Ibid.)  The court determined that
the payment of non-emergency services claims was generally limited by
Claims Settlement Practices regulations, specifically Cal. Code Regs., Tit. 28,
§ 1300.71(a)(3)(C) which states “[f]or non-emergency services provided by
non-contracted providers to PPO and POS enrollees: the amount set forth in the
enrollee's Evidence of Coverage.” (Ibid.; see also Orthopedic
Specialists of Southern California v. Public Employees' Retirement System
(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 644, 648.) With respect to the existence of the
mutual assent required for an implied contract, the Pacific
Bay court required further allegations that the insurer “authorized a certain
amount of treatment or agreed to pay a specific rate.” (Pacific
Bay, supra, 12 Cal.App.5th at 215 [emphasis added].) In Orthopedic
Specialists, the allegations did not establish that the defendants promised
to pay reasonable rates, rather in those cases the allegations merely
established that they were “led to believe” that they would be paid reasonable
rates. (Orthopedic Specialists, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at 646,
649.)  In both cases, the insurer advised the provider of the insured’s
coverage, but no explicit agreement was alleged that the insurer would pay a
certain rate. Both courts found that an oral/implied promise was not created by
such vague allegations.
Here, there are no specific facts demonstrating
the parties’ mutual assent to a certain treatment or rate. The complaint
alleges from August 8 through August 27, 2021, UCLA Health provided emergent,
inpatient, continuous and medically necessary treatment to an individual
(“Patient”). (Compl., ¶ 7.) Patient was a beneficiary of a health plan
sponsored/administered by Pitman Farms. (¶8.) Pitman Farms and/or
its agents (EBMS) authorized the medically necessary services rendered to
Patient by UCLA Health. (¶ 9.) UCLA Health submitted the billed charges to
Pitman Farms and/or its agents. (¶ 10.) UCLA Health’s usual and customary
charges for the medically necessary services, supplies and/or equipment
rendered to Patient amounted to $443,479.80, but Pitman Farms paid UCLA only
$139,405.90. (¶ 11.) UCLA Health claims an
outstanding bill, accounting for discounts, of $270,246.52. (¶ 12.)
The complaint further alleges that during
the relevant period, Pitman Farms, by its words and/or conduct, requested UCLA
Health provide Patient with medically necessary services, emergency services,
supplies and/or equipment. (Compl., ¶ 15.) “Pitman Farms, and/or its agents,
acknowledged the need for medical care for Patient and requested that UCLA
Health provide medically necessary services to Patient by issuing authorization
for the care rendered by UCLA Health.” (Id.) By such conduct, the parties
understood that, “in exchange for UCLA providing necessary medical care, Pitman
farms would pay UCLA for the services rendered.” (Id.) UCLA Health rendered
medical care, reasonably relying on Pitman Farm’s representations and
authorization for medical treatments, based on the custom and practice of the
health care industry. (¶ 22.) Pitman “confirmed coverage” and “authorized” the
necessary services, which conferred a benefit. (¶ 23.) Indeed, these allegations do not show sufficient facts of mutual
assent to pay for certain services and/or rates. At best, the complaint shows
that, at unidentified times, someone at UCLA contacted
EBMS to verify eligibility and benefits, and that UCLA received unspecified authorizations
for unspecified services. As seen in Pac. Bay, conclusory allegations
that Defendant gave an “authorization”, when combined with partial payments, do
not support the existence of an implied agreement. For this same reason, there
are insufficient facts to show that Defendant requested the services to support
a quantum meruit claim. There is no pled express or implied
request for specific services from Defendant. 
Plaintiff
asserts that this action is distinguishable from the above cases because
Plaintiff alleges that the authorizations were for emergency services. In this
context, “[i]f a hospital or other medical provider believes that the amount of
reimbursement it has received from a health plan is below the ‘reasonable and
customary value’ of the emergency services it has provided, the hospital or
provider may assert a quantum meruit claim against the plan to recover the
shortfall.” (Long Beach Mem'l Med. Ctr. v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc.,
(2021) 71 Cal. App. 5th 323, 335.) However, Plaintiff has only pled the
conclusion that the services were for an emergency. (Compl., ¶¶ 7, 14-15, 18.)
Plaintiff does not plead facts that the Patient was in “danger of loss of life,
or serious injury or illness.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 1317 (a).) Moreover, Plaintiff
bases this theory on Cal. Code Regs., tit. 28, § 1300.71(a)(3)(B), which might
require “payment of the reasonable and customary value” but would be preempted
by ERISA. (Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Barnes,
(9th Cir. 1978) 571 F.2d 502, 505 [ “ERISA preempts California’s Knox-Keene Act
to the extent that Knox-Keene seeks to regulate ERISA-covered employee benefit
plans.”); 29 U.S.C. § 1444(a) (ERISA “supersede[s] any and all State laws
insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any [ERISA plan]”].)
Accordingly,
the demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. 
Plaintiff has 30 days to file an amended complaint.
