Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by the Regents of the University of California against Pitman Farm Welfare Benefit Plan, et al. The court has granted defendant's request for judicial notice of the Plan Document and has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.

The court has determined that the complaint does not state a cause of action for quantum meruit and breach of implied contract. The court has found that the complaint lacks sufficient facts to show mutual assent between the parties, and that the allegations of authorization and payment are insufficient to support an implied contract.

The court has also found that the complaint does not plead facts sufficient to establish a request for services from the defendant, and that the allegations of emergency services rendered do not meet the requirements of California Health and Safety Code section 1317(a).

The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to file an amended complaint.
