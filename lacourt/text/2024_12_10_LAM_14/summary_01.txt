```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for reconsideration of the denial of their motion for summary judgment. The defendants had argued that the judge should reconsider the denial based on new information that they would file a new separate statement that would be shorter and more organized. However, the judge found that the motion for reconsideration was not timely filed, and that the cases cited by the defendants were not new and were available to the court when it made its earlier decision. The judge did, however, allow the defendants to file a new motion for summary judgment, and set a date for the motion to be heard. The judge also continued the trial date and set a final status conference.
