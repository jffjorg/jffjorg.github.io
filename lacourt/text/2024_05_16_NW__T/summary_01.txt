And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the ex parte application to advance the hearing on the motion to compel. The moving party waited 7 months to file the motion, which does not create an urgency requiring the court to burden its already heavy calendar. However, the judge strongly urges the parties to work out an agreement for the deposition. If the motion is granted and the defendant is found to have committed discovery abuse without substantial justification, the court will award monetary sanctions and may order the defendant to bear the expense of an expedited transcript.
