And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case between Virtue at the Pointe, LLC (Plaintiff) and David McGarry (Defendant). The Plaintiff demurred to the Defendant's Answer and moved to strike the Answer, alleging that the 28 Affirmative Defenses (AD) were uncertain, irrelevant, or improper. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's Points and Authorities (P&A) failed to meet the initial burden of showing insufficient fact pleading, uncertainty, or irrelevance, and that the Plaintiff's assertions were conclusory and lacked application of law to the ADs. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's contention that all the ADs were uncertain was improper because it failed to specify what aspect of each AD made it uncertain. The Judge overruled the Plaintiff's demurrer and denied the motion to strike.
