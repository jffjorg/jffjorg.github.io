And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in natural language:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the defendant's demurrer. The demurrer was filed by the defendant, Anza Management Company, and was moved against the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant demurred to seven causes of action, including battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of Civil Code section 1941.3, and public nuisance.

The court found that the plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to plead a cause of action for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and therefore sustained the demurrer as to the first and third causes of action. The court also sustained the demurrer as to the tenth cause of action, alleging negligent violation of statutory duty to maintain habitable conditions.

On the other hand, the court overruled the demurrer as to the ninth cause of action, alleging violation of Civil Code section 1942.4. The court also overruled the demurrer as to the twelfth and thirteenth causes of action, alleging public nuisance.

The court granted the plaintiff's request to amend the eighth cause of action, which alleged violation of Civil Code section 1942.3. The court gave the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.

The judge also issued a separate ruling on a motion to quash service of summons, granting the motion based on the fact that Ana Fuentes was not authorized to accept service of summons on Royal Gardens at Kittridge Apartments.
