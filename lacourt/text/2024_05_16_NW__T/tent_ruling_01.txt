  Case Number:  22VECV01728    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV01728
Elbatsh v Domanski
Tentative ruling: Ex parte application to advance hearing on motion to
compel: Denied.  The PMQ deposition
notice was set for 10/30/2023 but moving party waited 7 months to file a
motion.  The lack of timeliness in making
the motion does not create an urgency requiring the court to burden its already
heavy calendar with an advanced motion. 
However, the court strongly urges the parties to work out an agreement
for the deposition.  If the motion is
granted and defendant is found to have committed discovery abuse without
substantial justification, the court will award monetary sanctions and may
order the defendant to bear the expense of an expedited transcript.
