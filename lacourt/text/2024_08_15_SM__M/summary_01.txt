And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering the motions for summary judgment filed by four defendants: Related Fund Management, LLC, Related Partners, Inc., Related Sales, Inc., and RFM Holdco, LLC. The plaintiff, Singer, alleges that the defendants are liable for her damages due to their alleged fraud and concealment of defects in her condominium unit.

The judge finds that Related Fund Management, LLC (RFMH) has met its initial burden of showing that the plaintiff's claims against it have no merit. The judge grants RFMH's motion for summary judgment.

The judge also finds that Related Sales, Inc. (RSI) has failed to meet its initial burden of showing that the plaintiff's claims against it have no merit. The judge denies RSI's motion for summary judgment.

The judge finds that Related Partners, Inc. (RPI) has failed to meet its initial burden of showing that the plaintiff's claims against it have no merit. The judge denies RPI's motion for summary judgment.

The judge also finds that triable issues exist as to the motion for summary judgment filed by Related Fund Management, LLC (RFM). The judge denies RFM's motion for summary judgment.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' pleadings, the evidence presented, and the applicable laws and statutes. The judge finds that the defendants have not met their burden of showing that the plaintiff's claims against them have no merit, and that triable issues exist as to the claims.
