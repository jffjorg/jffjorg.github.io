The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 20STCV37011, addressing a motion filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Mark Fisher to compel Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Facecake Marketing Technologies, Inc. to provide answers to certain discovery requests. The Judge is denying the motion without prejudice, citing that it impermissibly combines multiple discovery motions into one. The motion seeks to compel responses to multiple types of discovery requests, including requests for production of documents, special and form interrogatories, and further responses to some of these requests. The Judge rules that motions to compel responses are separate from motions to compel further responses, and that motions related to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and production of documents should also be separate. The Judge notes that the motion also seeks issue and evidentiary sanctions, which should be a separate motion. The Judge takes no position on the merits of the relief sought and allows Fisher to file separate discovery motions along the lines outlined.
