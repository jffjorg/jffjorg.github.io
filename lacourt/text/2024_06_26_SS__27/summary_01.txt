And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Katherine Unverferth, Nataly Petrovic, and Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (Regents).

The judge has granted the motions for summary judgment filed by Nataly Petrovic and Dr. Unverferth, finding that they did not fall below the standard of care and that there was probable cause for the 72-hour hold. The judge has also found that the defendants are immune from liability under Welfare and Institutions Code section 5278.

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment filed by Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (Regents), finding that the defendants failed to meet their burden of showing that there was probable cause for the hold and that the treatment rendered by the defendants complied with the applicable standard of care.

The judge has also found that the plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact as to the defendants' medical malpractice claim and false imprisonment claim, and therefore has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment on those claims.

The judge has ordered that the parties may submit to the tentative ruling by email, and has scheduled a hearing on the motions for summary judgment.
