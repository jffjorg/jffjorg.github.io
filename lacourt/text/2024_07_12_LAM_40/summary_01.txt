And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Danny Bakewell, Sr., in his motion for fees and costs related to a deposition. The plaintiff had noticed the deposition of Robert Cooper, a defendant, but Cooper failed to appear due to a medical condition. The plaintiff hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on Cooper, which revealed that Cooper was not actually unable to attend the deposition. The judge found that the defendants, including Cooper and OneUnited Bank, had willfully violated the court's orders and had failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify Cooper's absence.

The judge has awarded the plaintiff $22,685 in fees and costs, which includes the cost of the private investigator and the doctor who reviewed the documents and prepared an expert declaration. The judge has also ordered that the defendants, Cooper and OneUnited Bank, pay the costs jointly and severally.

The judge has noted that the amount requested by the plaintiff is high, but has reduced the award based on the reasonable hourly rates of counsel, the medical doctor, and the private investigator. The judge has also found that the number of hours expended by the plaintiff's counsel and the private investigator is too high, and has reduced the award accordingly.
