And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the petition to confirm the arbitration award filed by Selan Law Firm and Lisa F. Selan, confirming the May 10, 2024 arbitration award that granted summary judgment to the defendants and dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice. The ruling finds that the petition satisfies the procedural requirements for a petition to confirm an arbitration award, including attaching a copy of the retainer agreement with an arbitration clause, naming the arbitrator, and attaching a copy of the arbitration award. The petition also names all parties to the arbitration and was served and filed within the required timeframe. The ruling notes that the petition to confirm the arbitration award is unopposed, and therefore, the allegations in the petition are accepted as true. The court confirms the arbitration award and orders the defendants to file a proposed judgment within seven days.
