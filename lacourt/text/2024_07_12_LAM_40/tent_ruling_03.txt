 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendants Selan
  Law Firm and Lisa F. Selan’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award



 
Background
On January 26, 2021, Plaintiffs
Second Site, LLC, Michael Sapir, and Ronald Glantz (collectively, Plaintiffs)
initiated this action against Defendants Selan Law Firm and Lisa F. Selan
(collectively, Defendants), asserting the following causes of action: (1)
Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (2) Legal Malpractice; (3) Breach of Statutory Duty
under California Business and Professions Code § 6068; and (4) Breach of
Business and Professions Code § 17200.
On April 7, 2021, the Court granted
the parties’ stipulation to stay the instant case and submit their dispute to
binding arbitration. 
The arbitration award was made on May 10, 2024, granting
summary judgment to Defendants (“Respondents”) and ordering Plaintiffs’ (“Claimants”)
complaint dismissed with prejudice. 
On June 11, 2024, Defendants filed a petition to confirm a
contractual arbitration award as against Plaintiffs. The petition prays for confirmation of the award, judgment
according to the award. 
Defendants’ petition in this action
is now before the Court.
 
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award
Legal
Standard
“Any
party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to
confirm, correct or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.)
“A
proceeding under th[e] [Arbitration title of the Code of Civil Procedure] in
the courts of this State [i.e., pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1280-1294.4] is
commenced by filing a petition. Any person named as a respondent in a petition
may file a response thereto. The allegations of a petition are deemed to be
admitted by a respondent duly served therewith unless a response is duly served
and filed. The allegations of a response are deemed controverted or avoided.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.)
The
petition must: “(a) [s]et forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the
agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement”;
“(b) [s]et forth the names of the arbitrators” and “(c) [s]et forth or have attached
a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.4.) The petition must also “name as respondents all parties to the
arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration
award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) A petition to confirm an award must be served
and filed within four years after the date the petitioner was served with a signed
copy of the award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.) 
If
a petition or response requesting confirmation is duly filed and served, the court
must confirm, correct and confirm, or vacates the award or dismiss the proceeding.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; see Horn v. Gurewitz (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 255,
258; Pacific Law Group U.S.A. v. Gibson (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 577, 580; Cooper
v. Lavely & Singer Professional Corp. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1, 10.)
“The
court may not vacate an award unless … [¶] [a] petition or response requesting
that the award be vacated has been duly served or filed ….” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.4, subd. (a).)  A response seeking
to correct and confirm or vacate an arbitration award must be served and filed
within ten days of service of a petition to confirm that same arbitration
award, unless the timeframe is extended by agreement of the parties or “for
good cause, by order of the court.” Thus, a court may not vacate an award pursuant
to a petition for that relief that was not duly served or filed. (See Oaktree
Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Bernard (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 60, 64 [a response
served out of the ten-day window has not been “duly served” as required for
relief by Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.4].)
Statutes
set forth specific grounds upon which an arbitrator’s award may be vacated. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.2.) Except on these grounds, arbitration awards are immune
from judicial review in proceedings to challenge or enforce the award. (Moncharsh
v. Heily & Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 12-13 (Moncharsh).) Thus, courts
will not review the sufficiency of the evidence to support the award. (Morris
v. Zuckerman (1968) 69 Cal.2d 686, 691.) Nor will courts pass upon the validity
of the arbitrator’s reasoning. (Ibid.) The court simply may not substitute
its judgment for that of the arbitrator. (Ibid.) Further, errors of fact
or law committed by the arbitrator, no matter how egregious, are not grounds for
challenging the arbitrator’s award under California law. (Moncharsh, supra,
at p. 11.)
“If
an [arbitration] award is confirmed, judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith.
The judgment so entered has the same force and effect as and is subject to all the
provisions of law relating to, a judgment in a civil action of the same jurisdictional
classification; and it may be enforced like any other judgment of the court in which
it is entered, in an action of the same jurisdictional classification.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1287.4.)
Order
Confirming Arbitration Award: GRANTED.
I. Procedural Requirements
Here,
Defendants’ petition satisfies the procedural requirements for a petition to
confirm arbitration award.
The
petition properly (1) attaches a copy of the retainer agreement between the
parties that includes an arbitration clause (Pet., Attach. 4(b), § 17), (2) names
the arbitrator (Petition, § 6 [“Judge Victor E. Bianchini (Ret.)”]; and (3)
attaches a copy of the arbitration award (Petition, Attach. 8(c), Final Award).
This satisfies Code of Civil Procedure § 1285.4.
The
petition also names as respondents all parties to the arbitration (Petition, §
1 [Plaintiffs]), thus satisfying Code of Civil Procedure § 1285.
The
petition to confirm was served on June 11, 2024 and filed within four years
after the date that Defendant was served with a signed copy of the award, which
satisfies Code of Civil Procedure § 1288.
II. Substantive Discussion
Here,
the petition to confirm the arbitration award is unopposed. (Petition, Attach.
8(c), Final Award, p. 1; 4/1/21 Stipulation and Order to Stay Case and Submit
Dispute to Binding Arbitration.) 
As
a result, the petition to confirm the arbitration award is not controverted and
the allegations in Defendants’ petition to confirm are accepted as true. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1290.)
Defendants’
petition is accordingly GRANTED.
The
May 10, 2024 arbitration award is CONFIRMED. 

Conclusion
Defendants Selan Law Firm and Lisa F. Selan’s Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
The May 10, 2024 arbitration award
is CONFIRMED.
Defendants shall file a proposed judgment and file and served that
proposed judgment within seven days of this order.
