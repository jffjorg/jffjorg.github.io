And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike. The plaintiff, Ivan Rodriguez, rented a property to the defendants, but listed the property for sale without their consent. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the pleadings were vague and the complaint was based on information and belief as to matters for which the defendants do not have superior knowledge. The Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has been satisfied and that the demurrer is based on a misunderstanding of the legal standard for sufficiency of the complaint.

The Court rules that the defendants' demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action is OVERRULED. The Court finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a cause of action for quiet title, cancellation of instrument, and declaratory relief. The Court notes that the plaintiff is seeking to establish title against the adverse claims of the defendants and that the claims for quiet title and cancellation of instrument are based on the alleged forgery of a grant deed.

The Court also finds that the plaintiff's request for declaratory relief is sufficient, as it seeks a judicial determination that the plaintiff is the 100% owner of the property and that the defendants have no interest in it. The Court concludes that the defendants' demurrer is OVERRULED, and the plaintiff's complaint will proceed.
