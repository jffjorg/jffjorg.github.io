Defendants’ Demurrer and 
Motion to Strike.
 



 
Facts
Plaintiff Ivan Rodriguez
rented the property located at 3280 Folsom Street Los Angeles, California 90063
to Defendants. On or around December 28, 2023, plaintiff listed the property
for sale to which defendants disagreed. On or around January 17, 2024, real
estate agent Jesse Uribe conducted a title search and discovered a grant deed
recorded on December 29, 2023. The deed, identified as instrument number
20230919365 grants defendant a 50% interest in the property as joint tenants
with plaintiff who claims he was unaware of the forged deed until informed by
Uribe on January 17, 2024.
On January 31, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants alleging causes of action for: 
1.         Quiet Title
2.              
Cancellation of
Instrument
3.              
Declaratory Relief
4.              
Negligence
5.              
Payment on Bond.
 
Defendant Evaristo Rodriguez Gonzalez (“Defendant”) demurs
to the First, Second, and Third Causes of Action on three grounds: (1) that the
pleadings are vague and the complaint is based on information and belief as to
matters for which Defendant does not have superior knowledge; (2) as to the
first cause of action for quiet title, the complaint must be amended to reflect
the date as of which the determination is sought and the pleadings are vague
and unintelligible; and (3) as to the second cause of action for cancellation
of instrument, the complaint fails to allege how Plaintiff knows that Defendant
forged the purported grant deed when Plaintiff has possession of the driver
license that was presented to the notary public, the pleadings are vague and unintelligible
such that Defendant cannot respond to such allegations of ultimate facts made
on information and belief that are not within his superior knowledge, and Defendant
is in essence investigating the facts that Plaintiff should have discovered
prior to bringing the action. The Court analyzes each ground in turn.
 
Meet and Confer
The Court finds that the meet and
confer requirement for this motion has been satisfied.  (See Graham Decl., ¶ 2.)
 
Demurrer Analysis: 
The Court OVERRULES the Demurrer 
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of
action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or by proper judicial notice.  (CCP §
430.30(a).)  A demurrer challenges only legal sufficiency of complaint,
not truth or accuracy of its factual allegations or plaintiff's ability to
prove those allegations.  (Assurance
Co. of Am. v. Haven (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 78, 82.)  Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.  (CCP §
430.30(a).)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.  (Hahn, 147 Cal.App.4th
at 747.)  The face of the
complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94.)  “If facts appearing
in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take
precedence."  (Holland v. Morse
Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)
 
Quiet Title
A plaintiff alleges a quiet title
action where they allege that “[1] the plaintiff is the owner and in possession
of the land and [2] that the defendant claims an interest therein [3] adverse
to him.” (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725,
740; see also Gray v Walker (1910) 157 Cal. 381, 384 [“the complaint
contains a statement of all the facts necessary to constitute a cause of
action. It avers that plaintiff is the owner and in possession of certain land,
that defendant claims an interest therein adverse to plaintiff, and that such
claim is without right.”].)  
However, generally, “the holder of equitable title cannot
maintain a quiet title action against the legal owner.” (Lewis v. Superior
Ct. (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1850, 1866; see also Staffor v. Ballinger
(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 289, 294-95 [“It has been held consistently that the
owner of an equitable interest cannot maintain an action to quiet title against the owner of
the legal title.”]) There is a limited exception to this rule, in the case
where legal title was acquired through fraud. (See Warren v. Merrill
(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 96, 114.)  
Legal title does not have a strict legal meaning. (Solomon
v. Walton (1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 381, 386.) “The term ‘legal title’ has been
defined as ‘one cognizable or enforceable in a court of law, or one which
complete and perfect so far as regards the apparent right of ownership and
possession, but which carries no beneficial interest in the property, another
person being equitably entitled thereto. . .” (Parkmerced Co. v. City &
Cnty. of San Francisco (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1091, 1094-95.)  
 
Defendant argues that the claim for
quiet title action fails because Plaintiff failed to plead the date as of which
the determination is sought and failed to provide the information which he
relied upon to believe that Defendant committed forgery. 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that he has alleged sufficient facts to support a cause of action for quiet
title as the complaint alleges that Defendant obtained title by fraud. Since
Plaintiff seeks to establish title against the adverse claims of Defendant, he
argues that the claim for quiet title is the appropriate remedy. 
Defendant provides no arguments in
reply. 
            In the
complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he is the owner of real property located at
3280 Folsom Street Los Angeles, California 90063 (Compl. ¶ 6), that a forged
deed purports to grant Defendant a 50% gift interest in the subject property
(Compl. ¶ 10), and that Plaintiff seeks to quiet title against all adverse
claims as of December 29, 2023 as they are without any right whatsoever.
(Compl. ¶ 15.) The Court finds that these constitute sufficient facts to support
a cause of action for quiet title.
 
Cancellation of
Instrument
“To prevail on a claim to cancel an
instrument, a plaintiff must prove (1) the instrument is void or voidable due
to, for example, fraud; and (2) there is a reasonable apprehension of serious
injury including pecuniary loss or the prejudicial alteration of one's
position.” (Thompson v. Ioane (2017) 11 Cal. App. 5th 1180, 1193-94.)
Defendant argues that the complaint
fails to provide the information which led Plaintiff to believe that Evaristo
Rodriguez Gonzalez committed forgery. Defendant also asserts that the complaint
fails to allege tender, to the extent that Evaristo Rodriguez Gonzalez is the
equitable owner, and Plaintiff holds title as constructive trustee with no
authority to list the property for sale out from under Defendant. 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that he has alleged sufficient facts to constitute
a cause of action for cancellation of instrument as he is attacking the forged
deed and is seeking an order to cancel the forged deed.
            Defendant
provides no arguments in reply. 
            In the
complaint, Plaintiff asserts that the Grant Deed recorded on December 29, 2023
is a forged deed that is void or voidable and that said grant deed will cause
Plaintiff serious injury as he is being deprived of his 100% ownership in the
subject property. (Compl. ¶¶ 18-21.) The Court finds that these constitute
sufficient facts to support a cause of action for cancellation of instrument.
 
Declaratory Relief
            Plaintiff
argues that he is seeking a judicial determination that he is the 100% owner of
the subject property and that Defendant has no interest in the subject
property. Plaintiff states he is seeking a judicial declaration that the forged
deed is invalid. 
            Defendant
provides no arguments as to why the claim for declaratory relief fails as a
matter of law. The complaint requests declaratory relief in the form of a
judicial declaration that Plaintiff is 100% owner of the subject property and
Defendant holds no interest in the Subject Property. The Court finds this is
sufficient. 
Accordingly, the demurrer OVERRULED. 
Conclusion
Defendant’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.
