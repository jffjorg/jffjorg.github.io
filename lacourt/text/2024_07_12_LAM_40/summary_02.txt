And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to consolidate the two cases, 20STCV25497 and 21STCV15837, is granted in part for trial purposes only. The cases are related and involve common questions of law and fact, and consolidating them will save time and money, prevent inconsistent adjudications, and promote the convenience of the parties involved. However, the judge has declined to consolidate the cases for all purposes due to the lack of good cause to reopen discovery in the Brighton Case, which has already had its discovery deadlines elapse.
