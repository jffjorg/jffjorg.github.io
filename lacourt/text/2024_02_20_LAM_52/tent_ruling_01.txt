  Case Number:  23STCP04474    Hearing Date:   February 20, 2024    Dept:  52 Petitioner Greatbuildz,
Inc.’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award
Petitioner
Greatbuildz, Inc. petitions the court to confirm an arbitration award against
respondent Robert Barron dba All In One
Construction.  Code of Civil Procedure
section 1286 provides, “If a petition or response under” the California
Arbitration Act “is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as
made … unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceedings.”
The
court does not find this petition was “duly served and filed.”  “A copy of the petition and a written
notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon
which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided in the
arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.”  (CCP § 1290.4(a).)  “If the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which such service shall be made,” the service “shall be
made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an
action.”  (CCP § 1290.4(b)(1).)  
The
parties’ contract (Petition, att. 4(b)) does not specify a method of service.  Petitioner therefore was required to serve the
petition and notice of the hearing on respondent in the manner of a
summons.  Petitioner did not timely file
any proof of service on the respondent.    
The
petition to confirm the arbitration award is denied without prejudice.
