And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the petition to confirm an arbitration award against respondent Robert Barron dba All In One Construction, filed by petitioner Greatbuildz, Inc. The court finds that the petition was not "duly served and filed" because the parties' contract does not specify the method of service, and the petitioner did not timely file proof of service. According to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1286 and 1290.4, a petition to confirm an arbitration award must be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement or, if the agreement is silent, in the manner provided by law for serving a summons. The court will not confirm the arbitration award at this time, but the denial is without prejudice, meaning the petitioner may be able to refile the petition and provide the required proof of service.
