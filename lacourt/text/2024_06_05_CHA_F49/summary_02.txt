And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The tentative ruling is that the Motion to Set Aside Judgment and Quash Writ of Possession is DENIED. The judge notes that the case record does not include a Writ of Possession and that Defendant Duron does not assert any alternative grounds to support his motion to quash writ of possession, other than his claim of not being properly served. The judge concludes that the Court DENIES the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment and Quash Writ of Possession. The judge also notes that the case record reflecting that the Default Judgment was entered against one Defendant Orlando Duron, and the other moving Defendant Maria Verdugo had been dismissed at Plaintiff's request on March 4, 2024. The judge finds that the Defendant Duron has not met his burden to rebut the presumption of valid personal service established by the Proof of Service dated March 4, 2024."
