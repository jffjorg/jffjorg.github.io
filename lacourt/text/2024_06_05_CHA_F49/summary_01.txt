And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for fraud, without leave to amend. The plaintiff's complaint fails to state the necessary elements of fraud, including misrepresentation, knowledge of falsity, intent to induce reliance, justifiable reliance, and resulting damage. The complaint also fails to meet the heightened pleading standards for fraud claims. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to show that the defendant made a misrepresentation as to a material fact or a promise without intent to perform. Additionally, the court rejects the plaintiff's argument that the parties' contract created an independent duty to perform. The court concludes that the plaintiff's fraud claim is not sufficiently pleaded and dismisses the second cause of action for fraud.
