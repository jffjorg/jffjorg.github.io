Case    # 22CHCV00821      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    JUNE 5, 2024    DEMURRER  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case No. 22CHCV00821    Motion  filed: 3/22/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendants Sanjiv Jain and Shubha Jain  (collectively “Defendants”)  RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs Surjit Multani and  Amrita Multani (collectively “Plaintiffs”) NOTICE: OK.   RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order to sustain the Demurring Defendants’ demurrer to the Second Cause of  Action for Fraud of the First Amended Verified Complaint.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The demurrer  is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.    BACKGROUND   On October 5, 2022, Plaintiffs initiated the present action  against Defendants, and all persons unknown, claiming any legal or equitable  right, title, estate, lien, or interest in the property described in the  Complaint adverse to Plaintiff’s title, or any cloud on Plaintiffs’ title  thereto, and Does 1 through 50.    On May 9, 2023, Defendants filed their first demurrer to the  second cause of action for fraud in the original Complaint.    Subsequently, Plaintiffs filed their operative First Amended  Verified Complaint (“FAVC”) on August 21, 2023, alleging the following causes  of action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Fraud; (3) Preliminary and Permanent  Injunction; and (4) Declaratory Relief, rendering Defendants’ first demurrer  moot.   On October 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Request for Entry of  Default, which was entered on the same day. Subsequently, on March 8, 2024, the  Court granted Defendants’ motion to set aside default filed on December 5,  2023. (3/8/24 Minute Order.)   On March 22, 2024, Defendants filed their instant Demurrer  (the “Demurrer”). Subsequently, on May 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their  Opposition.    No Reply papers have been received by the Court.   ANALYSIS   A demurrer is an objection to a  pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the  complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d  311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a  pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153  Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of  determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a  view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The  court “‘“treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly  pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ....”’”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525 (Berkley).) In  applying these standards, the court liberally construes the complaint to  determine whether a cause of action has been stated. (Picton v. Anderson  Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)    “[T]he policy of liberal  construction of the pleadings ... will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a  pleading defective in any material respect. This particularity requirement  necessitates pleading facts which show, how, when, where, to whom, and by what  means the representations were tendered” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)  12 Cal.4th 631, 645 (Lazar) internal quotations and citations omitted).   A.     Meet and  Confer   A party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in  person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to  demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached  that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) A failure to meet and confer does not constitute  grounds to sustain or overrule a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., §430.41, subd.  (a)(4).)   Here,  the requirements for meet and confer have been satisfied. (Joshi Decl., ¶ 3.)   B.      Second Cause  of Action - Fraud   A claim for fraud must plead all of  the following elements: (1) misrepresentation; (2)¿knowledge of falsity; (3)  intent to induce reliance; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting  damage.  (Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School Dist. (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d  123, 128; Wilhelm v. Pray, Price, Williams & Russell (1986)  186 Cal.App.3d 1324, 1332.)    Fraud actions are subject to strict  requirements of particularity in pleading.  (Committee on Children’s  Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216.)   Particularity requires facts that show how, when, where, to whom, and by what  means the representations were tendered.  (Lazar, supra, 12 Cal.4th  at p. 645.) “Promissory  fraud” is a subspecies of the action for fraud and deceit. A promise to do  something necessarily implies the intention to perform; hence, where a promise  is made without such intention, there is an implied misrepresentation of fact  that may be actionable fraud.” (Id., at p. 638.)    Defendants argue that their Demurrer to the Fraud  claim should be sustained on three independent grounds: first, the FAVC lacks a  statement of fact that can be proven true or false in the FAVC, second, Plaintiffs  fail to meet the heightened standard for pleading a Fraud claim, and third, the  Fraud claim is converted from a contract cause into a tort without a required  independent duty. (Dem., at p. 5.)   The Court now turns to examining these arguments  respectively.   1)       Failure  to State Elements of Fraud Claim    “‘The necessary elements of fraud are:  (1) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure);  (2) knowledge of falsity (scienter); (3) intent to defraud (i.e., to induce  reliance); (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.’” (Alliance Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell (1995) 10 Cal.4th  1226, 1239.)    Here, Defendants argue that the FAVC does not allege  with any specificity regarding any statement of misrepresentation. (Dem., at p.  7.) In response, Plaintiffs assert that the FAVC alleges the specific date and  the specific misrepresentation, which states, “On or about October 29, 2019, simultaneous  with the execution of the Lease ... Defendant Sjain verbally represented to  Smultani that if he and his wife signed the Lease and the Option to Buy,  Smultnai and Amulani would be able to continue to rent the Subject Property for  an additional two years and at the end of extended lease period be able to  purchase the Subject Property for $1,745.000.00.” (FAVC, ¶ 28.)    “It is hornbook law that an actionable misrepresentation must be made about past  or existing facts; statements  regarding future events are merely deemed opinions. [Citations.]” (San Francisco Design Center Associates v. Portman Companies  (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 29, 43–44 (SF Design Center).) For example, the  law is clear that expressions of opinion are not generally treated as  representations of fact, and thus not grounds for misrepresentation cause of  action. (Neu-Visions Sports, Inc. v. Soren/McAdam/Bartells (2000) 86  Cal.App.4th 303, 308 [internal citations omitted.])   In accordance with the established precedent, it is  evident to the Court that the quoted statement should be characterized as a  promise in the context of negotiation, not about “past or existing facts” which  is required for an actionable misrepresentation, as outlined in SF Design  Center, supra, 41 Cal.App.4th at pp. 43-44.) Plaintiffs concede and  emphasize that the quoted statement was concerning an Option to Buy at a future  time.  (See generally FAVC.)   Consequently, Plaintiffs’ argument that they alleged  the specific statements that qualify as a basis for the Fraud  (misrepresentation) claim fails.    Plaintiffs further state, in their Opposition, that “a  Fraud Cause of Action can also be alleged with a Breach of Contract Cause of  Action. It is commonly known as Promissory Fraud[.]” (Opp’n., at pp. 2, 5.)   Next,  the Court turns to evaluate if the specific statements relied upon by  Plaintiffs would support a cause of action for Promissory Fraud. (See Bush v.  California Conservation Corps. (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 194, 200 [“A trial court's ruling sustaining a demurrer is deemed erroneous where a  plaintiff has stated a cause of action under  any possible legal theory.”])   “The elements of promissory fraud  (i.e., of fraud or deceit based on a promise made without any intention of  performing it) are: (1) a promise made regarding a material fact without any  intention of performing it; (2) the existence of the intent not to perform at  the time the promise was made; (3) intent to deceive or induce the promisee to  enter into a transaction; (4) reasonable reliance by the promisee; (5)  nonperformance by the party making the promise; and (6) resulting damage to the  promise.” (Muraoka v. Budget Rent–A–Car (1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 107,  119 (Muraoka).)   Here, the FAVC alleges, “Between December 2021 and  April 18, 2022, Smultani was told by Sjain through his authorized agent Robin  Gaur at various times that if he would agree to pay an extra $200,000 or more  over and above the $1,745,000.00 purchase price, he and Shjain would sell to  Plaintiffs the Subject Property for this increased amount.” (FAVC, ¶ 31.)  Plaintiff claims that this allegation supports the elements of their Fraud  claim.    The Court disagrees with this assessment, finding that  the specific allegation only suggests that Defendants were proposing to modify the  price terms of the Option to Buy Agreement. However, this inference neither  proves nor disproves any statement, nor does it show that the alleged intent of  Defendants not to perform existed at the time the promise was made, as these  two statements were made at least two years apart, spanning between October  2019 (FAVC, ¶ 28) and December 2021 (FAVC, ¶ 31.)    Moreover, Plaintiffs concede that the alleged promise  was made “[o]n or about October 29, 2019, simultaneous with the execution of  the Lease.” (FAVC, ¶ 28.) The Option to Buy Agreement, which is part of the  Lease, as incorporated into their pleading, indicates that the Option to Buy  Agreement actually includes this promise as its term, leading to a reasonable  inference that Defendants intended to carry out this performance by including  the exact term in the written agreement, thereby undermining Plaintiffs’ argument.   Therefore, the allegations that Plaintiffs rely on  would not sufficiently state the second element of the cause of action for  Promissory Fraud – namely, the existence of the intent not to perform at the  time the promise was made. (Muraoka, supra, 160 Cal.App.3d at p.  119.)   The Court finds these allegations are insufficient to  show that Defendants made either a misrepresentation as to a material fact or a  promise without intent to perform.   The Demurrer is SUSTAINED on this ground.   2)      Failure  to Meet the Pleading Standards for Fraud Claims   The heightened pleading standard for fraud  requires “pleading facts which ‘show how, when, where, to  whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.’” [Citation.] (Lazar,  supra, 12 Cal.4th, at p. 638) Thus, “every element of the cause of  action for fraud must be alleged in full, factually  and specifically.” (Wilhelm v. Pray (1986) 186  Cal.App.3d 1324, 1331.)   Here, as discussed previously,  the FAVC fails to sufficiently state elements of the Fraud cause of action, and  there is no point in evaluating the specificity requirement since it is  premised on the completeness of all elements being first satisfied.    Accordingly, the Demurrer is  SUSTAINED on this alternative ground.   3)       Tort  Claim Unavailable for Contract Claim   “Conduct  amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates  an independent duty arising from principles of tort law. ‘The law imposes the  obligation that “every person is bound without contract to abstain from  injuring the person or property of another, or infringing upon any of his  rights." (Sec.  1708, Civ. Code.) This duty is independent of the contract.... ‘[A]n omission to  perform a contract obligation is never a tort, unless that omission is also an  omission of a legal duty.’” (Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi  Arabia Ltd (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 515 (Applied Equipment), citing Jones v. Kelly (1929) 208 Cal. 251, 255.)   “Liability for deceit, for example, may be imposed on  contracting parties as well as others: ‘One who willfully deceives another with  intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for  any damage which he thereby suffers.’ (Civ. Code, §  1709.) We do not suggest that the  doctrine of conspiracy cannot impose tort liability on a contracting party  for fraud or other torts for which that party could, in the absence of a  conspiracy, be held liable to a plaintiff.” (Applied Equipment, supra,  7 Cal.4th 503 fn.  8.)   According to the established law above, a  Fraud claim may be imposed in conjunction with an action for Breach of  Contract. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Promissory Fraud is an example  of this application.   Thus, the Court rejects Defendants’  argument on this independent ground.   In sum, the Court SUSTAINS the Demurrer  as to the Second Cause of Action for Fraud in the FAVC.    C.     Leave to Amend   When a demurrer is  sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that  the defect can be cured by amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39  Cal.3d 311, 318.)  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts  upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff  an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived  of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were  defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152  Cal.App.2d 892, 900.)     Here, Plaintiffs have  not argued that there is a reasonable possibility to cure the defect in their  Fraud claim – namely, the absence of the most critical element the  misrepresentation of fact. Additionally, Plaintiffs had previously amended  their original Complaint to moot Defendants’ first demurrer to the same Fraud  claim. However, Plaintiffs have not addressed the defects in the pleadings.   Therefore, Defendants’  Demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for Fraud is SUSTAINED, without leave to  amend.   CONCLUSION   Defendant’s  Demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.   Moving  party to give notice.
