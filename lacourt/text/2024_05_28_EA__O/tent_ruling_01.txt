Plaintiff’s
Counsel Tom Kinan’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, effective
upon [see below]. 
 
Background
 
This is a negligence case. Plaintiff Vanessa Melody Singh
alleges the following against Defendants Friendly Franchisees Corporation dba
Carls Junior (“Carls Junior”); Manager Jasmine; Peco Foods, Inc.: On May 17,
2020, Plaintiff bit into a chicken nugget that contained a metal spring. 
 
On May 1, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit.
 
On December 7, 2022, Carls Junior and Manager Jasmine filed
a cross-complaint (CC) against Peco Foods, Inc. for (1) indemnity and (2)
apportionment of fault. That same day, said defendants also filed their answer.
 
On December 15, 2023, Peco filed its answer to the CC.
 
On March 4, 2024, Peco Foods, Inc. filed its answer to the
complaint. 
 
On April 15, 2024, the parties attended an IDC. 
 
On April 22, 2024, Carls Junior filed a ‘MOTION TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES – GENERAL, SET ONE, FROM PLAINTIFF;
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT
OF  $ 1,680.00; DECLARATION OF JOEL S.
POREMBA.’
 
On May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed the instant
motion.
 
Future hearings: CMC set for 5/28/24 and Discovery Motion
set for 6/5/24. 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel Tom Kinan seeks to be relieved as counsel because
Plaintiff is not cooperating in the litigation process. 
 
Here, the court finds good cause to grant the motion. Should
there be any prejudice by granting the motion, the client, despite receiving
notice of the motion, has not filed an opposition to convey any concerns. Additionally,
even should Plaintiff raise concerns with prejudice, the court finds concerns
with prejudice mitigated as there is no trial date set and no substantive
motions on calendar that require Plaintiff’s immediate representation.
According, Plaintiff has sufficient time to retain new counsel. 
 
Therefore, as Plaintiff’s Counsel has complied with the
California Rules of Court, the court grants the motion.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted effective upon
service of motion and the court’s order upon Plaintiff, Defendants, and all
other parties who have appeared.
