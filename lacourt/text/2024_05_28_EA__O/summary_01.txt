And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel Tom Kinan to be relieved as counsel. The court finds good cause to grant the motion because the Plaintiff is not cooperating in the litigation process. The court notes that the client has not filed an opposition to the motion, and even if they did, the court finds that any prejudice would be mitigated since there is no trial date set and no substantive motions on the calendar that require immediate representation. The court grants the motion effective upon service of the motion and the court's order upon the Plaintiff, Defendants, and all other parties who have appeared.
