And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles World Airports' (LAWA Defendants) demurrer to Maria Prado's Complaint is sustained, with 20 days leave to amend. The Complaint alleges that LAWA Defendants are liable for a dangerous condition of public property that caused Prado to slip and fall while trying to get into an airport wheelchair.

The Judge found that Prado's Complaint fails to state a cause of action for vicarious liability against LAWA Defendants, as it does not allege sufficient facts to establish a statutory basis for liability. The Judge also found that Prado's Complaint does not specify the nature of the dangerous condition, such as whether the ground was slippery or the wheelchair was defective.

The Judge granted LAWA Defendants' demurrer and gave Prado 20 days to amend her Complaint to better plead her claims. The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to modification based on any further briefing or oral argument.
