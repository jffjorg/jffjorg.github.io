And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion for trial preference filed by Seiichi Saito, as guardian ad litem for his minor daughter Julia Saito, who is 11 years old and has suffered personal injuries due to the uninhabitable conditions of the property. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (b), which provides that a civil action to recover damages for personal injury shall be entitled to preference upon the motion of any party to the action who is under 14 years of age unless the court finds that the party does not have a substantial interest in the case as a whole. The judge finds that Julia Saito has a substantial interest in the case and that the defendants have not disputed this fact. The judge also rejects the defendants' argument that granting the motion for trial preference would violate their due process rights, citing the case of Swaithes v. Superior Court, which held that the trial court has no power to balance the differing interests of opposing litigants in applying the provision of section 36. The judge orders the trial to be set within 120 days.
