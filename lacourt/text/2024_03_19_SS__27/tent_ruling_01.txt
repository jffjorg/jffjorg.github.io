Background
 
This lawsuit
arises from injuries allegedly suffered by Plaintiff stemming from a purported
trip and fall which occurred on October 21, 2018, at Pacific Theatres
Northridge, a movie theater owned by Pacific Theatres. Decurion is Pacific
Theatres’ parent company. On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service for summons
and complaint on Pacific
Northridge Fashion Center 10. Defendants move the court to quash service on the
basis that Pacific Northridge Fashion Center 10 is fictious business name used
by Defendant Pacific Theatres Entertainment. Plaintiff did not file an
opposition.
 
Legal standard
 
“‘Service
of process, under longstanding tradition in our system of justice, is
fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant.’ [Citation.]” (AO
Alfa-Bank v. Yakovlev (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 189, 202.) “To establish
personal jurisdiction, compliance with statutory procedures for service of
process is essential.” (Kremerman v. White (2021). 71 Cal.App.5th 358,
371.) Defendant’s knowledge of the action does not dispense with statutory
requirements for service of summons. (Kappel v. Bartlett (1988) 200
Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466.)   
  
“A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow” may move “to quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him
or her” that results from lack of proper service. (Code of Civ. Proc. §
418.10(a)(1). A defendant has 30 days after the service of the summons to file
a responsive pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3).)   
  
“When
a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413.)   
  
Filing
of proof of service that complies with the applicable statutory requirements
creates a rebuttable presumption of proper service. (Am. Express Centurion Bank
v. Zara, (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) The moving party may then introduce evidence
to rebut this presumption. 
 
Judicial Notice 
 
Defendant’s request that the Court take
judicial notice that The California Secretary of State’s website provides
that Jill Saperstein is the registered agent for THE DECURION CORPORATION is GRANTED. 
 
Analysis 
On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service for
personal service of the summons and complaint on Pacific Northridge Fashion
Center 10. The process server declared that he personally served the summons
and complaint on Christopher S. Forman, who was identified as the authorized
agent for service of process at 120 N. Robertson Avenue, 3rd Floor, Los
Angeles, on January 16, 2024, at 11:10 AM. Plaintiff’s proof of service
identified the time, place, name and title of person served and manner of
service, creating a rebuttable presumption of proper service.
Defendant now introduces evidence to rebut this presumption.
Defendant argues that "Pacific Northridge Fashion Center 10" was the
name of a movie theatre complex located at 9400 Shirley Avenue, Northridge,
California, in which the trip and fall took place. (Jim Jamila Decl. ¶ 3.) It
is a fictitious business name used by Defendant PACIFIC THEATRES ENTERTAINMENT
CORPORATION. (Mersereau Decl. ¶ 4; Jamila Decl. ¶ 3.) "Pacific Northridge
Fashion Center 10" is not and was not a corporation, limited liability
company, or any other type of business entity. (Jamila Decl. ¶ 3.) A business
search on the California Secretary of State website confirms that no such
entity exists. (Mersereau Decl. ¶ 4.) 
Moreover, Defendant disputes the accuracy of the information on the
proof of service, where Christopher S. Forman was identified as the authorized
agent for service of process for Pacific Northridge Fashion Center 10. Jim
Jamila, Assistant Secretary of Decurion, declares that no one employed by
Decurion is authorized to accept service for "Pacific Northridge Fashion
Center 10." (Jamila Decl. ¶ 4.) Mr. Forman is the CEO of Decurion. He is
not even the registered agent for service for Decurion let alone Pacific
Northridge Fashion Center 10. The registered agent for Decurion is Jill
Saperstein. (Jamila Decl. ¶ 6.)
While a declaration from Christopher Forman would be preferred, Plaintiff
did not file an opposition contesting the merits of Defendant’s motion. Such failure
can be construed as a presumption that Plaintiff has no meritorious
argument(s).  (See Southern California
Gas Co. v. Flannery (2016), 5 Cal. App. 5th 476, 483, fn.7 (lack
of opposition waives arguments); Sexton v. Superior Court (1997), 58
Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.)
Based on the evidence provided and Plaintiff's
lack of opposition, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to quash.
