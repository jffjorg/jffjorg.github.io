Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel deposition of Defendant Francisco Escalante and request for sanctions filed by Plaintiff Robert Williamson. The Court grants the motion, ordering Escalante to appear for deposition within 20 days of the date of the ruling. The Court also grants the request for sanctions, ordering Defendant Escalante and his counsel to pay $2000 to Plaintiff. The ruling is based on the failure of Defendant to comply with the notice of deposition and the lack of good faith meet and confer efforts. The Court finds that Plaintiff fulfilled the necessary requirements for a motion to compel and that further intervention is necessary to resolve the issue of deposition.
