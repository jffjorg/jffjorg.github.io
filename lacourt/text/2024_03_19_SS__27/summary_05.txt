The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel by Timothy M. Ghobrial, the attorney for the plaintiff, Christian Bravo. The motion was unopposed and was based on an alleged breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge found that this was proper grounds for withdrawal, but expressed concerns about whether proper notice was given to the plaintiff. The judge denied the motion without prejudice, pending further clarification and/or evidence from counsel regarding the "skip trace" used to determine the plaintiff's address and pending the upcoming court appearances.
