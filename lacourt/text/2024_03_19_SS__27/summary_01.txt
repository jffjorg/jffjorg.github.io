Summary in English text:
The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons filed by defendants The Decurion Corporation and Pacific Theatres Entertainment Corporation. The motion was unopposed by the plaintiff, Patricia Ann Venti. The defendants argued that the proof of service filed by the plaintiff was improper because it was served on a fictitious business name, Pacific Northridge Fashion Center 10, which is not a corporation or limited liability company. The defendant also disputed the accuracy of the information on the proof of service. The Judge found that the plaintiff failed to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving the facts requisite to an effective service. The Judge granted the motion to quash service of summons and ordered that the case be taken off calendar unless the parties submit to the tentative ruling by email.
