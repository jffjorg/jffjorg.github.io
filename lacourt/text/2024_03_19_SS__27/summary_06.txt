Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiff, Alfredo Becerra-Aguilar, by Attorney Arturo S. Salinas. The motion is unopposed and the Court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and/or communication is a proper ground for withdrawal. The Court notes that the next hearing is a Final Status Conference set for September 26, 2024, which should be sufficient time for the Plaintiff to retain new counsel or be prepared to represent himself.
