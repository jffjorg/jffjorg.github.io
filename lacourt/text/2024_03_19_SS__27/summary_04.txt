**Significant Statements**

"The purpose of a motion for summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite its allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve its dispute." (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.)
"A defendant moving for summary judgment must show the plaintiff's causes of action have no merit."
"A defendant need not own, possess and control property in order to be held liable; control alone is sufficient."
"Defendants have failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that they did not own or control the property at the time of the incident."
"Defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED."
