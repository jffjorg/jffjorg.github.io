Background
On January 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed the present
slip and fall case. Defendant's PMK deposition was noticed three times: on
September 29, 2021, May 2, 2022, and August 18, 2022. From November 2023 to
December 2023, Plaintiff has made several attempts to schedule Defendant's PMK
deposition, which Defendant allegedly refused to produce. Plaintiff now moves
the Court to compel Defendant’s PMK deposition. Defendant argues that the
motion is untimely because it was filed after the discovery cutoff date.
Legal Standard
Any party may obtain any discovery
of information, documents, land, property, or electronically stored information
so long as the discoverable matter is not privileged, is relevant to the
subject matter and can lead one to admissible evidence.¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450¿provides in pertinent part the
following:¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“(a) If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.¿¿ 
 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with both of the following:¿¿ 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.¿¿ 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040 
 
Meet and Confer and Good Cause
Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated good cause
and engaged in good faith meet and confer efforts with opposing counsel.
Defendant does not oppose the motion on these grounds.
Analysis.
January 12, 2024 is the operative trial
date of this matter from which deadlines relating to discovery motions are
calculated. On December 22, 2023, the court continued the trial date from
January 12, 2024 to its current date of May 1, 2024. The court also provided:
“It is further ORDERED that unless a motion or event of discovery is otherwise
hereafter authorized by an order of the Court, all motion and discovery cut off
dates shall be associated with the January 12, 2024 trial date.” Pursuant to
C.C.P. § 2024.020, the discovery cut-off date for the present case was December
13, 2023, and the final date to hear a motion was December 28, 2023. The
present motion was filed on December 14, 2023, after the discovery cut-off
date, and is set to be heard well beyond the December 28, 2023, deadline. The
present motion is untimely, and Plaintiff does not dispute this in the reply.
Moreover, the Court cannot grant a motion to compel without first deciding on a
motion to reopen discovery. (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta
Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1588.) After the
trial was continued, Plaintiff did not file a motion to reopen discovery; thus,
Plaintiff's motion to compel is DENIED.
Plaintiff raises the issue of issue preclusion and evidentiary sanction
for the first time in her reply brief as to Defendant’s discovery abuse.
However, a party cannot raise new arguments for the first time in a reply
brief, as the opposing party would have no opportunity to respond. (Nelson
v. Gaunt (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 623, 641.) Furthermore, Plaintiff did not
sufficiently demonstrate discovery abuse by Defendant. The delay appears to be
of Plaintiff's own making. Plaintiff’s last PMK deposition notice was served on
August 18, 2022, and Plaintiff did not visit the issue of a PMK deposition more
than a year later, in November 2023. Plaintiff could have filed the present
motion in 2022, but waited until the discovery cut-off to close on December 13,
2023. 
Moreover, Plaintiff has not substantiated her claim that Defendant
engaged in discovery abuse as the only evidence provided consists of objections
Defendant raised to Plaintiff's deposition notice, which do not, without more, evidence
discovery abuse. Plaintiff did not produce any other documents to support her
claim. Thus, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.
