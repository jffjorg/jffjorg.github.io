And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to bifurcate the trial in a case where the plaintiff seeks damages arising from the defendants' illegal and discriminatory arrest and two-day jail detention. The defendants, the City of LA and Daniel Rodriguez, argue that bifurcation would save time and prevent the jury from being influenced by sympathy towards the plaintiff. However, the court finds that the defendants have failed to establish why bifurcation is warranted in this case. Therefore, the motion is denied. The court notes that it can bifurcate the issue of punitive damages if necessary. Counsel are encouraged to provide notice of their intentions and to appear remotely for the future court hearing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
