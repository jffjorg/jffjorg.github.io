And here is the English text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion seeking contempt, terminating, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Maria Lizarraga for failure to comply with court orders. The court granted Defendant Total Airport Services, LLC's motions to compel further responses from Plaintiff on August 2, 2023, and August 16, 2023. However, Plaintiff failed to provide substantive responses for many discovery requests and did not serve verifications. The court finds that Plaintiff's responses are inadequate and that Plaintiff engaged in a misuse of the discovery process. As a result, the court is granting the motion in part and ordering Plaintiff to provide further substantive responses and production of documents within 20 days. The court is also imposing reduced monetary sanctions of $1,500 against Plaintiff and her counsel. The court will also discuss the request to continue the June 24, 2024, trial date by eight months at the motion hearing.
