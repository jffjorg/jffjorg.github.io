Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on all claims except for punitive damages, which is granted as to the public entity LAUSD. The Judge finds that the defendants have failed to carry their burden on the harassment and retaliation claims, and that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate. The Judge also finds that the defendants' failure to provide a second aide and their lack of reasonable accommodation were discriminatory and pretextual.
