 This is an action in which “Plaintiff seeks damages arising from Defendants’ illegal and discriminatory arrest and two-day jail detention. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs from Defendants for violating Plaintiff’s rights under the Constitution and California state law, including unreasonable search and seizure, false arrest, and related illegal actions.”  (Complaint ¶ 1.)Defendants City of LA and Daniel Rodriguez seek to bifurcate trial into two phases: (a) liability and (b) damages.  Defendants contend that bifurcation could save time and that “[s]hould the jury hear evidence of Plaintiff’s claimed damages, it is likely the jury would feel sympathy towards the Plaintiff and would tend to favor a Plaintiff’s verdict regardless of the objective facts presented.”“Whether separate actions shall be consolidated for trial, or whether there shall be a severance and separate trials of issues in a single action, is within the discretion of the trial court.”  (Mellone v. Lewis (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 4, 7, quoting McArther v. Shaffer (1943) 59 Cal.App.2d 724, 727.)  The objectives of bifurcated trials are to “expedite and simplify the presentation of evidence” (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 888), and “avoidance of the waste of time and money caused by the unnecessary trial of damage questions in cases where the liability issue was resolved against the plaintiff.”  (Plaza Tulare v. Tradewell Stores, Inc. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 522, 524.)The Court finds that Defendants failed to establish why bifurcation is warranted under the circumstances of this case.  Therefore, the Motion is denied.The Court notes that it can bifurcate the issue of punitive damages.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
