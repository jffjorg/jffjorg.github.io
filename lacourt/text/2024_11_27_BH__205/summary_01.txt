And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting Respondent Aspiration Partners, Inc.'s motion to seal certain documents filed in connection with a joint statement related to an informal discovery conference (IDC) scheduled for October 30, 2024. The documents in question include financial information and confidential dealings with business partners. The judge finds that these materials were filed in connection with a discovery motion, which is not subject to the public's right of access. Therefore, the judge does not need to engage in a balancing test to decide whether to seal the materials. The sealed documents include the Joint Statement and several exhibits.
