And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action is granted. The plaintiff claims that the dismissal was the result of an attorney error, specifically a calendaring error, and that this error warrants vacating the dismissal. The judge has concluded that mandatory relief is warranted under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง473(b) and has vacated the order of dismissal. The plaintiff is still required to respond to the order to show cause (OSC) why counsel failed to appear at the October 1 case management conference (CMC). The OSC will be heard on December 9, 2024, and the court will consider whether sanctions are warranted.
