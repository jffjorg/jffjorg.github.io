  Case Number:  23SMCP00651    Hearing Date:   November 27, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   EDEN REFORESTRATION PROJECTS, et al.  Petitioners, v.  ASPIRATION PARTNERS, INC., et al.,   Respondents.    Case No.:  23SMCP00651     Hearing Date:  November 27, 2024   [TENTATIVE] order RE:   respondent aspiration partners,    inc.’s MOTION to seal portions of    joint statement of issues to be    covered at the october 30, 2024    informal discovery conference          BACKGROUND    This case arises from a dispute over a settlement agreement.  The signatories to the settlement agreement were Petitioners Eden Reforestation Projects and its wholly owned subsidiary Compassionate Carbon on the one hand, and Respondents Aspiration Partners, Inc. and Aspiration Inc. on the other.  A dispute arose over the settlement agreement.  The settlement agreement provided for the resolution of disputes “arising from or relating to” it by JAMS arbitration.   Petitioners commenced an arbitration of the dispute by filing a demand with JAMS.  The Hon. Kirk H. Nakamura (Ret.) was appointed as the arbitrator.  Petitioners filed a motion for summary judgment, which the Arbitrator granted.  (See Attachment 8(c) to Petition.)   The Arbitrator concluded that (1) Respondents breached the Settlement Agreement by not making a $1,000,000 settlement payment, (2) Respondents repudiated the Settlement Agreement and thereby anticipatorily breached the Settlement Agreement, and $1,376,271.19 is the discounted accelerated payment sum due under the Settlement Agreement, (3) the $1,000,000 past due sum is a sum certain and thus Petitioners are entitled to prejudgment interest on that sum which totals $10,958.90, and (4) Respondents are liable for all arbitration costs.  (Id.)  The Arbitrator also granted judgment in favor of Petitioners on their declaratory relief claim.  (Id.) On December 15, 2023, the Arbitrator issued the Award, and JAMS served the Award on the parties on December 5, 2023.  No request to correct the Award was made by any party.   On January 29, 2024, the Court confirmed the arbitration award.  The Court issued judgment in favor of Petitioners and against Respondents (the “Judgment”), including a monetary award.   This hearing is on Respondent’s motion to seal documents submitted in connection with a joint statement of issues for an informal discovery conference (“IDC”) scheduled for October 30, 2024.  The information to be sealed includes financial information and confidential dealings with business partners.  The Court previously granted a motion to seal this information in prior filings, concluding that there is no right to access for records filed or lodged in connection with discovery motions or proceedings.  Petitioners does not oppose the motion to seal.   LEGAL STANDARD  The “sealed records rule” (effective 2001) codifies the balancing test articulated by the Supreme Court in¿NBC Subsidiary¿(KNBC-TV),¿Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178. It provides that documents used as a basis of adjudication cannot be withheld from the public under the First Amendment without first obtaining a court¿order to file under¿seal, and that “court must not permit a record to be filed under¿seal¿based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the parties.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court rule 2.551(a).) The¿sealed¿records rule does not apply to discovery proceedings.  (See¿NBC Subsidiary, 20 Cal.4th at 1208-1209, fn. 25;¿Mercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein¿(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 60, 100.  “The public has a First Amendment right of access to civil litigation documents filed in court and used at trial or submitted as a basis for adjudication. Substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil cases, and the transcripts and records pertaining to these proceedings, are presumptively open.”  (NBC Subsidiary, 20 Cal.4th at 1208-1209.) ¿However, there is no right of public access to discovery materials filed or lodged in court in connection with discovery motions or proceedings (e.g., privileged material lodged in opposition to motion to compel).¿ (Mercury Interactive Corp., 158 CA4th at 100-101.)¿ The sealed records rule’s presumption of public access applies to court-filed¿discovery materials used at trial or submitted as a basis for adjudication of matters other than discovery motions or proceedings.¿ (Id.)  Discovery materials “submitted as a basis for adjudication” refers to materials submitted in support of or in opposition to substantive pretrial motions, regardless of whether those materials play any role in the trial court’s ultimate ruling on the motion.¿ (Overstock.Com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.¿(2014) 231 CA4th 471, 496.) DISCUSSION Respondent seeks to have various documents filed under seal.  The documents were filed in connection with a joint statement – filed in anticipation of an IDC, which the Court requires before any party may file a discovery motion.  Because these materials were filed or lodged in connection with a discovery motion, there is no right of public access.  Accordingly, the Court need not engage in a balancing test to decide whether to seal the materials.   CONCLUSION   For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Respondent’s motion to seal.  The following will remain under seal: Joint Statement at 2:22-24; 3:1-3, 18, 19-21  Ex. 3 at pp. 1-5 Ex. 8 at 2:16, 20-21; 3:1-25; 4:1-21; 6:5-18; 7:12-16, 18 DATED:  November 27, 2024        ___________________________ Edward B.
