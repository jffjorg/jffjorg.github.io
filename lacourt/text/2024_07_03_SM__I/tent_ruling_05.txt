 Case Number:  23SMCV04828    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  I The demurrer is OVERRULED. 
This is a demurrer to the answer. 
However, there is no actual demurrer filed.  That is a fatal defect, but even were the
court to overlook that problem, the demurrer would still be to the answer
entire, not to certain affirmative defenses only.  Because of that, either every affirmative
defense must fail or none of them do and the court cannot say that none are
proper.  This is the demurrer trap, and
it applies to demurrers to answers as well as to complaints.  Accordingly, the court really has no choice
in the matter.  
 
Were the demurrer proper, though, the court would rule as
follows: the demurrers to affirmative defenses 1, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 19, and
20 would be sustained without leave to amend as they are not affirmative
defenses; the demurrers to affirmative defenses 6, 8, 12, 13, 17, and 18 would
be sustained with leave to amend as they are not properly pled; and the
demurrers to affirmative defenses 2, 3, 4, 9, and 11 would be overruled.
 
The answer is overpled and boilerplate.  The court perceives a speedy MJOP on this,
and the form interrogatory will be served and the court would expect the
defense to give detailed, fact-based answers for each and every affirmative
defense pled without objection or evasion. 
If there are no facts that can be pled, the court would question (as it
already does) whether the answer was filed in good faith.
 
The court STRONGLY urges the defense to file an amended
answer that conforms to the rules.  The
court also suggests not assigning the task to an attorney who views this as a
law school examination but instead actually gives a moment of thought to what
defenses to plead and does not just copy and paste from the firm’s rather poor
form book.
