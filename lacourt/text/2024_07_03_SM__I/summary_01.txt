Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorneys' fees brought by a plaintiff who brought a petition to compel inspection of books and records. The defendant, APA, contests the recoverability of pre-litigation fees. The judge disagrees with APA and finds that the statute allows for recovery of fees incurred before and after suit was filed, as long as they are reasonable and related to the petition and suit. The judge notes that the goal of the statute is to get the company to comply with its obligations, not to punish a shareholder who is forced to bring a justifiable action.

The judge also notes that the lodestar approach is the correct one for determining the reasonableness of the fees, but more information is needed to determine whether the actual hourly rate is the correct one. The judge requires the attorneys to take more time to sort out what parts of the work related to the petition and what parts did not.

The judge awards fees to the plaintiff, but notes that more work needs to be done to firm up the hourly rates and provide better justification for the actual hours worked. The judge suggests that the parties reach an accord on this point.
