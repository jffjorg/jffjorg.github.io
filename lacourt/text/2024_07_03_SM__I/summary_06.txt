```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for reconsideration. The plaintiff is trying to proceed with a unlawful detainer (UD) action against the defendant, who claims to be the rightful owner of the property. However, the court has previously stated that when the person living on the premises claims to hold title, the UD procedures do not apply. Instead, the defendant is entitled to regular due process to determine whether they actually own the property. The judge is convinced that their prior order was correct because the ownership issue is being adjudicated elsewhere. If the plaintiff wants to lift the stay, they must bring a motion, which the court will consider on the merits.
