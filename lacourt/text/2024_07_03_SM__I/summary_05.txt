And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer to the answer filed by the defendant. However, the demurrer is not properly filed, which is a fatal defect. Even if the court ignores this issue, the demurrer would still be invalid because it is a blanket demurrer to the entire answer, rather than to specific affirmative defenses. The court is therefore forced to rule on the demurrer and will sustain or overrule each affirmative defense individually.

The judge notes that the answer is overpled and boilerplate, and suggests that the defense file an amended answer that conforms to the rules. The court also encourages the defense to give detailed, fact-based answers to each affirmative defense pled without objection or evasion. If the defense is unable to provide facts to support its affirmative defenses, the court may question whether the answer was filed in good faith.
