And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer by Dr. Hwang to the complaint. The judge sustains the demurrer in part and overrules it in part. The judge finds that certain claims against Dr. Hwang are valid, while others are not.

The judge strikes the declaration of Jones, finding that the jurat is improper. The judge overrules Dr. Hwang's demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action, finding that they are not uncertain or unclear.

The judge finds that Dr. Hwang can be held strictly liable for the device's defects, as he received a direct financial benefit from the sale and use of the device and was effectively co-opted by the manufacturer to become a salesman for the device.

The judge also finds that the complaint alleges outrageous conduct by Dr. Hwang, who allegedly pressured the plaintiff to use the device and concealed its problems. The judge rules that the complaint's allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

However, the judge sustains Dr. Hwang's demurrer to the negligent hiring and supervision cause of action, finding that the complaint does not adequately allege that Dr. Hwang was aware of the device's problems and concealed them.

The judge grants the motion to strike punitive damages as to the causes of action concerning medical malpractice. The judge gives the plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend the complaint to the extent necessary to correct the deficiencies identified in the ruling.
