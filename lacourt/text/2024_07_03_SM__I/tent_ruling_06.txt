 Case Number:  23SMCV06010    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  I The motion for reconsideration is DENIED.  The basic problem is that plaintiff is trying
to proceed by UD where defendant is claiming to be the appropriate
title-holder.  The court stated at the
last hearing that where the person living on the premises claims to hold title
to those premises, the UD procedures do not apply.  Rather, the defendant is entitled to regular
due process to determine whether the defendant is actually the property’s
owner.  The law on this is clear and
unambiguous.  True, where the defendant’s
claim is that the plaintiff does not have title because a third party has
title, UD procedures can apply.  But that
is because the defendant’s ownership of the property is not at issue.  Where the plaintiff can make out a prima
facie case of ownership, that is enough 
Here, however, defendant claims that defendant actually holds title.  Until that is sorted out, the UD procedures
cannot apply consistent with due process. 
The court is convinced that its prior order was the right one because
the ownership issue is being adjudicated elsewhere.  
 
If plaintiff wants to lift the stay, the proper procedure is
to bring such a motion.  The court will
consider that motion, and any opposition thereto, on the merits.
