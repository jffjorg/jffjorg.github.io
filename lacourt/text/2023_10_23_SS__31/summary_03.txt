And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cebert Green vs. Kameron Lee Kai, et al. (Case No. 21STCV21475). The De Leon Defendants have filed unopposed motions to compel discovery responses and to deem admissions admitted against Plaintiff Cebert Green. The Court has granted these motions.

The De Leon Defendants served discovery requests and requests for admission on Plaintiff on April 25, 2023, but Plaintiff failed to respond. The Court finds that Plaintiff was properly served and failed to respond, and therefore grants the motion to compel discovery responses. The Court orders Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days.

The Court also grants the motion to deem admissions admitted against Plaintiff. The De Leon Defendants had propounded requests for admissions on April 25, 2023, but Plaintiff failed to respond. The Court finds that the De Leon Defendants properly served the requests for admissions and Plaintiff failed to respond, and therefore deems the admissions admitted against Plaintiff.

The Court imposes sanctions on Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $1,184.95. The sanctions include attorney's fees and costs incurred by the De Leon Defendants.

Parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement on this tentative ruling. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court by October 23, 2023.
