And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Rudy Mauricio Benavides, and dismisses the plaintiff's action. The plaintiff failed to comply with the Court's April 13, 2023 order compelling responses to the defendant's discovery requests, and instead of opposing the motion, appears to have abandoned the case. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery obligations was willful and that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. The Court concludes that the plaintiff knew of his discovery obligations, knew of the Court Order, and failed to demonstrate that his non-compliance was not willful.
