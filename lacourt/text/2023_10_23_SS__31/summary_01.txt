And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor Jonathan Hernandez, age 8, and Mario Hernandez, age 16. The Court denies the petition due to the use of outdated forms and excessive attorney fees. The Court asks counsel to use the updated version of Judicial Council Forms MC-350 and MC-351 in the amended petition and to reduce the attorney fees. The Court is not satisfied with the efforts in this case justifying the requested 40% of settlement proceeds for attorney fees. Counsel is ordered to provide evidence of extraordinary efforts to support the requested fees. The Court also excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call.
