```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling to deny the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Whitney Werner. The reason for this denial is that the proof of service deficiencies noted in the November 15, 2023 Minute Order have not been corrected. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant, alleging breach of a loan agreement and personal guarantee, and requesting damages and costs. The defendant failed to respond to the complaint, and the plaintiff requested entry of default and default judgment. However, the judge found that the proof of service submitted by the plaintiff does not show that personal service was attempted before substitute service was made, which is required by law. Therefore, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment.
