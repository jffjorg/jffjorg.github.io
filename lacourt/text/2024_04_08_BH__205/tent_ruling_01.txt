Case Name:  Forwardline
Financial, LLC vs Roast, Inc., et al.


Case #: 22SMCV00741
 
Hearing Date (if any): April 8, 2024
 
Defaulting Party:
Defendant Whitney Werner


Total Amount: $42,913.72
 
BACKGROUND:  This case
arises from breach of a loan agreement. Defendant Roast Inc. entered into a
written loan agreement with Plaintiff Forwardline Financial LLC for $59,890.
Defendant Whitney Werner executed a personal guarantee that if Roast Inc.
defaulted, he would be personally and unconditionally liable to Plaintiff.
Roast Inc. failed to make payments under the loan agreement. On May 23, 2022,
Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants. The Complaint alleges three
claims for breach of written contract, breach of personal guarantee and account
stated. The Complaint seeks $43,369.02 in damages plus attorneys’ fees and
costs. Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing Werner was served by
substitute service on June 4, 2022. Werner was obligated to respond within 30
days. Werner did not do so. Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of
Werner’s default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on April 25, 2023.
Plaintiff requested a default judgment on September 5, 2023. Plaintiff served
Defendant by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and Request for
Default Judgment. Defendant has not appeared.

Summons and Complaint 


On June 4,
2022, Defendant was served via substitute service on “Daniel Amen- Private P.O.
Box Employee” at 11664 National Blvd # 410 Los Angeles, CA 90064-3802 
 
o  
November 15, 2023 Minute Order states “Plaintiff
has not shown Werner was properly served with the summons and complaint. The
Court has no jurisdiction to enter default where a defendant was not properly
served. (Hearn v. Howard (2009) 177 Cal. App. 4th 1193, 1200.) Plaintiff claims
it served Werner by substitute service, but the proof of service does not show
any attempts were made at personal service. Ordinarily two or three attempts at
personal service must be made before substitute service is allowed. (Id. at
1202.)”
o  
Plaintiff resubmitted the same proof of service
which still does not show that personal service was attempted before substitute
service.

Relief prayed for in complaint is

total amount requested to $42,913.72.


(Relief afforded in default
judgment is limited to type and amount of claims in complaint, except for
punitives and PI/death. CCP §§ 425.11, 580, 585(a)(b).  The amount in the complaint prayer controls (National
Diversified Services, Inc. v. Bernstein (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 410, 418).)
 
Civil Code § 1719(a)(2) states:
 
Notwithstanding any penal sanctions that may apply,
any person who passes a check on insufficient funds shall be liable to the
payee for damages equal to treble the amount of the check if a written demand
for payment is mailed by certified mail to the person who had passed a check on
insufficient funds and the written demand informs this person of (A) the
provisions of this section, (B) the amount of the check, and (C) the amount of
the service charge payable to the payee. The person who had passed a check on
insufficient funds shall have 30 days from the date the written demand was
mailed to pay the amount of the check, the amount of the service charge payable
to the payee, and the costs to mail the written demand for payment. If this
person fails to pay in full the amount of the check, the service charge payable
to the payee, and the costs to mail the written demand within this period, this
person shall then be liable instead for the amount of the check, minus any
partial payments made toward the amount of the check or the service charge
within 30 days of the written demand, and damages equal to treble that amount,
which shall not be less than one hundred dollars ($100) nor more than one
thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500). When a person becomes liable for treble
damages for a check that is the subject of a written demand, that person shall
no longer be liable for any service charge for that check and any costs to mail
the written demand.

NOTES: 
1.               
Judgment to be entered against only one
defendant?  Yes, Whitney Werner
 CCP §§ 579, 585(a) indicate that judgment may
be taken against one defendant in cases having more than one defendant unless
liability is joint only (e.g., possession of property).
2.               
In actions affecting title to or possession of
land, Court policy is that oral testimony is required. (CCP § 585(c).)  
 
RECOMMENDATION:    The Court should deny the default judgment
because the proof of service deficiencies noted in the November 15, 2023 Minute
Order have not been corrected.   
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Forwardline Financial LLC’s Request for Default
Judgment against Defendant Whitney Werner is DENIED.
