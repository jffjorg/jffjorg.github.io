And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's application for default judgment against the Defendants. The Plaintiff, Strategic Funding Source, Inc. dba Kapitus, filed a Complaint against the Defendants, Santa Monica Observer Newspaper, SNMC LLC, David Ganezer, and DOES 1 through 20, on May 26, 2022, alleging four causes of action for breach of contract. Defaults were entered against the Defendants on January 23, 2024, and the Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment on the same day. However, the Judge finds the application to be deficient due to lack of personal knowledge of the declarant and the failure to specify that the judgment would be imposed jointly and severally against the Defendants. The Judge has denied the application without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiff may re-file the application with the necessary documentation.
