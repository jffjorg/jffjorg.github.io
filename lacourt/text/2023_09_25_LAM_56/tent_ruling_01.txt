MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least five court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of a commercial landlord/tenant relationship.  The first amended complaint alleges: (1)
breach of lease.  
 
 
 
After
this matter went to trial, a judgment (the “Judgment”) was entered in
Plaintiff’s favor on June 20, 2023.  On June
27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney’s fees (the “Motion”).  The Motion seeks attorney’s fees in the
amount of $13,082.50.
            
DISCUSSION
Under
CCP section 1033.5, reasonable attorney’s fees may be awarded to a prevailing
party where they are authorized by a contract, statute, or law.  (CCP § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  Unless authorized by either statute or
agreement, attorney’s fees ordinarily are not recoverable as costs.  (Reynolds
Metals Co. v. Alperson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 124, 128.)  Civil Code section 1717 provides: in any
action on a contract, where such contract specifically provides that attorney’s
fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce the provisions of such contract,
shall be awarded to one of the parties, the prevailing party, whether he is the
party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to costs and necessary disbursements.  (Civ.
Code § 1717, subd. (a).)  
 
The lease agreement includes a provision that
states: “In the event of any action or proceeding brought by either party
against the other under this Lease, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover for the fees of its attorneys in such action or proceeding, including
costs of appeal, if any, in such amount as the court may adjudge reasonable as
attorneys' fees.” (Declaration of Ernie Zachary Park ¶ 2, Exhibit 1 at p. 38.)
 
 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated its
entitlement to attorney’s fees.  For this
reason and because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at

and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar. 
 
  Dated
this 25th day of September 2023
