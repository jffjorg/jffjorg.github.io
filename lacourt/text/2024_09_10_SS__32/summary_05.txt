Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the parties' positions and has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to advance the hearing date for the Defendant's motion for summary judgment and the motion to continue the trial date. The Defendant has requested that the hearing date be advanced to at least 30 days before the current trial date, or to continue the trial date to at least May 22, 2025. The Plaintiffs have opposed the motion, arguing that the Defendant's new summary judgment motion is based on Kristie Hall's declaration, who the Plaintiffs are trying to depose.

The Court has found good cause to continue the trial date, as the Defendant has filed a timely summary judgment motion and the Plaintiffs do not oppose a continuance. The Court has granted the motion to continue the trial date, setting the new trial date to May 22, 2025. The Court has also continued the Final Status Conference to May 8, 2025.

The Court's decision is based on the legal standards set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, which provides that continuances are granted only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring a continuance. The Court has considered the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a continuance.
