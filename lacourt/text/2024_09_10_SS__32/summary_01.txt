Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by the Defendant State of California. The Plaintiff, Oscar Sanchez, alleges that on May 12, 2020, he was electrocuted by downed power wires on the premises owned, maintained, and controlled by the City of Los Angeles and/or Southern California Edison. The Defendant argues that it did not own or control the area where the incident occurred and therefore has no liability.

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the Defendant has met its burden of establishing that it did not own or control the area where the Plaintiff was injured. Since the Plaintiff does not oppose this motion, he fails to meet his burden. The Judge concludes that the State of California's motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
