Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Trap Karaoke, LLC's unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement. The settlement is for $1,000,000, with each side bearing their own costs and fees. The judge finds that the settlement is reasonable based on the Tech-Bilt factors, including the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, and the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. The judge also finds that the settlement is below the policy limit and that there was no collusion in reaching the settlement. Therefore, the judge grants the motion and orders that Defendant provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
