Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motions to deem admitted Requests for Admission, Set One, and to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production, Set One. The Plaintiff, Jameelah Budhan, failed to respond to the discovery requests, which were served on November 29, 2023. As a result, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has waived any objections to the discovery requests and grants the motions.

The Court also awards monetary sanctions to the Defendant in the amount of $1,125, which represents 1.5 hours of attorney time to file and appear at the hearing. The Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days.

The Court notes that the Defendant's request for $750 in monetary sanctions for each of the three motions is excessive and reduces the amount to $1,125. The Defendant is also ordered to provide notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service of such.
