Summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for relief from judgment. The plaintiff, Teresa Williams, had filed a complaint against defendants Orbit International, Inc. and Pedro Corona for negligence due to a motor vehicle accident. The complaint was initially represented by counsel, but the plaintiff later substituted her own attorney. The plaintiff failed to appear at trial, and the court subsequently dismissed the complaint. The plaintiff then filed a motion for relief from judgment, arguing that she was delayed due to unforeseen complications related to her disability. The court finds that the plaintiff has not met the requirements for a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, and that she has not shown excusable neglect under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion for relief from judgment.
