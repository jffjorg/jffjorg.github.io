And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to consolidate two cases, 22STCV32014 and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Case No. 23STLC07359). The motion was unopposed and the cases are deemed related, pending in Department 32. The court denied the motion because the limited case was not reclassified as an unlimited case and the reclassification fee was not paid, as required by LASC Local Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(3). The court considered the timeliness of the motion, complexity, and prejudice, but ultimately denied the motion based on the lack of reclassification.
