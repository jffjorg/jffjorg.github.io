Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling grants Sully-Miller's motion for leave to amend its cross-complaint to add City of Huntington Park as a cross-defendant. The motion was opposed by City, which argued that the amendment was prejudicial due to the delay. However, the Judge found that City failed to demonstrate prejudice and that the amendment will not delay the trial. The Judge also noted that City had already filed a cross-complaint against Sully-Miller and had participated in the litigation.
