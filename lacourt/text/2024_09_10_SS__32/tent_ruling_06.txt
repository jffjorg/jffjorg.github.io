CASE NUMBER:


22STCV27941




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Determination of Good Faith Settlement




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Trap Karaoke, LLC 




OPPOSING PARTY:


None
  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On August 26, 2022, Plaintiff Myron Mackey (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants The Belasco, Belasco Theatre Entertainment, Inc.,
Live Nation Worldwide, Inc., Trap Karaoke, LLC, and Does 1 to 50 for alleged
injuries after falling off a stage. 
 
Defendant Trap Karaoke, LLC (“Defendant”) now moves for a
determination that the settlement with Plaintiff was entered in good faith. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Under section 877.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, “[a] determination by
the court that [a] settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint
tortfeasor . . . from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor .
. . for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative
indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 877.6 (c).) Any party to an action may move for an order
determining whether a settlement between the plaintiff and one or more alleged
tortfeasors or co-obligors was made in good faith. (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6,
subd. (a)(1).) “The party asserting the lack of good faith shall have the burden of
proof on that issue.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (d).) 
 
Section 877.6 requires “that the courts review [settlement] agreements
made under its aegis to insure that the settlements appropriately balance the .
. . statute’s dual objectives” (i.e., providing an “equitable sharing of costs
among the parties at fault” and encouraging parties to resolve their disputes
by way of settlement.) (Tech-Bilt, Inc. v.
Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 494 (hereafter, Tech-Bilt).) In
Tech-Bilt, the court set forth the factors to consider when determining
whether a settlement is made in good faith. The Tech-Bilt factors are:
(1) a rough approximation of plaintiff’s total recovery and the settlor’s
proportionate liability; (2) the amount paid in settlement; (3) the allocation
of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs; (4) a recognition that a settlor
should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a
trial; (5) the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling
defendants; and (6) the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct
aimed to injure the interests of the non-settling defendants. (Tech-Bilt,
supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 498-501.) Not every factor will apply in every case.
(Dole Food Co., Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Shell Oil Co.) (2015) 242
Cal.4th 894, 909.) 
 
“The party asserting the lack of good faith . . . [is] permitted to
demonstrate, if he can, that the settlement is so far ‘out of the ballpark’ in
relation to [the above] factors as to be inconsistent with the equitable
objectives of [Section 877.6]. Such a demonstration would establish that the
proposed settlement was not a ‘settlement made in good faith’ within the terms
of section 877.6.” (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at pp. 499–500.)
 
An
unopposed motion for determination of good faith of settlement need not contain
a full and complete discussion of the Tech-Bilt factors by declaration
or affidavit; rather, a bare bones motion setting forth the grounds of good
faith and a declaration containing a brief background of the case is
sufficient.  (City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192
Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261.)   
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant has agreed to settle with Plaintiff for $1,000,000, with
each side bearing their own costs and fees. This is a negligence and premises
liability case that results from injuries after Plaintiff fell off a stage
while attending a karaoke event at the Belasco Theatre in Los Angeles. Co-defendant
Live Nation owned and set up the stage. (Redfield Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
Defendant sets forth that Plaintiff alleges $104,711.60 in past
medical specials, and $2,674,678 in future medical expenses. (Redfield Decl. ¶
8.) However, Defendant notes that liability is disputed, given that Plaintiff
was told not to move once he stepped onto the stage and was informed that the
stage ended. (Id. ¶ 6.) Additionally, Defendant asserts that all
participants to the subject event accepted a waiver of liability upon
purchasing tickets. (Id. ¶ 7.) The settlement represents Defendant’s
policy limit, which it asserts is below what it would actually be liable for,
given the facts above. (Id. ¶ 13.) Defendant also asserts there was no
collusion in reaching this settlement. (Id. ¶ 14.) 
 
Based on this information, Defendant has sufficiently set forth the Tech-Bilt
factors. Accordingly, the motion is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the motion for determination of good faith settlement is GRANTED.

 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
