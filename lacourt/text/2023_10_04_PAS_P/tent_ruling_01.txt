[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING MOTION BY WESTERN SURETY FOR DISMISSAL AND DISCHARGE UPON

          I.
       INTRODUCTION
          The Blank Family Trust owns two small apartment buildings
in Glendale. This litigation concerns the Trust’s allegations against parties
who were hired to effect repairs to the buildings. 
          Western Surety Company is a named defendant in the 6th
cause of action for payment on bond. Western filed a cross-complaint against
all persons with potential claims against the bond it furnished to Defendant
Mid Construction Group: the trustees, Levi Nagel, Lauren Nagel, Scott Mund, and
Debra Mund. Western now seeks an order permitting it to deposit the disputed funds
with the Court, less fees and costs; and for an order dismissing it from the
action. This relief is provided for by statute, and the motion is therefore
granted. 
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. §386.5 provides:
          “Where the only relief sought against one of the defendants
is the payment of a stated amount of money alleged to be wrongfully withheld,
such defendant may, upon affidavit that he is a mere stakeholder with no
interest in the amount or any portion thereof and that conflicting demands have
been made upon him for the amount by parties to the action, upon notice to such
parties, apply to the court for an order discharging him from liability and
dismissing him from the action on his depositing with the clerk of the court
the amount in dispute and the court may, in its discretion, make such order.”
          Code Civ. Proc. §386.6 provides that the interpleader may
request costs and reasonable fees incurred; and that in ordering the discharge
of such party, the court in its discretion may award costs and reasonable
attorney fees from the amount in dispute which has been deposited with the
court. 
 
III.     DISCUSSION
          Western Surety, having been sued on
the bond it provided and having presented sufficient evidence that the claims
against it exceed the amount of the bond, is entitled to the relief requested. Western
Surety presents evidence of the fees and costs it has thus far incurred.
Declaration of Carlos Sosa, ¶6 (costs of $800 and fees pursuant to attached
billing statements). Western Surety requests $1,800 combined for fees and
costs, though its fees to date exceed that amount. 
          From the $15,000 amount of the bond,
$1,800 for fees and costs will be allowed. Upon the deposit of the balance of $13,200,
an order dismissing Western Surety and discharging it from liability will be
issued. 
 
IV.     ORDER
          The motion is granted. Western Surety is ordered to deposit
$13,200 with the court forthwith. An OSC regarding deposit and Western Surety’s
dismissal and discharge is set for ________________________. 
          Western Surety is ordered to provide notice.
