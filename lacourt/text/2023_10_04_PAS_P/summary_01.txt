The tentative ruling is a summary of a judge's thinking based on information presented to the judge before today. In this case, the Blank Family Trust owns two small apartment buildings in Glendale, and this litigation concerns the Trust's allegations against parties who were hired to effect repairs to the buildings. Western Surety Company is a named defendant in the 6th cause of action for payment on bond. Western Surety filed a cross-complaint against all persons with potential claims against the bond it furnished to Defendant Mid Construction Group. Western Surety now seeks an order permitting it to deposit the disputed funds with the Court, less fees and costs, and for an order dismissing it from the action. The judge grants the relief requested by Western Surety as it is entitled to it under the statute. Western Surety is ordered to deposit $13,200 with the court forthwith, and an OSC regarding deposit and Western Surety's dismissal and discharge is set for a future date.
