[1] This applies to all three causes
of action, not just breach of contract, because the policy states that “no
action” may be brought outside one year. The policy does not restrict the
limitations period to claims on the policy itself. Furthermore, where “the
essence of [a] claim[] is an attempt to recover ‘[d]amages for failure to
provide benefits under subject contract of insurance,’” the “claim is
‘fundamentally a claim on the policy and is thus time barred’” under the limitations
period stated in the policy. (Magnolia Square Homeowners Ass'n v. Safeco
Ins. Co. (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1049, 1063, quoting Lawrence v. Western
Mutual Ins. Co. (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 565, 575.)
