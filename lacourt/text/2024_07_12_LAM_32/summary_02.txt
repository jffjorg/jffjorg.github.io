And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary judgment motion filed by Hippo Insurance Services and Spinnaker Insurance Company against Boghos Tovmassian and Marguerite Tovmassian, the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs had filed an action alleging breach of insurance contract, breach of implied covenant, and elder abuse. The Defendants argued that they were not liable for these claims.

The ruling holds that Hippo Insurance Services is not liable for breach of contract or breach of implied covenant because it was not a party to the policy with the Plaintiffs. Similarly, Spinnaker Insurance Company is not liable for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant, or elder abuse because the claims are time-barred. The court also found that Spinnaker did not breach the insurance policy because it paid the Plaintiffs for the covered portions of the damage.

The ruling concludes that the motion for summary judgment filed by the Defendants is granted, and the case will be dismissed without the need for trial.
