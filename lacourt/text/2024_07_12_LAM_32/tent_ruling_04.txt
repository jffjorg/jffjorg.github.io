 Case Number:  24STCV04100    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  32      JUSTIN SMITH,                         Plaintiff,             v.   ALLA ZORIKOVA, et al.,                          Defendants.           Case No.:  24STCV04100   Hearing Date:  July 12, 2024        [TENTATIVE]    order RE: defendant alla zorikova’s demurrer to    complaint               BACKGROUND             On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff  Justin Smith filed this action against Defendants Alla Zorikova, Olivia Jeong,  and Joycelyn Yew. The complaint asserts causes of action for (1) violation of  the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), (2) violation of the Unfair Competition  Law (UCL), and (3) fraud.              Plaintiff alleges that Defendants  run an illegal dog breeding operation and operate out of Defendant Lew’s home  in Los Angeles. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants falsely advertise their dogs  as healthy, trained, and top quality. Plaintiff allegedly purchased a puppy  from Defendants that turned out to be sick, dirty, and not properly socialized.  Plaintiff allegedly contacted Defendant Zorikova for a refund, and Defendant  Zorkova allegedly refused, instead instructing Plaintiff to sell the dog to  another buyer himself.              On June 20, 2024, Defendant Zorikova  filed the instant demurrer to the complaint. Plaintiff has not filed an  opposition.     DISCUSSION             “Proof of electronic service shall  include all of the following: (1) The electronic service address and the  residence or business address of the person making the electronic service. (2) The date of electronic service. (3) The name and electronic service  address of the person served. (4) A statement that the document was  served electronically.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 1013b(b).)              The proof of service accompanying  Defendant’s demurrer does not include the electronic service address of the  person making the electronic service, i.e., Defendant Zorikova. (See  Code Civ. Proc., § 1013b(b)(1).) Furthermore, the proof of service is ambiguous  as to whether the documents were served by mail or email. The proof attests  that the documents were “served on counsel for all parties who have appeared in  this action as follows, on 06/18/2024 via email,” but simultaneously states  that documents were “SENT VIA U.S. MAIL/EMAIL.” If the documents were mailed,  it would be improper for Defendant Zorikova to execute the service because she  is a party to the action. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1013a(a) [person executing  mail service must be “over the age of 18 years and not a party to the  cause”].)             The demurrer is overruled for lack  of proper service.  CONCLUSION             Defendant Alla Zorikova’s demurrer  is OVERRULED.

  order RE:
defendant alla zorikova’s motion to
  quash service of summons 




 


 




BACKGROUND

            On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff
Justin Smith filed this action against Defendants Alla Zorikova, Olivia Jeong,
and Joycelyn Yew. The complaint asserts causes of action for (1) violation of
the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), (2) violation of the Unfair Competition
Law (UCL), and (3) fraud. 

            Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
run an illegal dog breeding operation and operate out of Defendant Lew’s home
in Los Angeles. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants falsely advertise their dogs
as healthy, trained, and top quality. Plaintiff allegedly purchased a puppy
from Defendants that turned out to be sick, dirty, and not properly socialized.
Plaintiff allegedly contacted Defendant Zorikova for a refund, and Defendant
Zorkova allegedly refused, instead instructing Plaintiff to sell the dog to
another buyer himself. 

            On June 21, 2024, Defendant Zorikova
filed the instant motion to quash based on defective service of the summons and
complaint. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 

 

LEGAL STANDARD

“[T]he court in which an action is pending
has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as
provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10).” (Code Civ. Proc, §
410.50(a).) “[A] court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of
process or by that party's general appearance.” (In re Jennifer O.
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 539, 547.) Actual notice of a lawsuit is not a
substitute for proper service of process. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 1199, 1206.) A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to
quash service of summons on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) 

DISCUSSION

            Even without proper service, a
defendant who makes a general appearance submits to the jurisdiction of the
court and waives any challenge to personal jurisdiction. (See In re Jennifer
O., supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 547; ViaView, Inc. v. Retzlaff
(2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 198, 210.)

Code of Civil Procedure section 1014 lists
the acts which constitute a general appearance. (Air Machine Com SRL v.
Superior Court (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 414, 425; Humphrey v. Bewley
(2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 571, 580.) Section 1014 provides as follows: “A defendant
appears in an action when the defendant answers, demurs, files a
notice of motion to strike, files a notice of motion to transfer pursuant to
Section 396b, moves for reclassification pursuant to Section 403.040, gives the
plaintiff written notice of appearance, or when an attorney gives notice of
appearance for the defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1014.)          

            Defendant Zorikova filed a demurrer
on June 20, 2024, thus making a general appearance and consenting to the
Court’s jurisdiction. As a result, the motion to quash is moot. 

CONCLUSION

            Defendant Alla Zorikova’s motion to
quash service of summons is DENIED.
