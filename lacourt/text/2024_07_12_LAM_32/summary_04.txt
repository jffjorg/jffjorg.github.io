```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendant Alla Zorikova and the motion to quash service of summons. The court has found that the demurrer was filed without proper service of the summons and complaint, as the proof of service does not include the electronic service address of the person making the service. The court has therefore overruled the demurrer.

The court has also denied defendant Zorikova's motion to quash service of summons, as defendant Zorikova has made a general appearance by filing a demurrer, which waives any challenge to personal jurisdiction. The court has found that defendant Zorikova's motion to quash is moot as a result of her general appearance.
