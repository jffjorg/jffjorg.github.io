     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion for summary judgment




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 5, 2023, Plaintiffs Boghos
Tovmassian and Marguerite Tovmassian filed this action against Defendants Hippo
Insurance Services (Hippo), Spinnaker Insurance Company (Spinnaker), and
Patrick Hix, alleging (1) breach of insurance contract, (2) breach of the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (3) elder abuse. 
            According to the complaint,
Plaintiffs own a home located in Tujunga, California (the Property). (Compl. ¶
1.) The Property was insured by a homeowners insurance policy issued by Hippo,
which is owned and underwritten by Spinnaker. (Ibid.) In December 2021,
the Property suffered wind and water intrusion, leading Plaintiffs to make a
claim. (Ibid.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to conduct a
full and fair investigation, which resulted in an insufficient payout. (Id.,
¶ 3.)
            On April 25, 2024, Hippo and
Spinnaker filed the instant motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs have not
filed an opposition. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
DISCUSSION
I. Hippo’s
Liability
            a. Plaintiffs Had No Contract
with Hippo
            To
establish breach of contract, a plaintiff must show: (1) the contract existed,
(2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance,
(3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff. (Richman
v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) A plaintiff “cannot assert a
claim for breach of contract against one who is not a party to the contract.” (Tri-Continent
Internat. Corp. v. Paris Savings & Loan Assn. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th
1354, 1359.) 
            It
is undisputed that the policy was issued by Spinnaker, with Hippo as the
program administrator. (Def.’s Undisputed Facts (UF) 1; Carden Decl., Ex. A.)
The policy was signed by Spinnaker’s CEO. (Ibid.) Therefore, Hippo has
satisfied its initial burden by showing that it was not a party to the policy
with Plaintiffs. This is sufficient to shift the burden to Plaintiffs, who do
not oppose the motion or present any contrary evidence. Accordingly, Hippo is
not liable for breach of contract as a matter of law. 
            b. Hippo Cannot be Liable for the Implied
Covenant
            “The covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, implied by law in every contract, exists merely to
prevent one contracting party from unfairly frustrating the other party’s right
to receive the benefits of the agreement actually made.” (Guz v. Bechtel
National, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 349-50.) “In the absence of a
contractual relationship, no implied covenant claims may be stated.” (Gulf
Ins. Co. v. TIG Ins. Co. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 422, 430.)
            As discussed above, Hippo has
established that it had no contractual relationship with Plaintiffs.
Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot maintain an implied covenant claim against
Hippo. 
            
 
c. Hippo Cannot be Liable for Elder Abuse
“Financial
abuse” of an elder or dependent adult occurs when a person or entity does any
of the following: takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or
personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with
intent to defraud, or both. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30.) 
Hippo could not
have wrongfully retained Plaintiffs’ property (i.e., the insurance
proceeds) if it was not a party to the policy and did not have any obligation
to pay Plaintiffs. Therefore, the elder abuse claim fails as a matter of
law.   
II. Spinnaker’s
Liability 
            a. The Claims are Time-Barred
            “Under
California law parties may agree to a provision shortening the statute of
limitations, ‘qualified, however, by the requirement that the period fixed is
not in itself unreasonable or is not so unreasonable as to show imposition or
undue advantage.’” (William L. Lyon & Associates, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1307, quoting Capehart v. Heady (1962) 206
Cal.App.2d 386, 388.) “[A] covenant shortening the period of limitations is a
valid provision of an insurance contract and cannot be ignored with impunity as
long as the limitation is not so unreasonable as to show imposition or undue
advantage.” (Prudential-LMI Com. Ins. v. Superior Court (1990) 51 Cal.3d
674, 683.) “One year was not an unfair period of limitation.” (Ibid.;
see also Ins. Code, § 2071(a) [imposing one-year limitations period for fire
insurance claims].) 
“The statute of
limitations for actions on insurance claims is equitably tolled from the time
the insured notifies the insurer of the claim until coverage is denied.” (Marselis
v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 122, 124.) “The reason for the
tolling rule is to avoid penalizing the insured for the time consumed by the
insurer investigating the claim.” (Id. at p. 125.) The running of the
limitations period resumes upon the insurer’s denial of a claim, and no further
tolling occurs, even if the insurer reconsiders its denial. (Singh v.
Allstate Ins. Co. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 135, 142.)
Here, the
insurance policy provides that “[n]o action can be brought against us unless .
. . the action is started within one year after the date of loss.” (Carden
Decl., Ex. A.) The loss occurred on December 30, 2021. (Compl. ¶ 1.) Plaintiffs
reported the loss to Spinnaker on January 8, 2022. (Carden Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. B.)
Spinnaker issued notice of its coverage position on January 27, 2022, granting
coverage on certain items and denying the rest. (Id., ¶ 5, Ex. C.)
Plaintiffs did not file this action until May 5, 2023, well past the one-year
limitations period, even accounting for the tolling period between January 8,
2022 and January 27, 2022. Spinnaker’s reopening of the claim on May 17, 2022
based on Plaintiffs’ request for reconsideration (Carden Decl. ¶13) did not
further toll the limitations period. 
Therefore,
Spinnaker has met its initial burden by establishing that the claims are
time-barred.[1]
This is sufficient to shift the burden to Plaintiffs, who do not oppose the
motion or present any contrary evidence. Accordingly, Spinnaker is not liable
as a matter of law. 
b.
Spinnaker Did Not Breach the Policy
There can be no
“breach of the insurance policy . . . [where] the undisputed evidence
established that [the insurer] ‘paid all amounts due under the policy.’” (Janney
v. CSAA Ins. Exchange (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 374, 390.) 
Here, the policy
covered “direct physical loss to property.” (Carden Decl., Ex. A.) Spinnaker covered
damage to the first-floor flooring, the only part of the Property directly
damaged by the water intrusion. (Carden Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. F.) Spinnaker declined
to cover the undamaged stairs and second-floor flooring. (Ibid.)
Spinnaker issued payment for the covered portions. (Id., ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. C,
D.) 
Spinnaker has
met its initial burden by showing that it satisfied its obligations under the
policy. This is sufficient to shift the burden to Plaintiffs, who do not oppose
the motion or present any contrary evidence. Accordingly, Spinnaker is not
liable for breach of contract as a matter of law for this independent reason. 
c.
Spinnaker Could Not Have Breached the Implied Covenant
“[A] bad faith
claim cannot be maintained unless policy benefits are due.” (Love v. Fire
Ins. Exchange (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1153.) Spinnaker could not have
acted in bad faith if it correctly denied policy coverage. Furthermore, as
discussed above, the claim is time-barred. Therefore, the implied covenant
claim fails as a matter of law.
d.
Spinnaker Could Not Have Committed Elder Abuse
Likewise,
Spinnaker could not have wrongfully retained insurance benefits if it correctly
denied them, and the claim is time-barred in any case. Therefore, the elder
abuse claim fails as a matter of law. 
CONCLUSION
            The
motion for summary judgment filed by Hippo and Spinnaker is GRANTED.
