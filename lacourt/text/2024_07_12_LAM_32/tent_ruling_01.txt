  Case No.:  21STCV16002
  Hearing Date:  July 12, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to tax costs 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 28, 2021, Plaintiffs Ignite
International, Ltd. and Ignite International Brands, Ltd. filed this action for
breach of contract against Defendant 10979 Chalon, LLC. Plaintiffs sued to
recover amounts due under a settlement agreement between the parties. 
            On January 9, 2023, Defendant made a
section 998 offer to pay $2.5 million secured by a deed of trust. Plaintiffs
rejected the offer. After a bench trial from March 5 to 7, 2024, the Court
found for Plaintiffs. On April 11, 2024, the Court granted judgment for
Plaintiffs in the amount of $2.5 million. 

            On April 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a Memorandum of Costs (MOC) totaling $35,103.84. 
            On May 8, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant motion to tax costs. Plaintiffs filed their opposition on June 26,
2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
            Code of Civil Procedure section 1032
“establishes this general rule: ‘Except as otherwise expressly provided by
statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs
in any action or proceeding.’” (Scott Co. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20
Cal.4th 1103, 1112, quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 1032(b).) Section 1033.5 specifies
the items allowable as costs under section 1032. (Id. at p. 1108.) One
such allowable cost is attorney’s fees, when authorized by statute, contract,
or law. (Ibid.) 
“Section 998 modifies the general rule of
section 1032 that only the prevailing party recovers its costs.” (Scott,
supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 1112.) Specifically, section 998 provides that “[i]f
an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain
a more favorable judgment or award, the plaintiff shall not recover his or her
postoffer costs and shall pay the defendant’s costs from the time of the offer.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 998(c)(1).) However, “[a] plaintiff who rejects a
settlement offer that is greater than the recovery it ultimately obtains may
nonetheless recover its preoffer costs to which it would otherwise be entitled,
including preoffer attorney fees.” (Scott, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 1112.)

DISCUSSION
On January 9, 2023, Defendant tendered the
following offer under section 998:
 
“In exchange for .
. . dismissal of the Complaint in this action with prejudice, Defendant 10979
Chalon, LLC will execute and deliver to Plaintiffs a Promissory Note and second
Deed of Trust for $2,500,000, at 3.5% interest, the terms of which will require
repayment on the sale of the property, and Defendant 10979 Chalon, LLC will
also pay Plaintiffs the total sum to ten dollars ($10.00), and each party shall
bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.”   

(Berokim
Decl., Ex. 2.) Plaintiffs did not accept this offer. (Id., ¶ 10.) At
trial, Plaintiffs recovered $2.5 million. (Id., Ex. 3.)           
Defendant argues that the offer provided
for $2.5 million secured by a deed of trust, which made it more favorable than
the trial award of $2.5 million unsecured. Plaintiffs argue that because the
offer did not provide for $2.5 million until the property at issue was sold at
some unspecified time, the offer was speculative and not more favorable than an
enforceable money judgment of $2.5 million. 
“An offer to compromise under Code of
Civil Procedure section 998 must be sufficiently specific to allow the
recipient to evaluate the worth of the offer and make a reasoned decision
whether to accept the offer.” (Fassberg Construction Co. v. Housing
Authority of City of Los Angeles (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 720, 764.) “Any
nonmonetary terms or conditions must be sufficiently certain and capable of
valuation to allow the court to determine whether the judgment is more
favorable than the offer.” (Ibid.) Additionally, “the offer must be
unconditional to be enforceable.” (Elite Show Services, Inc. v. Staffpro,
Inc. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 263, 268.) 
Here, Defendant’s offer was not certain
nor unconditional. Instead of making an unequivocal offer to pay $2.5 million,
Defendant conditioned Plaintiffs’ receipt of $2.5 million on sale of the
property at issue. Plaintiffs would not have been able to reasonably evaluate
the value of this offer because it is unclear from the terms of the offer when,
if at all, Defendant would be required to sell the property. For this reason,
it is also unclear how the offer could be more favorable than a cash judgment
of $2.5 million. Because Defendant’s settlement offer was insufficiently
certain for Plaintiffs to evaluate its worth or for the Court to determine its
value compared to the judgment, the offer was invalid and does not serve to cut
off Plaintiffs’ costs.       
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to tax costs is DENIED.
