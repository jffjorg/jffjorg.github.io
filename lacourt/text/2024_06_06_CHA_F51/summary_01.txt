And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling denies the Defendants' motion to strike references to punitive damages from Plaintiffs' complaint. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a basis for punitive damages against Defendants based on malice or oppression. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that they have sufficiently alleged that Defendants ratified/approved the allegedly wrongful conduct of their agents and/or employees. The Court denies the motions to strike and orders Defendants to file and serve their answers to Plaintiffs' complaint within 30 days.
