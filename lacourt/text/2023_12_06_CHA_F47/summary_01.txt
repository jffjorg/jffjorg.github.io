And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the Defendant, Janet Schori, M.D., filed a demurrer to the entire complaint. The Plaintiffs, William Angulo, Michellyn Russel, and Joseph Angulo, filed an action against Defendant Schori for professional/medical negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The Judge has overruled the demurrer to the 1st cause of action for professional/medical negligence, but sustained the demurrer to the 2nd cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress with 30 days leave to amend. The Judge found that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress as a bystander, as it does not specify what negligent act was committed by Defendant Schori that the Plaintiffs viewed at the time of and during the birth of William, and how they knew it was causing injury to William. The Judge has given the Plaintiffs the opportunity to try to cure the defects in their 2nd cause of action.
