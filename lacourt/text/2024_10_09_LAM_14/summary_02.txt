And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Michael A. Shorter's motion for a 60-day extension of time for unspecified proceedings. Michael Shorter claimed that he has health problems, including a growth on his adrenal gland, fatigue, and heart palpitations, and that he needs a biopsy. However, the Judge found that Michael Shorter failed to provide evidence that his medical condition would prevent him from appearing for trial on October 21, 2024, and therefore did not find good cause to continue trial. The motion is denied.
