And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Grant Golding's motion to stay the dissolution proceedings of AIRS LLC, without prejudice. The parties are ordered to meet and confer on the fair market value of Plaintiff Taylor Winslow's share of AIRS LLC. The judge notes that Golding is entitled to buy out Winslow's interest in AIRS LLC, but the parties have not attempted to determine the fair market value of Winslow's ownership interest. The judge requires the parties to make an attempt to determine the fair market value on their own before seeking a judicial decree fixing the amount.
