And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings filed by the Defendants, Ben-O, Inc., John Y. Oh, and Vicky Oh. The motion was denied. The case arises from the employment of Plaintiff, Samuel Lee, as a sushi chef by Defendant Ben-O, Inc. The Plaintiff alleges that he participated in tip pooling and that Defendant John Y. Oh distributed a portion of the pooled tips to Defendant Vicky Oh, but these tips were designated as being for an individual who did not work in the restaurant. The Plaintiff claims that he had a right to possession of his share of the pooled tips and that the Defendants converted a portion of his property. The Judge ruled that the pleading sufficiently alleges that the Plaintiff had a right to possession of his share of the pooled tips, and that whether the Defendants actually diverted part of that share to a non-employee is a question of fact that is not properly determined on a demurrer. The Judge denied the motion, stating that the case requires a fact-based inquiry rather than a legal determination.
