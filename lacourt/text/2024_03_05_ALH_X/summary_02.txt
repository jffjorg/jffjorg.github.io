And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Dave Barela, filed a motion to compel further responses to his requests for production of documents from the defendants, Jie Wang and Kiko Jia Liu. The defendants had previously served deficient responses to the requests. The plaintiff filed the motion on November 27, 2023, but did not serve the notice of motion until two days after the 45-day deadline. The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is untimely and denies the motion to compel further responses. The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to provide written agreement to extend the deadline and did not file a reply to the opposition. The motion is DENIED.
