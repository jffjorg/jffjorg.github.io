And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge Joel L. Lofton denies the Plaintiff's motions to compel the deposition testimony of Defendants' PMQs and to compel the production of documents. The court finds that the parties are in the best position to resolve the outstanding discovery issues and that the discovery disputes may still be unresolved, but it does not appear that Defendants' counsel are intentionally withholding information or failing to engage in a good faith effort to find responsive documents or witnesses. The court notes that the parties have engaged in efforts to resolve the pending discovery issue but seemed to have reached an impasse regarding the remaining categories and witnesses. The court concludes that the parties should continue to discuss and attempt to resolve the outstanding issues rather than seeking judicial intervention.
