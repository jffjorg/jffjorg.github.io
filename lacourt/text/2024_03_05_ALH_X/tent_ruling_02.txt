RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order
compelling Defendants to provide further responses to his requests for
production. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Dave
Barela’s claim that Defendant Jie Wang owes an outstanding debt. Plaintiff
filed this complaint on January 3, 2023. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s
motions to compel further responses to his requests for the production of
documents are DENIED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling a
response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2030.290, subd. (b).)
The same applies to a party that fails to respond to a request for document
production. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.300, subd. (b).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling further responses to his requests for the
production of documents. Plaintiff provides he served his requests for the
production of documents on “April 4, 2008”. (Barela Decl. ¶ 2.) However, it appears that requests for production of
documents were served on August 7, 2023. (Id. ¶ 2, Exhibit A.) Plaintiff
provides that Defendant served deficient responses on October 6, 2023. (Id. ¶
3, Exhibit B.) Plaintiff filed this motion on November 27, 2023, and served the
motion and notice of motion on November 22, 2023. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310, subdivision (c), “[u]nless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party
and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any
right to compel a further response to the demand.” 
            
Because the responses were served
October 6, 2023, the deadline to file the instant motion was November 20, 2023.
Plaintiff did not serve the notice of motion until 2 days after the 45-day
window. Plaintiff also does not provide that the parties agreed in writing to
extend the deadline. Plaintiff’s motions are untimely. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
motions to compel further responses to his requests for the production of
documents are DENIED.

Party to provide notice
