**Disputes:**

* **Subpoena Compliance:** Petitioners sought the production of forensically sound evidence drives containing information from Konnech, Inc. LADA objected, claiming privilege.

**Judge's Ruling:**

* The judge granted Petitioners' motion to compel LADA's compliance with the subpoena. 
* LADA is required to produce the requested documents within 30 days.

**Legal Basis:**

* California Code of Civil Procedure §2025.480(a) governs motions to compel discovery.
* Evidence Code §1040 outlines the privilege of public entities to refuse disclosure of official information.

**Key Arguments:**

* **Petitioners:** The requested information is directly relevant to an out-of-state case and cannot be obtained through less intrusive means. LADA failed to demonstrate that the items are privileged. 
* **LADA:** The information is privileged under Evidence Code §1040 because it constitutes "official information" acquired in confidence. Disclosure would be against the public interest.

**Judge's Reasoning:**

* The judge found that LADA failed to demonstrate that the information was acquired in confidence.
* The judge also found that LADA failed to show that disclosure would be against the public interest.


**Summary:**

The judge ruled in favor of the Petitioners, compelling LADA to produce evidence related to Konnech, Inc. The judge found that LADA's claims of privilege were unsupported and that the public interest did not outweigh the need for disclosure.
