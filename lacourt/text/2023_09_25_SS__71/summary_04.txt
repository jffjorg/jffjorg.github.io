And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petitioners' motion to compel compliance with their subpoena duces tecum, served on the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office (LADA) on March 14, 2023. The subpoena requests the production and inspection of forensically sound evidence drives containing information from Konnech, Inc. LADA objected to the subpoena, claiming that the requested documents are privileged under California Evidence Code §1040. However, the judge found that LADA failed to demonstrate that the requested documents are privileged and that the privilege prescribed by Evidence Code §1040 is not absolute. The judge also found that LADA has not made a showing that disclosure of the requested documents would be against the public interest. Therefore, the judge granted the petitioners' motion and ordered LADA to produce the requested documents within 30 days of the ruling.
