The judge finds that LADA has failed to demonstrate that the items requested are privileged under Evidence Code §1040. The judge also notes that even if LADA were to show that the items were "acquired in confidence" and so constitute "official information," the privilege prescribed by Evidence Code §1040 is not absolute and may only be invoked if disclosure would be "against the public interest." As LADA has made no such showing, the judge grants the petitioners' motion and orders LADA to produce the requested items within 30 days of the ruling.
