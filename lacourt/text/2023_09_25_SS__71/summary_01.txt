And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the petitioners' motion to compel the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office (LADA) to produce and permit inspection and copying of forensically sound evidence drives containing information from Konnech, Inc. The petitioners, Dr. Paul C. Broun, Sheri Gilligan, and VoterGA, served LADA with a subpoena duces tecum on March 14, 2023, requesting information from Konnech, Inc. related to an out-of-state case. LADA refused to produce the requested documents, claiming privilege under Evidence Code §1040. However, the judge finds that LADA failed to demonstrate that the items requested are privileged and that the privilege claim is not absolute. The judge grants the petitioners' motion and orders LADA to produce the items responsive to their request within 30 days of the ruling.
