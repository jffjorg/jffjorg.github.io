And the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling is:

The defendant, Karakashian, moves for leave to take a subsequent deposition of the plaintiff, Ryder, citing good cause due to the court reporter's inability to complete the deposition and lack of time to inquire about Ryder's loss of earnings claim and prior and subsequent incidents. However, the Judge rules that the motion is untimely, as it was filed five months after the completion of the deposition transcript, and that Karakashian failed to establish good cause for a second deposition. The Judge notes that Karakashian did not explain why, in five hours, they were unable to inquire about the loss of earnings claim and other incidents, and that the defendant's failure to provide portions of the transcript where Ryder allegedly failed to answer questions is not sufficient to demonstrate good cause. The motion is therefore denied.
