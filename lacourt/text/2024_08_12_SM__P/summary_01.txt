And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Magdi Mekari, et al. v. Arman Agajanyan, et al. (Case No. 19SMCV00818). The plaintiffs are seeking to amend the judgment to add LA Mattress Store Inc. as the alter ego of Los Angeles Mattress Plus, Inc. The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to amend the judgment, finding that there is no opposition to the motion.

The judge has also granted the plaintiffs' request for judicial notice of various documents, including the August 11, 2021 judgment, business search records, statements of information, and a webpage of LA Mattress Store Inc.

In order to determine whether LA Mattress Store Inc. is the alter ego of Los Angeles Mattress Plus, Inc., the judge will consider the evidence presented, including the business search records, statements of information, and the webpage of LA Mattress Store Inc. The judge notes that the principals, store locations, and operations of the two entities are the same, and that both entities share Arman Agajanyan as the chief executive officer. However, the judge finds that this does not conclusively prove that the entities are the same or alter egos of one another, as it does not establish a unity of interest between the entities or that an inequitable result would follow if the non-party alter ego were not added.

The judge will continue the matter for additional evidence, should the plaintiff request.
