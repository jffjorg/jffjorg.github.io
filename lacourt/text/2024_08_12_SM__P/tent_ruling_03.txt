Ryder v. Karakashian, Case No. 23SMCV03130 
Hearing date: August 12, 2024 
Defendant Karakashian’s Motion for Leave to Take Subsequent Deposition
 
Plaintiff Ryder sues defendant Karakashian for injuries sustained in a
motor vehicle accident. Karakashian’s counsel deposed Ryder on January 17, 2024
and now moves for leave to take a subsequent deposition. 
 
Code Civ. Proc. section 2025.610, which governs subsequent depositions,
provides “[o]nce any party has taken the deposition of any natural person,
including that of a party to the action, neither the party who gave, nor any
other party who has been served with a deposition notice pursuant to Section
2025.240 may take a subsequent deposition of that deponent.” Code Civ. Proc.
§2025.610(a). “Notwithstanding subdivision (a), for good cause shown, the court
may grant leave to take a subsequent deposition, and the parties, with the
consent of any deponent who is not a party, may stipulate that a subsequent
deposition be taken.” Id. §2025.610(b).   
 
Karakashian argues good
cause exists for a second deposition because the court reporter was unable to
complete the deposition, after 6 p.m. and could not obtain a different court
reporter that same day. Defense counsel argues there was insufficient time to
inquire about Ryder’s loss of earnings claim, prior and subsequent incidents.
Kandarian-Stein Decl. ¶8. 
Ryder argues the motion is
untimely. Code Civ. Proc. §2025.480(b) states a motion to compel further
production regarding a deposition "shall be made no later than 60 days
after the completion of the record of the deposition." Code Civ. Proc.
§2025.480(b); Weinstein v. Blumberg, (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th
316. 
The deposition was scheduled
for January 17, 2024 at 1:00 pm. Chacon Decl. Exh. A. It started at 1:13 pm and
lasted until around 6:13 pm. Kandarian-Stein Decl. ¶¶ 3-6; Chacon Decl. ¶3. The transcript was
completed on February 7, 2024. Chacon Decl. ¶6. The motion was filed July 9,
2024, five months later. The motion is untimely under Code Civ. Proc.
§2025.480. 
Per Code Civ. Proc.
§2025.290, a deposition is limited to seven hours, absent court order. Karakashian
does establish provide good cause for a subsequent deposition, as counsel failed
to explain why, in five hours’ time, she was unable to inquire about the loss
of earnings claim and other incidents. Defendant has not provided portions of
the transcript wherein plaintiff allegedly failed to answer, as required per Code
Civ. Proc. §2025.480(a), (h), but rather attaches the entire transcript, 121
pages. 
Defendant argues the
injuries claimed are significant, including TBI, and the LOE claim is $60,000.
The court agrees the issues about which defendant wishes to inquire are indeed
relevant, but defendant fails to explain why the deposition was scheduled in
the afternoon and why, in five hours and 121 pages of testimony, counsel did
not have time to inquire about the issues raised. Defendant, as moving party,
has the burden of proving good cause for a second deposition. DENIED.
