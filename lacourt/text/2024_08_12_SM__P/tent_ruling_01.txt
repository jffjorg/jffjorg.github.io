  Case Number:  19SMCV00818    Hearing Date:   August 12, 2024    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling
Magdi Mekari, et al. v. Arman Agajanyan, et al., Case No. 19SMCV00818  
Hearing date: August 12, 2024 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend Judgment (UNOPPOSED)
 
Plaintiffs leased commercial property to defendants on September 15,
2016, with the lease set to terminate September 30, 2021. Defendants failed to
pay rent from February 2018. On July 26, 2021 this court issued a ruling after
bench trial awarding plaintiffs $165,479 in back rent and $57,600 in damages.
Plaintiffs now move for an order determining that LA Mattress Store Inc. is the
alter ego of defendant Los Angeles Mattress Plus, Inc. under CCP § 187. No
opposition has been filed.
 
Mekari’s request for the court to take judicial notice of the August
11, 2021 judgment (Exh. 1) is granted under Evid. Code § 452(d) because it is a
court document. Mekari’s requests for the court to take judicial notice of 1)
the business search report of LA Mattress Store Inc.; 2) the business search
report for Los Angeles Mattress Plus, Inc.; 3) LA Mattress Store’s May 12, 2022
Statement of Information; and 4) Los Angeles Mattress Plus, Inc.’s November 30,
2022, Statement of Information (Exh. 2-5) are granted under Evid. Code § 452(c)
because they are documents of the Secretary of State. Mekari’s request for the
court to take judicial notice of LA Mattress Store Inc.’s webpage is granted
under Evid. Code § 452 (h) because it is a fact not reasonably subject to
dispute.  
 
Pursuant to CCP section
187, a trial court has jurisdiction to modify a judgment to add additional
judgment debtors. Section 187 grants every court the power to use all means to
carry its jurisdiction into effect, even if those processes are not set out in
the code. Section 187 states: “When jurisdiction is, by the Constitution or
this Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court or judicial officer,
all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also given; and in the
exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be not specifically
pointed out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process or mode of
proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of
this Code.” Code. Civ. Proc., § 187.
Utilizing section 187,
judgments are typically “amended to add additional judgment debtors on the
grounds that a person or entity is the alter ego of the original judgment
debtor. This is an equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is
not amending the judgment to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the
correct name of the real defendant. ‘Such a procedure is an appropriate and
complete method by which to bind new individual defendants where it can be
demonstrated that in their capacity as alter ego of the corporation they in
fact had control of the previous litigation, and thus were virtually
represented in the lawsuit.’” See NEC Electronics Inc. v. Hurt (1989)
208 Cal.App.3d 772, 778; see also Greenspan v. LADT, LLC (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 486, 508.
Plaintiffs argue LA
Mattress Store Inc. is the alter ego of Los Angeles Mattress Plus, Inc. because
the principals, store locations and operations of each entity are the same.
Both the business search records and statements of information show the
entities share Arman Agayanyan as the chief executive officer. Mekari’s
declaration states he is certain two of the store locations for LA Mattress
were also stores for Los Angeles Mattress Plus, and both entities shared the
same number. Mekari Decl. ¶4. 
This does not conclusively
prove the entities are the same, or alter egos of one another, because it does
not establish one company dominated the finances, policies, and practices of
the affiliated companies, which were conduits of the production company and had
no "mind, will, or existence" of their own. Toho-Towa Co., Ltd. v.
Morgan Creek Productions, Inc. (2013) 217 CA4th 1096, 1109. Plaintiffs have
not established a unity of interest between the entities or that an inequitable
result would follow if the nonparty alter ego were not added. 
The court will continue the
matter for additional evidence, should plaintiff request.
