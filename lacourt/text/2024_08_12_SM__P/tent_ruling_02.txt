Hearing date: August 12, 2024 
Plaintiff SM 10000 Property LLC’s Motion to Compel Responses to 1)
Special Interrogatories and 2) Request for Production; Request for Sanctions 
 
Landlord plaintiff SM 10000
Property alleges breach-of-contract against tenant defendant Johnson for failure
to pay rent. The court entered default on September 14, 2022. SM 10000 moves to
compel responses to special interrogatories and request for production as well
as $1,650 in sanctions. 
SM 10000 propounded
discovery on April 25, 2023, “asking for
Defendant’s financial assets, employment history, real property, income, etc.”
Ishu Decl. ¶4; Exh. 1. More than 30 days have lapsed without response. No opposition has been filed. 
SM 10000 seeks an order
compelling responses and $1,650 in sanctions for three hours at $300 per hour
spent drafting each motion, with an additional three hours anticipated for
opposition and reply. Id. ¶ 2, 4. This is excessive, given
the simplicity of the motions and lack of opposition. The court awards four
hours total for preparation and appearance ($1,200). GRANTED. Sanctions payable
within 30 days.
