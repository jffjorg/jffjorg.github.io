Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the evidence and has made a tentative ruling on several motions. Mardirossian's motion for summary adjudication/judgment is GRANTED. Howarth's private nuisance cause of action is based on an improvement that is only 15 inches from where it is supposed to be, and the violation was unnoticed for over a decade. The court finds that the alleged setback encroachment is not a substantial and unreasonable interference with Howarth's use and enjoyment of his property.

Mardirossian's argument that the setback violation is de minimis and cannot support a nuisance claim is bolstered by Howarth's admission that he did not discover the tennis court improvements were within the setback area until 2020, despite construction being completed and approved 12 years earlier.

The court also grants Mardirossian's motion on the trespass and ejectment claims, as the allegedly encroaching chain link fence has been removed and Howarth agrees to dismiss the fence-based causes of action.

The court DENIES Mardirossian's motion on the negligence claim, as Howarth has not provided evidence he was damaged by the setback violation, and the parties agree the chain link fence was removed. However, the court GRANTS Mardirossian's motion on the remaining causes of action, finding that Howarth has not established a substantial interference with his use and enjoyment of his property.

The court also DENIES Mardirossian's motion on the continuing nuisance claim, as there remains a triable issue of fact as to when Howarth last alleges a noise disturbance from the tennis court.
