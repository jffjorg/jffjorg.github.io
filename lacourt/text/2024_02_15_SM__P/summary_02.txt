And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mohamadreza Yazdi, D.D.S. v. Blakely Robles, et al. The court denied Robles' anti-SLAPP motion, finding that the gravamen of the first cause of action is not a statement made during arbitration, but rather the pursuit of a judgment after arbitration and subsequent appellate proceedings, which are protected petitioning activities covered by the anti-SLAPP statute.

The court also sustained the demurrers of defendants Baum and Mizrahi, finding that Yazdi's indemnity claim is not ripe for filing as the judgment against him has not been fully satisfied. The court held that Yazdi cannot bring a claim for equitable indemnity or contribution until he has paid the judgment in full.

The court granted Robles' anti-SLAPP motion, striking the first cause of action for equitable relief. The court also sustained Baum and Mizrahi's demurrers, finding that Yazdi's complaint is premature and does not allege facts showing they committed negligence.
