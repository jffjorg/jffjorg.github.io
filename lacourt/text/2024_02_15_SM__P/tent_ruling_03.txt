Don Chuy’s
Restaurant, LLC et al. v. Caffe Roberto, Inc. et al., Case No. SC129269
Hearing Date
February 15, 2024
Plaintiff Don
Chuy’s Restaurants Motion for Attorney’s Fees (UNOPPOSED)
 
On September 1,
2023 the court issued a proposed statement of decision finding for plaintiff
Don Chuy’s on its cause of action for breach of contract and awarding
$179,663.83 in damages. The lease provided “[i]n case suit should be brought
for recovery of the premises, or for any sum due hereunder, or because of any
act which may arise out of the possession of the premises by either party, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to all costs incurred in connection with
such action, including a reasonable attorney’s fees.” Don Chuy’s seeks attorney’s
fees of $336,706.68 under Code of Civ. Proc. §1717. No opposition was filed.
 
When a statute,
such as Code of Civ. Proc. §1717, does not explicitly define “prevailing
party,” “which party, if either, prevailed in an action” is left to the
discretion of the trial court. Galan v. Wolfriver Holding Corp. (2000)
80 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1128. In a case with “mixed results,” where a party
receives only some of the relief sought, a court can determine, after comparing
each party’s objectives to the relief awarded, that there was no prevailing
party entitled to attorney’s fees. Olive v. General Nutrition Centers, Inc. (2018)
30 Cal.App.5th 804, 827.
 
Don Chuy’s
complaint sought damages of $1,500,000, plus treble damages. After trial, Don
Chuy’s was awarded a fraction of the requested relief, and treble damages were
not awarded. While the court awarded judgment for Don Chuy’s on the contract
causes of action, it awarded judgment for defendants on the fraud, negligent
misrepresentation and unfair business practices claims. 
 
Since all claims
arose out of Don Chuy’s possession of the premises, the lease’s attorney’s fees
provision and §1717 apply to the entire action, not just the contract claims. The
results for Don Chuy’s were mixed and fell short of the litigation objectives as
stated in the complaint. The court will exercise its discretion under Galan and
Olive and determine that neither party prevailed. No attorney’s fees
will be awarded. DENIED.
