RELIEF
REQUESTED
Plaintiff is
requesting possession of a vehicle
 
SUMMARY OF
ACTION
 
Plaintiff is
the holder of a Contract whereby Defendants purchased from Plaintiff’s assignor
a 2019 Nissan Sentra. The Contract is in default and the balance due and owing
on the contract is $28,901.68. 
 
On December 12,
2023, Plaintiff obtained a default judgment of $28,901.68. Plaintiff also seeks
possession of the vehicle, with Plaintiff having filed the application for writ
of possession on September 13, 2023.
 
RULING: The
Application for Writ of Possession is granted.
 
Upon a showing
of the probably validity of a plaintiff’s right to possession of the property
claimed, a writ of possession shall issue, subject to any possible bond or
undertaking. (CCP § 512.060.) The claim has probable validity “where it is more
likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant
on that claim.” (CCP § 511.090.) Once the requirements for issuance of the writ
are met, CCP § 512.070 authorizes an order directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to plaintiff. When necessary, the Court may take
additional oral and documentary evidence at the claim and delivery hearing.
(CCP § 512.050.)
 
Plaintiff has
met the requirements set forth in the CCP for an application for writ of
possession. Plaintiff need not establish that it is likely that it will obtain
a judgment, as it has already obtained a default judgment. Plaintiff is
entitled to possession of the vehicle given the default. However, Plaintiff
will need to obtain oral evidence from the Defendant at the hearing regarding
the location of the vehicle. Good cause exists for a brief examination of the
Defendant.
 
 The Court issues the writ of possession and
directs transfer of the vehicle, pending Plaintiff obtaining the location of
the vehicle at the hearing.
