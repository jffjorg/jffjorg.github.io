SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On May 26, 2023,
Plaintiff Kubota Credit Corporation (Plaintiff) served Defendant Esmerald
Rubio-Acosta (Defendant) with Form Interrogatories, Requests for Production of
Documents, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Admission. Plaintiff contacted
Defendant on June 28, 2023, to indicate that no response had beeen received,
but Defendant did not reply. (Motions at p. 3.) Plaintiff filed these motions
on October 18, 2023. Plaintiff seeks an order compelling responses to the demand
for production, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. Plaintiff
also seeks an order deeming the requests for admission admitted. Plaintiff seeks
sanctions in the amount of $1,860.00 against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel
of record for each of the motions.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses to requests for production and motion to compel
responses to form interrogatories are set for hearing on February 1, 2024. The
motion to compel responses to special interrogatories is set for hearing on February
2, 2024. The motion to deem requests for admissions admitted is set for hearing
on February 5, 2024.
 
RULING:
The four motions are all granted
 
Requests
for Production
A propounding
party may move to compel responses to requests for production of documents
where the responding party fails to provide responses. (CCP § 2031.300.) The
responding party must provide responses within thirty days after the demand is
served. (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2) & (3).) The responding party waives all
objections, including privilege and work product, by failing to timely respond
to requests for production of documents. (CCP § 2031.300.)
 
Defendant has
failed to provide responses to Plaintiff’s request for production of documents.
Plaintiff has moved for an order compelling production of those documents. The
Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the requests for
production.
 
Form
Interrogatories
The propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and monetary sanctions if a
party to whom the interrogatories are directed fails to respond. (CCP §§ 2030.290,
2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) Responses to interrogatories
are due within thirty days from the date of service of the interrogatories. (CCP
§§ 2030.260(a), 2016.050.) The responding party waives any objections to the
interrogatories by failing to serve responses in a timely manner. (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
 
Defendant has
failed to respond to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories. Defendant has moved for an
order compelling Defendant’s response to these Interrogatories. The Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the Form Interrogatories.
 
            Special Interrogatories
The propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and monetary sanctions if a
party to whom the interrogatories are directed fails to respond. (CCP §§
2030.290, 2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) Responses to
interrogatories are due within thirty days from the date of service of the
interrogatories. (CCP §§ 2030.260(a), 2016.050.) The responding party waives
any objections to the interrogatories by failing to serve responses in a timely
manner. (CCP § 2030.290(a).)   
 
Defendant has
failed to respond to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories. Plaintiff has moved
for an order compelling Defendant’s response to these Interrogatories. The
Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the Special
Interrogatories. 
 
Requests
for Admission
Responses to
requests for admission are due within thirty days from the date the propounding
party serves the requests. (CCP § 2033.250.) Failure to timely respond to
requests for admission results in waiver of all objections to the requests,
including claims of privilege or work product protection. (CCP § 2033.280(a).)
The propounding party of requests for admission may move for an order that “the
truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as
for a monetary sanction.” (CCP § 2033.280(b).)  
 
Defendant has
not responded to Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions. Plaintiff has moved for an
order deeming the RFAs admitted. The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion. 
 
Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030
authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery,
evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are
“misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd. (d)-(f).)
 
Plaintiff has
requested sanctions in the amount of $1,860.00 against Defendant and Defendant’s
counsel of record for the each of the four motions. The amount was based on Plaintiff’s
counsel spending 1.1 hours preparing each of the motions at $600.00 an hour, plus
an anticipated two hours attending the hearing on each motion. (Ernest Decl., ¶
6.) However, the Court intends to hear the four motions at the same hearing, so
the amount for sanctions would be 1.1 hours for each of the four motions, plus
2 hours for the hearing, at $600.00 an hour, for a total of $3,840.00 in
sanctions.
 
Plaintiff’s
requests for sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record are
granted in the total amount of $3,840.00 for the four motions.
