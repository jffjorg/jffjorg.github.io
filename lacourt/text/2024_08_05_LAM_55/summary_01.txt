  - "The refusal to reveal material evidence is deemed to be an admission that the claim or defense is without merit."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Culver City Chevrolet's motions to terminate sanctions and dismiss the case brought by Jerrin McGhee and Jeneta McGhee. The plaintiffs failed to respond to discovery requests and pay sanctions, despite multiple warnings and orders from the court. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' conduct is egregious and willful, and that less severe sanctions would not have produced compliance with the discovery rules. Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's motion to terminate sanctions and dismiss the case.
