And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Aveon Goosby, was employed by the defendants, Panda Restaurant Group, Inc. and Panda Express, Inc., from November 2021 to June 2022. The plaintiff claims that he was wrongfully terminated after informing a human resources representative that he and other employees under the age of 18 were routinely required to work hours not allowed under Labor Code Section 1391.

The defendants demurred to each cause of action alleged in the complaint, arguing that the claims are insufficient and uncertain. The judge disagrees, finding that the plaintiff's allegations adequately describe his belief that the defendants required him and other minors to work hours not permitted by Labor Code Section 1391, that he complained about it to his managers, and that he was terminated shortly thereafter. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim for whistleblower retaliation in violation of Labor Code Section 1102.5.

The judge overrules the demurrer as to the first and second causes of action, but sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the claim is barred by the exclusive remedies of the Workers' Compensation Act. The defendants have 20 days to answer.
