  Case Number:  22STCV13042    Hearing Date:   August 5, 2024    Dept:  55 Proceeding:Defendant's Motion for Terminating Sanctions; Motion to DismissBACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Jerrin McGhee and Jeneta McGhee
(“Plaintiffs”) in pro per, filed a complaint alleging one cause of action for
negligence against Defendant Culver City Chevrolet (“Defendant”). The complaint
is devoid of any facts and requests $40,000.00 in damages. Defendant served Plaintiff
with discovery requests on September 28, 2022, and January 26, 2023. On
December 20, 2023, the Court issued an order compelling Plaintiffs’ responses
to Defendant's discovery requests and issued $2,310.00 sanctions. During a
January 16, 2024, status conference, the Court vacated the final status
conference and trial date. The Court also granted Defendant’s request to file
the instant motion. Given that Plaintiffs did not comply with the order, on
June 5, 2024, Defendant filed the motion before the court to terminate sanctions
and file a motion to dismiss the case. The motion is unopposed.

REASONING
Legal
Standard
 
 
Motion for Terminating Sanctions
Under Code of Civil
Procedure §¿2025.250, the trial court may impose either issue, evidence, or
terminating sanctions per C.C.P. §¿2023.030 for a party’s failure to “obey an
order compelling attendance, testimony, and production.” (CCP §¿2025.450; see
also Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 991.) Code of
Civil Procedure § 2023.030 allows for the imposition of terminating sanctions
by the following orders: “(1) an order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, (2)
[a]n order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for
discovery is obeyed, (3) [a]n order dismissing the action, or any part of the
action, of that party, (4) [a]n order rendering a judgement by default against
that party.” (CCP §¿2023.030(d)(1)-(4).)
The court should only
issue terminating sanctions if the party’s failure to object the court’s orders
actually prejudiced the moving party. (Moofly Productions, LLC v. Favila¿(2020)
46 Cal.App.5th 1, 11; see also¿Morgan v. Ransom¿(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d
664, 669–670.) Prior to issuing terminating sanctions, the court must assess
whether the offending party’s conduct is sufficiently egregious to warrant
terminating sanctions. (Moofly Productions, LLC v. Favila, supra, 46
Cal.App.5th at p. 12.) However, “where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the superior court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem¿(2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 280.)
 
Motion to
Dismiss Plaintiff’s Case
The sanction of
dismissal or the rendition of a default judgment against the disobedient party
is ordinarily a drastic measure which should be employed with caution.  (See Wilson v. Volkswagen of America, Inc.
(4th Cir. 1977) 561 F.2d 494, 503-504.) 
However, there is no question that a court is empowered to apply the
ultimate sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to
comply with his discovery obligations.  (Fred
Howland Co. v. Superior Court, supra., 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 612.)  The refusal to reveal material evidence is
deemed to be an admission that the claim or defense is without merit.  (Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas
(1909) 212 U.S. 322, 350-351 [53 L.Ed. 530, 544-545, 29 S.Ct. 370]; Kahn v.
Kahn (1976) 68 Cal.App.3d 372, 382 [137 Cal.Rptr. 332].)
Motion for
Terminating Sanctions
Defendant argues that
terminating sanctions are an appropriate penalty for Plaintiffs’ misuse of the
discovery process, which includes Plaintiffs’ failure to respond to Defendant’s
first set of form interrogatories, the first set of requests for admission, and
second set of form interrogatories, and failure to pay the court ordered
sanctions. (Decl., of Neda Safapour ¶¶ 3-6.) Defendants support their motion
with exhibits that chronicle the served discovery requests.
As of present, the
Court notes Plaintiffs have violated three discovery orders or directives: (1)
the September 2022 discovery request, (2) the January 2023 discovery requests,
(3) the December 2023 unopposed motion to compel discovery responses and (4)
the December 2023 order compelling Plaintiffs’ objection less discovery
responses and pay $2,030.00 in sanctions. By the January 16, 2024, final status
conference (“FSC”), Defendants informed the Court that Plaintiff had not served
discovery responses, and the Court vacated the FSC hearing dates and trial. (Safapour
Decl., ¶ 12.) 
In the absence of an
opposition or further explanation from Plaintiffs’ regarding their failure to
pay the previously issued sanctions, failure to serve responses to the
discovery requests, the Court finds that its previous alternatives have had
seemingly no impact on Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have effectively failed to
participate in the discovery process by evading responding to discovery requests.
Plaintiffs’ failure to pay the previously issued monetary sanctions further
demonstrate their unwillingness to comply with court orders. Despite monetary
sanctions, Plaintiffs continue to engage in further abuses of the discovery process
without explanation so as to compel the Court to impose the ultimate level of
sanctions—terminating sanctions.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion for terminating sanctions is granted.
 
Motion to
Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Case
Defendant is entitled
to an order dismissing Plaintiffs’ action without prejudice. Defendant
submitted evidence Plaintiffs have failed to participate in discovery as well
as evidence suggesting Plaintiffs have no intention of litigating their claim
against Defendant, notwithstanding the Court’s orders. 
Here, Defendant’s
motion is timely because they have awaited discovery responses since 2022 and
have repeatedly attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiffs prior to filing
motions to compel responses. The Court has issued reduced sanctions and granted
Defendant’s motion. Moreover, Plaintiff’s complaint provides the Court with no
guidance whatsoever as to what the nature of the negligence allegation could
be.
Based on the foregoing,
Defendant’s motion to dismiss the case is granted, without prejudice.
Conclusion 
Defendant Culver City Chevrolet’s Motion to Dismiss
Plaintiff’s Case is GRANTED. 
 
Defendant Culver City Chevrolet’s Motion for
Terminating Sanctions is GRANTED. 
 
The Court finds terminating sanctions appropriate in
light of Plaintiffs’ Jerrin McGhee and Jetena McGhee’s multiple discovery
violations, including their outstanding $2,030.00 sanction award and their
repeated failure to respond to discovery requests.
