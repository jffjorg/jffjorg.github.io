And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff, Mark Bullard, to have the case reinstated to the active list and/or allocate the costs of arbitration. The plaintiff argues that the defendant, Laibco, LLC, has waived its right to arbitration and is responsible for paying the costs of arbitration. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has not shown that he is unable to pay the costs of arbitration and that the arbitration agreement requires each party to pay its pro rata share of the costs.

The court finds that the defendant has not waived its right to arbitration and that the arbitration agreement requires each party to pay its pro rata share of the costs. The court notes that the plaintiff has obtained a waiver of court fees and costs and is determined to be indigent. The court concludes that the plaintiff is unable to pay any share of the costs of the arbitration and that the defendant has the choice of paying the plaintiff's share of the costs and remaining in arbitration or declining to do so and allowing the case to proceed in court.

The motion is granted in part, and the hearing is continued to allow the defendant to file a declaration as to its choice. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling and the defendant to file a declaration as to its choice.
