Background
 
This is a family
dispute arising in connection with real property located at 336 Flintridge Oaks
Drive, La Canada-Flintridge, California, 91011 (the “Property”). Plaintiff
Lucia Early (“Lucia”) alleges that she is the sister of Defendant, John D.
Early (“John”) and that both, in addition to Elizabeth V. Early (“Elizabeth”),
were the surviving children of Mary C. Early. (“Mary”) Mary was born on October
2, 1930, and thus, allegedly qualifies as an elder for purposes of the Elder
and Dependent Adult Protection Act. 
 
Lucia alleges that
on or about March 16, 2006, Mary, as the trustee of the Mary C. Early Trust
dated December 14, 2005 (the “Trust”) took title to the property located at 366
Flintridge Oaks Drive, La Canada-Flintridge, California, assessor’s parcel number
5820-011-013 (the “Property”) and later restated the Trust to provide equally
for her three children. Lucia alleges that despite Mary’s actions, John
successfully demanded that she amend her Trust to exclude Lucia and transfer
substantially all the interest in the Property to him. Thereafter, John
allegedly removed Mary from the Property and moved her to live with relatives
in Missouri, despite alleged assurances that Mary would be allowed to live in
the Property for life.¿¿
 
Lucia’s
Complaint, filed May 5, 2020, alleges six causes of action: (1) interference
with expected inheritance against John, (2) fraud against John, (3) fraud
against John, (4) constructive fraud against John, (5) injunction against John,
and (6) restitution against John. 
 
On
August 19, 2020, the court deemed this action related with John D. Early v.
Lucia C. Early (LASC No. 20GDCV00556) (the “Related Action”) with the
instant action deemed the lead action. John’s Complaint in the related action
alleges seven causes of action: (1) intentional interference with contractual
relations, (2) intentional interference with prospective economic relations,
(3) breach of contract, (4) partition by appraisal of real property, (5)
partition by sale of real property, (6) specific performance, and (7)
declaratory relief.  
 
On
December 4, 2020, Lucia filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).
The FAC alleges the same causes of action as the Complaint.   
 
On
March 23, 2021, Lucia and Elizabeth (“Cross-Complainants”) filed the operative
First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) in the Related Action, 20GDCV00556. The
FACC alleges nine causes of action: (1) battery, (2) conversion, (3) statutory
violation – theft, (4) elder abuse, (5) conversion, (6) statutory violation –
theft, (7) restitution, (8) quiet title, (9) defamation. On March 24, 2021, the
court deemed the Related Action consolidated with this action. 
 
On
March 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an Amendment to Cross-Complaint naming Roe 2
as Defendant Alexander R. Early V (“Alexander”). On December 21, 2023, Defendant
Alexander moved to quash the Service of Summons of FACC and/or Dismiss the FACC
on the grounds of forum non conveinens. Plaintiffs oppose the Motion. The
matter is now before the court. 
 
motion to quash service of summons OF facc
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
CCP § 418.10(a) states: “A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve or file a
motion…[t]o quash service of summon on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of
the court over him or her.”¿¿¿ 
 
When a defendant moves to quash
service of process on jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has the initial
burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.¿(State
of Oregon v. Superior Court (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)¿If the
plaintiff meets his or her burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to
demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. (Buchanan
v. Soto (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1362. [“When a motion to quash is
properly brought, the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish
the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.”].) This burden
must be met by competent evidence in affidavits and authenticated documentary
evidence. (Jewish Defense Org. v. Superior Court¿(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th
1045, 1055.) “A court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident
defendant only if: (1) the defendant has purposefully availed himself or
herself of forum benefits; (2) the controversy is related to or arises out of
the defendant’s contacts with the forum; and (3) the assertion of personal
jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice.” (Snowey
v. Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1054, 1062.) 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
 The court may take judicial notice of
records of any court of record of the United States. (Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).)
However, the court may only judicially notice the existence of the record, not
that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th
1548, 1565.) A court may take judicial
notice of contents of its own records. (Dwan v. Dixon (1963) 216
Cal.App.2d 260, 265; Foster v. Gray (1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 434,
439.) 
 
Defendant John and
special appearing Defendant Alexander request judicial notice of the following:

 
Alleged Proof of
Service of Summons filed on December 7, 2023, in Case No. 20STCV17157,
consolidated with 20STCV00556 (Exhibit 1).
 
The court may take
judicial notice of Exhibit 1, since it is the proof of service at issue in this
Motion, but the court cannot take judicial notice of the purported facts
Defendants insist are reflected in the proof of service: (1) R. Diefanbach is
using her married name and her maiden name is Stroh; (2) her parents, Joseph
and Lucia Stroh, are parties to this action, adverse to her uncle John Early;
(3) she is the 1st cousin of Alexander Early; ( 4) the driving distance from
her address on the alleged proof of service to Alexander's house is 495.2 miles
round trip for a $100 fee; and (5) the phone number on the alleged proof is
registered to her sister.
 
Since the court is
judicially noticing the existence of the proof of service and not its truth,
Defendants’ request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
III.      Evidentiary Objections
 
Special
appearing Defendant Alexander filed evidentiary objections:
 
Objection
No. 1 is overruled. Defendants fail to show that R. Diefanbach is a party to
this action and that even if R. Diefanbach does have an adverse interest in
this action, the California Code. Civ. Proc. prohibits service by persons with
interests adverse to that of a named party. 
 
Objection
No. 2 is sustained due to hearsay and lack of relevance. 
 
Objection
No. 3 is sustained due to hearsay and violation of the best evidence rule. The
Declaration is trying to prove the contents of a writing, here what Defendant
John said at his deposition, without providing a copy of said deposition. 
 
IV.       Discussion
 
Plaintiffs
assert that although discovery had ben cut-off in late summer of 2022, the
parties had not completed the deposition of John Early prior to the discovery
cut-off. (Cordier Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs assert that John’s deposition did not
reconvene until March 8, 2023, wherein John allegedly admitted that his son
drove the car. (Ibid.)
 
Accordingly, on March
13, 2023, the Plaintiffs filed an Amendment to the FACC, naming Alexander as
Doe 2. The record of this action reflects that the Plaintiffs filed a proof of
personal service on Alexander on December 17, 2023, with the service undertaken
on October 31, 2023, and with the proof of service declaration signed by “R.
Diefanbach” on November 16, 2023. Plaintiffs fail to explain why they delayed
in serving the FACC on Alexander and filing the Proof of Service as Plaintiffs
present no evidence that Alexander resisted service. 
 
“The filing of a proof of service
creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper. However, the
presumption arises only if the proof
of service complies with the applicable
statutory requirements.” (Floveyor Internat., Ltd. v.
Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 795.) CCP § 1011 lays out the
requirements for personal service on a party. Specifically, section 1011(b)(1)
states: 
 
Any
attempt of service upon a party at the party's residence shall be made between
the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.
 
Here, the proof of service reflects the
fact that the summons and other papers were served at Alexander’s residence at
8:05 pm. (POS filed 12/07/23.) Accordingly, the proof of service is facially deficient,
and Plaintiff is not entitled to a rebuttable presumption that service was
proper. The Declaration of R. Diefanbach asserts they consulted with the police
department of Blacksburg, Virginia but fails to explain why the police
department did not carry out the service, despite the police having had experience
serving Defendant John. (R. Diefanbach Dec. ¶ 3.) 
 
Second, nothing in the Declaration of R.
Diefanbach rebuts Defendants’ evidence that Alexander was never served. When a defendant moves to quash service of summons on
jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating
facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.¿(State of Oregon v. Superior
Court (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)¿If the plaintiff meets his or her
burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the exercise of
jurisdiction would be unreasonable. (Buchanan v. Soto (2015) 241
Cal.App.4th 1353, 1362.)¿ 
 
Special appearing Defendant Alexander
asserts that on Halloween (10/31/2023), he was doing schoolwork, did not leave
the house, and was not served with any documents. (A. Early Decl. ¶ ¶ 4 , 5.)
Alexander further asserts that the weekend before Tuesday, October 31, 2023,
the street of his residence was being resurfaced and that since 2020, no
trick-or-treater appeared on his street and his family does not celebrate
Halloween. (A. Early Decl. ¶ 6.) Defendant John similarly declared that no one came
to the house on October 31, 2023, the street was being resurfaced, and there
were no Halloween trick-or-treaters or celebrations at the residence. (J. Early
Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4.) On reply, Defendant John asserts that the process server, R.
Diefanbach is Veronica R. Stroh, but Diefanbach is her married name. (Supp. J.
Early Decl. ¶ 5.) Defendants assert that Diefanbach is the daughter of Joseph
and Lucia Stroh who are parties in this action and have interests adverse to
those of John. (See Ds’ Objection No. 2.) 



The court finds that the Plaintiffs have
failed to meet their initial burden of showing that service was proper.
Accordingly, the court need not decide if Defendant Alexander has sufficient
minimum contacts with California. As discovery has been cut off, Plaintiffs
failed to present admissible evidence to show that Alexader conspired with his
father to steal property and has sufficient minimum contacts in California. 
 
As the motion to quash service has been
granted, the motion to stay or dismiss the action due to forum non conveniens
is moot. 
 
Conclusion
 
Special appearing Defendant
Alexander Early’s motion to quash service of summons on FACC is granted.
Defendant to give notice.
