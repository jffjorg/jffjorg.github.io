**English Text Summary**

The tentative ruling grants the motion to quash service of summons on the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) filed by Lucia C. Early and Elizabeth C. Early against John D. Early and Alexander R. Early. The court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to meet their initial burden of showing that service was proper. The motion to stay or dismiss the action due to forum non conveniens is moot since the motion to quash service has been granted. The court notes that the plaintiffs failed to present admissible evidence to show that Alexander conspired with his father to steal property and has sufficient minimum contacts in California. The court grants the motion to quash service of summons on FACC and orders the defendant to give notice.
