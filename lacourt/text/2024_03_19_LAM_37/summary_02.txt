And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Douglas Smith, had requested a religious exemption from the vaccine mandate, but the defendant, Burbank Unified School District, denied his request and terminated his employment. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant's policies were discriminatory and retaliatory.

The judge found that the plaintiff's pleadings were deficient in several ways. First, the plaintiff failed to state facts that supported his claims of religious discrimination and retaliation. Second, the plaintiff failed to allege that the defendant's policies were not reasonable. Third, the plaintiff failed to provide evidence that the defendant denied him a reasonable accommodation.

The judge granted the defendant's motion to strike the following paragraphs: 14, 15, 16, and 17, which alleged that the plaintiff's requested accommodation was reasonable and that the defendant's refusal to provide it was discriminatory. The judge also granted the plaintiff leave to amend his pleadings to fix these deficiencies, but warned that he would not grant leave to amend a fourth time.

The judge set the OSC RE: Amended Complaint for a future date and ordered the defendant to give notice.
