And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the City of Pomona (the "City") against Regency Outdoor Advertising, Inc. (Regency). The City demurred to several causes of action, alleging that Regency's claims were barred by the Government Claims Act and lacked factual and legal basis.

The court sustained the demurrer to the third, fourth, sixth, and eighth through tenth causes of action, finding that Regency's claims were insufficient and that the City was not estopped from removing the billboards. The court also sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, alleging an unconstitutional taking, and the seventh cause of action, alleging an equitable servitude, without leave to amend.

The court found that Regency's declaratory relief claim did not state a claim for prospective relief and that Regency's reliance on the City's promise to extend the Development Agreement was not justifiable. The court also noted that the City's prohibition on new or altered billboards under Proposition L was a valid exercise of its legislative authority.
