Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to compel responses to discovery requests propounded by Plaintiff on Defendant. The Plaintiff alleges 11 causes of action arising from an employment relationship. The Defendant failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, and the Plaintiff moved to compel responses. The Court finds that the Defendant has now provided responses, making the motion moot insofar as it seeks to compel responses. However, the Court awards Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,900, which represents four hours drafting the Motion at an hourly rate of $475 per hour. The Defendant and counsel are jointly ordered to pay this amount within 20 days of this order.
