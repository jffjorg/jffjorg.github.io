The purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act is to move the parties in an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.
A written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable, and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.
The party moving to compel arbitration bears the burden of producing prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy.
If the moving party meets its initial prima facie burden and the opposing party disputes the agreement, then in the second step, the opposing party bears the burden of producing evidence to challenge the authenticity of the agreement.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendant American Guard Services, Inc. and the opposition from the plaintiff Richard Hernandez. The judge finds that the existence of the arbitration agreements is disputed and grants the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of Exhibit I, but denies it with respect to Exhibits M and N. The judge also overrules the plaintiff's objections to the declaration of Natalie Solano.

The judge notes that the purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act is to move parties in an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible. The judge also cites California law, which favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.

The judge finds that the moving party (defendant) has met its initial burden of producing prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy, but the existence of the agreement is disputed. The judge orders that the parties provide additional evidence as follows: (1) an additional declaration from Ramirez regarding whether she oversaw the plaintiff during the onboarding process, and (2) a response from the plaintiff to the Ramirez declaration and the supplemental Ramirez declaration. The hearing on this matter is continued to October 27, 2023.
