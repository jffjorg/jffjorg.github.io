  CASE NO.: 23STCV07927
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES
 
Date: 
  October 6, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56



 
MOVING PARTY:
Plaintiff
 
RESPONDING PARTY:
Defendant 4 Star Motel (“Defendant”)
 
The Court has considered
the moving, opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff’s
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges 11 causes of action arising from an
employment relationship.  On July 3,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel responses to various discovery
requests propounded on Defendant (the “Motion”). 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION
            Under
California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 2030.290, subdivision
(b), when a party directs interrogatories towards a party and that party fails
to serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.290,
subd. (b).)  The moving party need only show that the interrogatories were
served on the opposing party, the time has expired to respond to the
interrogatories and no responses have been served in order for the
court to compel the opposing party to respond.  (Leach v. Superior
Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906.) 

 
Where
there has been no timely response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing
or sampling, the demanding party may seek an order compelling a
response.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd. (b).)  Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work
product.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  
 
Under CCP section
2033.280, subdivision (a), where requests for admission are propounded on a
party and that party fails to serve a timely response, that party waives any
objection to the requests.  (CCP §
2033.280, subd. (a).)  The requesting
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction.  (CCP § 2033.280,
subd. (b).)  The court must grant a
motion to have admission requests deemed admitted where responses have not been
served prior to the hearing, or, if such responses were served, they were not
in substantial compliance with CCP section 2033.220.  (CCP
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)  It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated the motion.  (Id.)  
 
            On
May 2, 2023, Plaintiff propounded the discovery at issue in the Motion on
Defendant.  (Declaration of Crystal F.
Mohsin (“Mohsin Decl.”) ¶ 5.)  Defendant
did not serve its responses by the June 6, 2023 deadline.  (Mohsin Decl. ¶ 8.)  Although Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to
contact Defendant’s counsel, Plaintiff had not received any responses as of the
date she filed the Motions.  (See Simonian
Decl. ¶¶ 9-13.)  
 
            Defendant provides evidence that it provided responses on August 30,
2023.  (See Declaration of Sheldon
Rosenfield (“Rosenfield Decl.”) ¶ 7.) 
Given that Defendant has now provided responses, the Motion is MOOT
insofar as it seeks to compel responses. 

 
Monetary Sanctions
            Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,800.  This amount represents: (1) one hour of meet
and confer efforts; (2) four hours preparing the moving papers; and (3) an
anticipated three hours preparing for and attending the hearing at an hourly
rate of $475 per hour.  (Mohsin Decl.
¶ 17.)   
 
The Court exercises its discretion
and awards Plaintiff sanctions in the reasonable amount of $1900, which
represents four hours drafting the Motion at an hourly rate of $475 per
hour.  (Moran v. Oso
Valley Greenbelt Assn. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1034.)  Defendant and counsel are
jointly ordered to pay this amount within 20 days of this order. 
             Moving party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
 
Parties who intend
to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
