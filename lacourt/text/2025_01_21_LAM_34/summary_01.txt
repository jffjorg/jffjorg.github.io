```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the third cause of action for fraud is sustained. This means that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud are insufficient to state a cause of action. The plaintiff's allegations of a fiduciary relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff's representative, as well as the alleged concealment of facts by the defendant, are not sufficient to establish a cause of action for constructive fraud. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's allegations are vague and conclusory, and that the plaintiff has not identified the specific facts that were concealed by the defendant with the level of specificity required. As a result, the judge has sustained the demurrer and has given the plaintiff an opportunity to amend their complaint to cure the defects.
