Legal Standard
 
            “The
party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object, by
demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the pleading on any one or
more of” various grounds listed in statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)
 
            When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer
tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab,
Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.)
As such, the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or
implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
            Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation
Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
demurs, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivisions (e)
and (f), to the Plaintiffs’ third cause of action for fraud, on the basis that Plaintiffs fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that it is uncertain. 
 
Uncertainty 
 
            A party may demur to a complaint
where “[t]he pleading is uncertain,” meaning also that it is “ambiguous [or]
unintelligible.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10, subd. (f).) The law encourages
courts to liberally construe pleadings and disfavors demurrers for uncertainty.
(Morris v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 279. 292.)
That said, where the complaint does not properly distinguish between multiple
defendants, such that it is not clear which factual allegations are made as to
which parties, the complaint fails for ambiguity. (Hawley Bros. Hardware Co.
v. Brownstone (1899) 123 Cal. 643, 646-647.) 
 
The court finds that Plaintiffs’
allegations supporting the third cause of action for fraud are not so
unintelligible that Defendant is not apprised of the issues it has to meet. Defendant also fails to make direct arguments regarding how
Plaintiffs’ third cause of action is uncertain. 
 
Accordingly, the special demurrer for
uncertainty is overruled. 
 
Constructive
Fraud 
 
            “Constructive fraud ‘ “ ‘is a unique species of fraud
applicable only to a fiduciary or confidential relationship.’ ” ’ [Citation.]
‘Constructive fraud “arises on a breach of duty by one in a confidential or
fiduciary relationship to another which induces justifiable reliance by the
latter to his prejudice.” [Citation.] Actual reliance and causation of injury
must be shown. [Citation.]’ Citations.]” (Prakashpalan v. Engstrom, Lipscomb
& Lack (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1131.) The elements of a
constructive fraud cause of action are (1) a fiduciary duty or confidential
relationship, (2) nondisclosure (breach of fiduciary duty); (3) intent to
deceive, and (4) reliance resulting in injury. (Younan v. Equifax Inc.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 498, 516, fn. 14.)
Generally, fraud must be
pled with particularity. (Hills Transportation Co. v. Southwest Forest
Industries, Inc. (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 702, 707.) Pleadings must allege
facts as to “‘how, when, where, to whom, and
by what means the representations were tendered.’" (Stansfield v.
Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73.)
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs fail to plead all of the elements required for fraud by
making vague and conclusory allegations while also failing to state the
identity of any individual who spoke on Defendant’s behalf with the intent to
defraud. (Demurrer, at p. 6.) Additionally, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’
constructive fraud claim is based on concealment but Plaintiffs fail to allege
any facts that show concealment by Defendant. (Ibid.) Defendant also
argues that Plaintiffs fail to properly allege that a fiduciary relationship
existed. (Id., at p. 7.) 
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiffs contend that they properly pleaded that Defendant owed a
fiduciary duty and the elements of cause of action for constructive fraud
referencing paragraphs 20 to 28 of the FAC. (Opp., at pp. 5-8.) 
 
            In
reply, Defendant continues to argue that Plaintiffs’ constructive fraud claim
is not sufficiently pled as Plaintiffs fail to establish that a fiduciary duty
exists nor how it was breached. (Reply, at p. 2.) 
 
            Plaintiffs allege that a fiduciary relationship existed
between Defendant and Plaintiff Hui Chung Kim (“Kim”) as Kim was
dependent upon Defendant for custodial care and assistance. (FAC, ¶¶ 20-22.) The
court does not find that Plaintiffs sufficiently plead that a fiduciary
relationship existed. As the court noted in Zumbrun v. University of Southern
California (1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 1, 13, “[t]he mere placing of a trust in
another person does not create a fiduciary relationship.” 
 
            Additionally, Plaintiffs fail to identify the specific
facts that were concealed by Defendant with the level of specificity required. Plaintiffs
do not identify when, where, and by what means the concealments were made.
Plaintiffs do not identify what Defendant or Defendant’s agents specifically
said, other than that Defendant was aware, but concealed from Plaintiffs, that Defendant was
managing its facility “in a manner that was focused on maximizing its profits
to the fullest possible extent even when doing so was to the detriment of the
care to be provided.” (FAC, ¶ 24.) Additionally,
Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege Defendant’s intent to deceive Plaintiffs.
 
            As such, Defendant’s demurrer is
sustained as to Plaintiffs’ third cause of action.
Conclusion
 
Defendant Inland Medical Enterprises
Inc.’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Third Cause of Action for Fraud is
SUSTAINED.
