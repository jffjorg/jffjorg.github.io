The Court
DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Discovery Responses and for Discovery of

I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 30, 2024, Plaintiff Alander Lee Pulliam Jr. filed this
action against Defendant City of Los Angeles Police Department. 
 
Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action:
1.     
Violation of California Civil Code Section 51.7 (Ralph Civil
Rights Act of 1976)
2.     
Battery
3.     
Assault
4.     
False Arrest and Imprisonment
5.     
Invasion of Privacy
 
The Complaint alleges the following. “This complaint concerns an
incident that occurred on July 26, 2024, and which involved, among other
things, blatant and unjustifiable misconduct by Los Angeles Police Department
Officers Antonio J. Velasco and Christian A. Castro.” (Complaint, ¶ 1.) “Plaintiff
was subjected to an unmerited arrest and officers executed an unlawful search
of plaintiff's belongings without cause or justification.” (Complaint, ¶ 2.)
Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages. 
 
On August 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Discovery
Responses and for Discovery of Witness, arguing:
·       Plaintiff
seeks the discovery of personnel files of Officers Velasco and Castro; incident
reports regarding the July 26, 2024 incident; surveillance reports regarding
the July 26, 2024 incident; witness information regarding the July 26, 2024
incident.
·       Plaintiff
seeks this information under California Code of Civil Procedure Sections
2030.290 and 2031.310.
 
No opposition or other reply was filed.
 
On September 5, 2024, Defendant City of
Los Angeles (“Defendant” or “City”) filed a demurrer to the Complaint, arguing:
·       The Los
Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”) cannot sue or be sued because it does not
exist separate and apart from the City of Los Angeles and does not have its own
legal identity. (See Alcala v. City of Corcoran (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
666, 669-670.) Therefore, a suit against the LAPD is tantamount to a suit
against the City of Los Angeles. Thus, the LAPD should be dismissed.
·       Plaintiff’s
Complaint fails to allege compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act.
Gov’t. §§810 et. seq.
·       Plaintiff’s
Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is
uncertain therefore the City demurs to the entire Complaint
·       Plaintiff’s
Complaint fails to adequately allege a statutory basis for imposing tort
liability against the City, which is a public entity. Gov. Code, §§ 815, subd.
(a), 815.6.
 
No opposition or other reply was filed.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Defendant’s
Demurrer
 
a.       Meet and
Confer Requirement 
 
“Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  
 
Here, counsel for Defendant submitted a declaration stating that
on August 29, 2024, he spoke with Plaintiff Alander Lee Pulliam Jr., who is
representing himself, regarding the grounds of the demurrer.  (Warren Decl., ¶
3.) The Court finds the moving party has satisfied its meet and confer
obligation and the Court proceeds on the merits.
 
b.      Legal
Standard for Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests
the sufficiency of whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context—any defects must be apparent on
the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v.
Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the
court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual
allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is
whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn,
supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)
 
c.       Discussion
 
 
 
First, the
City Defendant asserts that although Plaintiff has named the LAPD as a
defendant in this action, the LAPD cannot be sued in state court because it
does not exist separate and apart from the City Defendant, and thus, the LAPD
does not have its own legal identity. (See Alcala v. City of Corcoran (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 666, 669-71.) The City Defendant avers that a lawsuit against
the LAPD is tantamount to a lawsuit against the City Defendant. Plaintiff does
not dispute this assertion or otherwise provide any explanation for why he can
sue LAPD separately from the City Defendant. Thus, LAPD is not a properly named
defendant in this matter.
 
Next, the City
Defendant argues the demurrer should be sustained because Plaintiff failed to
plead his compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act.  The Court
agrees.  Except as provided in Sections 946.4 and 946.6, a written claim
must be presented to a public entity and must be denied or deemed denied before
a suit for money or damages may be brought against the public entity on a cause
of action for which a claim is required to be presented.¿ (Gov. Code, § 945.4;
Munoz v. State of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1777.)¿¿ The claim
must be filed within six months.¿ (Gov. Code, § 911.2, subd. (a); Munoz,
supra, 33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1777.)¿ Here, the Complaint is devoid
of any allegations regarding Plaintiff’s compliance with the Government Tort
Claim Act.   
 
Finally, the
Court finds that Plaintiff’s Complaint is uncertain and fails to state any
causes of action. The first page of the Complaint states Plaintiff is alleging
causes of action for: Violation of California Civil Code Section 51.7 (Ralph
Civil Rights Act of 1976); Battery; Assault; False Arrest and Imprisonment; and
Invasion of Privacy. However, the Complaint does not contain any facts in
support of these causes of action. Plaintiff only references an incident on
July 26, 2024 and provides conclusory allegations of misconduct, without providing
any specific facts in support. CCP section 430.10(f) provides that a pleading
is uncertain if it is ambiguous and unintelligible. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10(f).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury
v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) “A demurrer
for uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e.,
he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied,
or what counts or claims are directed against him or her.” (Weil & Brown,
Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group) § 7:85 (emphasis in original).)
Not only does Plaintiff fail to state a cause of action, but the Court finds
the Complaint is ambiguous such that Defendant cannot determine what is at
issue.
 
Accordingly,
based on the foregoing independent reasons, the City Defendant’s demurrer is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend.  
 
B.      Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Discovery
 
In light of the
Court’s ruling on Defendant’s demurrer, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Discovery. As discussed above, Plaintiff’s operative Complaint is
uncertain and fails to state any causes of action. Further, Plaintiff brings his
instant motion against the LAPD, which is not a properly named Defendant. 
 
Therefore, the
Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Discovery Responses and for Discovery
of Witness.
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
The Court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer with 20 days leave to
amend. 
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Discovery Responses
and for Discovery of Witness.
