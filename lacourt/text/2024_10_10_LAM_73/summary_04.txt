Summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Rolf Treu, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of PULLIAM v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT (24STCV18869). The case involves alleged misconduct by Los Angeles Police Department Officers Antonio J. Velasco and Christian A. Castro against Plaintiff Alander Pulliam Jr. on July 26, 2024.

The Judge sustains Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's Complaint, which means that the Complaint is uncertain and fails to state any causes of action. The Judge also denies Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Discovery, citing that the Complaint is uncertain and fails to state any causes of action.

The Judge finds that the Complaint is uncertain and fails to state any causes of action because it does not contain any facts in support of the alleged causes of action. The Judge also finds that the Complaint fails to plead compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act and that the Los Angeles Police Department cannot be sued separately from the City of Los Angeles.

The Judge grants Defendant's demurrer with leave to amend, which means that Defendant has 20 days to file an amended complaint. The Judge denies Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Discovery.

The case will proceed with Defendant's demurrer granted and Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Discovery denied.
