And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Judge Rolf Treu has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial date and related deadlines in the case of Kent Tran v. Utomi Tani, et al. The motion was filed by the defendants and cross-complainants, who are seeking a six-month continuance due to the illness of Defendant and Cross-Complainant Yong Sook Kim. The defendants and cross-complainants also argue that they have been unable to obtain essential discovery and that the case is relatively new.

The plaintiff, Kent Tran, opposed the motion, arguing that he has health issues that warrant an expedited trial under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 36. However, the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims of health issues.

The Court found that there is good cause to continue the trial due to Defendant and Cross-Complainant Yong Sook Kim's serious illness. The Court also considered the fact that the defendants and cross-complainants have been unable to obtain essential discovery and that the case is relatively new. Therefore, the Court granted the motion to continue the trial date and related deadlines.
