And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Leisure Healthcare, LLC dba Leisure Glen Post Acute Care Center, has moved to compel binding arbitration and stay the superior court matter pending a hearing on the petition. The plaintiff, Lida Sarkisian, et al., opposes the motion. The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable. However, the court denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the superior court matter. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims should not be sent to arbitration because there may be conflicting outcomes between the survivorship causes of action and the wrongful death cause of action.
