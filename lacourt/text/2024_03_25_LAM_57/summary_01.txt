And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the motion of the Pedram Defendants to strike certain portions of the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by Plaintiff Ori Blumenfeld. The SAC alleges that Blumenfeld and Defendant Brooke Mason were formerly engaged, and that Blumenfeld sold his condominium and gave Mason $350,000 in exchange for a 33.33% interest in the Subject Property. The SAC also alleges that Mason fraudulently conveyed her share of the Subject Property to the Pedram Defendants. The Pedram Defendants sought to strike certain paragraphs of the SAC, including allegations that they jointly engaged in fraud and prayers for punitive damages. The judge disagrees, finding that the allegations in Paragraph 64 of the SAC must be read in conjunction with Paragraph 61, and that those allegations contain sufficient facts to support an award of punitive damages against the Pedram Defendants under Civil Code Section 3294.
