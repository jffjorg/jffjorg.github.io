Petitioner Alejandra
Tischhauser’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability 
 
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Petitioner Alejandra
Tischhauser’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability is DENIED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a personal injury action in which Defendants Southern
California Alcohol and Drug Program, Inc. (“SCADP”) allegedly owned, maintained,
entrusted, and operated a daycare program without properly trained attendants.
(See Complaint.) As a result, minor Claimant Dashiell Hammett
(“Claimant”) suffered a skull fracture and brain bleed. (Ibid. at ¶ 70.)
 
On August 29, 2019, Claimant, through his guardian ad litem
Sahar Malek, filed an action against SCADP for negligence and vicarious
liability.
 
On May 3, 2021, Sahar Malek (“Malek”) filed an application
and order for appointment of guardian ad litem for Claimant, which was granted.
 
On November 22,
2022, Petitioner Alejandra Tischhauser (“Petitioner”) filed an application to
be substituted as Claimant’s guardian ad litem, which was granted.
 
On May 9, 2024, Claimant filed a notice of settlement.
 
On June 7, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable
Judge Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective
June 24, 2024.
 
On October 4, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant petition
for approval of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for
minor or person with a disability.
 
Legal Standard
 
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s
claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500,
3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for
approval must be presented to the court and until it is granted, there is no
final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th
1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s
guardian ad litem. (Ibid. at 1606.) 
 
Prob. Code § 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement
proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to § 3601, the order shall approve payment of
reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows: 
 
The court
making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part
thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that such
reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a
parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court
shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property
to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or incompetent person.
(Prob. Code § 3601(a).) 
 
In cases pursuant to Prob. Code § 3601, “unless the court
has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee
standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from
money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person
with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955(a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he
court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made
between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances
existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the
attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (CRC Rule 7.955(a)(2).)
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner seeks court
approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $1,000,000.00.
$2,625.76 will be paid to reimburse Medi-Cal. (MC-350 Item 12b(4)(a)-(c);
Attachment 12b(4)(c).) Attorney fees are to be deducted in the amount of
$250,000. (MC-350 Item 13a; Attachment 17a.) Additional costs are to be
deducted in the amount of $26,385.20. (MC-350 Item 13b; Attachment 13b.) In
total, Claimant will receive $720,989.04 out of the proposed $1,000,000.00
settlement amount.
 
Having reviewed the petition,
the Court finds that the settlement is fair considering the risk of going to
trial and the alleged injuries sustained by Claimant. Petitioner has satisfied
the requirements under CRC 7.950 by disclosing information that bears upon the
reasonableness of the compromise. (Mungcal Decl. Exh. A, Attachments 7 and 8c
[medical records and invoices].) Counsel provides their retainer agreement
which shows Petitioner agreed to a 25% contingency fee. (Mungcal Decl. Exh. A
Attachment 17a.)
 
The remaining balance of
$720,989.04 is to be transferred to a special needs trust (“SNT”) pursuant to
Prob. Code § 3604. Petitioner requests an order for payment of funds to a
special needs trust. (MC-350 Item 19; Attachment 19.)
 
Considering the request for a
special needs trust, the Petition is denied for the following relevant
deficiencies:
 
1.      Most notably, the
proposed order cannot be approved because of the improper nature of the current
petition which does not seek approval of the SNT instrument, appointment of
trustee, and other issues. Los Angeles Superior Court Rule 4.115 requires that the
court which has the underlying civil action review and approve the relevant SNT.
Here, the SNT was reviewed and approved by a San Diego County superior court.
2.      Petitioner failed to provide notice of hearing and
service of the Petition upon the Department of Mental Health, Department of
Developmental Services, and Department of Health Care Services. (Prob. Code §
3611(c).)
3.       Petitioner failed to provide briefing regarding trust
issues. Pursuant to Prob. Code § 3605(b), there are insufficient factual
allegations in the Petition to approve the compromise and its attachments to
support the requisite findings:
a.       The SNT beneficiary has a disability which
substantially impairs the individual’s ability to provide for her own care or
custody and constitutes a substantial handicap;
b.       The SNT beneficiary is likely to have special needs
that will not be met without the trust; and
c.       
The money to be
paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary
to meet the SNT beneficiary’s special needs.
 
Therefore, the instant
petition is denied without prejudice to allow for a new amended petition that
seeks creation and funding of the proposed SNT by this civil department as the
court that has the underlying civil action. The new amended petition should be
filed after Petitioner files proof of an order vacating the San Diego County
court’s approval of the SNT.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to confirm
minor’s compromise. 
 
The Court
further sets an OSC re Special Needs Trust and Minor’s Compromise for February
20, 2025 at 8:30am in Department B.  
 
Petitioner
to give notice.
