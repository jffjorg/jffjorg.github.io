I.      
BACKGROUND  
On September 27, 2021, Plaintiffs Adina Avila
(“Avila”), Aaron Guerra (“Guerra”), and Margarita Chavez
(“Chavez”)(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendants
Daniel Chan (“Chan”), Chanchenda Hou (“Chanchenda”), Chanvachana Hou
(“Chanvachana”), Doe Attacker, and Does 1 to 20 (collectively “Defendants”)
alleging six causes of action: (1) general negligence; (2) assault; (3) battery;
(4) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (5) negligent contact; and (6)
premises liability. Plaintiffs allege that, on or about October 29, 2019,
Defendants negligently allowed Doe Attacker on the premises where Plaintiffs
were invitees. Plaintiffs allege that Doe Attacker shot Plaintiffs several
times without justification or good cause.
On December 8, 2023, Plaintiffs identified
Carolyn Thao Nguyen as Trustee of the Nguyen Huynh Carolyn Trust dated October
11, 2018 (“Trust”), and Carolyn Nguyen (“Nguyen”)(collectively “Movants”) as
Does 1 and 2.
On February 20, 2024, Movants filed an
initial demurrer with motion to strike. On April 19, 2024, the demurrer was
sustained in part as to Plaintiffs’ second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of
action without leave to amend. The demurrer was also sustained as to the first
and sixth cause of action with leave to amend.
On May 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their first
amended complaint (“FAC”).
On June 7, 2024, the case was reassigned to
the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
On June 20, 2024, Movants and Defendant Chan
filed another demurrer to Plaintiffs’ FAC. On August 1, 2024, the demurrer was
sustained in its entirety.
On August 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
second amended complaint (“SAC”).
On September 23, 2024, Movants filed the
instant demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC.
Plaintiffs have not filed an opposition.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading that may be used to
test the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint. (Cal.
Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10.) There are two types of demurrers: general
demurrers and special demurrers. (See McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co.
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.)
General demurrers can be used to attack
pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (CCP § 430.10(e); McKenney,
167 Cal.App.4th at 77.) Such demurrers can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable; evidence or extrinsic matters are not
considered. (CCP §§ 430.30 and 430.70; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) To test the sufficiency of the cause of action, the Court admits “all
material facts properly pleaded” and “matters which may be judicially noticed,”
but does not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.
[Citation].” (Blank, 39 Cal.3d at 318.) It
gives these facts “a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its
parts in their context.” (Ibid.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need
only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual
basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to
the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.)
"If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in
the exhibits take precedence." (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001)
86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.) Special demurrers can be used to attack the
pleadings on grounds that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, and
unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to allege whether a contract
is oral or written. (CCP § 430.10(f).)
CCP §
430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a).) The parties
are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due.  (CCP § 430.41(a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (CCP § 430.41(a)(3).)
When a
demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts
upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff
an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived
of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were
defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152
Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) Generally, the court will allow leave to amend on at
least the first try, unless there is absolutely no possibility of overcoming
the issue. (See Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217,
1227 [“Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the
complaint shows on its face it is incapable of amendment. (Citation.)
Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct
any defect has not been given."].)
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer Requirement
On
September 11, 2024, defense counsel met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel
via telephone regarding the instant demurrer. (Reagan Decl. ¶ 3.) It was agreed
that defense counsel would file the instant demurrer. (Ibid.) Therefore,
Movants satisfy the meet and confer requirement pursuant to CCP § 430.41.
 
First Cause of Action
Movants
demur to Plaintiffs’ first cause of action for negligence, arguing that
Plaintiffs fail to state sufficient facts to support a showing of negligence.
(Motion p. 3:6-7.)
To support a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff
must plead facts showing that a defendant (1) owed a legal duty to plaintiff to
use due care; (2) defendant breached that duty; (3) this breach actually or
proximately caused plaintiff harm; and (4) plaintiff suffered damages as a
result. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137
Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) “Ordinarily, negligence may be pleaded in general terms
and the plaintiff need not specify the precise act or omission alleged to
constitute the breach of duty.” (Lopez v. S. Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985)
40 Cal.3d 780, 795.) “In order to state a cause of action for negligence, the
complaint must allege facts sufficient to show a legal duty on the part of the
defendant to use due care, a breach of such legal duty, and the breach as the
proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.” (Bellah v. Greenson (1978)
81 Cal.App.3d 614, 619.)
            Movants
argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient facts showing that Doe
Attacker’s violence was foreseeable. (Motion p. 6:15-26.) “[A] person
ordinarily is obligated to exercise due care in his or her own actions so as
not to create an unreasonable risk of injury to others. This legal duty
generally is owed to the class of persons who it is reasonably foreseeable may
be injured as the result of the actor’s conduct.” (McGarry v. Sax (2008)
158 Cal.App.4th 873, 994.) Here, the underlying incident occurred when tenants
at 2711 East 7th St., Long Beach, California 90804 held a birthday party for a
coworker and several gang members arrived, opening fire, killing some
individuals and wounding Plaintiffs. (Motion p. 4:3-9.) The Trust owns the
property at 2711 East 7th St. (Ibid. at 13-15.) Nguyen is the Trust’s
trustee. (Ibid.) In Plaintiffs’ SAC, Plaintiffs allege that Movants
“knew of local gang activity in the surrounding area, based upon knowledge of
prior criminal incidents at or near the subject premises including, but not
limited to, gang-related assaults, batteries, and shootings, and failed to
properly warn against or in any way attempt to prevent such activity from affecting
reasonably foreseeable invitees of the premises, such as Plaintiffs . . .” (SAC
p. 5 at ¶ 4.)
“[I]n the case of criminal conduct by a third party, an
extraordinarily high degree of foreseeability is required to impose a duty on
the landowner, in part because ‘it is difficult if not impossible in today’s
society to predict when a criminal might strike.’ [Citation.]” (Melton v.
Boustred (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 521, 532.) “In determining whether this
heightened standard of foreseeability has been established, the defendant’s
knowledge is critical.” (Ibid. at 536.) Therefore, to support a claim of
negligence against a landowner whose property suffered from third-party criminal
conduct, the plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that the
landowner had knowledge of prior criminal conduct on the property. (Ibid.)
Here, Plaintiffs’ SAC fails to allege specific incidents of criminal conduct on
Movants’ property that would make the underlying incident highly foreseeable.
Therefore, Plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to support a cause
of action for negligence against Movants. Movants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’
first cause of action is sustained.
 
Sixth Cause of Action
Movants
also demur to Plaintiffs’ sixth cause of action for premises liability, arguing
that Plaintiffs fail to state sufficient facts to support this claim. (Motion
p. 3:8-9.)
To
support a cause of action for premises liability, a plaintiff must plead facts
showing that a defendant (1) was the owner, occupant, or lessor of the subject
premises at the time of the underlying incident; (2) was negligent in the use,
maintenance, or management of the premises; and (3) such negligence was the
cause of injury, damage, loss, or harm to plaintiff. (Brooks v. Eugene
Burger Management Corp. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1619.) Factors for
determining whether a landowner owed plaintiff a duty of care includes the
foreseeability of third-party conduct on the premises. (Garcia v. Paramount Citrus
Ass’n, Inc. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1448, 1454.) Like negligence, a
landowner’s duty related to third-party criminal conduct on their premises
requires a heightened foreseeability based on prior criminal conduct. (Delgado
v. Trax Bar & Grill (2005) 36 Cal.4th 224, 245.) “Foreseeability must
be measured by what the defendant actually knew.” (Margaret W. v. Kelley R. (2006)
139 Cal.App.4th 141, 156.)
Once again, Plaintiffs fail to plead specific
facts showing that Movants knew of prior criminal conduct on the subject
premises. Instead, Plaintiffs claim that Movants knew or should have known
about “prior criminal activity at or near the premises.” (SAC p. 14 at ¶ 2.)
Therefore, Plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to support a cause
of action for premises liability against Movants. Movants’ demurrer to
Plaintiffs’ sixth cause of action is sustained.
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs
have repeatedly failed to plead facts supporting causes of action for
negligence and premises liability against Movants. Therefore, Movants’ demurrer
is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
Moving
party to give notice.
