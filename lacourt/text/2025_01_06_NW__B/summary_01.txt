And here is the summary in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for approval of a settlement between Dashiell Hammett, a minor, and Southern California Alcohol and Drug Program, Inc. The settlement amount is $1,000,000.00, with $250,000.00 going to attorney fees, $2,625.76 to Medi-Cal reimbursement, and $26,385.20 to additional costs. The remaining balance of $720,989.04 will be transferred to a special needs trust. The Petitioner, Alejandra Tischhauser, seeks court approval for the settlement.

The Judge finds that the settlement is fair, but denies the petition due to several deficiencies, including:

* The proposed order is improper and does not seek approval of the special needs trust instrument and appointment of trustee, which must be done by the court that has the underlying civil action.
* Failure to provide notice of hearing and service of the petition upon the Department of Mental Health, Department of Developmental Services, and Department of Health Care Services.
* Failure to provide briefing regarding trust issues.

The Judge sets an OSC re Special Needs Trust and Minor's Compromise for February 20, 2025, at 8:30am in Department B, and orders the Petitioner to give notice.
