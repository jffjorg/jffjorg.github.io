 Case Number:  BC724203    Hearing Date:   March 8, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.   BACKGROUND  On October  4, 2018, Plaintiff Megan Reese (“Plaintiff”) filed  this action against Defendants California Back and Pain Specialists (“Specialists”),  Nova Surgical Institute, Inc. (“Nova”), Vikram Singh, M.D. aka Vikramjeet  Singh, M.D. (“Singh”), and Does 1-100 for professional negligence.  On November  21, 2018, Nova filed an answer.  On June  1, 2022, the Court dismissed Nova with prejudice at Plaintiff’s request.  On  August 30, 2019, Specialists and Singh ("Defendants") filed an answer.  On  June 13, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as  counsel.  On  January 31, 2024, Defendants filed motions (1) to  compel Plaintiff’s responses to requests for production, set five and (2) to  compel Plaintiff’s responses to special interrogatories, set five.  The motions were set for hearing on March 8,  2024.  Plaintiff has not filed  oppositions.  Trial  is currently scheduled for April 15, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Defendants  ask the Court to compel Plaintiff to provide verified code compliant responses,  without objections, to requests for production of documents, set five, and  special interrogatories, set five.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Inspection demand  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides:  “If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the  following rules shall apply:  “(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under  Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party making the demand may move for an order  compelling response to the demand.  “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order  compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including  the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in  addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional  circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney  of a party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has  been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good  faith operation of an electronic information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2031.300.)  B.   Interrogatories  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:  “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails  to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code  Civ.
