```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Jose Dennis Callejas Reyes's motion to compel Defendant Milestone Haulers Inc's further responses to request for production of documents, set three, and request for sanctions. The Court finds that the surveillance evidence is work product because Milestone's counsel directed its creation, and Milestone has not shown that denial of disclosure will unfairly prejudice Plaintiff or result in an injustice.
