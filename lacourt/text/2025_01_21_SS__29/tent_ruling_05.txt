Background
On September 19, 2022, Denise Ruan and Sophia Ruan (collectively
“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Andy Amador (“Defendant”) and Does 1
through 20, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general
negligence arising out of an alleged accident on September 19, 2020.
 
On March 21, 2024, Defendant filed an answer. 
 
On December 4, 2024, Defendant filed these
three motions to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to written discovery. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not
provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
“In addition to
the number of interrogatories permitted by Sections 2030.030 and 2030.040, a
party may propound a supplemental interrogatory to elicit any later acquired
information bearing on all answers previously made by any party in response to
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070, subd. (a).)
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) 
“In addition to
the demands for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling permitted by this
chapter, a party may propound a supplemental demand to inspect, copy, test, or
sample any later acquired or discovered documents, tangible things, land or
other property, or electronically stored information in the possession,
custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.050, subd. (a).)
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant moves
for an order compelling Plaintiffs to respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for Production of Documents, Set
One. 
On March 21,
2024, Defendant propounded the written discovery in question on Plaintiffs. (Reed
Decls., ¶ 2; see also Exhs. A.) Plaintiffs failed to respond to discovery. (Id.,
¶ 4.) 
Defendant need
show nothing more.
Accordingly, Defendant’s
motions for an order compelling Plaintiffs to respond to Form Interrogatories,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for Production of
Documents, Set One, are GRANTED. 
The Court notes, however, that each
set of discovery requests should have been the subject of a separate
motion.  By grouping Plaintiffs together,
Defendant filed three motions for what should have been six motions. Combining
discovery motions allows the moving party to avoid paying the requisite filing
fees. Filing fees are jurisdictional and it is mandatory for court clerks to
demand and receive them. (See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114
Cal.App.4th 457, 460.) Thus, Defendants are ordered to pay additional filing
fees. 
As for sanctions, in the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act governing
interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has authorized
sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) &
2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, Plaintiffs have not opposed the motion, and thus the
requests for sanctions are denied.
