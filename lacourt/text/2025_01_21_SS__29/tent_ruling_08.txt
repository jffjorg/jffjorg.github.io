Background
On February 16, 2023, Kejenae Brooks (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Noel Arreola Zamora (“Zamora”), Alma Arely Robles (“Defendant”),
and Does 1 through 20, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence
and general negligence arising out of an alleged accident on March 5, 2021.
 
On March 20, 2024, Defendant filed an answer. On April 3,
2024, Zamora filed an answer.
 
On December 2, 2024, the Court granted the motion to
intervene filed by Integon Preferred Insurance Company (“Integon”).  Integon filed its answer in intervention on
December 3.
 
On October 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed these
three motions to compel.  Plaintiff filed
amended notices of motion on November 15,
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not
provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves
for orders compelling Defendant to respond to form interrogatories, special
interrogatories, and requests for production.
On April 22,
2024, Plaintiff propounded the written discovery in question on Defendant. (Zurita-Cruz
Decls., ¶ 3; see also Exhs. 1.) Defendant failed to respond to discovery. (Id.,
¶ 8.) 
For the motion
to compel responses to Requests for Production (Set One), the proof of service
attached to the discovery does not match, as it is a proof of service for another
document in another case. As Plaintiff has not provided a proof of service for
this discovery, the Court must deny, without prejudice, the motion to compel
Defendant to respond to the requests for production.
For the motions
to compel responses to the interrogatories, all substantive and procedural
requirements are satisfied.  The motions
are granted.
As for sanctions, in the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act governing
interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has authorized
sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) &
2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, Defendant has not opposed the motion, and thus the
requesrts for sanctions are denied
Conclusion
The
Court GRANTS the motions to compel responses to the form interrogatories and
the special interrogatories.  
 
The
Court DENIES without the prejudice the motion to compel responses to the
requests for production.
