The judge's tentative ruling denies the City of Los Angeles' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The City argued that the allegations against it in the complaint were insufficient to state a cause of action, but the judge found that the allegations against the City must be accepted as true and that the City is not absolved of all potential liability even if Metro, the operator of the bus, is the primary cause of the plaintiff's injuries. The plaintiff, Elio Vallecillo Rivera, was injured on September 19, 2022, while riding or exiting a bus operated by Metro. The case is scheduled for trial on February 19, 2025.
