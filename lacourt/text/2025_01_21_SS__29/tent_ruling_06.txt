 Case Number:  22STCV31739    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  29 C.M. v. Burbank
Unified School District
22STCV31739
Expedited Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise as to Claimant Criston
Montova (Age 16)
 
Tentative 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
Petitioner filed a petition on December
20, 2024 for approval of a minor’s compromise for Claimant Criston Montova.
 
The Court notes that there are
several issues that must be addressed before the petition can be granted.
 
First, Item 1 on proposed orders
filed on forms MC-351 and MC-355 lists the incorrect department.
 
Second, total fees are summarized in Item 8a(1); they
should be split between attorney’s fees and costs on Items 8a(1) and 8a(2).
Item 8a(4) including costs leads to the potential for double payment of costs.
Item 8b(1)  and 9a both appear to list
the incorrect amount to be disbursed.
 
Third, no Attachment 8 was filed
and thus the petition does not meet the requirements of showing “a diagnosis of
the claimant's injuries or a prognosis for the claimant's recovery, and a
report of the claimant's current condition.”
 
Fourth, no attorney declaration has been filed.
 
Last, no Attachment 18a(2) has been included.
 
Accordingly,
the Petition for Criston Montova is CONTINUED to __/__/2025 at 1:30 PM  in DEPT. 29 at SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. 
 
Moving
party to give notice.
