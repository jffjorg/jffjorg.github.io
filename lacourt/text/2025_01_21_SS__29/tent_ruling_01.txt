  Case Number:  20STCV29835    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  29 Castillo-Revolorio
v. Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center
20STCV29835
Petition for
Approval of Minor’s Compromise as to Claimant Nathan Amaya-Castillo (Age 5).
 
Tentative 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
Petitioner filed a petition on December
30, 2024 for approval of a minor’s compromise for Claimant Nathan
Amaya-Castillo.
 
The Court notes that there are
several issues that must be addressed before the petition can be granted.
 
First, no proposed order on form
MC-351 was filed.
 
Second, Attachment 8 does not meet
the requirements of showing “a diagnosis of the claimant's injuries or a
prognosis for the claimant's recovery, and a report of the claimant's current
condition.”
 
Third, Attachment 11b(3) and 11b(6)
states the total settlement is $150,000, with Claimant to receive $142,000 and
Petitioner to receive $8,000; this does not match the numbers for the rest of
the petition. 
 
Fourth, Item 13b is incorrectly
filed out, as it is totaled with 13a. Total listed should be $3,757, not
$51,985.
 
Fifth,
no attorney
declaration or legal retainer agreement has been attached.
 
Sixth, Petitioner selects both options on Item 14,
stating that Petitioner paid and did not pay expenses. Only one can be correct.
 
Last, Petitioner lists $90,015 to be deposited into an
annuity. However, this amount does not match the balance as listed on Item
16(f), which in turn does not match the net balance on Item 15. 
 
Accordingly, the Petition for Nathan
Amaya-Castillo is CONTINUED to __/__/2025 at 1:30 PM  in DEPT. 29 at SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.Moving party to give notice.
