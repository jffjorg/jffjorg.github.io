And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to written discovery. The defendant filed three motions to compel on December 4, 2024, but the plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests. The Judge grants the motions and orders the plaintiff to serve written, verified, code-compliant responses to the defendant's Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production within 15 days of notice. The Judge also orders the defendant to pay three additional filing fees to the Clerk of the Court within 15 days of the hearing. The Judge denies the defendant's requests for sanctions, as the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion.
