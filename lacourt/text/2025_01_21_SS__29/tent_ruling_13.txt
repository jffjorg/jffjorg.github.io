23STCV19504
Defendant’s Motion to Continue Trial
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On August 15, 2023, Alice Arabyan Ploozian (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Harvey Prince, Suzanne
Prince, and Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of action for (1) motor
vehicle negligence, (2) negligence per se, (3) intentional infliction of
emotional distress, and (4) negligent entrustment, arising out of an alleged
accident on March 23, 2022.
 
On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff amended
the complaint to name Prince Family Trust as Doe 1.
 
On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against the same defendants asserting the
same four causes of action. 
 
On December 29, 2023, Defendants
Harvey Prince and Suzanne Prince filed an answer to the FAC.
 
On January 12, 2024, the Prince
Family Trust filed an answer to the FAC.
 
On January 26, 2024, Harvey Prince died.  (Motion, Exh. A.)
 
On August 22, 2024, counsel filed a motion for summary
adjudication on behalf of Harvey Prince. 
The motion was noticed for hearing on November 13, 2024, in Department
30 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  On
the date of the hearing, counsel learned that Department 30 had been closed, and
the case reassigned to a new department.
 
On December 16, 2024, counsel filed a new motion for
summary adjudication on behalf of Harvey Prince.  The motion was noticed for hearing on July
15, 2025.
 
Trial is set for February 11, 2025.
 
On December 18, 2024, Defendant Suzanne Prince
(“Defendant”) filed this motion to continue this matter. 
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Defendant seeks to
continue trial until after the hearing on the summary adjudication motion filed
on behalf of co-defendant Harvey Prince, scheduled for July 15, 2025.
Harvey Prince,
however, is deceased.  The Court has no
jurisdiction to enter judgment in his favor or against him.  (Herring v. Peterson (1981) 116
Cal.App.3d 608, 611–612.)  Moreover, when
a client dies, the power of the attorney to act on behalf of the client
terminates.  (Id. at p. 612.)  These raises substantial questions regarding
whether the summary adjudication motion was properly filed.
When
a defendant dies, a plaintiff may file a motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 377.41 to continue the action against the decedent’s personal
representative or successor in interest. 
Or the plaintiff may elect to proceed against an insured decedent under
the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.50 and Probate Code
sections 550 through 554.  
So
far, Plaintiff has not exercised either option. 
Unless Plaintiff does so, trial will proceed against only the other
defendants, as the court has no jurisdiction over a deceased party.  But the filing of a summary adjudication motion
on behalf of a deceased party is not itself an action that provides good cause
to continue trial.  And Defendant does
not offer any other reason for trial to be continued.
Accordingly,
the motion to continue trial is denied.
In
addition, now that the Court has been informed that one of the defendants has
died, the Court sets an Order to Show Cause regarding whether that defendant
should be dismissed without prejudice, and the motion for summary adjudication filed
on behalf of the deceased defendant should be placed off calendar.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to continue trial.
 
The Court SETS an Order to Show Cause regarding why (1) the
causes of action asserted in the First Amended Complaint against Defendant
Harvey Prince, now deceased, should be dismissed without prejudice; and (2) the
motion for summary adjudication filed on behalf of Defendant Harvey Prince
should be placed off calendar.  The
hearing on the OSC is set for 2/11/25 at 8:30 am in Department 29 of the Spring
Street Courthouse.
 
Any response to the OSC must be filed and served no later
than January 30, 2025.
 
The Court ORDERS counsel for all parties to meet and
confer regarding the status of the causes of action asserted against Harvey
Prince by no later than January 28, 2025.
 
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
