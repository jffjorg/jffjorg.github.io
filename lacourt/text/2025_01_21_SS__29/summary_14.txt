And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to continue the trial without prejudice. The motion was filed on December 17, 2024, citing two grounds: (1) to allow the Defendant to file a summary judgment motion, and (2) due to a conflict in the schedule of trial counsel. The Judge found that the first ground has no basis, as there is no pending summary judgment motion. The second ground was denied because the mere possibility of a conflict in trial counsel's schedule is not sufficient grounds to continue the trial. The Judge noted that the Court respects the right of the Defendant to choose its trial counsel, and that if the trial counsel is actively engaged in another trial on the day of the trial, the matter may need to be continued or trailed until the other trial is completed.
