On March 15, 2023, Pinky Smith (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Global Paratransit, Inc. and Esmeralda Herrera (collectively
“Defendants”) for motor vehicle negligence cause of action arising out of an
automobile accident occurring on April 28, 2022.
On June 2, 2023, Defendants filed an answer.

Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be relieved as counsel of record
for Plaintiff. Counsel has timely served all parties in this matter including
Plaintiff at his confirmed address. Counsel contends there has been a breakdown
in the attorney client relationship.
All substantive
and procedural requirements for the motion are satisfied.  The motion is granted.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the motion to be relieved as counsel.
The order is
effective upon filing with the Court of a proof of service showing service of
the signed order (not just the Minute Order) on the client.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
