23STCV12059
Motion for Judgment on Pleadings Filed by City of Los Angeles


Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On May 30, 2023, Elio Vallecillo Rivera (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“Metro”) and Does 1 through 20 asserting a cause of action for “negligence
and statutory liability” arising out of an incident on September 19, 2022, in which
Plaintiff alleges that he was injured while riding on or exiting a bus.
 
On July 21, 2023, Metro filed an answer to the complaint.

 
On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to
name City of Los Angeles (“City”) as Doe 1.
 
Plaintiff failed to submit a timely claim to Metro under
the Government Claims Act.  On November
17, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s petition for permission to file a late
tort claim.
 
On January 4, 2024, City filed an answer to the complaint
and also filed a cross-complaint against Metro and Does 1 through 10.
 
On February 2, 2024, Metro filed an answer to City’s
cross-complaint.
 
On June 4, 2024, the Court granted Metro’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings in relation to the complaint.  On August 7, 2024, the Court entered judgment
in favor of Metro and against Plaintiff on the complaint.
 
On November 18, 2024, City filed a request to dismiss its
cross-complaint against Metro.
 
On November 6, 2024, City filed a motion for judgment on
the pleadings.  The motion was noticed for
hearing on December 2, 2024.  On November
7, the Court denied City’s ex parte application to shorten time on the hearing.  On December 2, the Court denied City’s motion,
on procedural grounds, as the notice of the motion was untimely.
 
On December 4, 2024, City filed this new motion for
judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiff filed an opposition on January 8, 2025.
 
Trial is scheduled for February 19, 2025.
 
Legal Standard
A
defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings when the “complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii).) 
“A motion for judgment on the
pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks
only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper
on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman
Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)  “The standard for granting a motion
for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a
general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with
matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322; accord Los Angeles Unified School
Dist. v. Torres Construction Corp. (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 480,
494; Templo v.
State (2018) 24
Cal.App.5th 730, 735; Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216; see also 1 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial [2024] ¶ 7:275.) 
 
California practice recognizes
two types of motions for judgment on the pleadings.  First, there is a statutory motion, which
must be filed within certain time limits and which is subject to a statutory
meet-and-confer requirement.  Second,
there is a nonstatutory motion for judgment on the pleadings, which “may be
made at any time either prior to the trial or at the trial itself.”  (Ion
Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877.)    
 
Discussion
City brings this
nonstatutory motion for judgment on the pleadings, asserting that the
allegations against it (as Doe 1) in the complaint are insufficient to state a
cause of action.  In ruling on this
motion, the Court must apply the same standard as it would in ruling on a demurrer.  All reasonable inferences must be
drawn in favor of the pleading.  (Schifando
v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 104.)  The Court must “liberally construe the
pleading” and “give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a
whole and its parts in context.”  (Id.
at p. 105.)  Even “improbable” facts
alleged in the pleading must be accepted as true.  (Id.  at pp. 104-105.)
City’s argument is that Plaintiff’s injury occurred while Plaintiff was
riding or exiting a bus operated by Metro. 
In support of this argument, City cites various documents, of which City
requests that the Court take judicial notice, and City argues that it and Metro
are separate legal entities.  
As a threshold matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff has not filed a
proper request for judicial notice, which should be a separately filed and
captioned document.
In any event, even if the Court were to take judicial notice of the
documents cited (which the Court declines to do), it would not change the
result.  Plaintiff has alleged (among other
things) that City (as Doe 1) owned, leased, or rented the bus at issue and
authorized Metro to transport Plaintiff in the bus.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 11-12.)  On a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
the Court must accept these allegations as true.  Even if Metro is also a cause of Plaintiff’s
injuries, and even if Metro is the primary cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, this
does not absolve City of all potential liability.    
Accordingly, the motion is denied.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
City’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
