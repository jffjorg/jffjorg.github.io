On December 30, 2021, Blanca Reyes

Esmailian, DDS, Santo Tomas Dental Group, and Does 1 through 100, asserting a
cause of action for medical negligence arising out of a dental procedure performed

(erroneously sued as Lari Soman Esmailian, DDS) filed an answer to the
complaint. 
On January 31, 2022, Soo J. Chang, DDS (“Defendant”
or “Chang”) filed an answer to complaint. 
On February 15, 2022, Evan Farr DDS, Inc dba
Santo Tomas Dental Group (erroneously sued as Santo Tomas Dental Group) filed
an answer to the complaint.
As is relevant to the matter set for hearing
on January 21, 2025, Defendant Chang filed a motion for summary judgment on
July 13, 2023.  The motion was set for
hearing on August 16, 2024.  Attached to
the motion is a proof of service showing that all counsel (including
Plaintiff’s counsel) were served electronically on June 30, 2023.
On July 18, 2023, Defendant Chang filed a
motion to continue trial.  As grounds, Defendant
specifically identified the summary judgment motion that was set for hearing on
August 16, 2024.  Attached to the motion
is a proof of service showing that all counsel (including Plaintiff’s counsel)
were served electronically on July 18, 2023. 
The motion was subsequently taken off calendar by the moving party.
On August 8, 2023, Defendant Chang filed an
ex parte application to continue trial. 
As grounds, Defendant specifically identified the summary judgment
motion that was set for hearing on August 16, 2024.  Attached to the application is a proof of
service showing that all counsel (including Plaintiff’s counsel) were served
electronically on August 8, 2023.  The
application was granted on August 9, 2023. 
Moving party gave notice on August 10, 2023.
Plaintiff did not file any opposition to
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. 
The Court heard and granted the motion on August 16, 2024.  Notice of ruling was served on September 12,
2024.
A judgment in favor of Defendant was entered
on October 14, 2024.  Notice of the
judgment was given by mail and electronically on October 22, 2024.
On December 6, 2024,
Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the judgment entered in favor of Defendant
Chang.  Plaintiff filed a notice of
errata on December 10.  The motion was
set for hearing on January 14, 2025, in Department 32.
Defendant filed
an opposition on January 7, 2025. 
Upon the closure
of Department 32, this case was transferred to Department 29.  The Court, on its own motion, continued the
hearing to January 21, 2025.
Discussion
Plaintiff seeks
relief under both the mandatory and discretionary provisions of Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).  
The basis of
Plaintiff’s motion is, in large part, that Plaintiff’s counsel was never served
with Defendant’s summary judgment motion, and that the proof of service of the
motion filed with the Court is not accurate. 
If there was no effective service, both the order granting Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment and the resulting judgment are void and should be
set aside under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d).
The Court, on
its own motion, continues the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for approximately 21
days.
In addition, the
Court, on its own motion, also sets an Order to Show Cause regarding whether
the Minute Order granting Defendant’s summary judgment motion (dated August 16,
2024) and the Judgment in favor of Defendant (dated October 14, 2024) should be
set aside and vacated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(d).
Any responses the
OSC must be filed and served at least nine court days in advance of the OSC
hearing.  Any reply to any response must
be filed and served at least five court days in advance of the OSC hearing.

The Court
CONTINUES the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to February __, 2025, at 1:30 pm,
