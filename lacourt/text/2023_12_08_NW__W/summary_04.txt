And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Rachel Zovar's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production Set One and Special Interrogatories. The Plaintiff had requested further responses from Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. regarding the alleged Sensing Defect in a 2020 Honda CR-V leased by the Plaintiff.

The Judge found that the Defendant's responses to the Requests for Production were incomplete and did not address the Plaintiff's requests. The Judge ordered the Defendant to provide further responses regarding complaints about similar vehicles and warranty repairs.

The Judge also denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant, finding that both parties had substantial justification for their actions.

The Judge's ruling is based on the Song-Beverly Act and California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 2030.300 and 2031.310, and cites several case law precedents, including Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216, Donlen v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, and Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967.
