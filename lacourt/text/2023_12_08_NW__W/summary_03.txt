**English Summary**

The Tentative Ruling grants the Defendants' Motion for an Award of Attorney Fees to the Prevailing Party upon Contract and Statute's, seeking $53,079.15 in attorney fees. The court finds that the Defendants are entitled to attorney fees as the prevailing party, and that the fees are reasonable and proper, excluding the $6,000.00 in fees with predecessor counsel. The court rejects the Plaintiffs' arguments that the attorney fees are not reasonable and that the defense counsel has acted in bad faith. The court concludes that the Plaintiffs' claims arose out of a commercial lease agreement, and that Paragraph 31 of the agreement provides for a broad fees provision for "full[] reimbursement" of actual reasonable attorney's fees incurred without limitation by any court fee schedule.
