Here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge W MELVY CARDONA on a motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Defendant 14732 Blythe Associates L.L.C. The motion seeks to determine whether the settlement reached between Defendant 14732 Blythe Associates L.L.C. and the Plaintiffs (Melvy Cardona, Felipe Argueta, Ever Carbajal, Maymarie Carbajal, Melanie Carbajal, Michael Carbajal, Bella Rodriguez, Chanel Carbajal, and Mason Cardona) was made in good faith.

The Judge finds that the settlement was made in good faith, as it satisfies the factors outlined in California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, including the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds, and the recognition that the settling defendant should pay less than it would if it were found liable after a trial. The Judge also notes that the settlement exceeds the Plaintiffs' claimed damages and that the Defendant 14732 Blythe Associates L.L.C. claimed it settled to avoid litigation costs and uncertainties.

The Judge rejects the arguments made by SFV Portfolio, the opposing party, that the settlement is not reasonable, citing the lack of evidence that the Defendant 14732 Blythe Associates L.L.C. might be found liable for punitive damages and that the settlement compensates the Plaintiffs for some of their potential attorneys' fees. The Judge also notes that the failure to provide information regarding the amount paid in settlement to each Plaintiff does not preclude a good faith settlement.
