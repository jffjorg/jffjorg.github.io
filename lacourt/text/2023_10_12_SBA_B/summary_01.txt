```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Tesla, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration of plaintiff Veera Raja Suresh Babu Kollipara's claims without prejudice. The motion is denied because, as currently situated, there is no entity named "Tesla, Inc." in the complaint nor served with the complaint. The only named and served defendant is an entity named Tesla Motors, Inc. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling. The motion may be refiled by the named defendant if the defendant is properly named and identified by the plaintiff.
