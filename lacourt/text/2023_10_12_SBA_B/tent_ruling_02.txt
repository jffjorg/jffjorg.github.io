1.     
City National
Bank’s Demurrer to Complaint  
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

City National Bank’s Demurrer to Complaint is overruled.

 
Background 
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on April 3, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Defendant breached the commercial lease agreement
by failing to pay operating expenses. Plaintiff alleges causes of action for
Breach of Contract and Common Counts.  
 
Meet and Confer
             
            Defendant set forth a meet and
confer declaration in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41.  (Decl., Bradley E. Jewett.)  
 
            Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
Defendant demurs to the Complaint and both
causes of action for failure to state sufficient facts to state a cause of
action.
First Cause of Action for Breach of Contract 

Defendant’s demurrer to the first cause of action is overruled.
Plaintiff states facts sufficient to state a cause of action. 
 
“The elements of a cause of action for breach of
contract are: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to
plaintiff.” Coles v. Glaser (2016) 2
Cal.App.5th 384, 391(internal quotations omitted). “[T]he complaint must
indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by
conduct. [...] If the action is based on an alleged breach of a written
contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a
copy of the written instrument must be attached and incorporated by reference.”
Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452,
458–59.
 
A cause of action for breach of written contract
contains a four-year statute of limitations. Code Civ. Proc., § 337(a).
 
Plaintiff has attached the written lease agreement and
alleged facts to meet the elements of the cause of action. (Complaint, ¶¶ BC-1
to BC-5.)  Defendant argues that
Plaintiff has not pled Plaintiff’s performance of the conditions of the
contract. However, Plaintiff did allege such performance. (Complaint, ¶ BC-3.)  Whether Plaintiff did or did not perform is a
question of fact that is not appropriate for adjudication with a demurrer.
 
Second, Defendant argues that the cause of action is
barred by the statute of limitations because Plaintiff seeks operating expenses
dating back from 2004 to the present. However, Plaintiff has alleged that the
breach occurred on May 1, 2020.  In
opposition, Plaintiff contends that no breach could have occurred until after
Plaintiff gave notice of the deficiency which Plaintiff states did not occur
until 2020.  Thus, the face of the
allegations of the pleadings do not reveal a bar based on the statute of
limitations.  The question of whether the
claim is barred by the statute of limitations is an issue of fact that cannot
be adjudicated with a demurrer. 
 
Thus, Defendant’s demurrer to the first cause of
action is overruled. 
 
Second Cause of Action for Common Counts
 
Defendant’s demurrer to the second cause of action is
overruled. Plaintiff states facts sufficient to state a cause of action. 
 
“A common count is not a specific cause of action ...;
rather, it is a simplified form of pleading normally used to aver the existence
of various forms of monetary indebtedness, including that arising from an
alleged duty to make restitution under an assumpsit theory.”  Avidor
v. Sutter's Place, Inc. (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1454 (internal
citations and quotations omitted). 
 
“The averment of an indebtedness not by stating the
actual ultimate facts in each particular case, but by using one of a series of
generalized forms consisting in part of legal conclusions, is directly opposed
to a basic principle of code pleading. Nevertheless, when the codes were
adopted the familiarity of lawyers with the form, and its simplicity and
convenience, were sufficient to overcome this objection. And today in nearly
all code states and in the federal practice the common counts are permissible and
widely used. In California, it is settled that they are good against special as
well as general demurrers.” Interstate
Group Administrators, Inc. v. Cravens, Dargan & Co. (1985) 174
Cal.App.3d 700, 707, fn. 2 (internal quotation and citation omitted).
 
“When a common count is used as an alternative way of
seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause of action, and is based
on the same facts, the common count is demurrable if the cause of action is
demurrable.” McBride v. Boughton
(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 394.
 
Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant owes money on an
account stated/open book account. As noted above, a common count is a distinct
cause of action from breach of contract and can be pled as an alternative
manner to seek recovery. The demurrer to the cause of action fails for the same
reasons noted above.
 
The demurrer to the second cause of action is
overruled.
 
            Defendant is ordered to file and
serve an Answer within 10 days of this date.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
