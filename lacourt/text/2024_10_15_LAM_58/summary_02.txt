Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion to quash an order for a third-party examination, filed by Levon Gugasian. The order was signed on June 21, 2024, and Gugasian was served with the order on July 3, 2024. The plaintiff, Levon Mgrdichian, obtained a judgment against the defendant, Tony Mavusi, on March 29, 2024. Gugasian claims that the order lacks specificity in describing the property or debt he controls, and that the plaintiff failed to tender fees for mileage. The Judge finds that the order does not adequately describe the property or debt, and that the plaintiff did not tender fees for mileage. The Judge also finds that the proof of service on the defendant was not filed. Based on these findings, the Judge grants the motion to quash the order without prejudice.
