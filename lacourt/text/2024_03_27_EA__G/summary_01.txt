Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by the Judge continues the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike by the Kiewit-Parsons Defendants, citing a failure to meet and confer with the Plaintiffs' counsel. The Judge orders the Defendants' counsel to meet and confer with the Plaintiffs' counsel regarding the demurrer and motion to strike and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing. The case is a wrongful death action arising from a motor vehicle collision, and the Plaintiffs are seeking damages, including punitive damages. The Defendants are seeking to strike the punitive damages and have demurred to several of the Plaintiffs' causes of action.
