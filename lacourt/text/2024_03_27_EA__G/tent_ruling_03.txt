BACKGROUND This is an action for fraud  and breach of contract initially commenced on July 13, 2018. On January 31,  2020, Plaintiff Sun Bees Groups Inc. (Sun Bees) filed the operative Third  Amended Complaint (TAC) against Defendants Soulie Elkarake, Kooly Solar Energy  LLC (Kooly), Great Energy Solar Solution LLC (Great Energy LLC), Great Energy  Solutions Inc. (Great Energy Inc.), and Does 1-20, alleging the following  causes of action: (1) intentional misrepresentation, (2) concealment, (3)  constructive fraud, (4) breach of contract, (5) unjust enrichment, (6) breach  of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (7) violation of Business  and Professions Code section 17200. After a non-jury trial on  January 17, 2024, the court issued a judgment in favor Sun Bees on February 6  that awarded Sun Bees $30,000 in damages. On February 8, 2024, Sun Bees  filed the present motion. A hearing on the motion is set for March 27. ANALYSIS Sun  Bees moves the court for an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs in the  amount of $8,731.59. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS Sun  Bees’ motion. Legal  Standard “Except  as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and  mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the  agreement, express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or  proceedings are entitled to their costs . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.) The prevailing party on a contract which specifically provides for attorney  fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement is entitled to reasonable  attorney fees in addition to other costs. (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a); Code  Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).) The court, upon notice and  motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an  element of the costs of suit, the reasonable attorney fees. (Civ. Code, § 1717,  subd. (a), (b).) “The  amount to be awarded to a party as attorney fees is a matter within the sound  discretion of the trial judge.” (Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v. Westway  Contractors, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 152, 168.) In determining the  reasonableness of an attorney fees award, the court considers “the nature,  difficulty, intricacy and importance of the litigation, the amount involved,  the skill required and success of the attorney's efforts, his or her learning,  age and experience, and the time consumed.” (Id., at p. 169.) Discussion In  this case, the court previously found Sun Bees was entitled to reasonable  attorney fees and costs pursuant to paragraph (K) of a confidential settlement  agreement. (1/17/2024 Minute Order, p. 2.) Thus, the court now considers  whether Sun Bees’ requested attorney fees and costs are reasonable. Reasonableness  of Hourly Rate To  determine if an hourly rate is reasonable, courts consider the rates of similar  attorneys in the community as well as “the experience, skill, and reputation of  the attorney requesting fees.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy  (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.) In  this case, Sun Bees’ counsel requested an hourly rate of $400. In support of  this request, counsel provided a declaration describing counsel’s experience. (Carter  Decl., ¶ 6.) Counsel also requested an hourly rate of $150 for counsel’s  paralegal. (Carter Decl., ¶ 6.) Based upon the information provided and the  court’s own experience, the court finds an hourly rate of $400 for counsel and  $150 for counsel’s paralegal to be reasonable. Reasonableness  of Hours Billed Although  a verified fee bill is “prima facie evidence the costs, expenses and services  listed were necessarily incurred,” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167  Cal.App.3d 677, 682), counsel still has the burden to demonstrate the  reasonableness of charges. (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC  (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 247.) Here, Sun Bees requests fees for a total of  19.7 hours spent by counsel and 3.2 hours spent by counsel’s paralegal. The  court addresses each category of requests below. Communications Sun Bees  requests $480 in attorney fees for 1.2 hours spent by counsel on client or  opposing party communications including 0.2 hours for communications regarding  the breach of the settlement agreement on March 21, 2023; 0.1 hours for emailing  Sun Bees on April 11; 0.1 hours for emailing Sun Bees case updates on May 26; 0.1  hours for telephone calls with Sun Bees on July 7; 0.2 hours for brief telephone  call with Sun Bees on August 4; 0.3 hours for telephone call with Sun Bees on  November 28; and 0.2 hours for telephone call with Sun Bees on December 19. Sun Bees also  requests $75 in fees for 0.5 hours spent by counsel’s paralegal on client or  opposing party communications including 0.3 hours for emailing Sun Bees case  updates on May 18, 2023, and 0.2 hours for emailing Sun Bees case updates on  December 14. The court  finds these requested hours to be reasonable. Case  Preparation Sun Bees  requests $800 in attorney fees for 2.0 hours spent on case preparation by  counsel including 0.5 hours for case review on May 15, 2023; 0.2 hours for case  discussion with team on September 15; and 1.3 hours for drafting of proposed  judgment on January 24, 2024. Sun Bees also  requests $405 in fees for 2.7 hours spent by counsel’s paralegal on case  preparation including 0.8 hours for preparing notice of ruling on April 21,  2023; 0.2 hours for updating calendar with upcoming hearings on August 7; 0.6  hours for preparing notice of ruling on October 23; 0.8 hours for preparing exhibit  list and witness list on January 11, 2024; and 0.3 hours for review and  calendaring of minute order on January 24, 2024. Based upon  the brevity of the April 21, 2023 notice of ruling, the court finds 0.8 hours  to be excessive and reduces the requested amount to 0.5 hours. For the same  reasons, the court also reduces the hours spent on the October 23, 2023 notice  of ruling from 0.6 hours to 0.5 hours. The court also reduces the time  requested for drafting the proposed judgment from 1.3 hours to 1.0 hour. Last,  the court reduces the time spent calendaring hearing dates from 0.2 hours and  0.3 hours to 0.1 hours and 0.1 hours respectively. Accordingly,  the court finds the total number of reasonable hours spent on case preparation  to be 1.7 hours spent by counsel and 2.0 hours spent by counsel’s paralegal. Motion  Drafting Sun Bees  requests $3,120 in attorney fees for 7.8 hours spent by counsel on motion  drafting including 3.1 hours for drafting an ex parte application to continue  trial and 4.7 hours for drafting the present motion. Based upon a review of  these filings, the court reduces the total number of hours awarded to 2.0 hours  for drafting the ex parte application and 2.0 hours for drafting the present  motion for a total reasonable amount of 4.0 hours. Time  Spent Attending Hearings Sun Bees  requests $3,480 in attorney fees for 8.7 hours spent by counsel attending court  hearings including 0.6 hours for attending a status conference remotely on  April 17, 2023; 1.3 hours for attending a settlement hearing in person on July  25; 1.2 hours for attending an OSC hearing remotely on August 17; 1.4 hours for  attending a scheduled non-jury trial in person on October 20; 2.2 hours for  attending a scheduled non-jury trial in person on January 17, 2024; and 2.0  hours for attending a hearing on the present motion. After reducing the hours  for the hearing on the present motion from 2.0 hours to 0.5 hours, the court  finds the total number of reasonable hours requested is 7.2 hours. Accordingly,  the court GRANTS Sun Bees’ request for attorney fees and awards  attorney fees in the reasonable amount of $6,015, including $5,640 in fees for 14.1  hours of work at counsel’s reasonable rate of $400 per hour and $375 for 2.5  hours of paralegal work at a rate of $150 per hour. Costs Sun Bees also  requests the award of $371.59 in costs including $13.11 in filing fees for notice  of ruling on April 21, 2023; $240 in service fees for the service of cease and  desist letter; $2.00 in fees for copy of minute order on September 29; $13.12 in  filing fees for notice of ruling on October 23, 2023; $74.92 in filing fees for  ex parte application; $14.22 in filing fees for exhibit list and witness list;  and $14.22 in filing fees for filing of judgment. Because the  court finds these requested costs are reasonable, Sun Bees’ request is GRANTED. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Sun  Bees’ motion for attorney fees and costs is GRANTED in the reduced  amount of $6,015 in attorney fees and $371.59 in costs.
