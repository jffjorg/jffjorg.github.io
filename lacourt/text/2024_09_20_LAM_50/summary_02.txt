Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff, Francisco Javier Nunez, alleges that the defendant, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., failed to fully respond to his discovery requests and is seeking an order compelling the defendant to provide further responses. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiff failed to participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) prior to filing the motion and that the motion is untimely.

The judge found that the defendant's response to the discovery requests was inadequate and that the plaintiff's motion was timely. However, the judge denied the motion as the plaintiff failed to provide evidence of good cause justifying the discovery sought. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's counsel attempted to meet and confer with the defendant's counsel regarding the discovery disputes, but the defendant failed to respond to the attempts.

The judge ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
