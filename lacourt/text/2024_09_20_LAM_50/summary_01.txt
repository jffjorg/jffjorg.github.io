And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is reviewing a joint stipulation requesting approval of a representative PAGA settlement between Plaintiff Cy Kishiyama and Defendants Guckenheimer Enterprises Inc. and Guckenheimer Services, LLC. The settlement agreement provides for a Gross Settlement Amount of $270,000.00, but the parties have since revised this amount to $392,580.00. The Judge notes that the parties have not addressed certain defects in the settlement agreement, including the definition of "PAGA Period" and "Aggrieved Employee," and the calculation of the Gross Settlement Amount. The Judge also notes that the parties have failed to provide evidence that no objection was received to the settlement or joint stipulation. The Judge orders the parties to file supplemental papers addressing these issues by a certain date. The Judge also notes that the second amended proposed order references "Defendants' funding of the Gross Settlement Amount of $392,580..." but the settlement agreement provides that "Guckenheimer promises to pay $270,000.00 and no more as the Gross Settlement Amount." The Judge concludes that the parties are ordered to file supplemental papers addressing the above issues.
