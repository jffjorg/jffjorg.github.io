  ORDER RE: 
 
KATE GELLER’S
  MOTION FOR AN AWARD OF FEES AND COSTS




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTIONS


 



 
Background 
Plaintiff Kate Geller
(“Geller”) filed this action on March 26, 2018 against Defendants Strong Arm
Group, LLC (“SAG”), Eric Yohan Knipe, and Joseph Feldman (“Feldman”). On August
17, 2020, Geller filed the operative Fourth Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging
causes of action for (1) breach of settlement agreement and (2) fraud. 
In the FAC, Geller
alleges, inter alia, that on January 30, 2018, she resolved a
pre-litigation employment dispute in mediation, with Feldman attending the
mediation as the representative for SAG. (FAC, ¶ 10.) On January 30, 2018, the
parties entered into a settlement agreement which provided for a payment of
$65,000 to Geller in four installments: $10,000 on or before February 28, 2018,
$10,000 on or before March 28, 2018, $10,000 on or before April 28, 2018, and
$35,000 on or before May 28, 2018. (FAC, ¶ 11, Ex. A.) Feldman signed the
settlement agreement on behalf of SAG. (FAC, ¶ 11.) 
The settlement agreement also provided for a liquidated damages
penalty of $5,000 for every failure to make a payment by the deadlines
identified. (FAC, ¶ 12.) Geller alleges that “Defendants failed to make the
February 28, 2018, March 28, 2018, April 28, 2018 and May 28, 2017 payments
thereby breaching the Agreement and incurring four (4) $5,000 penalties for a
present total of $20,000.” (FAC, ¶ 13.) Geller further alleges that “Defendants
now claim Feldman was not authorized to bind SAG rendering the Agreement void.”
(FAC, ¶ 18.) 
On June 27, 2019, SAG
filed a Cross-Complaint against Geller. On December 23, 2020, SAG filed
a First Amended Cross-Complaint against Geller and Joseph Lewis Feldman. On
November 13, 2023, a minute order was entered in this matter providing, inter
alia, that “[t]he Court orders Joseph Lewis Feldman and Kate Geller in
Amended Cross-Complaint (1st) filed by Strong Arm Group, LLC on 12/23/2020
dismissed without prejudice. as Strong Arm Group, LLC has no legal
representation.” 
On January 22, 2021,
Feldman filed a Cross-Complaint against SAG and Eric Knipe. Feldman filed the
operative Second Amended Cross-Complaint on May 9, 2022, alleging thirteen
causes of action.
On December 15, 2023, a Judgment was entered in this matter providing,
inter alia, as follows: 
 
“On November 13,
2023, a bench trial in the above matter was held in Department 50 in the Los
Angeles Superior Court, the Honorable Rolf M. Treu presiding…The
Cross-Complaint by SAG against Kate Geller (“Geller”) was dismissed. The
Cross-Complaint by SAG against Joseph Lewis Feldman (“Feldman”) was dismissed. 
 
Based on the
evidence provided at trial, the court ruled in favor of Geller against SAG and
Knipe) on Geller’s complaint, and in favor of Feldman against Knipe on
Feldman’s cross-complaint.

IT IS HEREBY
FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that Judgment in the amount of $5,000 be
hereby entered in favor of Joseph Lewis Feldman against Eric Knipe. Interest
shall accrue on said sum at the rate of ten percent per annum from the date of
the entry of this judgment until said judgment is paid in full…”
On January 3, 2024, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter
alia, that “[t]he Court signs and files the Judgment December 15, 2023 and
is incorporated herein by reference. This minute order is deemed to be the
Notice of Entry of Judgment. A copy of this minute order as well as the
Judgment are mailed to counsel of record.” 

Geller now moves for an
order awarding her attorney’s fees in the amount of $77,791.00 and costs in the
amount of $1,693.76 against SAG and Eric Yohan Knipe (“Knipe”), jointly and
severally. The motion is unopposed. 
Discussion
A.    Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
Civil
Code section 1717, subdivision (a) provides: “In any action on a contract, where the
contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in
addition to other costs.” In addition, Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10)(A) provides
that attorney’s fees, when
authorized by contract,
are allowable as costs.
In her
supporting declaration, Geller’s counsel states that “[o]n January 30, 2018, Kate Geller submitted to a
Mediation with the Honorable Enrique Romero (Ret.) at Signature Resolution to
resolve a pre-litigation lawsuit. The matter settled and at the conclusion of
the mediation, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement…” (Lyon Decl., ¶
2.) A copy of the settlement agreement is attached as Exhibit “A” to Geller’s counsel’s declaration. (Lyon Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.)
Geller asserts that “the settlement agreement allows for the recovery of
reasonable fees and costs.” (Mot. at p. 4:22-23.) 
The settlement
agreement refers to Kate Geller as “P” and Strong Arm Group LLC as “D.”  (Lyon Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) It provides, inter
alia, that “D will pay $65,000 to P…” (Lyon Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A, ¶ 3.) Geller
notes that the settlement agreement further provides that “[t]he parties
stipulate that because it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain
damages arising out of a breach of this agreement (including failure to make a
payment on the deadline) that liquidated damages in the amount of $5,000.00
shall be awarded for every breach proven by the preponderance of evidence and
also that reasonable attorney’s fees and costs shall be awarded to the
prevailing party.” (Lyon Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A, ¶ 8.) 
Geller asserts
that here, she is the “the prevailing
party for purposes of seeking an award of attorney’s fees and costs under the
Settlement Agreement.” (Mot. at p. 5:18-20.) As discussed, the Court’s December
15, 2023 Judgment in this action provides, inter alia, that “IT IS
HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that Judgment in the amount of $85,000.00
be hereby entered in favor of Kate Geller and against Strong Arm Group, LLC, a
Nevada Limited Liability Company and Eric Knipe aka Knipe Eric Yohan AKA Eric
Yohan Von Knipe AKA Eric Von Knipe AKA Eric Y. Knipe AKA Eric K. Yohan AKA Eric
V. Knipe AKA Eric Von AKA Erick Knipe AKA Eric Yohan, an individual, jointly
and severally on Geller’s claims for (1) Breach of Settlement Agreement, and
(2) Fraud.” 
Geller also
asserts that “[a]s an ‘alter
ego’ of SAG, Knipe is liable for the payment of attorneys’ fees and costs.” (Mot. at p. 5:3.) Geller cites to 347 Group, Inc. v. Hawkins (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 209, 211-212, where the Court of
Appeal noted that “Plaintiff 347 Group, Inc. (347 Group),
sued and obtained a default judgment against defendant Philip Hawkins
Architect, Inc. (Architect, Inc.), for breach of contract. Defendants Philip Hawkins,
as an individual, and Design-Build, Inc. (Design Build), were also named
in the lawsuit, although [sic] were not defaulting parties.
Instead, 347 Group dismissed its breach of contract cause of
action against Hawkins and Design Build but maintained causes of
action for fraudulent conveyance and conspiracy, seeking to establish Hawkins and
Design Build were alter egos of Architect, Inc., and liable under the
contract with Architect, Inc.” 
“Following trial, the court
ruled that Hawkins and Design Build were not liable as alter egos to
pay the amount owing under the contract between Architect, Inc., and 347 Group under
either a fraudulent conveyance or conspiracy theory.” ((Id.
at p. 212.) “Hawkins and
Design Build then moved for attorneys’ fees pursuant to Civil
Code section 1717. The trial court denied the motion stating: As
[347 Group] voluntarily dismissed the claims on the contract
against Hawkins and Design Build, the only remaining causes of action
at trial were tort claims for fraudulent conveyance and conspiracy. As to the
tort claims, there is no basis for reciprocal fees under…section
1717.” (Id. at p. 213.) The Court of
Appeal found that “[a]ll of the considerations that led Reynolds Metals to
permit an alleged alter ego to claim attorney fees under a contract are equally
applicable to a postjudgment…action to establish alter ego liability…[I]f
[347 Group] had prevailed in [its] action to deem [Hawkins] an alter ego
of [Architect, Inc.], [Hawkins] would have been liable for [any] attorney
fee award that was a component of the [contract signed
by Architect, Inc]. Under the principles of mutuality that
inform…section 1717, [Hawkins] was entitled to
fees as the prevailing party.” (Id. at p. 215.)
The Court of Appeal concluded that “because 347 Group’s alter ego
action was on the contract and Architect, Inc., the
party Hawkins was alleged to be the alter ego of, was liable for
attorney fees under the contract, Hawkins is entitled to attorney
fees.” (Ibid.) 
Geller asserts that here,
“[w]hile Knipe was not personally a party to the Settlement Agreement, the
court found that Knipe was an ‘alter ego’ of SAG and therefore liable for
breach of contract damages against Plaintiff.” (Mot. at p. 4:16-18.) In support
of this statement, Geller cites to Exhibit “B” to her counsel’s declaration,
which is a November 13, 2023 minute order in this action. (Lyon Decl., ¶ 3, Ex.
B.) However, the Court notes that the November 13, 2023 minute order does not
appear to contain any discussion of whether Knipe was an “alter ego” of SAG. (Lyon
Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. B.) In addition, Geller does not appear to point to any
allegations of the FAC stating that Knipe is an alleged “alter ego” of SAG.
Thus, the Court does not find that Geller has shown in the instant motion that
Knipe is liable for attorney’s fees and costs under an “alter ego” theory.  
Based on the foregoing, the
Court finds that Geller has demonstrated her entitlement to attorney’s fees and
costs against SAG under the subject settlement agreement. 
B.   
The Hourly Rate of
Counsel and the Reasonableness of the Requested Fees
“[T]he fee
setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. …
The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services provided.”
((PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [internal
citations omitted].)
“[T]he
court’s discretion in awarding attorney fees is … to be exercised so as to
fully compensate counsel for the prevailing party for services reasonably
provided to his or her client.” ((Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 395.) The trial court may reduce the award
where the fee request appears unreasonably inflated, such as where the
attorneys’ efforts are unorganized or duplicative. ((Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, fn. 21.) “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of
California State University, supra,
132 Cal.App.4th 359 at p. 396.)
Geller’s
counsel Devon M. Lyon of Lyon Legal, P.C. indicates that a total of 136.70
hours were spent prosecuting this case for a total of $77,791.00 in fees. (Lyon
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. C.) Geller’s counsel states that the costs incurred total
$1,693.76.  (Lyon Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. C.)
Geller’s counsel has attached billing entries for this matter to her
declaration. (Lyon Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. C.) 
Geller’s
counsel requests the following hourly rates for the following attorneys and
paralegals: (1) Devon M. Lyon (attorney): $650/hour; (2) Matthew Perez
(attorney): $450/hour; (3) Lila Tonche (paralegal): $90/hour; (4) Karla Hernandez (paralegal): $90/hour; and (5) Teresa
Acosta (paralegal): $150/hour. (Lyon Decl., ¶ 4.) As discussed, the instant
motion is unopposed. Thus, SAG and Knipe do not challenge the requested hourly
rates. The Court finds that Geller’s requested hourly rates are
reasonable.  
In
addition, as SAG and Knipe do not oppose the motion, they do not challenge any
of Geller’s billing entries or argue that the amounts requested for fees and
costs is unreasonable. The Court finds that the 136.70 hours spent by Geller’s
counsel prosecuting this matter for a total of $77,791.00 in attorneys’ fees is
reasonable. (Lyon Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. C.) The Court also finds that $1,693.76 in
costs is reasonable. (Lyon Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. C.)
Conclusion
            Based
on the foregoing, Geller’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs is granted in
part. Geller is awarded attorney’s fees in the amount of $77,791.00 and costs
in the amount of $1,693.76 against SAG. The motion is denied as to Knipe.
Geller is ordered to
provide notice of this ruling.
