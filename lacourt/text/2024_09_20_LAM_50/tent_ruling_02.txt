[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL
  FURTHER RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE
 



            
Background
Plaintiff
Francisco Javier Nunez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on June 15, 2023 against
Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (“Defendant”). The Complaint
alleges causes of action for (1) violation of subdivision (d) of Civil Code section 1793.2, (2) violation of subdivision
(b) of Civil Code section 1793.2, (3) violation of
subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2, (4)
breach of express written warranty, and (5) breach of the implied warranty of
merchantability. 
In the
Complaint, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that on or about January 15,
2023, Plaintiff purchased a 2023 Volkswagen Atlas (the “Vehicle”). (Compl., ¶
5.) Plaintiff alleges that “[d]uring the warranty period, the Vehicle contained
or developed defects, including, but not limited to the following: a. Defective
body system; b. Defective powertrain system; c. Defective safety system; d.
Defective electrical system; e. Defective braking system; f. Defective noise
system; and g. Any additional complaints made by Plaintiff, whether or not they
are contained in the records or on any repair orders.” (Compl., ¶ 11.) Plaintiff
alleges that “Defendant VWGOA was unable and/or failed to service or repair the
Vehicle within a reasonable number of attempts.” (Compl., ¶ 14.) 
            On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff served his Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One on Defendant. (Sue Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. 2.) On
October 9, 2023, Defendant served its response to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One. (Sue Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel
states that Defendant’s response “did not come with verifications or document
production.” (Sue Decl., ¶ 13.) Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to meet and
confer with Defendant’s counsel regarding the asserted deficiencies in Defendant’s
response. (Sue Decl., ¶¶ 16-17.)
            On December 18, 2023, Defendant served a further verified
response to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set One. (Sue Decl., ¶ 18, Ex.
8.) Defendant also served its initial document production. (Sue Decl., ¶ 18.)
Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[o]n February 1, 2024, having received no
responses to its meet and confer attempts, Plaintiff sent Defendant’s counsel
an email proposing more time to meet and confer regarding Plaintiff’s discovery
disputes.” (Sue Decl., ¶ 19.) Plaintiff’s counsel also states that “[a]dditionally,
Plaintiff sent a third meet and confer letter, offering [sic], inter alia,
an extension to Plaintiff’s written discovery motion deadline, and to schedule
an informal discovery conference (IDC) with Defendant.” (Sue Decl., ¶ 20.) Plaintiff’s
counsel states that “[a]s of time of filing, no response was received by
Defendant.” (Sue Decl., ¶ 21.)
            On August 12, 2024, the parties participated in an
Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”). The Court’s August 12, 2024 minute order
provides, inter alia, that “[t]he matter is called for hearing[.] The
Informal Discovery Conference is held. Parties have fulfilled their IDC
requirement.”[1]
            Plaintiff now moves for “an order to strike [Defendant’s]
meritless objections and compel further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents, Set One Nos. 16­-21.” Defendant opposes. 
Legal Standard 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), “[o]n receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete. (2) A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An
objection in the response is without merit or too general.” 
“The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand,” and “[t]he motion shall be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subds. (b)(1)-(2).) 
Discussion  
A.    Procedural Arguments 
As an initial matter, in the
opposition, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff failed to participate in an IDC
prior to filing the instant motion. The instant motion was filed on February
20, 2024. However, Defendant acknowledges that thereafter, the parties
participated in an IDC on August 12, 2024. (Opp’n at p. 3:17.) Defendant
asserts that the August 12, 2024 IDC was “interrupted by an earthquake.” (Opp’n at p. 3:18-19.) The Court notes
that Defendant does not appear to provide any evidence to support this assertion.
In addition, as discussed, the Court’s August 12, 2024 minute order provides
that “[t]he matter is called for hearing[.] The Informal Discovery Conference
is held. Parties have fulfilled their IDC requirement.” Defendant does not
appear to address the Court’s August 12, 2024 minute order. 
Defendant also asserts that
“Plaintiff failed to file…this motion in accordance with California Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.310(c).”
(Opp’n at p. 3:21-22.) Defendant asserts that the
motion should be “denied on this basis alone.” (Opp’n at p. 4:6.) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.310, subdivision (c), “[u]nless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand.” In addition, “[a]ny period of notice, or any right or duty to do
any act or make any response within any period or on a date certain after the
service of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or
rule of court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days…” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)
As
discussed, Plaintiff indicates that on December
18, 2023, Defendant served a further verified response to Plaintiff’s Requests
for Production, Set One. (Sue Decl., ¶ 18, Ex. 8.)[2]
The proof of service attached to Defendant’s further response indicates that
such response was served by electronic service. (Sue Decl., ¶ 18, Ex. 8.) Defendant asserts that accordingly, Plaintiff’s deadline to file the
instant motion was February 5, 2024. The Court notes that 45 days after
December 18, 2023 is February 1, 2024. In addition, 2 court days after February
1, 2024 is February 5, 2024. 
As Defendant acknowledges, the Declaration of Jonathan Sue and the
separate statement in support of Plaintiff’s motion were filed on February 5,
2024. The proofs of service attached to these documents indicate that they were
served on February 5, 2024. However, as Defendant notes, Plaintiff’s notice of
motion and the memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion
were not filed until February 20, 2024. The proof of service attached to
Plaintiff’s notice of motion and motion indicates that such documents were
served on February 20, 2024 by electronic mail. As discussed, “[u]nless notice
of [the] motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

Plaintiff did not file any reply in support of the instant motion, and
thus does not address the foregoing. In addition, Plaintiff does not appear to
provide any evidence that Defendant agreed to extend Plaintiff’s deadline to
file a motion to compel. Rather, Plaintiff’s counsel indicates that on February
1, 2024, he sent a letter to Defendant’s counsel indicating, inter alia,
that “I also ask that Defendant agree
to an extension of Plaintiff’s motion deadline to the IDC date.” (Sue Decl., ¶
20, Ex. 11.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[a]s of time of filing, no
response was received by Defendant.” (Sue Decl., ¶ 21.) 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion as untimely. 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion is denied. 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.¿¿
