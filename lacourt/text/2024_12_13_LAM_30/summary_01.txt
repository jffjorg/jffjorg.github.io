Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration and stay the court action. Hyundai Motor America claimed that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties, but the judge found that the agreement does not apply to the Plaintiffs' claims. The judge ruled that the agreement is limited to disputes and claims arising out of or relating to Bluelink services, and does not cover the Plaintiffs' claims related to mechanical issues with the vehicle. Additionally, the judge found that even if the agreement did apply to the Plaintiffs' claims, it would not be enforceable due to Hyundai Motor America's failure to comply with Civil Code section 2981, which requires a physical copy of the contract or physical signature.
