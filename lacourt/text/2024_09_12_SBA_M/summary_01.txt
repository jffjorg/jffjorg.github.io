And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sadrack Ngue Ngue v. Inglewood Montessori Pre-School. The Defendant, Inglewood Montessori, LLC, has filed a demurrer to the Complaint, arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts to establish a cause of action. The Judge agrees with the Defendant and sustains the demurrer, giving the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the Complaint.

The Judge finds that the Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to establish the elements of a negligence cause of action, including the existence of a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. The Judge also finds that the Complaint is uncertain and fails to apprise the Defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.

The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has not alleged facts under the bystander recovery theory, which requires the plaintiff to be present during the injury-producing event and aware that it is causing injury to the victim. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff has not alleged facts that would impose a duty of care upon the Defendant to the named Plaintiff.

The Judge orders the Defendant to give notice of this ruling, and grants the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the Complaint.
