On May  19, 2022, plaintiff Amilkar Frausto (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant  Arch Telecom, Inc. (Defendant) and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action  for failure to provide employment records, overtime/double time, meal/rest  breaks, minimum wage, accurate/itemized wage statements, reporting time, split  shifts, all wages paid on time, all wages paid on discharge/termination,  failure to reimburse, and seeking civil penalties.  On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff moved to compel responses to written  discovery and to deem the truth of matters admitted. On April 17, 2024,  Defendant opposed the motions. On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD  When a party  fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories, the party propounding the interrogatories  may move for an order compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,  subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response waives any  objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id., §  2030.290, subd. (a).) “The court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any  party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to  compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to  the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances  make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id., § 2030.290, subd.  (c).)  When a party  fails to serve a timely response to an inspection demand, the party making the  demand may move for an order compelling a response to the inspection demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely  response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work  product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) “[T]he court shall impose a  monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully  makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  When a party  fails to serve a timely response to a request for admission, the party  propounding the request for admission may move for an order to deem the  genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the  requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who  fails to provide a timely response waives any objection, including one based on  privilege or work product. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court  shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for  admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a  proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial  compliance with Section  2033.220. It is  mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the party or attorney,  or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission  necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer  Although meeting and conferring is not required before bringing  motions to compel, (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific  Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404), Plaintiff indicates  having attempted to informally resolve this matter before bringing these  motions, (Gonzalez Decls., ¶ 4).  Analysis  Plaintiff served written discovery on Defendant on March 14, 2023,  comprised of Special Interrogatories, Set One, Form Interrogatories – General,  Set One, Form Interrogatories – Employment Law, Set One, Requests for  Production, Set One, and Requests for Admission, Set One. (Gonzalez Decls., ¶  2.) Despite having granted multiple extensions, Defendant failed to timely  serve responses. (Id., ¶¶ 3-4.)  In opposition, Defendant contends the motions are now moot because  it served responses on Plaintiff on April 15, 2024 and must be denied as such.  (Chen Decls., ¶ 5.) Defendant further contends Plaintiff’s requests for  sanctions should be denied since it provided responses. Defendant contends the  lack of responses was due to Defendant’s prior counsel having left the firm and  the oversight having been discovered thereafter. (Id., ¶¶ 3-6.)  In reply, Plaintiff acknowledges Defendant provided responses, but  contends many of those responses contain improper objections and impermissibly  cite documents in lieu of providing substantive responses. (Gonzalez Reply  Decls., Ex. A.) Plaintiff contends the motions should still be granted as to  those particular responses, and further contends that sanctions are still  appropriate. But, the Court notes that Plaintiff does not contend there are any  substantive problems with Defendant’s responses to Requests for Admissions, Set  One, and Form Interrogatories – General, Set One, and instead contends only  that sanctions are still appropriate.  The Court agrees with Plaintiff. First, Defendant concedes having  provided untimely responses to Plaintiff’s written discovery requests. (Chen  Decls., ¶ 5.) Defendant therefore waived the right to object to Plaintiff’s  discovery requests and cite to documents in lieu of providing substantive  responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Id., § 2031.300,  subd. (a); Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) Second, the mere fact that  Defendant provided responses shortly before the hearing on these motions does  not render these motions moot or otherwise deprive the Court of the ability to  rule on them. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148  Cal.App.4th at p. 404.) Third, given Defendant’s waiver of rights for failure  to timely respond, Defendant provided many improper responses containing  objections and citations to documents in lieu of substantive responses. (See  Gonzalez Reply Decls., Ex. A; Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Id.,  § 2031.300, subd. (a); Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motions to compel  responses to:       1.      Special  Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1-3, 6-27, 29-33, 35-36, 38-39, 41-42, 44-45,  47-48, 50-51, 62-64, 78, 80, and 82; 2.      Form  Interrogatories – Employment Law, Set One, 209.2 and 211.1; and 3.      Requests for  Production, Set One, Nos. 2-7, 10, 11, 13-15, 29, 30, 35-39, 47, and 50.  Given that Plaintiff did not raise any issues with respect to  Defendant’s responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One, and Form  Interrogatories – General, Set One, the Court infers Defendant’s responses were  not otherwise improper, other than for being untimely. Therefore, the Court  DENIES Plaintiff Amilkar Frausto’s motion to compel responses to Form  Interrogatories – General, Set One. The Court also DENIES Plaintiff Amilkar  Frausto’s motion to deem the truth of matters specified in Requests for  Admissions, Set One, admitted and conclusively established.  With respect to monetary sanctions, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff  Amilkar Frausto’s requests for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of  $1,311.65 per motion, comprised of 1.0 hour preparing each motion, 1.0 hour for  reviewing each opposition and preparing each reply, and 0.5 hours for attending  the hearing on the motions, for a total of 2.5 hours, multiplied by a reduced  hourly rate of $500.00, plus the $61.65 filing fee for each motion. The Court  reduced the hourly rate from $725.00, finding it excessive for the relevant  legal community. (See 569 E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the  Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436–437 [“The courts repeatedly have  stated that the trial court is in the best position to value the services  rendered by the attorneys in his or her courtroom [citation], and this includes  the determination of the hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar  calculus. [Citation.]”])  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Amilkar Frausto’s motion to compel  responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1-3, 6-27, 29-33, 35-36,  38-39, 41-42, 44-45, 47-48, 50-51, 62-64, 78, 80, and 82.
