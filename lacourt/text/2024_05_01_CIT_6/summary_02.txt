Case Number: Nobia Joyce v. Shawn M. Millner, et al.
Judge's Ruling:
  - Case Type: Quiet Title Action
  - Requested by: Plaintiff
  - Requested Date: Within 120 days
  - Reason: Plaintiff is over 70 years old and has a substantial interest in the action, and her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation.

Plaintiff's Arguments:
  - Plaintiff has difficulty regulating her emotions and requires redirection, guidance, and support to engage in effective communication.
  - Plaintiff contends that the case has not been settled.
  - Plaintiff argues that the Defendants do not dispute Plaintiff being 76 years old.

Defendants' Arguments:
  - Defendants contend that Plaintiff's declaration lacks persuasiveness.
  - Defendants argue that Plaintiff's social worker's declaration is not objective.
  - Defendants point to Plaintiff's ability to enter into an agreement in May 2023 regarding a payment of $10,000 for Plaintiff's current apartment.
  - Defendants contend that Plaintiff does not qualify for preference because of various agreements.

Judge's Decision:
  - The Court grants Plaintiff's request for trial preference as to Plaintiff's equitable claims for quiet title and partition.
  - The Court finds that Plaintiff has a substantial interest in the action and her health requires preference to prevent prejudice to her interest in the litigation.

Waiver:
  - Plaintiff formally waives her entitlement to have the entire case set for a preferential trial date.
  - The Court exercises its discretion to accept such waiver so that the entire case will not be tried at one preferential trial.

Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for trial preference as to the equitable claims for quiet title and partition. The plaintiff, who is over 70 years old, has a substantial interest in the action and her health requires preference to prevent prejudice to her interest in the litigation. The court finds that the plaintiff's health issues are sufficient to warrant a preference, despite the defendants' arguments to the contrary. The court also waives the plaintiff's entitlement to have the entire case set for a preferential trial date, allowing the equitable claims to be tried separately from the legal claims.
