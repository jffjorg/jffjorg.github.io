And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel documents and deposition testimony from a third-party subpoenaed witness, Richard Hoting. The motion was filed by plaintiff Maria Angela Rodriguez, who is seeking to compel Hoting to produce documents and answer questions related to his representation of the defendants in this involuntary dissolution action. The court has denied the motion, finding that plaintiff failed to properly serve the moving papers on Hoting and that the motion is untimely. The court also notes that plaintiff failed to serve a Notice to Consumer on the defendants, as required by law. As a result, the court declines to consider the parties' other arguments and denies the motion.
