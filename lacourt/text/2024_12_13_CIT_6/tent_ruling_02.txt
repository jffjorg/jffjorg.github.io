Londo Welding, Inc. dba Welding Certification Center’s Request for Entry of Default
Judgment 
Defendant: Adam Mason 
TENTATIVE RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED. The Court hereby VACATES the entry of default on
September 12, 2024. The Court will also discuss with counsel for
Plaintiff at the hearing on this motion regarding whether this case should be
reclassified as limited civil and transferred to the appropriate court.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a breach of contract case. On September 20, 2023, plaintiff Londo Welding,
Inc. dba Welding Certification Center (Plaintiff) filed this action against
defendant Adam Mason (Defendant) and Does 1 through 50, alleging the sole cause
of action for breach of written contract. On September 11, 2024, default was
entered against Defendant. On October 15, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a default
judgment package.  
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $13,850.13,
including $11,124.23 in damages, $1002.11 in interest, $723.70 in attorney
fees, and $1,000.09 in costs. The Court finds a few problems with the default
judgment package. First, the amount of principal damages requested exceeds that
stated in the complaint. The complaint alleges at most $10,000.00 in damages.
(Compl., ¶¶ 13, 19.) “The purpose of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 580 is to
require the plaintiff to provide notice of the maximum amount of the
defendant's potential liability.” (Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1174; see also Becker v. S.P.V. Constr. Co. (1980)
27 Cal.3d 489, 494 [“a prayer for damages according to proof passes muster
under section 580 only if a specific amount of damages is alleged in the body
of the complaint. [Citation]”.) 
Second,
Plaintiff attempts to include $3,608.41 in collection fees. (Malczynski Decl.,
p. 2; Londo Decl., ¶ 8.) While the underlying contract may provide for recovery
of collection fees, those are items of damages that need the amounts
purportedly incurred to be specifically alleged in the complaint in order to
recover them in a default judgment; general allegations regarding collection
fees will not suffice. (FAC, ¶¶ 11, 13, 16, 19; see Becker v. S.P.V. Constr.
Co., supra, 27 Cal.3d at p. 494.) 
Third, the
Court notes that the default should not have been entered on September 12,
2024. The first date of publication of the summons was July 31, 2024. (Proof of
Publication (8/21/24).) Service was not effective until 28 days later on August
28, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.50, subd. (c); Gov. Code, § 6064; Watts v. Crawford (1995) 10 C4th 743, 747, fn. 4.) This means Defendant had until September 27,
2024, to respond to the complaint, i.e., 30 days after August 28, 2024. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 412.20, subd. (a)(3) [defendant has 30 days after service is
complete to respond to complaint].) The Court will vacate the default for
having been improperly entered. 
Fourth,
Plaintiff did not provide a prejudgment interest calculation. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(3).) 
Finally, given
that the principal damage amount sought here is at most $10,000.00 and
Plaintiff does not request injunctive relief, this matter appears to have been
improperly filed with this Court. This is an unlimited jurisdiction court, and
the jurisdictional limit for an unlimited civil case at the time this action
was filed was $25,000.00. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 85, subd. (a) [limit changed
to $35,000.00 effective January 1, 2024]; Stratton v. Beck
(2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 483, 492.) The Court also notes that this is not the first
time this Plaintiff and the same counsel have filed this kind of action with
this Court, which also involved an amount below the unlimited jurisdiction
limit. (LASC Case No. 23PSCV00209.) The Court will hear from counsel for
Plaintiff at the hearing on this default judgment request as to why this action
should not be reclassified and transferred to the appropriate court. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a) [court may order reclassification on its own motion];
Stern v. Superior Ct. (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 223, 230
[court contemplating reclassification must give notice to parties]; but see
Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (e) [court not required to reclassify case
merely because the judgment to be rendered after trial or hearing may fall
below the unlimited jurisdiction limit].) 
CONCLUSION           
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED. The Court hereby VACATES the
entry of default on September 12, 2024. The Court will also discuss with
counsel for Plaintiff at the hearing on this motion regarding whether this case
should be reclassified as limited civil and transferred to the appropriate
court.
