Significant Statements:
	* "The court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement." (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2, subds. (a), (b))
	* "A proceeding to compel arbitration is in essence a suit in equity to compel specific performance of a contract." (Freeman v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co. (1975) 14 Cal.3d 473, 479)
	* "The arbitration agreement is mildly procedurally unconscionable. The Agreement is an adhesion contract, in that Defendant required Plaintiff to accept the agreement as a condition of employment. However, most employment agreements are adhesion contracts, and this factor alone does not make an arbitration agreement highly procedurally unconscionable." (Lange v. Monster Energy Co. (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 436, 446)
	* "The Court has found a low degree of procedural unconscionability in the Agreement, Plaintiff must demonstrate a high degree of substantive unconscionability to render it unenforceable." (Gentry v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 443, 469)
	* "Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration is granted. Proceedings are stayed pending completion of arbitration and Defendant is awarded costs for filing the present motion."
