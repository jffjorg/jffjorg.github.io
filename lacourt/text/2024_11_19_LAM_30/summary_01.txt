Here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24STCV07875
* Hearing Date: November 19, 2024
* Department: 30 Dept. 30

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: O.A., J.A., and M.A (represented by Guardian ad Litem, J.A.)
* Defendant: Jessica Devita (et. al.)

**Facts**

* The case involves allegations of abuse of process and protected activity under California's anti-SLAPP statute (Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16)
* Defendant Jessica Devita moves to strike all causes of action from the complaint

**Issues**

* Whether the allegations in the complaint pertained to protected activity under section 425.16
* Whether the Defendant's communications on Twitter and with a youth sporting league's parents and staff were protected activity

**Analysis**

* The Court finds that only Defendant's request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) is protected activity under section 425.16, subdivision (e)
* The Court denies Defendant's motion with respect to Plaintiffs' first and third causes of action, which are not based on protected activity
* The Court proceeds with a second step analysis regarding Plaintiffs' second cause of action for abuse of process

**Ruling**

* Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiffs' second cause of action (abuse of process) is granted
* The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not established a probability of success on the merits with respect to their abuse of process claim

**Significant Statements**

* "The court does not weigh evidence or resolve conflicting factual claims. Its inquiry is limited to whether the plaintiff has stated a legally sufficient claim and made a prima facie factual showing sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment."
* "A claim may be struck only if the speech or petitioning activity itself is the wrong complained of, and not just evidence of liability or a step leading to some different act for which liability is asserted."
* "In deciding whether a matter constitutes a public interest, courts look to whether the subject of the speech or activity 'was a person or entity in the public eye' or 'could affect large numbers of people beyond the direct participants'; and whether the activity 'occur[red] in the context of an ongoing controversy, dispute or discussion' or 'affect[ed] a community in a manner similar to that of a governmental entity.'"
