[TENTATIVE] ORDER DEMURRER BY
 DEFENDANT, LA PLAZA DE CULTURA Y ARTES, TO COMPLAINT, JOINED BY COUNTY
OF LOS ANGELES
 
I.      
BACKGROUND
      The
complaint alleges that Defendant wrongfully unearthed more than 100 human
remains of Plaintiffs’ ancestors at the First Cemetery and re-interred the
remains in a mass grave. Plaintiffs allege the mass graves are a continuing
nuisance and violate provisions of the Health and Safety Code and Plaintiffs’
cultural traditions. 
 
 
II.              
ARGUMENTS
      Defendant,
La Plaza De Cultura y Artes (“Museum”) demurrers to all claims for failure to
state a cause of action and on grounds the first and fifth causes of action are
barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and Plaintiffs have not
alleged facts that avoid it. Plaintiffs’ contention that the graves constitute
a continuing nuisance is without merit. On October 10, 2024, the County of Los
Angeles (“COLA”) joined in Museum’s demurrer. (Notice of Joinder [COLA],
10/10/24.)  
      In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ breach of their own rules for
respectful reburial creates a continuing nuisance that avoids the statute of
limitations. Whether the claims are untimely is a question of fact based on the
circumstances of this case. Plaintiffs have alleged facts to support continuous
accrual of the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs do not rely on a theory of
delayed discovery to avoid the statute of limitations. Defendants’ continuing
duty to remediate the mass graves extends the limitations period. 
      La
Plaza contends in reply that Plaintiffs have not explained why they have
delayed 12 years to file this action. Plaintiffs failed to allege any cause of
action against La Plaza. 
III.   
LEGAL STANDARDS
      A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt
v. Foundation Health (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.) In testing the complaint’s sufficiency, the court must
assume the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations as well as facts
that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded facts. The court
may also consider matters properly subject to judicial notice. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.)
      The court may not consider contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore
v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th
634, 638.) Plaintiff is required to allege facts sufficient to establish every
element of each cause of action. (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e); (Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles
(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126.)
      Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity that is
sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and
extent of his cause of action.” (Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  Whether the
Plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant. (Stevens
v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.) 
      A demurrer may also be sustained if a
complaint is “uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s factual
allegations are so confusing, they do not sufficiently apprise a defendant of
the issues it is being asked to meet. (Williams
v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2; Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)
      A pleading is required to assert general
allegations of ultimate fact. Evidentiary facts are not required. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty
Co. (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 47; Lim
v. The.TV Corp. Internat.
(2002) 99 Cal. App. 4th 684, 690.) However, unlike federal courts, California
state courts are not a notice pleading jurisdiction, and notice alone is not a
sufficient basis for any pleading. California is a fact pleading jurisdiction.
Merely putting an opposing party on notice is not sufficient. (Bach
v. County of Butte (1983) 147
Cal.App.3d 554, 561; see Diodes,
Inc. v. Franzen (1968) 260
Cal.App.2d 244, 250.)
 
IV.  
DISCUSSION
A.    
Demurrer based on the statute of limitations is
SUSTAINED. 
      The Museum contends that the first and
fifth causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations, and Plaintiffs
have not alleged facts to avoid the time bar.  The statute of limitations for injury based on
negligence is two years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1.) 
      Plaintiffs allege the incidents giving
rise to this action took place began on January 14, 2011. (Complaint, ¶ 22.) As
Plaintiffs explained in their opposition, the first cause of action set forth
the applicable laws to support a theory of negligence per se, the two-year
limitations period also applies. 
      Plaintiffs argue that since the wrongdoing
is ongoing, the statute of limitations is not tolled due to the “continuous
accrual” doctrine where in certain circumstances, recurring invasions of the
same right can each trigger their own statute of limitations.  
(Aryeh
v. Canon Business Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55 Cal.4th 1185, 1198.) The
principle seeks to correct that inequities that would result where "parties
engaged in long-standing misfeasance would thereby obtain immunity in
perpetuity from suit even for recent and ongoing misfeasance. In addition,
where misfeasance is ongoing, a defendant's claim to repose, the principal
justification underlying the limitations defense, is vitiated." (Gilkyson
v. Disney Enterprises, Inc. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 1336, 1342.)
      The doctrine applies where an obligation
arises on a recurring basis, such as a case involving periodic payments. (State
of California ex rel. Metz v. CCC Information Services, Inc. (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 402, 418.) The reasoning is that each new breach of an
obligation provides all elements of a claim, and can then be treated as an
independently actionable wrong with its own limitations period for recovery. "(Aryeh
v. Canon Business Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55 Cal.4th 1185, 1199.)  If the harm arose out of a single transaction
however, the doctrine does not apply. (Id.) 
      The complaint does not allege facts that
the Museum had a recurring duty to Plaintiffs that continues to be breached to
this day. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to adhere to their
obligations for the reburial of the remains according to a January 14, 2011,
letter. (Complaint, ¶ 24.) Defendants allegedly did not comply with those steps
resulting in the alleged harm that continues unmitigated and unresolved, as the
remains were placed in a mass grave. (Complaint, ¶ 14:6-8.)
      Therefore, the misconduct arose in 2011.
Plaintiffs’ contention that Defendants continue to breach their obligations by
failing to mitigate is not a “recurring” transaction. Rather, the alleged
misconduct flowed from the 2011 reinterment. 
 
B.    
Demurrer
to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED.
      Plaintiffs
allege that the Museum’s expansion into the area occupied by the First
Cemetery, approved by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles Funeral and Mortuary
Services Corporation (“Archdiocese”), led to the wrongful disinterment of
Plaintiffs’ ancestors pursuant to a written letter agreement between the Museum
and the Archdiocese dated October 20, 2011. (Complaint, ¶ 110.) 
      The
first cause of action alleges violations of various codes: Health
& Safety Code, section 8113.5, which imposes criminal penalties for failing
to limit one body to a single plot; Los Angeles County Code of Ordinances which
is intended to “protect and preserve archaeological, historical, and
paleontological resources from destruction, and avoid impacts to such resources
where feasible.” (L.A.M.C.
§ 22.44.1570 subd. (D)(4)(e); and a section of the California Public
Resources Code that prohibits interference with Native American religion or
damage to cemeteries. (Pub.
Resources Code, § 5097.9.)
      Plaintiffs
concede that the cited codes do not expressly provide for a private right of
action. Relying on Michael
R. v. Jeffrey B. (1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 1059, however, Plaintiffs
contend that these code sections embody a public policy, which is actionable.  Michael R. held that a statute need
not provide specifically for civil damages or liability.  A “violation of a statute embodying a public
policy is generally actionable even though no specific civil remedy is provided
in the statute itself. Any injured member of the public for whose benefit the
statute was enacted may bring the action." (Michael
R. at 1067.) 
      Michael
R. applied negligence per se principles based on the violation of criminal
statutes. The significance of identifying the statute in a civil suit for
negligence “involves its formulation of a standard of conduct that the court
then adopts in the determination of such liability.” (Id.)
Negligence per se is not a separate cause of action; it creates an evidentiary
presumption that affects the standard of care in a cause of action for
negligence.”(Johnson
v. Honeywell Internat. Inc. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 549, 555.) Contrary
to the Museum’s reply, as it is not an independent cause of action, Plaintiffs
do not need to allege elements that would entitle Plaintiffs to the presumption
of negligence under the Evidence Code. (Evid.
Code, § 669 ; Quiroz
v. Seventh Ave. Center (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1285–1286 ["… it
operates to establish a presumption of negligence for which the statute serves
the subsidiary function of providing evidence of an element of a preexisting
common law cause of action.”]
      Therefore,
to the extent Plaintiffs have mischaracterized this cause of action as an
independent statutory claim, instead of subsuming it in the negligence cause of
action of which it is a part, the complaint is fatally uncertain.
 
C.    
Demurrer to the claim for private nuisance is SUSTAINED.
      As
Defendants observe, a private nuisance is a civil wrong based on disturbance of
one’s land. (Monks
v. City of Rancho Palos Verdes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 263, 302.) Plaintiffs
argue they have rights as “Most Likely Descendants” to reclaim their ancestors’
remains from the First Cemetery. (Opp. 11:23-26.) Plaintiffs rely on a case
that concerned property owners’ potential rights to groundwater. (Orange
County Water Dist. v. Sabic Innovative Plastics US, LLC (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 343.) 
      The Sabic
case is not persuasive under the facts alleged in the complaint. Defendant
cites People
v. Reid (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 822, which recognized that human
remains have not been legally treated as property although next of kin have "a
temporary, quasi-property right in the body of a deceased for purposes
of burial or other disposition.” (Reid at 828.) Plaintiffs allege they
are “Most Likely Descendants,” not next of kin. As there are no allegations to
support Plaintiffs’ rights over the 200-year old remains, this cause of action
is defective. (Complaint, ¶ 5:4.)
 
D.    
Demurrer to the third cause of action for public
nuisance is SUSTAINED.
      A
nuisance is generally defined as "one which affects at the same time an
entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons,
although the extent of the annoyance or damage inflicted upon individuals may
be unequal.” (Civ.
Code, § 3480.) A public nuisance is defined as "[a]nything which is
injurious to health, including, but not limited to, the illegal sale of
controlled substances, or is indecent or offensive to the senses, or an
obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the
comfortable enjoyment of life or property, or unlawfully obstructs the free
passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay,
stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, square, street, or highway, … ."
(Civ.
Code, § 3479.)
      Parties
authorized to sue for a public nuisance are limited to the State of California,
by the district attorney or county counsel, or the city attorney.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 731.) As Plaintiffs are not authorized by statute to pursue
this claim, demurrer is SUSTAINED. 
 
E.    
Demurrer to the fourth cause of action for
fiduciary duty and the fifth cause of action for negligence are SUSTAINED. 
      A
claim for breach of fiduciary duty requires facts to support the following
elements: the existence of a fiduciary relationship, breach of that duty,
causation and damages caused by the breach. (Mosier
v. Southern California Physicians Ins. Exchange (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
1022, 1044.) Plaintiffs allege that the Museum assumed a duty owed to
Plaintiffs by agreeing to and authorizing the reburial plan articulated by Los
Angeles County.  (Complaint, ¶ 110.)
      Plaintiffs
have not alleged facts showing the existence of a fiduciary relationship
between them and the Museum. A fiduciary relationship is “any relation existing
between parties to a transaction wherein one of the parties is in duty bound to
act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the other party. Such a
relation ordinarily arises where a confidence is reposed by one person in the integrity
of another, and in such a relation the party in whom the confidence is reposed,
if he voluntarily accepts or assumes to accept the confidence, can take no
advantage from his acts relating to the interest of the other party without the
latter's knowledge or consent." (Wolf
v. Superior Court (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 25, 29.) 
      Plaintiffs
do not allege they were parties to the agreement between Defendants with
respect to the reinterment of the remains. Plaintiffs argue in opposition that
a “special relationship” can form the basis for a duty owed. Plaintiffs
conflate a special relationship with that of a confidential or fiduciary
relationship. A special relationship “inheres” in the nature of the
relationship itself. Some examples of special relationships have been recognized
as follows:
“(1) a common carrier and its passengers, (2) an innkeeper
and its guests, (3) a person who owns or possesses land and persons coming onto
the land, (4) an employer and its employees who, while at work, are in imminent
danger or rendered helpless by injury or illness, (5) a school and its
students, (6) a landlord and its tenants, (7) a custodian and those within its
custody, and (8) a manufacturer or supplier of goods and the buyer or user of
those goods. (Rest.3d Torts, § 40, subd. (b) [listing first seven]; see Regents,
supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 620, 230 Cal.Rptr.3d 415, 413 P.3d 656; Seo v.
All-Makes Overhead Doors (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1203, 119 Cal.Rptr.2d
160 (Seo) [listing eighth].) Second, the parties may create a special
relationship by entering into a contract imposing a “contractual duty” to act.
(Johnson v. The Raytheon Co., Inc. (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 617, 634, 245
Cal.Rptr.3d 282; Seo, at p. 1203, 119 Cal.Rptr.2d 160; see Suarez v.
Pacific Northstar Mechanical, Inc. (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 430, 438-439, 103
Cal.Rptr.3d 168; Stockberger v. U.S. (7th Cir. 2003) 332 F.3d 479, 481 (Stockberger).)
Third, a special relationship entailing a duty to act can be created “by a
statute or government regulation.” (McHenry
v. Asylum Entertainment Delaware, LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 469, 484–485.)
 
      Plaintiffs have not alleged any
relationship between them and the Museum. The complaint alleges that remains
were on Museum property and the Museum allegedly took part in determining how
they would be reinterred. 
      As previously explained. Plaintiffs have
not alleged facts to support their temporary or quasi-property ownership based
on the allegation that they are “most likely descendants” of remains dating
more than 200 years. As Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to show that Museum
owed Plaintiffs a fiduciary duty or that a special relationship exists between
Plaintiffs and Museum from which a duty might otherwise arise, the claim is not
adequately alleged. 
      The negligence claim fails for the same
reason that the claim for breach of fiduciary duty fails. Plaintiff must allege
facts to establish that the Museum owed Plaintiffs a duty in particular. 
V.    
CONCLUSION
      Based on the foregoing, the demurrer to
all causes of action is SUSTAINED as to Defendant Museum and co-defendant Los
Angeles County, who joined in the demurrer. Leave to amend is
ordinarily given if there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be
cured. However, it is the plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate how he or she can
amend the complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. "]. (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now v. Department
of Industrial Relations (1995) 41
Cal.App.4th 298, 302. Plaintiffs contend all claims
are viable as written. However, given the age of the claims and that Plaintiffs
have not articulated a theory that would toll the statute of limitations, leave
to amend is DENIED.
