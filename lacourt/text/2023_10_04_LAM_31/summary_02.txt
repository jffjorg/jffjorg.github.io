The Plaintiff seeks to prevent Donald Cole, a key figure in the case and CEO of Defendant's company, from attending her deposition.

Defendant counters that proper notice was given and that Cole's attendance is justified under California Rules of Court 
3.1010. They also state that Cole did not engage in any disruptive behavior during the deposition.

The Judge ultimately denies the Plaintiff's motion for a protective order and motions for sanctions from both parties. They conclude that the Plaintiff did not demonstrate sufficient cause for the protective order and that both parties' requests for sanctions are denied.

roles:

significant\_statements:
- "Plaintiff’s motion for a protective order is DENIED. Both parties’ request for sanctions is DENIED."

The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion for a protective order precluding Donald Cole from attending her deposition and both parties' request for sanctions. The judge finds that good cause has not been shown to grant a protective order precluding Plaintiff's deposition or limiting it in any way. Even if there was improper notice as Plaintiff argues, the Court cannot order Cole not to be present, as he is entitled to be present under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420(b)(12). Plaintiff's request for sanctions under CCP sections 2023.030 and 2025.420 is denied, and Defendant's request for sanctions is also denied as it has not requested sanctions in the notice of opposition.
