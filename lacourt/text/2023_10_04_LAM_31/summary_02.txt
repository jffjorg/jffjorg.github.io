English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had sought to prevent the defendant's officers from attending her deposition, alleging that they attended the deposition without proper notice. The defendant argued that it had complied with the requirements for remote electronic depositions and that the plaintiff's request for a protective order was unfounded. The judge denied the plaintiff's motion, finding that the defendant had provided proper notice and that the plaintiff had not shown good cause for a protective order. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, citing the lack of evidence that the defendant had acted improperly.
