And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants GEICO's motion to bifurcate the products liability claims against FCA from the insurance coverage claims against GEICO. The judge concludes that the claims against GEICO are based on separate and distinct transactions, occurrences, legal theories, and factual proof that is not common to all defendants. The claims against FCA, on the other hand, require evidence of an alleged defect and how it caused the accident and injuries. The judge finds that bifurcation will avoid prejudice and expedite trial, as the jury would not have to sit through testimony unrelated to GEICO's causes of action. The judge also rejects the plaintiff's argument that bifurcation will lead to inconsistent verdicts, finding that the claims and defendants are completely different and there is no risk of inconsistent rulings.
