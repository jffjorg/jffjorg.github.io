[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR LEAVE TO
FILE A CROSS-COMPLAINT 
 
      This
action involves a dispute between Plaintiff (tenant) and the landlord
defendants arising from the parties’ lease agreement for commercial real
property. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants induced Plaintiff to enter into the
lease agreement by using an estimate for common area maintenance expenses that
turned out to be false. Plaintiff alleges claims for fraud, rescission, and
declaratory relief. 
      The
landlord defendants request leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff
for breach of contract, accounting, breach of guaranty, and declaratory relief,
for additional rent that Plaintiff failed to pay. Defendants did not discover
these claims until they received Plaintiff’s responses in discovery.
      Plaintiff
does not oppose the motion.
      A party
against whom a cause of action has been asserted in a complaint may file a
cross-complaint setting forth either a cause of action against any of the
parties who filed the complaint, or any cause of action he has against a person
alleged to be liable, whether or not such person is already a party. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 428.10 subd. (b).). Leave to
file or amend a cross-complaint may be granted so long as the moving party
acted in good faith. The statute is liberally construed to avoid forfeiture. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 426.50).
      Plaintiff
does not oppose the motion, and there is no evidence of bad faith by the moving
parties. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED. Cross-Complainants are ordered to
file its proposed cross-complaint within 10 days.
