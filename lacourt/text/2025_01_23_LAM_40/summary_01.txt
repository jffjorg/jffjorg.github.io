And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by the landlord defendants against the tenant plaintiff, Kids Empire Pomona, LLC. The dispute arises from the lease agreement for commercial real property, where the plaintiff alleges that the defendants induced them to enter into the agreement by providing false estimates for common area maintenance expenses. The plaintiff has alleged claims for fraud, rescission, and declaratory relief. The landlord defendants request leave to file a cross-complaint for breach of contract, accounting, breach of guaranty, and declaratory relief for additional rent that the plaintiff allegedly failed to pay. Despite not opposing the motion, the plaintiff does not have any evidence of bad faith by the moving parties. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the cross-complainants must file their proposed cross-complaint within 10 days.
