And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case Crestwood Hills Association v. Broumand et al, Case No. 23SMCV02981. The Broumand defendants have filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint, arguing that the first cause of action for breach of declaration of restrictions is insufficiently pleaded and that the second cause of action for declaratory relief is barred because the Association lacks legal capacity to sue. The court has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action, finding that the pleading is sufficient and that the restriction on building a home pursuant to the 1950 CC&Rs remains in effect. The court has also overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action, finding that the Association has the legal capacity to sue for declaratory relief on behalf of the Architectural Committee. The defendants are ordered to answer within 10 court days.
