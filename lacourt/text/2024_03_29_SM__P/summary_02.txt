And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for stipulated judgment filed by Walter N. Marks, plaintiff in the case against J. Freund, PC. The parties had previously stipulated to settle the matter, agreeing that the defendant would vacate the plaintiff's property by December 31, 2024 and pay the outstanding rent due within thirty days. However, the plaintiff has since submitted a declaration stating that the defendant has failed to make the required payment. Since there is no opposition and the court has retained jurisdiction under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, the judge grants the motion and orders entry of judgment.
