Crestwood Hill Association v. Broumand et
al., Case No. 23SMCV02981
Hearing date: March 29, 2024
Broumand Defendants’ Demurrer to First
Amended Complaint (FAC)
 
Plaintiff
Crestwood Hills Association alleges the Broumand defendants’ construction
violates architectural standards in the Crestwood Hills community. Defendants
Broumand demur to the first cause of action on the ground that it has not been
sufficiently pleaded and to the second cause of action on the ground that plaintiff
Association lacks legal capacity to sue for declaratory relief. 
 
Defendants
argue the first cause of action for breach of declaration of restrictions is
subject to demurrer because the restriction on building a home pursuant to
Paragraph 6 of the 1950 CC&Rs expired January 1, 1976. See Demurrer
at pg. 7; FAC at ¶18, Exh. 1 at ¶ 6.  They
note the FAC alleges no other breach, and the 1976 CC&R did not extend the
time set forth in Paragraph 6 of the 1950 CC&Rs but created a new
restriction that began January 1, 1976.  
 
The
Broumands are requesting the court conduct an analysis of the 1950 CC&Rs
and the 1976 CC&Rs. Such request is impermissible on demurrer, which may
only be sustained where the pleading is defective on its face. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. As alleged, when the
amendment to the CC&Rs was signed on December 16, 1975, the majority of homeowners
agreed to extend the authority of the Architectural Committee, and as a result,
Paragraph 6 of the 1950 CC&Rs remains in effect. FAC at ¶ 7. Because the
Broumands have not shown there are any defects on the face of the pleadings or via
judicial notice that contradict this allegation, the demurrer to the first
cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
Second,
the Broumands argue the Association lacks legal capacity to sue for declaratory
relief on behalf of the Architectural Committee. This argument has been raised
previously, and the court held that the Association, as successor-in-interest
to the original developer, has power to enforce the CC&Rs and any valid
rules issued by the Architectural Committee. See 11/30/23 Minute Order
and 12/15/23 Minute Order. The court adheres to its prior reasoning. As alleged,
the Association seeks a declaration that the decision by the Architectural Committee
denying the Broumands’ building plans was within its authority under the
CC&Rs. FAC ¶¶ 23-25. Thus, because the Association is seeking to enforce a
decision made by the Architectural Committee, the Association is permitted to
maintain its declaratory relief cause of action. The demurrer is OVERRULED.
