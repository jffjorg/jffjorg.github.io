Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of the Defendants, Newrez LLC and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, and has sustained their demurrer without leave to amend as to the HBOR claims and the UCL claim. The Court finds that the HBOR does not apply to the Plaintiffs' commercial loan, and that the Plaintiffs have not alleged any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent conduct on the part of the Defendants. The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs' default on the loan triggered the events leading to the foreclosure of their home, and that they have not demonstrated any likelihood of successfully amending their UCL claim to adequately state a cause of action under that law.
