And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. grants Defendant Christopher Adam Roundtree's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff Hamza Aouad. The cross-complaint arises from the same motor vehicle v. motorcycle accident that is the subject of the original complaint. The Defendant claims that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it relates to the same accident, and the Court agrees. The Court grants leave in the absence of bad faith, as there is no evidence of bad faith and Plaintiffs have not argued that there is bad faith. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 428.50, 426.30, and 426.10, as well as case law.
