And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by defendant Moses Michael Vigil. The case involves a motor vehicle collision and a lawsuit brought by plaintiff Marlen Tashjir against defendants Vigil, Juan Valles, and Enterprises Holdings LLC. The Court grants Vigil's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 6.2 and 6.7, and denies it as to the remainder. The Court also denies Vigil's motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 11-47 and Request for Production of Documents Nos. 1-10, 15, 17-25. The Court finds that Tashjir's responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 11-47 are complete and straightforward, and that Tashjir's objections to these requests are meritless. The Court also finds that Tashjir's responses to Request for Production of Documents No. 15 are complete and straightforward, and that Tashjir's objections to this request are not justified. The Court denies Vigil's motion to compel further responses to Request for Production of Documents Nos. 1-10, 17-25, as moot. The Court also denies both parties' requests for sanctions.
