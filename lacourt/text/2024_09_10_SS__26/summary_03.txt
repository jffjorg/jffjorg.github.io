And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admission admitted and to request sanctions against the defendant. The plaintiff, Fox Hills Auto, Inc. dba Airport Marina Ford, served requests for admission on the defendant, Karen Diaz, on April 19, 2024, but the defendant failed to respond. As a result, the plaintiff filed a motion to deem the requests for admission admitted. The judge found that the defendant's failure to respond waived any objections to the requests for admission and that the plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the requests for admission admitted. The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant, ordering the defendant to pay $360.00 to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of service of the order.
