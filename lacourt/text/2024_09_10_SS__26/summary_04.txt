And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to the request for production of documents and request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Dibara Masonry, LLC, is ordered to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of service of this order. The plaintiff is also ordered to pay sanctions of $455.00 to defense counsel within 20 days of service of this order. The judge's decision is based on the plaintiff's failure to serve initial responses to the discovery requests, despite a meet and confer effort and the defendant's filing of the instant motion. The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and that sanctions are appropriate under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.
