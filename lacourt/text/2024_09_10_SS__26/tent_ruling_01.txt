ANALYSIS:
 
On April 6, 2022, Plaintiff Danny Y. Yang (“Plaintiff”), in
propria persona, filed the instant action for legal malpractice against
Defendant Scott S. Streed (“Defendant”). Following Defendant’s failure to file
a responsive pleading, the Court entered their default on June 3, 2022 and
default judgment on August 4, 2022. Defendant filed the instant Motion to
Vacate Default and Default Judgment on August 5, 2024. No opposition has been
filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to vacate the entry of default pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, or on equitable grounds. Code of Civil
Procedure section 473.5, subdivision (a) states in relevant part: 
 
When service of a summons has not resulted
in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or
default judgment has been entered against him or
her in the action, he or she may serve and file a
notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for
leave to defend the action.  The notice of
motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event
exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or
her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has
been entered.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)
Additionally, the motion “shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party
shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other
pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd.
(b).) Defendant’s Motion was timely brought within two years of the entry of
default judgment and is supported by a declaration that explains that Defendant
only recently learned of this action when applying for credit. (Motion, Streed
Decl., ¶10.) Although Plaintiff filed a proof of personal service of the
Summons and Complaint, Defendant’s declaration demonstrates that they could not
have been personally served as stated therein. (Id. at ¶¶5-9.) Specifically,
although the proof of service indicates that Defendant was served on April 14,
2022 in Brea, California, Defendant was in the State of Washington on that
date. (Ibid.) Finally, the Motion is accompanied by a copy of
Defendant’s proposed answer to the Complaint. (Id. at Exh. 3.) Defendant
has demonstrated that they are entitled to relief from the default and default
judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Scott S. Streed’s Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment is GRANTED. THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON JUNE 3, 2022 AND DEFAULT
JUDGMENT ENTERED ON AUGUST 4, 2022 ARE HEREBY VACATED. ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
REGARDING FAILURE TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IS SET
FOR DECEMBER 9, 2024 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET
COURTHOUSE.
