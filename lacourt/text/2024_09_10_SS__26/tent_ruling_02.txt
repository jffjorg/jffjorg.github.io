California Casualty Indemnity Exchange v. Young, et
al.MOTION
TO VACATE JUDGMENT
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Jawaun De Anthony Young’s Renewed Motion to
Vacate Default or Default Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff California Casualty Indemnity Exchange
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action for insurance subrogation against Defendant
Jawaun De Anthony Young (“Defendant”) on September 22, 2022. Default judgment
was entered against Defendant on February 8, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment (“the first
Motion to Vacate”) on June 20, 2024. The Court denied that Motion on July 15,
2024. (Minute Order, 07/15/24.) On the same date, Defendant filed another
Motion to Vacate the Judgment for which no hearing was reserved. Defendant then
filed the instant Motion to Vacate Judgment (“the Renewed Motion”) on July 31,
2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
As with the first Motion to Vacate, Defendant’s renewed
Motion is not accompanied by a proof of service demonstrating service of the
motion papers or notice of hearing on Plaintiff. Defendant filed a proof of
service on August 29, 2024 that fails to indicate what papers where served, to
what address, and on what date. (Proof of Personal Service, filed 08/29/24.) Failure
to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory
requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero
(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.)
 
Second, the Motion is not
accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities, as required. “The
memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law,
evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and
textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(b).) The Motion, however, cites no legal authority in support of
the request for relief. (Motion, pp. 3:1-5:4.) Indeed, Defendant’s failure to
provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that the
[request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Jawaun De Anthony Young’s Renewed
Motion to Vacate Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
