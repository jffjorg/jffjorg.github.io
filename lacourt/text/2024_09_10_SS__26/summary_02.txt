And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's renewed motion to vacate the default judgment is denied. The defendant, Jawaun De Anthony Young, filed the motion after the court previously denied his first motion to vacate judgment. However, the renewed motion is not accompanied by a proof of service demonstrating service of the motion papers or notice of hearing on the plaintiff, California Casualty Indemnity Exchange. Additionally, the motion does not include a memorandum of points and authorities, as required by the rules of court. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to provide these required documents is a violation of the statutory requirements and due process, and is also an admission that the request for relief is without merit. Therefore, the judge has denied the defendant's renewed motion to vacate the default judgment.
