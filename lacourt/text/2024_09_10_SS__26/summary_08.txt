And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants (JSK Build, Inc., John Hur, Mark Kim, and Austin Jang) to the complaint filed by the plaintiff (Alicia Yu) is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff alleges a single cause of action for breach of contract against all defendants, but the defendants argue that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because they are not parties to the contract and therefore cannot be held liable. The judge agrees with the defendants and finds that the plaintiff has not shown a reasonable possibility of successful amendment to state a cause of action.
