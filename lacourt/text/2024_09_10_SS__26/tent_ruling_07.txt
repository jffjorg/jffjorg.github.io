ANALYSIS:
 
On April 4, 2024, Petitioner Forward Financing, LLC
(“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the
“Petition”) against Respondents AT Import and Export Transportation, LLC dba AT
Import and Export Transportation (“Respondent AT”) and Artur Tigranyan (“Respondent
Tigranyan”). No opposition to the Petition has been filed to date.
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondents “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
The arbitration agreement does not provide for the manner of
service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing, which therefore must be served
in the manner of service for a summons. (Pet., Attachment 4(b).) Petitioner
filed proofs of personal service with respect to both Respondents on August 23,
2024. However, the proofs of service do not indicate the name of the person
served on behalf of Respondent AT. (Proof of Personal Service, filed 08/23/24,
¶3b.) Nor does either proof of service show that Respondents were served with
the Notice of Hearing Date. (Proofs of Personal Service, filed 08/23/24, ¶2.) Accordingly, the Court finds that the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 are not satisfied.
