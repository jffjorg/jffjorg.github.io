TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED; 
REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS(CCP § 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            
Plaintiff Fox Hills Auto, Inc. dba

Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT KAREN DIAZ IS ORDERED TO PAY

ANALYSIS:
 
On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff Fox Hills Auto, Inc. dba
Airport Marina Ford (“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendant Karen Diaz (“Defendant”). (Motion, Gubernick Decl., Exh. 1.) To date,
Defendant has not served verified responses to the Requests for Admission. (Id.
at ¶2.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission
Admitted (“the Motion”) on July 25, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.

 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant in the amount of $360.00 based on half-an-hour of
attorney time billed at $600.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion, Gubernick
Decl., ¶5.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Fox Hills Auto, Inc. dba
Airport Marina Ford’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and
Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT KAREN DIAZ IS ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $360.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
