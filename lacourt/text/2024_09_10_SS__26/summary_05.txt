The court has deemed the requests for admission admitted due to the defendant's failure to timely serve verified responses. Additionally, the court has awarded sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $360.00, which represents one hour of attorney time billed at $300.00 per hour, plus a $60.00 filing fee. The defendant is ordered to pay the sanctions to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of service of this order.
