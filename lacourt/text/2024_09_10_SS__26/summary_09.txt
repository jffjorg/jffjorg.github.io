And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Carey B. Strom, MD, has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff, Scott Cooper's, complaint alleging a single cause of action for breach of intentional or negligent misrepresentation. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The trial court agrees and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend. The complaint does not meet the pleading standard for fraud, failing to allege specific and factual information about the misrepresentations, including who made them, to whom, and in what manner. Additionally, the complaint does not allege all the elements of fraud, including intent, reliance, and damages. As a result, the demurrer is sustained, and the plaintiff has not shown a basis for leave to amend the complaint.
