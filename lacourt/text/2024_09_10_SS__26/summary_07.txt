And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the petition to confirm an arbitration award filed by Forward Financing, LLC (Petitioner) is continued to January 7, 2025. The Petitioner must file and serve proofs of service of the petition and notice of the new hearing date by December 10, 2024. Failure to do so may result in the petition being dismissed. The basis for this ruling is that the Petitioner's proofs of personal service do not indicate the name of the person served on behalf of one of the respondents, and neither proof of service shows that the respondents were served with the notice of the hearing date. The judge is requiring the Petitioner to cure these deficiencies before the petition can proceed.
