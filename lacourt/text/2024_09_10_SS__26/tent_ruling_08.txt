v. JSK Construction, et al.DEMURRER
(CCP § 430.10, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants
JSK Build, Inc., John Hur, Mark Kim, and Austin Jang’s Demurrer to the
Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 

On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff Alicia
Yu (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants JSK Construction
(“Defendant JSK Construction”), JSK Build, Inc. (“Defendant JSK Build”), John
Hur (“Defendant Hur”), Mark Kim (“Defendant Kim”), and Austin Jang (“Defendant Jang”).
The Complaint alleges a single cause of action for breach of contract. 
 
Defendants JSK Build, Hur, Kim,
and Jang (“Moving Defendants”) filed the instant Demurrer to the Complaint on
July 10, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on August 27, 2024 and
Cross-Defendant replied on September 3, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Demurrer, Kromke Decl., ¶¶3-4 and Exh.
A.) Moving Defendants demur on the grounds that the Complaint
fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. (Citing Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
 
The Complaint alleges the
following facts: Plaintiff entered into a contract with Defendant JSK
Construction on December 15, 2023. (Compl., ¶BC-1 and Exh. A.) On December 21,
2023, Defendant informed Plaintiff he will not fulfill the agreement and
refused to refund the money paid. (Id. at ¶BC-2.) Defendant is
wrongfully withholding Plaintiff’s $20,000.00 deposit and refusing to refund
the money. (Id. at ¶BC-4.) 
 
Cause of Action for Breach of
Contract
 
A cause of action for breach of
contract must allege “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the
resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (D’Arrigo Bros. of California v. United
Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790, 800.) Moving Defendants
demur on the grounds that they are not parties to, nor in privity with any
party to, the contract. In support, they point to the copy of the contract
attached to the Complaint, which names the parties as Plaintiff and Defendant JSK
Construction. (Compl., Exh. A.) 
 
The opposition does not address
the fact that Moving Defendants are not named in the parties’ agreement,
Instead, Plaintiff provides a bevy of facts that are not included in the
allegations of the Complaint, such as Moving Defendants’ purported relationship
to Defendant JSK Construction. It is black letter law that none of these facts
can be considered by the Court in ruling on the Demurrer. A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.30; Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) Therefore, the Demurrer to the cause
of action for breach of contract is sustained.
 
Leave to Amend
 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) 
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can
be amended successfully. (Id.)
Plaintiff argues in opposition that leave to amend should be permitted to
allege alter ego liability against Moving Defendants because they promised to
be individually responsible if any issues should arise with the contract.
Plaintiff does not explain how this meets the standard for alter ego liability,
which the opposition concedes is “sufficient facts to show a unity of interest
and ownership, and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole
actor.” (Opp. P. 5:21-23 [citing Vasey v. California Dance Co. (1977) 70
Cal.App.3d 742, 749].) Plaintiff, therefore, has not shown a basis for leave to
amend with respect to Moving Defendants. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants
JSK Build, Inc., John Hur, Mark Kim, and Austin Jang’s Demurrer to the
Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
