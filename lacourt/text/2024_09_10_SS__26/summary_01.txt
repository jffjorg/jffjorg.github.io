And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against him. The default was entered on June 3, 2022, and the default judgment was entered on August 4, 2022. The defendant claims that he did not receive actual notice of the action and that his lack of notice was not caused by his avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The judge has found that the defendant's claims are supported by a declaration that explains that he only recently learned of the action when applying for credit. The judge has also found that the proof of service of the summons and complaint was not properly served on the defendant because he was not in California at the time of service. As a result, the judge has vacated the default and default judgment and set an order to show cause regarding the defendant's failure to file proof of service of the summons and complaint for December 9, 2024.
