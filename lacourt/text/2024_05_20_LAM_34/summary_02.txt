Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to lift the stay of proceedings pending the appeal of the denial of the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The court found that the amended version of Code of Civil Procedure section 1294, subdivision (a) does not operate retrospectively and therefore cannot be applied to lift the stay of proceedings. The court also found that the stay of proceedings was automatic and that the court does not have the discretion to lift it. The court cited the Supreme Court's decision in Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski, which held that federal courts must stay their proceedings when there is an ongoing interlocutory appeal of the denial of a motion to compel arbitration.
