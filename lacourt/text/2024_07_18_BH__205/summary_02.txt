And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling from Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. regarding a motion for attorneys' fees filed by Defendant City National Bank. The Court granted the special motion to strike the complaint filed by Plaintiff Adam J. Tenser and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The Defendant seeks to recover attorneys' fees for work done on the special motion to strike. The Court finds that the Defendant is the prevailing party and awards attorneys' fees in the sum of $51,764.55, which represents the work done by Mr. Hosp, Mr. Gross, and Mr. Tessem, but does not include the work done by an unnamed associate due to the Defendant's failure to identify the associate by name or provide billing records reflecting work done by that associate.
