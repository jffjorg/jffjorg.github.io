[1] The Court notes that Defendants’ citation to an
unpublished state trial court decision is improper and is not citable
authority.  (See CRC, Rule
8.1115(a) [unpublished appellate court or superior court appellate department
opinions “must not be cited or relied on by a court or a party in any other
action”]; Bolanos v. Superior Court (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 744, 761
[citation of unrelated trial court order improper].)
