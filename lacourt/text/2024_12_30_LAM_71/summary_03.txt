The judge has denied the defendant's motion to release the funds and dismiss the interpleader action. The defendant, Law Offices of David R. Denis, P.C., had requested that the court release the funds and dismiss the action, but the judge found that the defendant did not have standing to make this motion. The judge also denied the defendant's request for fees and costs, stating that the defendant was not discharged from the instant case and therefore was not entitled to receive fees and costs. The judge noted that the plaintiff, PSG California, LLC, is the only party entitled to receive attorneys' fees under California Code of Civil Procedure section 386.6(a) because it has been discharged from the instant case.
