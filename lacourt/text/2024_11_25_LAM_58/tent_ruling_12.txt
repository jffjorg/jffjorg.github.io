 
            This is a breach
of contract action. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff Myung Hwan Wee (Plaintiff)
entered into an agreement with Defendant Jaesun Lee (Defendant). Under the agreement,
Defendant was to create and complete an NFT development project by October 2022
or return Plaintiff’s payment for these services. In exchange for the
performance of these services, Plaintiff transferred 221
units of Etherium cryptocurrency to Defendant. Defendant failed to perform
his obligations under the agreement or return the 221 units of Etherium.
 
Plaintiff filed her Complaint on April
24, 2024. The Request for Entry of Default against Defendant was entered on September
18, 2024. Plaintiff dismissed DOES 1-25. 
 
The request for entry of default
judgment is granted. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiff
requests entry of default judgment in the amount of $700,000. Plaintiff does
not seek prejudgment interest, costs, or attorney fees. 
 
            In support
of the request for damages, Plaintiff submits evidence that she paid Defendant 221
units of Etherium cryptocurrency. (Wee Decl., ¶ 5.) She states that despite performing
his obligations under the agreement, Defendant did nothing in return and
refused to return my Etherium as promised. (Wee Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) 
 
            She states
that 221 units of Etherium cryptocurrency were worth $700,000 at the time of
filing the Complaint. (Wee Decl., ¶8.) 
 
            The
evidence submitted to prove-up the amount of damages requested in the Complaint
are sufficient. (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th
267, 288 [“ ‘[p]laintiffs in a default judgment proceeding must prove they are
entitled to the damages claimed’ ”].) The request for default judgment is
granted.
