And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to remove the mechanic's lien recorded by Fire Net against the property located at 321 S. Fickett St., Los Angeles, CA 90033. The lien is invalid because it was recorded more than 90 days after Fire Net completed its work on the property. The judge has also granted the related request to dismiss Fire Net's fifth and sixth causes of action for foreclosure of the lien in the First Amended Cross-Complaint. The judge's decision is based on Civil Code section 8412, which requires a contractor to record a claim of lien within 90 days after completing the direct contract. Fire Net's recording of the lien more than 90 days after completing its work makes it unenforceable.
