 
            On
January 26, 2024, Plaintiff CEP Fickett, LLC (“CEP”) filed this action against
Defendant Fire Net (“Fire Net”) arising out of a dispute related to
construction service performed by Defendant. On April 12, 2024, CEP filed a
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). Following a stipulation by the parties, CEP
filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Fire Net on May 22, 2024, for
(1) negligence, (2) violation of Business and Professions Code § 7160, (3)
intentional misrepresentation, (4) negligent misrepresentation, (5) breach of
contract, and (6) breach of implied covenant to perform work in a good and
competent manner. 
 
On March
29, 2024, Defendant Fire Net filed a Cross-Complaint and, on June 5, 2024, it
filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) against Foundation Builders
Corporation (“Builders”), David Martinez (“Martinez”), CEP, First Republic Bank
(“Bank”), and Roes 1-100 (collectively “Cross-Defendants”) for (1) breach of
written contract, (2) open book account, (3) account stated, (4) reasonable
value, (5) foreclosure of mechanics’ lien, and (6) claim on mechanics’ lien
release bond. 
 
On June
12, 2024, Fire Net filed the a Demurrer (“Demurrer”) and Motion to Strike
(“MTS”) portions of the SAC. On July 24, 2024, CEP filed an Opposition and, on
July 26, 2024, Fire Net filed a Reply.
 
The Court
overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike. 
 
Plaintiff
CEP now moves for an order removing Defendant’s mechanic’s lien and to also
dismiss the fifth and sixth causes of action in Fire Net’s
FACC. Defendant opposes the motion. A reply was filed. 
 
The motion to remove Mechanic’s Lien
is granted.
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff CEP moves for a court
order declaring the mechanic’s lien recorded by Defendant as invalid and
releasing it from the property located at 321 S. Fickett St., Los Angeles, CA
90033 (Property). Plaintiff argues the mechanic’s lien is invalid because was
recorded more than 90 days after Defendant’s work at the property was
completed.
 
Civil Code section 8412 provides:
 
“A direct contractor may not enforce a lien unless the
contractor records a claim of lien after the contractor completes the direct contract,
and before the earlier of the following times:
(a) Ninety days after completion of the work of improvement.
(b) Sixty days after the owner records a notice of
completion or cessation.”
 
The lien is
unenforceable because, per Defendant’s own admission, it was recorded more than
90 days after completion of its work. (Civ. Code, § 8412, subd. (a).)
 
On June 8, 2022,
Plaintiff CEP and Defendant entered into a contract whereby Defendant was to
install a fire protection system at the Property. (FACC ¶ 12.) 
 
On September 6,
2024, in verified responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests in this action, Defendant
stated that it completed all work required by the contract and that the last
date on which it performed work at the Property was August 1, 2023. (Novian
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A, ¶ 3, Ex. B p. 2:13-24, 6:13-18.) Thereafter, a dispute arose
between the parties, and, on January 11, 2024, Defendant recorded a mechanic’s
lien against the Property. (FACC ¶ 28.)
 
Per Civil Code
Section 8180, subdivision (a), “completion of a work of improvement occurs upon
the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) Actual completion of the
work of improvement. (2) Occupation or use by the owner accompanied by
cessation of labor. (3) Cessation of labor for a continuous period of 60 days.
(4) Recordation of a notice of cessation after cessation of labor for a
continuous period of 30 days.”
 
Here, the
discovery responses admit that Defendant did not complete any more work on the
Property as of August 1, 2023. Further, based on Defendant’s discovery
responses, Defendant contends that it completed the project. Therefore, the
latest possible date to record a mechanics lien was 90 days after August 1,
2023, or October 30, 2023. 
 
Alternatively,
Defendant admitted that it ceased performing work on the Property on August 1,
2023. (Novian Decl. ¶2, Ex. A (3:26-4:2).) Thus, pursuant to Section 8180(a)(3),
the date of “completion of the work of improvement” could be considered 60 days
thereafter. September 30, 2023 is 60 days after August 1, 2023. Accordingly, Defendant
would have had 90 days from September 30, 2023 to record a lien. (Civ. Code §§
8180(a)(3), 8412(a).) However, Defendant waited 103 days after September 30,
2023 to record the Lien.
 
In opposition,
Defendant argues that the mechanics lien was timely recorded pursuant to Civil
Code Sections 8180, subdivision (b), and 9200. 
 
Neither statute
applies to the parties here.
 
First, Plaintiff correctly
argues that Civil Code 9200 -- which states “[f]or the
purpose of this title, completion of a work of improvement occurs at the
earliest of the following times: (a) Acceptance of the work of improvement by
the public entity. (b) Cessation of labor on the work of improvement for a
continuous period of 60 days” -- does not apply. Civil Code section 9000
states that “[t]his title applies to a work of improvement contracted for by a
public entity.” Plaintiff is not a public entity, (FACC ¶ 4.)
 
Further, Section
8180, subdivision (b) states, “Notwithstanding subdivision (a), if a work of
improvement is subject to acceptance by a public entity, completion occurs on
acceptance.” (Civ. Code §8180(b).) Again, this case does not involve a contract
by a public entity for a work of improvement.
 
Finally, citing Accucon
Corp. v. P.T. Enters., 2023 Cal. Super. LEXIS 39376, Defendant argues that “completion”
is understood to encompass the satisfaction of all final administrative and
procedural requirements where regulatory compliance is involved. Defendant’s
reliance on a Los Angeles Superior court case is improper. (Pep Boys Manny Moe & Jack of California v. Old Republic Insurance
Company (2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 329, 341, fn. 5.) Moreover,
the case does not stand for the proposition that a date of completion is subject
to regulatory approvals. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the mechanic’s lien is invalid. 
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to
remove the mechanic’s lien is granted; the related request to dismiss Defendant
Fire Net’s fifth and six causes of action for foreclosure of the Lien in the
First Amended Cross-Complaint is granted.
