And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a request for entry of default judgment in a breach of contract action. The plaintiff, Myung Hwan Wee, entered into an agreement with the defendant, Jaesun Lee, under which the defendant was supposed to create and complete an NFT development project by October 2022 or return the plaintiff's payment. The defendant failed to perform his obligations and did not return the plaintiff's cryptocurrency. The plaintiff is seeking $700,000 in damages, which is the value of the 221 units of Etherium cryptocurrency that were transferred to the defendant. The judge finds that the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is sufficient to prove the amount of damages and grants the request for default judgment.
