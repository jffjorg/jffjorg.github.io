And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment in the amount of $725,000 plus $957.26 in costs. The plaintiff, Fei Li, alleged that the defendants, Dong Yu and Kundi Li, breached a contract and committed fraud in connection with an investment in a Robinhood account. The plaintiff invested $620,000 in the account and paid $123,300 in commissions. The defendants agreed to compensate the plaintiff's loss in the amount of $725,000, payable in four installments, but failed to make any payments. The judge found that the evidence only supported damages against Dong Yu under a breach of contract theory, and that the complaint did not support any legal theory of recovery against Golden Baby Inc. or Kundi Li. The judge also noted that a defendant's default operates as an admission of the matters well-pleaded in a complaint, and that it is the duty of the court to act as a gatekeeper to ensure that only appropriate claims get through.
