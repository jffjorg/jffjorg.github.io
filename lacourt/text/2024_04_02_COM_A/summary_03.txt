And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The defendant was not properly served with the summons and complaint, and the proof of service filed with the court reflects substituted service on the defendant at a different address than the one listed for the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, and the judge has determined that the burden of proving jurisdictional criteria is on the plaintiff. Since the plaintiff has failed to meet this burden, the default judgment entered on September 21, 2023, is void. The judge has ordered the defendant to file a proposed answer and has set a case management conference for August 1, 2024.
