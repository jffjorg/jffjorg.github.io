      A
claimant’s settlement is valid if approved by the court after a hearing.  (Prob. Code, §§3505, 3500.) Claimant Nolasco has suffered permanent injuries as a result of
the alleged attacks. Counsel is required to provide “an original or a photocopy
of any doctor's report containing a diagnosis of the claimant's injuries or a
prognosis for the claimant's recovery, and a report of the claimant's current
condition, must be attached to this petition as Attachment 8. A new report is
not necessary if a previous report accurately describes the claimant's current
condition.” (Petition ¶ 8.)
      Counsel
proposes to deposit into his trust account $215,000 from which Counsel intends
to pay the Medi-Cal lien and to distribute $23,614.58 to the Guardian ad Litem.
The amount of the net settlement that can be transferred to the Guardian ad
Litem is limited to $5,000.00. (Prob. Code, § 3611 subd. (e). The
Court has discretion to order that all or part of the money, not exceeding $20,000,
be held on any other conditions the Court determines is in the Claimant’s best
interest. (Prob. Code § 3611 subd. (f).) Alternatively, the Court can order
deposit of $23,614.58 into a blocked account for the benefit of Claimant.
      The
Court will hear from the parties as to the proposed transfer of funds directly
to the Guardian. The proposed order should be amended to reflect that checks
will be issued in the following manner:
1)     
A check for counsel’s fees and costs
totaling $191,198.92. 
2)     
A check to Medi-Cal for $186.50.       
3)     
A check to New York Life Insurance
Company for $165,000 to fund the annuity.
4)     
A copy of the terms of the annuity
and schedule shall be attached to the proposed order.
5)     
An order for distribution of the
balance of $23,614.58 into a blocked account for the benefit of the Claimant
(or as otherwise ordered at the hearing). 
      The
hearing is continued to May 9. 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Petitioner is
ordered to provide a supplemental declaration that includes a doctor’s report
as reference above, and an amended proposed order.
