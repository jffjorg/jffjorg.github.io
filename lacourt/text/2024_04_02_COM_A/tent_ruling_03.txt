[TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
 
      This is an action to collect on a debt
owed to Plaintiff’s predecessor-in-interest. The clerk entered default against
Defendant on August 7, 2023. The Court entered judgment against
Defendant on September 21, 2023, for $31,391.96. 
      Defendant moves to vacate default and
default judgment on grounds he was not properly served with the summons and
complaint. Defendant timely served Plaintiff with the motion, and Plaintiff did
not file an opposition. 
      Without proper service over a defendant, the court lacks personal
jurisdiction. (Brown
v. Williams (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 182, 186, fn. 4).
Therefore, an ensuing default entry and judgment are void. (Id.) 
      The proof of service filed with the Court
reflects that substituted service on Defendant was accomplished May 18, 2023 at
7301 Richfield Street, Apt 10 in Paramount, California. However, Plaintiff’s
address as reflected in the motion is 7200 Somerset Blvd., #452, Paramount,
California. 
      Plaintiff bears the burden of proving “by a preponderance of the
evidence that all necessary jurisdictional criteria are met.” (Thomas J.
Palmer, Inc. v. Turkiye Is Bankasi A.S. (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 135, 148.) This burden
must be met by competent evidence in affidavits and authenticated documentary
evidence. An unverified complaint may not be considered as an affidavit
supplying necessary facts. (Ziller Electronics Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
1222, 1232–1233.)
      Plaintiff did not file an opposition. Accordingly, Defendant’s
Motion is GRANTED. The default entered on August 7, 2023, and default judgment
entered on September 21, 2023 are both vacated. Defendant is ordered to immediately
and separately file the proposed answer presently attached to the motion. The
Court sets a Case Management Conference hearing for August 1,
 2024,  at 8:30 a.m. in
Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
