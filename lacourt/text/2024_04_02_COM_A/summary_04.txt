And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the City of Compton's demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Susan Boyd, alleges that she slipped and fell on an uneven sidewalk owned by the City, and that the City was negligent and failed to warn of the dangerous condition. The City argued that the complaint does not adequately allege all the elements of a claim for premises liability, but the judge found that the complaint meets the threshold requirement of alleging essential ultimate facts to state a claim. The judge also rejected the City's contentions that the complaint is uncertain and that it does not identify the specific employee who allegedly created the dangerous condition. The City is ordered to answer the complaint within 10 days.
