The judge has decided to take off calendar the two motions to compel responses to requests for admission and form interrogatories, as well as the request for monetary sanctions, filed by the defendant Ardeshir Nejati against the plaintiffs Coral Langarica, Jocelyn Ramon, and Samantha Ochoa. The motions were served electronically on March 7, 2024, but the defendant did not give the plaintiffs sufficient notice.

As a result, all five motions are taken off calendar.
