       This
action arises from a two-vehicle accident. Defendant, Ardeshir Nejati, served
initial written discovery on Plaintiffs, Carol Langarica, Jocelyn Ramon, and
Samantha Ochoa on November 3, 2023. 
       Defendant
did not give Plaintiffs sufficient notice of the motions, which were served
electronically on Plaintiffs’ counsel. The motions should have been served on
March 6, 2024, to allow for 16 court days of notice extended by two court days
for service accomplished electronically. (April 1, 2024, was a court holiday
and is not counted). (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd.
(a)(4)(A).) The proofs of service indicate that the motions were served on
March 7, 2024. 
Accordingly, all five motions are
taken off calendar.
