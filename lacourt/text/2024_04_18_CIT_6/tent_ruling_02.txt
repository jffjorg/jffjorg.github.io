 Case Number:  22PSCV00465    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  California  Home Solar Technology, Inc. v. Shuai Deng, et al.  Defendant’s Motion  for Terminating Sanctions or Contempt  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions or  contempt without prejudice, but orders Plaintiff again to comply with its  February 22, 2024 order. Plaintiff must pay $675.00 in monetary sanctions  to counsel for Defendant within 20 days of the Court’s order. The Court also  again orders Plaintiff to provide verified responses, without objections, to  Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Form Interrogatories,  Set One, within 20 days of the Court’s order.               Defendant is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order and file proof of  service of the same.  BACKGROUND  This is a business dispute case. On May 17, 2022, plaintiff  California Home Solar Technology, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant  Shuai Deng (Defendant) and Does 1 5to 25, alleging causes of action for conversion,  unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment, waste of  corporate assets, and constructive trust.  On March 15, 2024, Defendant moved for terminating sanctions or  contempt. On April 3, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the motion. On April 9, 2024,  Defendant replied.  LEGAL STANDARD  The court is authorized, after notice and an opportunity  for hearing, to impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in  conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: monetary sanctions, issue  sanctions, evidence sanctions, terminating sanctions, and contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2023.030,  subds. (a)-(e).) A terminating sanction may be imposed by an order  dismissing the action of the party that brought the action. (Id., §  2023.030, subd. (d)(3).)    “The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to  discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the  ultimate sanction of termination. [Citation.]” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; see J.W.  v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2018) 29  Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater  sanction is warranted. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) “Discovery  sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed what is required to  protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’” (Id.)  “But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the  evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the  discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate  sanction.” (Id., quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279–280); Creed-21  v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702, quoting Doppes  and Mileikowsky.)    The court should consider the totality of the  circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were  willful, the determent to the propounding party, and the number of formal and  informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77  Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly,  but are justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse,  and there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance  with the discovery rules. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.)  Before any sanctions may be imposed the court must make  an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to serve  the required discovery responses. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los  Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) The party who failed to  comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure  was not willful. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 788; Cornwall  v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252-253.)  Code of Civil Procedure, section 2023.010, subdivisions  (d) and (f) provide that a misuse of the discovery process includes, but is not  limited to, “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of  discovery” and “[m]aking an evasive response to discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2023.010, subds. (d), (f).)  PRELIMINARY  ISSUE              The  Court notes that Defendant did not file a proof of service for its moving  papers. But, given that Plaintiff timely filed an opposition, it appears  Defendant did timely serve the moving papers on Plaintiff. The Court will  therefore still consider the motion, but admonishes Plaintiff to file the  appropriate proofs of service going forward.  DISCUSSION  Defendant seeks terminating  sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s February 22,  2024 order directing Plaintiff to pay $675.00 in monetary sanctions and to  provide verified responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Requests for  Production of Documents, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One, within 20  days of the Court’s order. Defendant notes that counsel for Plaintiff advised  the Court at the hearing on February 22, 2024, that it had lost contact with  his client’s sole remaining principal located in China. Defendant contends  terminating sanctions are warranted here given the amount of time that has  passed since the requests were originally served in September 2023 and  Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s February 22, 2024 order.  Defendant alternatively argues that the Court should issue a contempt order conditioned  upon Plaintiff’s compliance with the February 22, 2024 order.  In opposition, Plaintiff contends  that when the complaint was filed on May 17, 2022, Plaintiff had $21,298.20 in  its bank account.[1] Plaintiff contends that  Defendant subsequently withdrew the remaining balance and closed the account,  which Plaintiff contends has made it impossible for Plaintiff to pay the  court-ordered sanctions. Plaintiff requests a continuance to afford one last  attempt to provide verified responses to the outstanding discovery requests.  In reply, Defendant contends  Plaintiff has not provided evidence to support its contention that Defendant  stole the remaining funds from the bank account, and notes that Plaintiff  clearly had the ability to hire an attorney to file this action.  The Court finds that terminating  sanctions at this point in time would be premature, despite Plaintiff’s  admitted failure to comply with the Court’s February 22, 2024 order. Plaintiff’s  counsel seems to believe that Plaintiff can provide discovery responses and  requests additional time to do so. (See Opp., 2:1-18; Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 797 [lesser sanctions  generally imposed before the ultimate sanction].) The Court does not  find there to be sufficient evidence of a willful failure to comply. (See Fairfield, supra, 246 Cal.App.2d at  p. 118.)  First, although not mentioned in  Plaintiff’s opposition, the Court notes that Defendant did not give notice of  the Court’s February 22, 2024 order as directed. (Minute Order (2/22/24).) While  Defendant did file a proof of service regarding a notice of entry of order on  February 22, 2024, it does not specify the order for which it gave notice or  include a copy of that order. (Proof of Service (2/22/24). Second, the Court  also notes that Defendant filed this motion only 22 days after the Court issued  its ruling, i.e., two days after the deadline to comply, and filed it without first  attempting to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel. (See Sullivan Decl., ¶¶  10-12; Dept. 6 Courtroom Information, p. 1 [“Parties are  required to meet and confer prior to filing any motion.”) Third, Plaintiff, at least through its counsel, has  expressed a willingness to try to provide verified responses to the outstanding  discovery requests. (Opp., 2:14-15.) Thus, the Court is inclined to give  Plaintiff one last opportunity to comply with the Court’s February 22, 2024  order here, and therefore DENIES Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions or  contempt without prejudice.  “The time has come to  reassert a well-established but apparently not well-known rule about monetary  sanctions in discovery. The rule is that it is an abuse of discretion for a  trial court to issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay the sanction. A  monetary sanction is immediately enforceable as a judgment, unless the court  rules that it is not." (Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th  608, 610.) Thus, the Court will not issue a terminating sanction for Plaintiff’s  failure to pay monetary sanction ordered on February 22, 2024.  Given the Court’s denial of  Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions, the Court also DENIES the request  for monetary sanctions. But, if Defendant brings this motion for terminating  sanctions again and prevails, the Court will permit Defendant to include the  time spent preparing this motion in addition to the time spent preparing the  subsequent motion as part of a request for monetary sanctions.  CONCLUSION  The Court DENIES the motion for terminating sanctions or contempt  without prejudice, but orders Plaintiff again to comply with its February 22,  2024 order. Plaintiff must pay $675.00 in monetary sanctions  to counsel for Defendant within 20 days of the Court’s order. The Court also  again orders Plaintiff to provide verified responses, without objections, to  Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Form Interrogatories,  Set One, within 20 days of the Court’s order.               Defendant is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order and file proof of  service of the same.
