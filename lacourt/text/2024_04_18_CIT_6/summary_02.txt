  - "Discovery sanctions 'should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed what is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.'"
  - "But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court denies Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions or contempt without prejudice. The court orders Plaintiff to comply with its February 22, 2024 order, which includes paying $675.00 in monetary sanctions to Defendant's counsel and providing verified responses to Defendant's requests for production of documents and interrogatories. The court finds that terminating sanctions at this point in time would be premature, despite Plaintiff's admitted failure to comply with the court's order. The court also notes that Defendant did not file a proof of service for its moving papers and did not attempt to meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel before filing the motion. The court is inclined to give Plaintiff one last opportunity to comply with the court's order.
