 Case Number:  23NWCV02208    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  F Lopez v. Bodega Latina
Corporation dba El Super Markets (23NWCV02208)
This premises liability action was
filed on July 17, 2023. Defendant Chedraui USA, Inc. (erroneously sued as
Bodega Latina Corporation dba El Super Markets) moves to continue trial from
February 19, 2025 to July 14, 2025, or a date thereafter convenient to the
Court. Defendant also moves to continue the final status conference from
February 15, 2024, to June 10, 2025, or to a date thereafter convenient for the
Court. Defendant argues trial should be continued because the hearing for its
Motion for Summary Judgment is currently scheduled on May 14, 2025, three
months after trial. Defendant argues that it will be prejudiced if its Motion
for Summary Judgment is not heard before trial. Defendant further argues a
continuance would facilitate discovery and settlement discussions.
Defendant Chedraui USA, Inc.’s Ex
Parte Application to Continue Trial and Final Status Conference is GRANTED
pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332(c)(6)-(7) and Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (a)(3). Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment was timely filed
and served per Code in accordance with current trial date. The only reason that
the Motion cannot be heard before the current trial is due to the congestion of
this Court’s law and motion calendar. A continuance for a trial date
on or after July 14, 2025, is reasonable. The Court will confer with the
parties to select a new final status conference and trial date.
Discovery and all trial deadlines will track the
new trial date. Moving Party to give notice.
