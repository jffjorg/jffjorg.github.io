Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Plaintiff XIAOXING ZHANG moves for summary judgment on the grounds that there are no genuine issues of material fact remaining as to his causes of action against Defendant ZHE ZHANG and Envirogreen Windows and Doors, Inc. The court finds that Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact. Specifically, Plaintiff failed to file a separate statement as required by Code Civ. Proc., section 437c(b)(1) and Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1350. As a result, the court denies Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
