English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's further responses to requests for production. The ruling states that Plaintiff's responses to requests 9, 48, 50, 52, and 53 are limited to documents from up to five years before the alleged assault and onward. The judge notes that Plaintiff's counsel failed to provide a privilege log and failed to provide authority supporting his argument that the selection of responsive documents is protected under work product privilege. The judge also states that the requests are not unduly burdensome, oppressive, overbroad, harassing, or unduly intrusive. The ruling also notes that Plaintiff's counsel's selection of responsive documents is not protected under attorney work product privilege. The judge concludes that the selection of documents is not a writing and therefore not protected under Code of Civil Procedure section 2018.030(a).
