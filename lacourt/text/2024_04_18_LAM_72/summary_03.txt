And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion in part, compelling the defendant to produce responsive documents only for requests 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, and 19. The defendant will only be required to produce documents that refer or relate to the plaintiff. The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion as to requests 1 and 2, finding them to be overbroad and violating the privacy rights of third parties. The judge has also denied both parties' requests for sanctions, finding that the defendant's opposition was substantially justified.
