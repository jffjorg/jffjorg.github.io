And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has tentatively granted the petition to approve the compromise of the claims brought by Plaintiffs Manuel De Jesus Reyes Chicas, Mylo Steven Baires, Ezra Izvy Loya Baires, and Heaven Reyes Baires against Defendant Abode Communities. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendant allowed the apartment building where they lived to develop bug infestations and fall into disrepair, resulting in personal injuries, property damage, and harassment. The Court finds the settlement amount of $200,000.00 to be reasonable, but requests that Petitioner clarify what breach of contract damages were suffered, as the Plaintiffs did not bring a claim for breach of contract.
