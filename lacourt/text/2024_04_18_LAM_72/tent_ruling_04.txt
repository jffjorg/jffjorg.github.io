 Hearing Date:  April 18, 2024
 Calendar Number:  2



 
 
 
Plaintiff Iris Yesenia Baires (“Petitioner”) petitions the
Court for approval of the compromises of the claims of Plaintiffs Mylo Steven
Baires (“Mylo”), Ezra Izvy Loya Baires (“Ezra”), and Heaven Reyes Baires
(“Heaven”) (the Court uses the parties first names to avoid confusion, and
means no disrespect), the three of whom are minors.
 
The Court tentatively GRANTS the petition to approve the
compromises.  However, the Court would
like Petitioner to clarify what breach of contract damages were suffered, since
Plaintiffs did not bring a claim for breach of contract.
 
Background
 
This is a landlord-tenant case.
 
Defendant owns and operates an apartment building located at
327 N King Avenue, Wilmington, California 90744 (the “Property”). Plaintiffs
lived in Unit A106 of the Property.
 
            Plaintiffs
allege that Defendant allowed the Unit to develop bug infestations and fall
into disrepair while they lived there, listing out a large number of defects in
the premises. (First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) ¶ 9.) Plaintiffs allege that
they suffered personal injuries, as well as property damage. Plaintiffs also
allege a number of acts of harassment by Defendant. (FAC ¶ 39.)
 
Plaintiffs filed this action on October 17, 2022. The
operative complaint is now the FAC, which raises claims for (1) breach of
implied warranty of habitability; (2) breach of statutory warranty of
habitability; (3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; (4) negligence;
(5) violations of Civil Code, section 1942.4; (6) private nuisance; and (7)
violation of tenant anti-harassment ordinance.
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 372,
any settlement of a claim made by a minor or adult with a disability must be
approved by the court. If the court is satisfied that the settlement is in
the best interest of the claimant, then the court shall approve the
settlement. (See Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1338.)   
 
A petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant
not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with
California Rules of Court, Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be
verified by the petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information
that has “any bearing upon the reasonableness” of the compromise or the
covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.) The person compromising
the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the
represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless
the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 7.952.)   
 
Discussion
 
            Petitioner
has properly verified the petitions.
 
            The
total settlement amount offered by Defendant is $200,000.00. Petitioner will
receive a gross amount of $135,500.00, Manuel De Jesus Reyes Chicas will
receive $34,500.00, and each of the minor plaintiffs will receive $10,000.00.
After attorney’s fees and costs, Petitioner will receive $79,368.54, De Jesus
Reyes Chicas will receive $20,208.23, and each of the minor plaintiffs will
receive $7,321.82. Under the settlement, the adults will pay an attorney fee of
40% each, and the minors will pay an attorney fee of 25% each.
 
            The
plaintiffs were allocated their settlement amounts based upon their individual
time living at the Property during the statutory period. (Chapman Decl. ¶ 3.)
The adults were allocated more in settlement to compensate for breach of
contract, medical expenses, property damage, out-of-pocket costs, and other
losses not suffered by the minors. (Chapman Decl. ¶ 3.) The minors in this case
suffered bug bites and allergy-type symptoms such as runny noses, coughs, and
itchy eyes, which have been treated with over-the-counter medications. (Chapman
Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
            Plaintiffs’
attorneys conducted numerous site inspections, depositions, and mediation
sessions as part of this litigation, as well as written discovery. (Chapman
Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiffs’ counsel estimates that an average of 15 hours was spent
on this matter on behalf of each of the minors. (Chapman Decl. ¶ 5.)
 
            The
Court tentatively finds this settlement to be reasonable, but would like
Petitioner to clarify what breach of contract damages were suffered, since
Plaintiffs did not bring a claim for breach of contract.  Breach of contract was mentioned in paragraph
3 of the Chapman Declaration as one of the reasons that the adults should
receive a larger portion of the settlement amount.
