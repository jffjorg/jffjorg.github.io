The judge's tentative ruling sustains the City's demurrer to the TAC without leave to amend, finding that Dawson's alleged actions were within the scope of his employment and that the City is immune from liability under Government Code section 821.6. The Court also finds that the City is immune from liability as a public entity under Government Code section 815. The ruling notes that the Plaintiff has not alleged a statute subjecting the City to liability and that amendment would be futile.
