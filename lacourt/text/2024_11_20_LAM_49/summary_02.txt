Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Defendant, Cemen Tech, Inc., and has granted its motion to dismiss the action for forum non conveniens. The Defendant argued that the provision in the governing Lease Agreements requires any lawsuit to be litigated in Iowa, and the Judge has held that this is a mandatory forum selection clause. The Judge has considered the private interests of the litigants and the interests of the public in retaining the action for trial in California, and has determined that Iowa is a suitable forum for trial. The Judge has dismissed the action without prejudice and has ordered the Defendant to give notice, unless waived.
