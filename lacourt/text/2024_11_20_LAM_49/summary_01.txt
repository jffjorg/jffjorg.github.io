And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting Non-party Rockpoint Funding, LLC's motion to quash the subpoena issued by Plaintiff Allstate Insurance Company in part, and denying it in part. The judge is ordering Rockpoint to produce certain documents, including agreements between Rockpoint and Precise MRI, communications between Rockpoint and Precise MRI where such agreements are directly referenced, and any communications wherein Rockpoint recommended or suggested a patient use Precise MRI's facilities. The judge believes that the subpoena is relevant to the Plaintiff's claims, but its current scope is unduly broad. The judge is striking a balance between the discovery of potentially relevant documents and the right of privacy of Rockpoint and third-party patients. The judge is also awarding no sanctions to either party, as the motion was not made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification.
