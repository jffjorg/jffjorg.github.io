ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)
 
“Section 664.6 was enacted to provide a
summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the
need for a new lawsuit.” (Weddington Prod., Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 809.) In deciding motions made under Section 664.6, judges
“must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement.” (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
 
II.       Discussion
 
Plaintiffs move the Court to enter
judgment in favor of Plaintiffs (Evelyn Horton and Horton Management, Co.,
Inc.) and against Defendants (John K. Jones and John K. Jones, M.D., Inc.) in
the amount of $140,282.48, plus $4,550.00 in attorney’s fees and $61.65 in
costs. (Motion, pp. 4:3–8, 7:5–9.) 
 
Among other documents, Plaintiffs
provide the Court with a copy of the “Second Amendment to March 2007 Settlement
Agreement Between Everlyn Horton and Horton Management Company, Inc. on the One
Hand, and John K. Jones, M.D. and John K. Jones, M.D., Inc. on the Other Hand”
(“Second Amended Agreement”). (Motion, Exh. 2, p. 1.) The Second Amended
Agreement is signed by both Plaintiffs (on April 24, 2018) and by both
Defendants (on April 20, 2018). (Id. at p. 5.)
 
Defendants do not oppose the Motion.

 
The Court finds that the Parties
entered into a valid and binding settlement. The Court shall enter judgment
that conforms with the written settlement agreement. 
 
        The hourly rate
and costs requested are reasonable, but the number of hours claimed is not
reasonable. This is a standard motion to enforce a settlement which should not
have required four hours, and the anticipated three hours to review the
opposition did not materialize. The Court will award two hours of work at the
hourly rate requested, plus costs. 
 
III.     Conclusion 
 
The Motion for Entry of Judgment Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., Sec. 664.6 is GRANTED. 
 
Judgment is AWARDED in favor of
Plaintiffs and against Defendants in the amount of $140,282.48. 
 
Monetary sanctions are AWARDED in
favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants in the amount of $1,361.65. 
 
Moving party is to prepare judgment.
