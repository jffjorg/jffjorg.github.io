And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Mikhail Moiseyevich Khanukhov, and Five Star Service Company, move to dismiss the action against them on the basis that the five-year deadline for bringing the action to trial has passed, and the three-year deadline for serving the defendant has also passed. The plaintiff argues that the deadlines should be tolled due to various reasons, including a stay of service caused by the defendant's bankruptcy and a delay in service due to the plaintiff's failure to discover relevant facts. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's arguments are unpersuasive and that the deadlines are not subject to tolling or extension. Therefore, the court grants the motion to dismiss the action against Khanukhov and Five Star Service Company, and the motion to quash service is moot.
