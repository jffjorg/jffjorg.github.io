And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff, Shohreh Fathieh, in a motor vehicle accident case. The defendant, Pantea Pahlavani and Atoosa Pahlavani, had served Form Interrogatories on the plaintiff, but the plaintiff only provided boilerplate objections and did not provide complete responses. The judge ordered the plaintiff to provide complete and verified responses within 20 days, but the plaintiff did not comply with the order. The judge finds that the plaintiff's objections lack merit and that the Form Interrogatories are relevant to the case. The court orders the plaintiff to provide the complete responses, and the defendant has not requested monetary sanctions.
