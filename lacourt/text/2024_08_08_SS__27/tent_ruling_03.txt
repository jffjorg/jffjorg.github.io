 Case Number:  21STCV08600    Hearing Date:   August 8, 2024    Dept:  27 Hon. Lee S. Arian, Dept 27
 
MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL 
Hearing Date: 8/8/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV08600 GUSTAVO A. CORDOBA
vs S.W. SCHOOL SUPPLY, INC et al.
Moving Party: Defendants Murle A. Hall and
Hoovestol Inc. (Hall Defendants)
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED 
 
The Hall Defendants
request that the Court continue the trial date currently set for August 23,
2024, to November 16, 2024, with all general and expert discovery remaining
closed. The other Defendants join this motion. The reason for this continuance
is because Defendant Rodriguez, who drove the vehicle that crashed into
Plaintiff, is dealing with mental health issues and will not return from Mexico
until the end of August. Counsel for Rodriguez has confirmed that he will be
available for the trial on the proposed date. If the trial date is continued,
counsels for other parties are all unavailable until sometime in November 2024.

The Court finds good
cause to continue the trial to ensure Defendant Rodriguez's attendance, as he
is a pivotal witness/party. Defendant is not seeking to reopen discovery, which
could potentially lead to further delays. Considering the availability of
Plaintiff's expert, the Court continues the trial to November 16, 2024. The new
Trial Date is set for November 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., and the Final Status
Conference is rescheduled to November 2024, at 10:00 a.m. All case-related
deadlines will adjust to the new trial date. No further continuances will be
granted.
