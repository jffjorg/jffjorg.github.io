CASE
NO./NAME: 22STCV38316 YERVAND ISKOYAN vs YARIS SANCHEZ RODRIGUEZ et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: MOTION TO VACATE IS
GRANTED
 
On December 8,
2022, Plaintiff filed the present action. No answer has been filed; however,
Plaintiff's counsel represents that the insurance carrier for the Defendant
seeks to evaluate and potentially settle the claim once the dismissal is set
aside. On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff did not attend the Final Status Conference
(FSC), nor the trial on June 6, 2024. Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration
stating that the reason for Plaintiff's non-attendance at both the FSC and
trial was due to counsel’s calendaring error or mistake, and requests mandatory
relief.


Plaintiff’s
motion is granted as it was filed on July 1, 2024, less than six months from
the dismissal entered on June 6, 2024. The court order in question is a
dismissal of the action, which is appropriate for mandatory relief.
Additionally, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration attesting to his mistake,
inadvertence, or negligence. All requirements for mandatory relief have been
met.
