MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
Hearing Date: 8/8/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV27032 SHOHREH FATHIEH
vs PANTEA PAHLAVANI et al.
Moving Party: Defendant Pantea Pahlavani
and Atoosa Pahlavani 
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES IS GRANTED 
 
On July 22, 2021,
Plaintiff filed this motor vehicle accident case. On September 7, 2023,
Defendants Pantea Pahlavani and Atoosa Pahlavani served their Form
Interrogatories Set One on Plaintiff. After several extensions, Plaintiff
provided responses consisting solely of an objection that the request was
irrelevant to all of Defendants’ Form Interrogatories or that the response
should be answered by an expert witness. On May 1, 2024, the parties attended
an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC), and the Court ordered Plaintiff to
serve full and complete responses by May 29, 2024. However, no responses were
provided. Defendants now move the court to compel further responses. Plaintiff
did not file an opposition.
The Court examined
Plaintiff’s objections and found them to be boilerplate objections not tailored
towards each individual request. Furthermore, the objections lack merit as most
of the form interrogatories ask questions about the incident, which are
obviously relevant, or questions about Plaintiff’s injuries, which do not necessarily
require expert witness testimony. The Court orders Plaintiff to provide
complete and verified responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One,
within 20 days of today. 
Defendant did not
request monetary sanctions.
