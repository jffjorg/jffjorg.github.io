And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to continue the trial date from August 23, 2024, to November 16, 2024. The reason for the continuance is that Defendant Rodriguez, a pivotal witness, is dealing with mental health issues and will not return from Mexico until the end of August. Counsel for Rodriguez has confirmed his availability for the trial on the new date. The other parties' counsel are unavailable until November 2024, so the judge has set the new trial date to ensure everyone's availability. The judge has also rescheduled the Final Status Conference to November 2024.
