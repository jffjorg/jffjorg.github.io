Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's Counsel Vanessa Fantasia. The motion is denied due to the lack of notice to the Plaintiff and the potential disruption to the orderly process of justice. The Court notes that there is an FSC and OSC Re: Sanctions set for August 16, 2024, and a Trial set for August 30, 2024, and that there would be insufficient time for the Plaintiff to retain new counsel. The Court also notes that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is proper grounds for withdrawal, as stated in Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014. The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
