CASE
NO./NAME: 22STCV30508 DARRYL ADONIS MURPHY vs LUKAS HUYNH 
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: MOTION TO COMPEL INITIAL
RESPONSES AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE GRANTED
 
On February 1,
2024, Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories (Set One), Requests for Production
(Set One), and Special Interrogatories (Set One) on Defendant 123 TRUCKING,
LLC. Responses were not provided by the statutory deadline of March 5, 2024.
Defendant requested and was granted several extensions, with the final deadline
being June 14, 2024. However, no responses were provided by that date either.
Plaintiff now moves the Court to compel initial discovery responses. 
 
Defendant did
not file an opposition or any document indicating that the responses at issue
have been provided prior to the hearing. Therefore, the motions are granted,
and Defendant is ordered to provide complete and verified responses to
Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories (Set One), Requests for Production (Set One),
and Special Interrogatories (Set One) without objections within 30 days of
today. 
 
Furthermore,
sanctions are mandatory, and the Court finds Defendant did not act with
substantial justification. Based on the simplicity of the issues and the lack
of opposition, the Court lowers the sanctions to $1,500 for all three motions
against Defendant and its counsel, jointly and severally, payable to Plaintiff
within 30 days of today.
