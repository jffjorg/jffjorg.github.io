And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the defendant has failed to meet its initial burden in negating the constructive notice element of the plaintiff's negligent entrustment claim. The defendant argued that it had fulfilled its duty of care by confirming that the renter, Cristian Mauricio Torresarias, had a valid driver's license. However, the court finds that the defendant failed to verify the renter's signature and photograph on the license, as required by Vehicle Code section 14608. The court concludes that the defendant's evidence does not demonstrate that it made reasonable efforts to verify the driver's license, as required by the statute. As a result, the court denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment and sets the matter for a hearing on August 8, 2024.
