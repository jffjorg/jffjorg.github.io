The court initially questioned whether Escobedo had been properly served with the motion but is now satisfied that proper service was made. 

The judge finds good cause for granting the motion because all necessary forms have been filed, notice was provided to both Escobedo and the defendant, and there are no upcoming court events requiring Escobedo's presence.  The judge also notes that Escobedo has not filed any opposition to the motion.

The motion will be effective upon the filing of proof of service of the court's order relieving counsel.
