Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding the plaintiff's second cause of action for harassment based on race. The plaintiff alleges that he was subjected to racial harassment and discrimination by various defendants while working for Matrix Service, Inc. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendants made unprovoked racist statements in the workplace, creating a hostile work environment. The judge has determined that the plaintiff has established material questions of fact that cannot be resolved by a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendants' motion is therefore denied.
