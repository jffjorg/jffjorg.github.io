And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for reconsideration filed by Deangelo Greene, the defendant, on December 20, 2023. The motion was filed after the Court denied the defendant's motion to strike on December 19, 2023, due to the defendant's failure to comply with the service requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 1005.

The Court found that the motion for reconsideration does not present new or different facts, circumstances, or law that warrant the reconsideration of the previous order. The Court also noted that the defendant failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time.

The Court cited several California appellate court cases, including Garcia v. Hejmadi, Rains v. Superior Court, Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc., and New York Times Co. v. Superior Court, to support its decision.

The Court's ruling is final unless a party submits an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative ruling.
