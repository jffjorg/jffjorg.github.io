And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to withdraw their admissions made in response to a request for admission. The motion was filed on December 15, 2023, after the plaintiffs provided responses to the requests for admission on February 22-23, 2023. The court found that the plaintiffs' failure to withdraw the admissions earlier was due to a mistake or neglect, and that the defendant would not be substantially prejudiced by the withdrawal. The court also noted that the defendant was aware that the plaintiffs had provided responses before the April 17, 2023 hearing on the request for admission motion.
