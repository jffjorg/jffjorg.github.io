And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Old Republic National Title Insurance Company (Old Republic) to the fourth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation in a lawsuit brought by Oaktree Investment Fund, LLC (Oaktree). The lawsuit arises from an insurance dispute related to the purchase of real property.

Old Republic demurred to the fourth cause of action, arguing that it does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and that the cause of action is uncertain. The judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend, meaning that Oaktree must refile the complaint with additional facts to support the claim of negligent misrepresentation.

The judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that a demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law. The judge must accept as true all material factual allegations and give them a liberal construction, but cannot consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or judicially noticed facts.

The judge also noted that the basis for the negligent misrepresentation against Old Republic is not clearly alleged, as the representations regarding the LURA exception were made by California Best Title, a different entity, and there is no clear relationship between that entity and Old Republic alleged in the complaint.
