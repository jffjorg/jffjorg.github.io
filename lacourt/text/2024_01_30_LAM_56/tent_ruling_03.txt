AND
RELATED CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Old Republic National Title Insurance Company
(“Old Republic”)
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant Oaktree Investment Fund, LLC (“Oaktree”) 
            
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of an
insurance dispute.  Old Republic’s
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges declaratory relief. 
 
Oaktree’s
currently operative first amended cross-complaint (the “FAXC”) alleges: (1)
specific performance; (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing; (4) negligent misrepresentation; and (5)
indemnity. 
 
In
relevant part, the FAXC alleges:  On or
about October 7, 2022, Oaktree entered into a purchase and sale agreement for
the purchase of real property (the “Property”). 
(FAXC ¶ 9.)  During the due
diligence process, Oaktree received a September 28, 2022 Preliminary Title
Report (the “September 28 Report”) from California Best Title.  (FAXC ¶ 10.) 
The September 28 Report stated that the Property was subject to a land
use restriction agreement (“LURA”) exception. 
(FAXC ¶ 10.)  When Oaktree
opened escrow on or about October 12, 2022, Oaktree received an updated report dated
September 30, 2022 (the “September 30 Report”). 
(FAXC ¶ 11.)  After Oaktree
reviewed the September 30 Report, its representative spoke to Nick Guzman
(“Guzman”), a title officer at California Best Title, who explained that the
September 30 Report was the correct title report and that the LURA was no
longer applicable to the Property and had been deleted from the document.  (See FAXC ¶ 12.)  Guzman failed to properly investigate the
applicability of the LURA and had no reasonable grounds to state that it no
longer applied.  (FAXC ¶ 13.)  
 
On
or about January 27, 2023, a title insurance policy (the “Policy”) related to
the purchase of the Property was issued to Oaktree by Old Republic.  (FAXC ¶ 15, Exhibit C.)  Pursuant to the September 30 Report, the
Policy did not list the LURA as an exception from coverage.  (FAXC ¶ 16.) 
After Oaktree purchased the Property, the Affordable Housing Group
contacted Plaintiff regarding compliance and compensation under the LURA.  (FAXC ¶ 20.) 
Oaktree tendered a claim to Old Republic regarding the inclusion of the
LURA on the Property’s title, and Old Republic subsequently filed its Complaint
in this action.  (See FAXC
¶¶ 21-22.)
 
Old
Republic filed a demurrer to the fourth cause of action on the grounds that the
XC does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and the
cause of action is uncertain. 
 
DISCUSSION
Meet
and Confer
            The meet and
confer requirement has been met.
 
Legal Standard
A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
 
Demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored.  (Chen
v. Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822.)  A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.  (Id.) 

 
Fourth Cause of Action:
Negligent Misrepresentation
The
elements of negligent misrepresentation are: (1) the misrepresentation of a
past or existing material fact; (2) without reasonable ground for believing it
to be true; (3) with intent to induce another's reliance on the fact
misrepresented; (4) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation; and (5)
resulting damage.  (Apollo Capital
Fund, LLC v. Roth Capital Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226,
243.)  A positive assertion is required;
an omission or an implied assertion or representation is not sufficient.  (Id.) 
Responsibility for negligent misrepresentation rests upon the existence
of a legal duty, imposed by contract, statute or otherwise, owed by a defendant
to the injured person.  (Bock v.
Hansen (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 215, 228.) 
California courts have recognized a cause of action for negligent
misrepresentation, i.e., a duty to communicate accurate information, in two
circumstances.  (Id. at 229.)  The first situation arises where providing
false information poses a risk of and results in physical harm to person or
property.  (Id.)  The second situation arises where information
is conveyed in a commercial setting for a business purpose.  (Id.) 
With respect to the second situation, the duty extends only to losses
suffered by plaintiffs belonging to a limited group of persons for whose
benefit and guidance the misrepresentation was made.  (Leining v. Foster Poultry Farms, Inc. (2021)
61 Cal.App.5th 203, 219.) 
 
The
basis for the negligent misrepresentation against Old Republic is not clearly
alleged.  The representations regarding
the LURA exception were made by California Best Title, and there is no clear
relationship between that entity and Old Republic alleged in the body of the
FAXC.  The Court therefore SUSTAINS the
Demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Moving party
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
