Background   
Plaintiff Hudson Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) alleges as
follows:
Plaintiff furnished to the State of
California, Department of Motor Vehicles, License Bond No. 10005592 (“Bond”) for
and at the request of El Pollo Auto, Inc. (“EPA”) and Leopoldo Robles
(“Robles”) in the penal sum of $50,000.00. On October 23, 2013, a general
indemnity agreement was made by EPA and Robles in Plaintiff’s favor. Thereafter
(i.e., “[o]n or about April, 2021”), several claims were made against the Bond.
Plaintiff requested that EPA and Robles hold Plaintiff harmless and pay the
claims, but they failed to do so. Plaintiff retained counsel who filed an
interpleader action and paid the penal sum of the bond pursuant to an
interpleader order.
