And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Hudson Insurance Company's application for default judgment without prejudice. The application is denied due to defects in the evidence presented by the plaintiff. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to attach evidence of the claims made against the bond, and did not provide a clear explanation for the collection fee expenses incurred by Jomax Recovery Services. The plaintiff is requested to provide the court with a copy of the interpleader complaint filed in Case No. 20STCV09077 and to provide documentary evidence of the collection fee expenses. The judge has set an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment for November 27, 2023.
