Defendant to give notice.
 
I.                  
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
 
A party may move for a judgment on the pleadings as to an
entire complaint or as to a particular cause of action in a complaint. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 438 subd. (c)(2)(A).) If a defendant moves for a judgment on
the pleadings and argues that a complaint does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against that defendant, then the court should
grant a defendant’s motion only if the court finds as a matter of law that the
complaint fails to alleges facts sufficient to constitute the cause of action.
(See id., § 438 subd.
(c)(1)(B)(ii); see also Mechanical Contractors Assn. v. Greater Bay Area Assn.
(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 672, 677.) 
 
“The standard for granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is
essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under
the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially
noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Bezirdjian v. O’Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321.) When considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
the court not only should assume that all facts alleged in the SAC are true but
also should give those alleged facts a liberal construction. (See Gerawan Farming, Inc. v.
Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515–516, 101 Cal.Rptr.2d 470, 12 P.3d 720.) In
particular, the court should liberally construe the alleged facts “‘with a view
to attaining substantial justice among the parties.’ [Citation.]” (See Alliance
Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1226, 1232, 44
Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 900 P.2d 601.)
 
Defendant City of Los Angeles (Defendant) seeks judgment on
the First Amended Complaint (FAC) of Plaintiff Sohel Sedghat (Plaintiff) on the
grounds that the FAC pleads no statutory basis for liability against Defendant,
a public entity, and further that the FAC fails to allege facts supporting any
cause of action.
 
Defendant’s argument is
unpersuasive, as the statutory basis for liability against a public entity for
false arrest is not obscure. Although public entities are generally immune from
liability unless otherwise provided by statute (See Gov. Code § 815),
other statutory authority states: “A public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or
omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment
if the act or omission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a
cause of action against that employee or his personal representative.” (Gov.
Code, § 815.2, subd. (a).) “ And Government Code § 820.4, which immunizes
public employees for acts or omissions, “exercising due care, in the execution
or enforcement of any law,” specifically states that “[n]othing in this section
exonerates a public employee from liability for false arrest or false
imprisonment.” (Gov. Code § 820.4.) Thus if police officers are liable as
public employees for the alleged false arrest of Plaintiff, then Defendant will
be derivatively liable for those acts under section 815.2. (See Sullivan v.
County of Los Angeles (1974) 12 Cal.3d 710, 717 [“Thus if the county
sheriff is liable as a public employee under sections 820 and 820.4 for his
alleged failure to release plaintiff from jail after all charges against him
were dismissed, then the county will be derivatively liable for those acts
under section 815.2.”].)[1]
Defendant next argues that each
claim in the FAC is pleaded in conclusory fashion. (Motion at pp. 2–3.) But
while Defendant is correct that Plaintiff’s FAC is concise to a fault,
Defendant does not offer any analysis of what is lacking in the FAC such
that relief may lie. The FAC alleges that on the afternoon of May 16, 2021, in
the parking lot of Balboa Park in Van Nuys, Plaintiff called the police and
complained of being threatened by another individual, whereupon the LAPD
arrived and, without cause, detained Plaintiff by forcibly placing him in
handcuffs for an extended period of time. (FAC at pp. 3–5.) Defendant
identifies no defect or omission in these allegations that would warrant
dismissal of the FAC.
The motion is therefore DENIED.
