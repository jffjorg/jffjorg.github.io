And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has denied the City of Los Angeles's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The city argued that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against it, as there is no statutory basis for liability against a public entity for false arrest. However, the judge found that the city's argument is unpersuasive, as the statutory basis for liability against a public entity for false arrest is not obscure. The judge also found that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to support a cause of action, despite the city's claim that the allegations are conclusory. The judge noted that the city's argument is based on the lack of analysis of what is lacking in the complaint, and that the city does not identify any defect or omission in the allegations that would warrant dismissal of the complaint.
