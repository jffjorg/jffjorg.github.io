Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the demurrer to the third, ninth, tenth, twelfth, and fourteenth causes of action is sustained with leave to amend. The judge finds that the third cause of action for nuisance is duplicative of the fifth cause of action for negligence, and the twelfth cause of action for negligence per se is not a separate cause of action from the negligence claim. The judge also rules that the housing discrimination claim under FEHA is not adequately pleaded.

The judge sustains the demurrer as to the ninth cause of action for fraud, finding that the allegations are insufficiently particular. The judge also sustains the demurrer as to the fourteenth cause of action under the Bane Act, finding that the allegations do not state a cause of action.

However, the judge overrules the demurrer as to the eighth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action.

The judge denies the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that the allegations support a prayer for punitive damages by malicious or oppressive conduct.

The judge also denies the motion to strike the corporate ratification allegations, finding that the Complaint pleads corporate ratification by an officer or managing agent as required by statute.
