Defendant argues in reply that the police may be immune from false arrest
claims under Government Code § 820.2, for “the exercise of the discretion
vested in [them].” (Reply at p. 2.) No authority supports this position. Even
if the police exercised discretion in deciding to investigate the call that
Plaintiff alleges, “section 820.2 did not clothe [them] with immunity from the
consequences of [their] negligence in conducting it.” (McCorkle v. City of
Los Angeles (1969) 70 Cal.2d 252, 261.)
