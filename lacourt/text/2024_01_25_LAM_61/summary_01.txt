This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from the defendant, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. The plaintiff, Sylvia Santiago, seeks information about the defendant's hiring and firing practices at the Baldwin Park facility. The defendant has provided some responses to the interrogatories, but the plaintiff seeks more information.

The judge grants the motion in part, allowing the plaintiff to obtain discovery concerning non-managerial RNs in the Labor & Delivery, Acute Care Obstetrics – Unit 1, Neo Natal ICU – Unit 1, and Obstetrics/Gynecology departments at the Baldwin Park facility. The motion is denied as to Interrogatory No. 82.

United Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children's Foundation of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, and California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.010, 2030.300, 2031.310, 2033.290, and 2017.010.
