And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The court has considered the motion to quash subpoenas issued by the defendant to Café Bravo, Uber Technologies, Inc., and ASAP Pharmacy. The plaintiff, Leonar Hajiabadi, argues that the subpoenas seek irrelevant and private information, including medical records and pharmaceutical information. The court finds that the plaintiff's objections are without merit and denies the motion to quash subpoenas. The court concludes that the subpoenas are relevant to the case and do not violate the plaintiff's right to privacy. The court orders that the subpoenas remain in effect.
