  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to strike portions of
  first amended complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant 24 Hour Fitness USA,
LLC          
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Strike Portions of First Amended Complaint
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendant 24 Hour Fitness USA, LLC (“Defendant”) moves the court for
an order striking from the First Amended Complaint filed by plaintiff Art Jr
Cervera (“Plaintiff”) (1) the prayer for punitive damages (FAC p. 21, ¶ 3), and
(2) the supporting allegations (FAC ¶¶ 34-35). 
The court grants Defendant’s motion to strike Plaintiff’s prayer for
punitive damages and related allegations because (1) Plaintiff has prayed for
punitive damages pursuant to Civil Code sections 1708.5, subdivision (b), and
1782, subdivision (2), but (i) Civil Code section 1708.5 authorizes a court to
impose punitive damages against “[a] person who commits a sexual battery upon
another[,]” but Defendant is not alleged to have committed the sexual battery
against Plaintiff (FAC ¶¶ 8-10), and (ii) Civil Code section 1782, which is
part of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, does not authorize a court to impose punitive
damages, and (2) Plaintiff has not alleged specific facts establishing (i) that
Defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, or (ii) advance knowledge
and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification, or act of oppression,
fraud, or malice on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of
Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,
subd. (a); Civ. Code, §§ 1708.5, subd. (b), 1782, 3294, subds. (a), (b).) 
The burden is on the plaintiff “to articulate how it could amend its
pleading to render it sufficient.”¿ (Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners
Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290.)¿ To satisfy that
burden, a plaintiff “must show in what manner he can amend his complaint and
how that amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.”¿ (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) 
Plaintiff did not file an opposition to this motion, and therefore has
not articulated how he could amend his request for punitive damages against
Defendant to render it sufficient.  The
court therefore grants Defendant’s motion to strike without leave to amend.
ORDER
            The court grants defendant 24 Hour
Fitness USA, LLC’s motion to strike.
            The court orders that the following
portions of the First Amended Complaint filed by plaintiff Art Jr Cervera on
December 4, 2023, as alleged against defendant 24 Hour Fitness USA, LLC, are
stricken: (1) paragraph 34, in its entirety (page 21, lines 4-8), (2) paragraph
35 (page 21, lines 8-15), and (3) paragraph 3 of the prayer for relief (page
21, lines 22-24). 
The court orders defendant 24 Hour Fitness USA, LLC to file an answer
to plaintiff Art Jr Cervera’s First Amended Complaint no later than 10 days
from the date of this order.
            The court orders defendant 24 Hour
Fitness USA, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  September 26, 2024
