 Case Number:  23STCV30834    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  53  Ramirez v. California Landmark Group  23STCV30834 
Ex
Parte Application  9/26/24
The
court grants in part, and denies in part, defendants California Landmark Group,
Inc., R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management LLC’s ex parte application as follows.
The
court orders that the hearing on defendants’ motion for protective order re
deposition subpoena served on Janney and Janney Attorney Service Inc. is
advanced from May 27, 2025, to December 10, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
The
court orders that deponent Janney and Janney Attorney Service Inc.’s obligation
to comply with the Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business Records
directed to Janney and Janney Attorney Service Inc. (attached as Exhibit 1 to defendants’
motion for protective order, filed September 20, 2024) is stayed until the
court issues an order ruling on defendants’ motion for protective order re
deposition subpoena served on Janney and Janney Attorney Service Inc.
The
court does not find good cause to grant defendants’ request for an order
shortening time on the hearing on defendants’ motion for protective order re
deposition subpoena served on Janney and Janney Attorney Service Inc. or to
prescribe shorter times for the filing and service of papers than the times
specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subd.
(b).)  The court therefore denies that
request.
The
court denies all other relief requested in defendants’ ex parte application. 
 
The court
orders defendants California Landmark Group, Inc., R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management
LLC to give notice of this order.
