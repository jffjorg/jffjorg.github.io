DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Zenayda Servin (“Plaintiff”) requests that the court enter
default judgment against defendant JJL Machine Shop, Inc., d/b/a Alameda Motors,
or, in the alternative, set an Order to Show Cause re entry of default judgment
for hearing.
The court notes that the default of JJL Machine Shop, Inc., d/b/a
Alameda Motors appears to have been improperly entered.
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint in this action
on March 12, 2024, against defendants Luis A. Perez d/b/a Alameda Motors and
Felipe Perez d/b/a Fix and Go Auto Repair.[1]  On April 16, 2024, those defendants each filed
General Denials to the First Amended Complaint. 
(April 16, 2024 General Denials.) 
Thereafter, on June 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an “Amendment to
Complaint,” amending the First Amended Complaint to correct the name of
defendant Luis A. Perez, d/b/a Alameda Motors to be JJL Machine Shop, Inc.,
d/b/a Alameda Motors.  (June 17, 2024
Amendment to Compl., p. 1.)  The court
entered an order approving the amendment on June 17, 2024.  The clerk entered default of JJL Machine Shop,
Inc., d/b/a Alameda Motors on August 2, 2024. 
(Aug. 2, 2024 CIV-100, p. 1.) 
It appears that the court should not have entered an order approving
the Amendment to Complaint lodged by Plaintiff on June 13, 2024.  In requesting to amend the First Amended
Complaint, it appears that Plaintiff was attempting to substitute a new entity
in as a defendant.  Specifically,
Plaintiff, though using the “Amendment to Complaint” form to correct the name
of Luis A. Perez, d/b/a Alameda Motors, appears to have been attempting to add
an entirely new corporate entity as a defendant (i.e., JJL Machine Shop, Inc.,
d/b/a Alameda Motors).  (June 17, 2024
Amendment to Complaint.)  This appears to
have been an improper use of the “Amendment to Complaint” form. 
Further, even if that were a proper use of the Amendment to Complaint
form, in amending its First Amended Complaint on June 17, 2024, Plaintiff merely
corrected the name of defendant Luis A. Perez d/b/a Alameda Motors to be JJL
Machine Shop, Inc., d/b/a Alameda Motors. 
(June 17, 2024 Amendment to Complaint.) 
Plaintiff did not add JJL Machine Shop, Inc., d/b/a Alameda Motors as a
defendant, nor did Plaintiff designate this defendant with a fictitious name
(i.e., a Doe defendant) and substitute it for that fictitious defendant.  Instead, the effect of the Amendment to
Complaint is the substitution of the true name of the defendant (i.e., JJL
Machine Shop, Inc., d/b/a Alameda Motors) for the incorrect name (i.e., Luis A.
Perez d/b/a Alameda Motors) wherever it appears in the First Amended Complaint.

Thus, because defendant JJL Machine Shop, Inc., d/b/a Alameda Motors
has already filed a responsive pleading to the First Amended Complaint, it
appears that it should not have had its default entered.  (April 16, 2024 General Denial filed by Luis
A. Perez d/b/a Alameda Motors.)  Thus,
the court denies Plaintiff’s ex parte application. 
Based on the analysis set forth above, the court also finds that it is
appropriate, and therefore exercises its discretion, to sets an Order to Show
Cause (1) why the court should not set aside its June 17, 2024 order approving
the Amendment to Complaint, and (2) why the court should not set aside and
strike JJL Machine Shop, Inc., dba Alameda Motors’s default, entered on August
2, 2024, for hearing on December 11, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.
Any response to the Order to Show Cause shall be filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing. 
            The court orders plaintiff Zenayda
Servin (1) to give notice of this ruling to all parties who have appeared in
this action, and (2) to file a proof of service of the notice of ruling with
the court no later than November 4, 2024.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  September 26, 2024
