(2)  
Ex
Parte Application to Vacate September 26, 2024 Hearing
The court considered the moving papers filed in connection with the
motion for an order staying arbitration or, in the alternative, for leave to
withdraw from arbitration.  No opposition
papers were filed.
The court considered the moving and opposition papers filed in
connection with the ex parte application.
MOTION FOR ORDER STAYING ARBITRATION OR,
IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR LEAVE TO WITHDRAW FROM ARBITRATION
Plaintiff Veronica Martinez
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order staying the arbitration proceedings
between herself and defendant Public Health Foundation Enterprises,
Inc., d/b/a Heluna Health (“Heluna”) or, alternatively, granting Plaintiff
leave to withdraw from the arbitration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.97.
The court finds that Plaintiff
has not shown that she served Heluna with the pending motion.  
The proof of service attached
to Plaintiff’s motion states that the declarant “caused [the] envelope
[with the moving papers] to be delivered for service to the recipient indicated
above on the above-mentioned date, by providing same to Signal Attorney Service
. . . .”  (Mot., p. 10:20-22 [emphasis
added].)  However, this statement is not
based on the personal knowledge of the declarant.  Thus, the court finds that this proof of
service is defective and insufficient to establish that Plaintiff served Heluna
with the pending motion.[1]
The court therefore denies
Plaintiff’s motion, without prejudice to Plaintiff’s filing a new motion and
filing a valid proof of service which establishes that the motion has been
properly served on Defendant. 
EX PARTE APPLICATION TO VACATE SEPTEMBER
26, 2024 HEARING
Specially appearing defendant
Heluna has filed an ex parte application requesting that the court vacate the
September 26, 2024 hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for an order staying
arbitration or, alternatively, granting leave to withdraw from
arbitration.  Heluna moves for this
relief on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction over it because
Plaintiff has not properly served Heluna with the summons and complaint in this
action. 
The court has denied
Plaintiff’s motion for the reason set forth above.  The court therefore finds that Heluna’s ex
parte application is moot and orders that it is taken off calendar.
ORDER
The court denies plaintiff Veronica Martinez’s motion for an order
staying arbitration or, in the alternative, for leave to withdraw from
arbitration, without prejudice to
Plaintiff’s filing a new motion and filing a valid proof of service which
establishes that the motion has been properly served on Defendant.
            The court orders that specially
appearing defendant Public Health Foundation Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Heluna
Health’s ex parte application to vacate the September 26, 2024 hearing is taken
off calendar as moot.   
            The court orders plaintiff Veronica
Martinez to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  September 26, 2024
