And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to stay arbitration or withdraw from arbitration, without prejudice. The plaintiff had failed to show that she had served the defendant with the pending motion, and the proof of service submitted was defective and insufficient. The judge also denied the defendant's ex parte application to vacate the September 26, 2024 hearing, as it was moot due to the denial of the plaintiff's motion. The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
