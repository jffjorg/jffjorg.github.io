And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered a motion by plaintiff Justin Pagano for monetary sanctions against defendant FCA US LLC. The motion is based on the defendant's counsel's failure to respond to certain emails sent by plaintiff's counsel. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support his request for sanctions, as he has not identified a statute or law that would authorize the court to impose sanctions, nor has he identified conduct that is subject to sanctions. Therefore, the court denies the motion for monetary sanctions.
