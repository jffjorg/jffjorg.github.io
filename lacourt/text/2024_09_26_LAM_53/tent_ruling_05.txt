[tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for monetary sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Justin Pagano            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Monetary Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Justin Pagano (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
awarding monetary sanctions in his favor and against defendant FCA US LLC (“Defendant”)
in the amount of $7,500 on the ground that Defendant and its counsel have
engaged in “unprofessional behavior.” 
(Mot., p. 3:15-17.)  It appears
that the basis of Plaintiff’s motion is Defendant’s counsel’s failure to
respond to certain emails sent by Plaintiff’s counsel.  
The court finds that Plaintiff has not supported his request for
monetary sanctions against Defendant because Plaintiff has not (1) identified a
statute or other law that would authorize the court to impose monetary
sanctions against Defendant, or (2) identified conduct that is subject to
sanctions. 
The court therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion.
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Justin
Pagano’s motion for monetary sanctions.
            The court orders plaintiff Justin
Pagano to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  September 26, 2024
