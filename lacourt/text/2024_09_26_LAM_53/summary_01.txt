The Judge found that the Plaintiff has not alleged specific facts establishing the Defendant's guilt or advance knowledge and conscious disregard, as required by law. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion and therefore did not articulate how he could amend his pleading to render it sufficient. As a result, the Judge granted the motion to strike without leave to amend. The Judge ordered that the stricken portions of the First Amended Complaint be removed and that the Defendant file an answer to the complaint within 10 days.
