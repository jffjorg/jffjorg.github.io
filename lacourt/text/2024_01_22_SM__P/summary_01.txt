And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in the case of Crochet v. Brown, et al. The plaintiff, Crochet, is suing the defendants, Robbie Brown and his employer Old Town Baking Company, Inc, for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. Crochet is seeking an order compelling Old Town to produce documents responsive to their inspection demand, specifically requests 33, 44, 45, and 46. Old Town had objected to the requests, citing attorney-client privilege, attorney-work product doctrine, vagueness and ambiguity, irrelevance, and invasion of privacy. The court has ordered Old Town to produce a privilege log as to any responsive documents, as reports or documents created in anticipation of litigation are protected by attorney-client and/or work product privileges.
