Crochet v. Brown, et al., Case No. 23SMCV02694
Hearing date January 23, 2024
Plaintiff Crochet’s Motion to Compel
Defendant Old Town Baking Company, Inc’s Production of Documents at Deposition
Plaintiff
sues defendants driver Brown and his employer Old Town Baking for injuries
sustained in a motor vehicle accident. Crochet seeks an order compelling Old
Town to produce documents responsive to Crochet’s inspection demand, numbers
33, 44, 45, and 46. 
On
July 24, 2023 Crochet served a notice of Old Town’s PMQ, with a request for
production of documents, requests 33, 44, 45 and 46. Old Town objected to the request
for production, though Keith Klinger, the PMQ, was deposed. An IDC was held.
 
RPD
No. 33 requests “All DOCUMENTS concerning disciplinary action against Defendant
Robbie Brown as a result of the INCIDENT.” 
RPD
No. 44 requests: “All correspondence between DEFENDANT and Defendant Robbie
Brown, concerning the INCIDENT.” 
RPD
No. 45 re quests: “All emails between
DEFENDANT and Defendant Robbie Brown, concerning the INCIDENT.” 
RPD
No. 46 requests: “All text messages between DEFENDANT and Defendant Robbie
Brown, concerning the INCIDENT.” 
Old
Town asserted the following objections: attorney-client privilege,
attorney-work product doctrine, vague, ambiguous, overly broad, irrelevant, and
invasion of privacy.
As
discussed at the IDC, if reports or documents were created at the request of
counsel in anticipation of litigation, such would be protected via the
attorney-client and/or work product privileges. The court orders defendant to
produce a privilege log as to any responsive documents.
