And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrers filed by defendants American Medical Response Ambulance Service, Inc., et al., and Eric Leahy to the plaintiff's third amended complaint. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, alleges that she was sexually battered by defendant EMT Anderson while being transported to a psychiatric facility, and that defendants are vicariously liable for the intentional torts committed by Anderson.

The court overrules the demurrer filed by defendants to the first through third and fifth causes of action, finding that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support the theory of ratification. The court also notes that defendants' demurrer to these causes of action was previously overruled, and that a demurrer to a pleading on grounds which were previously overruled is improper.

However, the court sustains Defendant Eric Leahy's demurrer to the sixth cause of action for Negligence without leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to constitute the cause of action. The court also notes that plaintiff's theory of negligence fails factually, as defendant Leahy did report the incident he observed involving Anderson, and that plaintiff relies on the fact that Leahy did report the incident to support her assertion that AMR ratified the incident involving her.

The court orders defendants to file and serve an answer within 10 days of the date of the ruling, and plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
