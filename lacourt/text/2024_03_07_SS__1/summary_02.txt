Significant Statements:
* "A procedural unconscionability analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion."
* "Arbitration contracts imposed as a condition of employment are typically adhesive[.]"
* "The core concern of the unconscionability doctrine is the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party."
* "When there is no other indication of oppression other than the adhesive aspect of an agreement, the degree of procedural unconscionability is low."
* "The Court will strike that language."
* "Engaging in mediation on a classwide basis is inconsistent with the intention to arbitrate."
