And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre LLC's motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents, set one, and has ordered plaintiff Mansoureh Aghayan to serve verified responses to the requests within 20 days of the date of this order. The court has also ordered plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to defendant in the amount of $1,650 within 30 days of the date of this order.

The court has also granted defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, set two, numbers 59 and 60-63, but has denied defendant's request for monetary sanctions against plaintiff. The court has ordered plaintiff to serve a further written response to defendant's requests for production of documents, set two, number 59, and to produce responsive documents within 20 days of the date of this order.

The court has considered the moving and responding parties' papers and has found that the circumstances presented do not warrant the imposition of sanctions against plaintiff.
