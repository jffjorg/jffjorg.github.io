English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's October 24, 2022 order granting the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The court finds that there has been a change of law regarding the enforcement of arbitration agreements by third party nonsignatories, and that the plaintiff's claims are not subject to arbitration. The court vacates its previous order and denies the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The court also lifts the stay of the action and orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
