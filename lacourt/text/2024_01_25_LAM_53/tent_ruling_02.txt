(1)  
Motion
to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One
(2)  
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two,
Nos. 59, 60-63
The court
considered the moving, qualified opposition, and reply papers filed in
connection with each motion. 
 
 
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE
Defendant Beverly Hills
Rehabilitation Centre LLC (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order (1)
compelling plaintiff Mansoureh Aghayan (“Plaintiff”) to serve verified
responses, without objections, and to produce responsive documents to
Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff in the amount of
$3,135.
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection is directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party making the demand may move for an order compelling response
to the demand.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2031.300, subd. (b).)¿¿¿¿ 
Defendant
served Plaintiff with its Requests for Production of Documents, Set One on
October 24, 2022.  (Hassell Decl., Ex.
A.)  Plaintiff did not timely serve
responses to the Requests for Production and had not served responses as of the
date that Defendant filed this motion. 
(Hassell Decl., ¶¶ 3, 13, 20 [“To date, Plaintiff failed to provide
responses to this Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One”].)  
Plaintiff
filed a “qualified opposition” to Defendant’s motion on January 8, 2024,
stating that verified responses have been served as to Requests for Production
of Documents, numbers 1 and 2 on that date. 
(Opp., p. 1:21-23.)  However, Plaintiff
did not (1) submit evidence showing that responses to those requests have been
served, and (2) assert or submit evidence showing that responses to the
remaining Requests for Production of Documents (numbers 3 through 55) have been
served.  (Hassell Decl., Ex. A, pp. 3-8
[Requests for Production Nos. 1-55].) 
The court
therefore grants Defendant’s motion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
The court
grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)  The court finds that $1,650 (6
hours x $275 hourly rate) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against
Plaintiff in connection with this motion. 
(Hassell Decl., ¶ 22.) 
 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET TWO, NOS. 59, 60-63
Defendant moves the court for
an order (1) compelling Plaintiff to provide further responses to Defendant’s
Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two, numbers 59-63, and (2) awarding sanctions
in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff in the amount of $2,722.50.
The court grants Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s further response to Requests for Production of
Documents, number 59 because the objections in that response are without
merit.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).) 
The court denies Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, numbers 60-63 because (1) the demands are overbroad, and (2) the
objections in the responses are not without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a)(3).)
In light of the mixed results
of the court’s ruling, the court finds that the circumstances presented would
make the imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore denies Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(h).) 
ORDER
The court grants defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre LLC’s
motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents. 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, the court orders
plaintiff Mansoureh Aghayan (1) to serve on defendant Beverly Hills
Rehabilitation Centre LLC full and complete verified responses, without
objections, to defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre LLC’s Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, that comply with Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2031.210 through 2031.250, and (2) to produce to defendant Beverly
Hills Rehabilitation Centre LLC all documents and things in plaintiff Mansoureh
Aghayan’s possession, custody, or control, which are responsive to those
requests, within 20 days of the date of this order. 
The court orders plaintiff Mansoureh Aghayan to pay monetary sanctions
to defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre LLC in the amount of $1,650
within 30 days of the date of this order. 
The court grants in part defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre
LLC’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production numbers 59
and 60-63 as follows. 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, the court orders
plaintiff Mansoureh Aghayan (1) to serve a further written response to
defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre LLC’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set Two, number 59, and (2) to serve on defendant Beverly Hills
Rehabilitation Centre LLC all documents and things in plaintiff Mansoureh
Aghayan’s possession, custody, or control which are responsive to that request,
within 20 days of the date of this order.
The court orders defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre LLC to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
