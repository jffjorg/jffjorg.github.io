[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Curtis Dothard
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:     Defendants Ford Motor Company and Santa
Monica Ford Lincoln   
Motion for Reconsideration
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion.
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants plaintiff
Curtis Dothard’s (1) request for judicial notice, filed on May 24, 2023, and
(2) request for judicial notice, filed on August 30, 2023.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Curtis Dothard (“Plaintiff”) requests that the court (1) reconsider
and vacate its October 24, 2022 order granting the motion to compel arbitration
and stay proceedings filed by defendants Ford Motor Company and Santa Monica
Ford Lincoln (“Defendants”), and (2) enter a new order denying Defendants’
motion to compel arbitration.  (Oct. 24,
2022 Order, p. 7:26-27.) 
“If
a court at any time determines that there has been a change of law that
warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered, it may do so on its own
motion and enter a different order.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿1008, subd. (c).)¿
“An appellate decision published during an action’s pendency may be a change of
law under section 1008, subdivision (c), and requires a trial court to
reconsider its earlier ruling if the decision materially changed the law.”¿ (State
of California v. Superior Court (Flynn) (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 94, 100.)¿
“Even without a change of law, a trial court has the inherent power to
reconsider its prior rulings on its own motion at any time before entry of
judgment.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ “In addition, the court may consider a number of
factors in determining whether to exercise its discretion, including the
importance of the change of law, the timing of the motion, and the
circumstances of the case.”¿ (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2013)
218 Cal.App.4th 96, 107.)¿¿ 
First, as a
threshold matter, the court notes that Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s
motion is untimely because it was not filed within 10 days after service of the
October 24, 2022 notice of ruling.  The
court disagrees.  Although motions for
reconsideration made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008,
subdivision (a) must be made within 10 days after service upon the moving party
of written notice of entry of the subject order, Plaintiff has moved for
reconsideration of the court’s October 24, 2022 order under section 1008,
subdivision (c), which does not have the same 10-day filing requirement. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (c); Flynn, supra, 4 Cal.App.5th
at p. 100 [a change of law “‘is always an appropriate basis, up until a
final judgment is entered, for changing an interim order’”] [emphasis
added]; Mot., p. 1:21-24.) 
The
court therefore finds that Plaintiff’s motion is not untimely. 
Second,
Defendants assert that the court does not have jurisdiction to hear this motion
since this action has been stayed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.4.  The court disagrees.  “While it is correct as a general matter that
the granting of a stay under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4 places the
proceedings before the trial court in ‘the twilight zone of abatement’
[citation], such a stay does not effect the ‘ouster of the judicial power
vested in the trial court of this state by our Constitution’ [citation].¿
Because contractual arbitration ‘dr[aws] its vitality from the contract’
[citation], a trial court has inherent power to revisit the foundational
‘question of whether the parties are bound by a particular arbitration agreement’
[citation], just as it may on its own motion revise any other interim ruling in
the action pending before it [citation].”¿ (Pinela v. Neiman Marcus Group,
Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 227, 238 [internal citations omitted].)¿
The
court therefore finds that it has the jurisdiction to hear and rule on
Plaintiff’s pending motion for reconsideration of the court’s order granting
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration. 
Third,
the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that there has been “a change of law”
regarding the enforcement of arbitration agreements by third party
nonsignatories that warrants reconsideration of the court’s order.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (c).) 
Since
the date of the court’s October 24, 2022 order, numerous appellate cases have
disagreed with and rejected the reasoning set forth in Felisilda v. FCA US
LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486 (“Felisilda”), on which the court
relied in granting Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration.  (Oct. 24, 2022 Order, pp. 3:14-17, 5:4-13.)
In
Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1334-1335, review
granted July 19, 2023, S279969, the Court of Appeal expressly disagreed with
and declined to follow Felisilda, concluding that equitable estoppel did
not apply since the plaintiffs’ claims were based on the manufacturer
defendant’s statutory obligations, and not the underlying sale contracts. 
Thereafter, in Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958,
961, review granted September 20, 2023, S281237,¿ the Court of Appeal also
disagreed with Felisilda and concluded that the nonsignatory defendant
could not enforce the arbitration provision in the underlying sales contract
because the plaintiffs’ claims were founded on the manufacturer’s express
warranty, and not any obligation imposed by the underlying sales contract.¿
Similarly, in Kieler v. Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94
Cal.App.5th 614, 616, 621, review granted October 25, 2023, S281937, the Court
of Appeal joined the other decisions disagreeing with Felisilda, again
concluding that equitable estoppel was inapplicable.¿¿¿  
The court
finds that these cases show that there has been a material change in the law
because the weight of authority now disagrees with the reasoning set forth in Felisilda
and supports Plaintiff’s position that Defendants cannot compel Plaintiff to
arbitrate pursuant to the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  The court also finds that other factors,
including the importance of this change of law and Plaintiff’s promptness in
filing this motion on May 24, 2023, support reconsideration.  (Farmers Ins. Exchange, supra,
218 Cal.App.4th at p. 107.)  
The court
therefore exercises its discretion to grant Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1008, subd. (c).) 
Fourth, the
court orders that its October 24, 2022 order granting Defendants’ motion to
compel arbitration is vacated. 
The court
finds that the authorities rejecting Felisilda are better
reasoned and elects to follow the reasoning set forth therein.¿ (Auto Equity
Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450,
456 [when appellate decisions are in conflict, “the court exercising inferior
jurisdiction can and must make a choice between the conflicting
decisions”].)  Thus, the court finds that Defendants cannot enforce the
underlying arbitration agreement, as set forth in the “Retail Installment Sale
Contract – Simple Finance Charge (With Arbitration Provision)” entered into by
and between Plaintiff and nonparty Antelope Valley Mazda, pursuant to the
doctrine of equitable estoppel.  (Keithly
Decl., Ex. A, Retail Installment Sale Contract; Def. Mot. to Compel
Arbitration, pp. 12:21-16:2; Ford Motor Warranty Cases, supra, 89
Cal.App.5th at pp. 1334-1335, rev. granted [language regarding third party
nonsignatories is merely a “delineation of the subject matter of claims
the purchasers and dealers agreed to arbitrate”].)  
The
court therefore finds that Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration should be
denied. 
ORDER

Dothard’s motion for reconsideration.

24, 2022 order granting defendants Ford Motor Company and Santa Monica Ford
Lincoln’s motion to compel arbitration is vacated. 
            The court issues a new order denying
defendants Ford Motor Company and Santa Monica Ford Lincoln’s motion to compel
arbitration. 
            The court orders that the stay of this
action issued as part of the court’s October 24, 2022 order is lifted.
