The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena. The case involves a motor vehicle accident and plaintiff Jamil Johnson Hardwick is seeking damages from defendant Helia Zandipour. The defendant served a deposition subpoena to Beverly Hills Orthopedic Institute (BHOI) and GAD Auto Body, but they did not appear.
