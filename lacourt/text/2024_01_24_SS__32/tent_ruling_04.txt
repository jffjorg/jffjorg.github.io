Motion
  to Compel Compliance with Deposition Subpoena

None
  



 
BACKGROUND
 
On March 3, 2022, Plaintiff Jamil Johnson
Hardwick (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Helia Zandipour
(“Defendant”) for negligence involving a motor vehicle accident.  
 
Defendant now moves to compel a deposition
subpoena to a non-party: “PMK of Billing for Dr. Bal Rajagopalan of Beverly
Hills Orthopedic Institute” (“BHOI”). The subpoena set the deposition for
October 2, 2023. 
 
On October 30, 2023, Defendant
filed this motion to compel compliance with the subpoena. Defendant seeks
monetary sanctions. The proof of service shows that Beverly Hills Orthopedic
Institute was given personal notice of this motion. No opposition has been
filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A party seeking discovery from a person who is not a party
to the action may obtain discovery by oral deposition, written deposition, or
deposition subpoena for production of business records.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2020.010.)¿ A deposition subpoena may command either: (1) only the attendance
and testimony of the deponent, (2) only the production of business records for
copying, or (3) the attendance and testimony of the deponent, as well as the
production of business records, other documents, electronically stored
information, and tangible things.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.020.)¿  
 
A service of a deposition subpoena shall be affected a
sufficient time in advance of the deposition to provide the deponent a
reasonable opportunity to locate and produce any designated documents and,
where personal attendance is commanded, a reasonable time to travel to the
place of deposition.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.220, subd. (a).)¿ “Any person
may serve the subpoena by personal delivery of a copy of it as follows: . . . If
the deponent is an organization, to any officer, director, custodian of records,
or to any agent or employee authorized by the organization to accept service of
a subpoena.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2020.220(b)(2).) 
 
Personal service of any deposition subpoena is effective to
require a deponent who is a resident of California to: personally appear and
testify, if the subpoena so specifies; to produce any specified documents; and
to appear at a court session if the subpoena so specifies.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2020.220, subd. (c).)¿ 
 
A deponent who disobeys a deposition subpoena may be
punished for contempt without the necessity of a prior order of the court
directing compliance by the witness.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.240.)¿A motion
to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena must be made within 60 days
after completion of the deposition record, the date objections are served, or
the date specified for production, and be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.480, subd., (b); Board of Registered
Nursing v. Sup.Ct. (Johnson & Johnson) (2021) 59 CA5th 1011,
1032-1033.) 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1,
subdivision (a) states, “[i]f a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness
or the production of books, documents, or other things before a court, or at
the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court,
upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon
the court’s own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be
heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing
compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare,
including protective orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as
may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive
demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the
person.” 
  
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.2,
subdivision (a) states, in relevant part, “. . . in making an order pursuant to
motion made . . . under Section 1987.1, the court may in its discretion award
the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the
motion, including reasonable attorney’s fees, if the court finds the motion was
made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification . . . .” 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
            Defendant’s counsel declares that
after the October 2, 2023 non-appearance, she wrote a letter to BHOI’s office,
by email and mail, asking it to provide alternative deposition dates, or else a
motion to compel would be filed. (Zinn Decl. ¶ 15, Exh. L.) No response was
received. Therefore, it appears Defendant made a good faith effort to resolve
the issue. (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.480, subd.,
(b).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, this motion
is timely because it was filed on October 30, 2023, within 60 days after the
completion of the deposition record on October 3, 2023. (Zinn Decl., Exh. K.) 
 
Here, Defendant argues that BHOI
failed to present a PMK on October 2, 2023, in violation of a properly served
subpoena. (Id., Exh. G, H.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff is claiming $47,289
of treatment from Dr. Bal Rajagopalan at BHOI. (Id. ¶ 3, Exh. A.) Defendant
asserts that BHOI failed to appear because it maintains that Coronis Health
handled all of BHOI’s billing. However, after consulting Coronis Health,
Defendant asserts that it is no longer contracted with BHOI, and thereafter
returned all billing records to BHOI. (Id. ¶ 9, Exh. F.) 
 
Defendant has not been
communicating with counsel for BHOI. (See Exh. J [email exchange between
Defendant’s counsel and generic email for BHOI].) However, it appears the
subpoena and notice of motion was personally served on the business. 
 
Therefore, because BHOI was served
a deposition subpoena and did not appear, the motion to compel compliance is
granted. There is no indication of bad faith on BHOI’s part since it asserted
that Coronis Health contained the files. Therefore, the Court declines to award
sanctions. 
 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to compel compliance with the
deposition subpoena.
 
            Defendant shall give notice of the
Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.

California Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1,
subdivision (a) states, “[i]f a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness
or the production of books, documents, or other things before a court, or at
the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court,

MEET
AND CONFER
 
            Defendant’s counsel declares that
after the September 28, 2023 non-appearance, he wrote a letter to GAD Auto Body’s
office, by email and mail, asking it to provide alternative deposition dates,
or else a motion to compel would be filed. (Mendoza Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. I.) No
response was received. However, no effort was made to call the deponent. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, this motion
is timely because it was filed on October 30, 2023, within 60 days after the
completion of the deposition record on October 4, 2023. (Medoza Decl., Exh. H.)

 
Here, Defendant argues that GAD
Auto Body failed to present a PMK on September 28, 2023,
in violation of a properly served subpoena. (Id., Exh. D, E.) Defendant argues
that Plaintiff claims $7,254.96 in property damage to his vehicle. Defendant
seeks to depose a PMK of GAD to evaluate the property damage claim and
determine whether the accident caused sufficient force to cause Plaintiff’s
injuries. (Motion, 6.) 
 
Therefore, because GAD was served a
deposition subpoena and did not appear, the motion to compel compliance is
granted. 
 
The Court finds sanctions are
warranted, however the amount is excessive given the type of motion at issue
and the lack of opposition. Accordingly, the Court awards sanctions in the
amount of $240 (one hour of attorney time plus the filing fee).
 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to compel compliance with the
deposition subpoena. The Person Most Knowledgeable of GAD Auto Body shall
appear for deposition within 30 days.
 
GAD Auto Body shall pay $240 in monetary sanctions to counsel for
Defendant within 30 days.
 
            Defendant shall give notice of the
Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
