And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena served on non-party Hitzke & Ferran LLP. The motion is untimely because it was filed on December 28, 2023, after the 60-day deadline for filing a motion to compel compliance. The court finds that the defendant made a good faith effort to resolve the issue through meet and confer efforts, but the motion is still denied on procedural grounds. Defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
