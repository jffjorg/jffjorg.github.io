  - "It is an abuse of discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where the opposing party was not misled or prejudiced by the amendment."

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint to substitute Phillip Tirman, MD for Vanessa Jung Tirman, the personal representative of Decedent's estate. The Court finds that the amendment is ministerial and only seeks to reflect a Probate Court ruling that allowed Phillip Tirman to continue the litigation in his wife's place. Although Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that adding Phillip Tirman to the complaint would not be in the furtherance of justice, the Court finds that there is sufficient time before trial to avoid prejudice to Defendant and that the amendment is necessary to reflect the Probate Court's ruling.
