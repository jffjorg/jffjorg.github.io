And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Bank of America, N.A., has filed an unopposed motion to refer the matter to a referee to determine all disputes between the parties regarding the loan agreement, equipment agreement, guaranties, and related documents. The defendants, Performance Engineered Products, Inc., Dinesh V. Savalia, and Babulal A. Savalia, have not opposed the motion. The court grants the motion and appoints Hon. Chris R. Conway (Ret.) as the referee for all purposes. The parties will privately compensate the referee, splitting his fees equally at the outset, with the prevailing party to be awarded the balance. The referee will try all issues in the action and prepare a statement of decision, which will stand as the decision of the court.
