And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to transfer the venue from Los Angeles County to Orange County. The defendants argued that Orange County is the proper venue because the unlawful practices alleged in the complaint occurred at least in part in Orange County, and because Defendant Joseph Rupp resides in Orange County. However, the Judge found that the defendants failed to meet their burden of negating Los Angeles County as a proper venue. The Judge noted that Plaintiff Ronda Cruz worked in Los Angeles County and would have continued working there but for her termination. The Judge also found that the convenience of non-party witnesses is not a relevant factor in a change of venue motion. Therefore, the Judge denied the defendants' motion and declined to award them attorney's fees and costs.
