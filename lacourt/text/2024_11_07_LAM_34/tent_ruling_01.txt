or after judgment or final determination, as follows: 1. Upon the consent of
both client and attorney, filed with the clerk, or entered upon the minutes; 2.
Upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney,
after notice from one to the other.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 284.)
 
An
attorney moving to be relieved as counsel under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 284(2) must meet the requirements set out in California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362. 
 
To
comply with rule 3.1362, the moving party must submit the following forms: (1)
Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; (2) Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; and (3) Order Granting
Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule

The

Further, when the client is served by mail, the attorney's declaration must
show that the client's address was confirmed within the last 30 days and how it
was confirmed. (Ibid.)  
 
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should
be granted.  (People v. Prince

Discussion
 
Counsel
Patricia Rodriguez’ (“Counsel”) seeks to be relieved from representing Petschauer
on the Cross-Complaint. The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel complies with all
of the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, in that Counsel
provided notice of motion and motion to be relieved as counsel; proposed order
granting attorney’s motion to be relieved as counsel; and declaration in
support of the motion to be relieved as counsel. 
 
            The declaration states that Counsel and Petschauer have
encountered a conflict of interest. (MC-052, ¶ 2.) Counsel attempted to resolve
the conflict with Petschauer but has been unable to do so and must now withdraw
as attorney of record for Petschauer. (Ibid.)
 
            The court determines that the requirements of Rules of
Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated above have been sufficiently met and will grant
the requested withdrawal.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Dawn M. Petschauer’s Counsel Patricia Rodriguez’ Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel is GRANTED.
