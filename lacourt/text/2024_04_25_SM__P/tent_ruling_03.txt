Plaintiff’s
Motion for Leave to Amend the FAC
On February
7, 2024 the County, Silverman, Mokayef, Cotter, Martindale and Gascon
(collectively, “County Defendants”) filed a demurrer to the FAC. As of April
23, 2024, no opposition has been filed. Tenser filed a motion for leave to
amend and file a Second Amended Complaint, which is set to be heard on the same
day as this motion, on April 25, 2024.
Request
for Judicial Notice
The County
Defendants request judicial notice of the fact that Los Angeles County District
Attorney George Gascón took office on December 7, 2020, and of several filings
and court orders in the matters of Tenser v. Ryan, et al., United States
District Court, Central District of California (Case Number CV 19-05496 VBF)
and Tenser v. Ryan, et al., Los Angeles County Superior Court (Case
Number 20SMCV01690). The latter was dismissed, and the dismissal was affirmed
on January 17, 2024, by the Court of Appeal.
“Judicial
notice may be taken of . . . [r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2)
any court of record of the United Sates or of any state of the United States”
and of “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and
are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of
reasonably indisputable accuracy.”  (Evid.
Code § 452, subd. (d) and (h).)  Section
452 provides a proper basis for judicial notice of the documents in the County
Defendants’ request.  
Upon taking
notice of court records, the court accepts as true only that (1) they were
filed and (2) the assertions therein were made; the court does not take notice
of the truth of their contents.  (See Joslin
v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374-375; see also Day
v. Sharp (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 916.)
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law.  Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
Shea Homes Limited Partnership v. County of Alameda (2003) 110
Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254. A demurrer will be sustained without leave to amend if
there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.  Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.
“Suits for money
or damages filed against a public entity are regulated by . . . the Government
Claims Act.” DiCampli-Mintz v. County of Santa Clara (2012) 55 Cal.4th
983, 989. Under the Act, “[b]efore suing a public entity, the plaintiff must
present a timely written claim for damages to the entity.”  Shirk v. Vista Unified Sch. Dist.
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 201, 208; see also Gov’t. Code §945.4 (“no suit for money or
damages may be brought against a public . . . until a written claim therefor
has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon by the board,
or has been deemed to have been rejected . . . .”). “[F]ailure to timely
present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars a plaintiff from
filing a lawsuit against that entity.”  State
of California v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239.
 
A plaintiff is
required to present his claim to the public entity no later than one year after
accrual of the cause of action. Gov. Code §911.2(a). Plaintiff must generally
file suit within six months after the rejection. Gov. Code §945.6. “[A]
plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim
presentation requirement.  Otherwise, his
complaint is subject to a general demurrer for failure to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.”  Bodde, supra at 1243.
 
Tenser’s
allegations against the County Defendants arise from conduct that occurred in July
2018. See FAC ¶¶ 24–35, 49–60, 86-90. Government Code section 911.2 requires a
claim to be presented “not later than one year after the accrual of the cause
of action.” Gov. Code §911.2(a).  If
claimant misses the deadline, he may apply to the County to file a late claim. Gov.
Code §911.4(a). That application must be made within “a reasonable time not to
exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of action.” Gov. Code §911.4(b).  
 
Tenser alleges he
complied with Gov. Code §§911.2 and 945.4 by mailing, on August 28, 2023, the
County’s form claim notice to the County Board of Directors (the “Claim
Notice”). FAC ¶ 87. The claim was deemed rejected on October 13, 2023 because
the County failed to take action. FAC ¶ 88. Tenser filed this action December
26, 2023.  
 
Pursuant to Gov.
Code §§911.2 and 911.4, Tenser’s one-year deadline to file a claim or apply for
leave to file a late claim ran in July 2019. Tenser makes no showing that he
filed any
government claim
or application to file a late claim by that deadline. To the contrary, the FAC
shows Tenser missed that deadline by over four years.  
 
Tenser appears to
claim his claim accrued when he discovered Townsend’s podcast episode on the
Leibel trial on August 25, 2023. FAC ¶ 87. However, this allegation only
supports Tenser’s claim against Townsend, not County Defendants. The FAC alleges
the podcast is slanderous because it “repeats” Silverman and Mokayef’s
slanderous statement. FAC ¶ 20. Tenser does not allege he discovered the
alleged slanderous statement through the podcast. This is because Tenser was
made aware of the slanderous statement the moment it was uttered by Silverman
and Mokayef, because Plaintiff was present at the scene and within earshot when
Silverman and Mokayef called him a stalker. 
FAC ¶ 25.
 
Tenser files no opposition, so provides no counter to
the County Defendants’ arguments. Per Gov. Code section 950.2, the claims
against the individual defendants are similarly barred by the Government Claims
Act. SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
 
Plaintiff
attorney Tenser represented Blake Leibel in a highly publicized murder trial. Plaintiff
alleges defendant Townsend published a defamatory podcast episode that
described plaintiff as a stalker. 
Motion
to Strike: The first
amended complaint alleges defamation, invasion of privacy and fraud against
Townsend. On March 4, 2024, Townsend filed a special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP)
which is set for hearing on June 6, 2024. On March 11, plaintiff filed the
instant motion “to strike” Townsend’s motion to strike. Townsend filed her
opposition on April 3, 2024. As of April 16, 2024, no reply has been filed. 
Plaintiff
purports to make this motion to strike Townsend’s motion to strike pursuant to
CCP §436. Plaintiff described section 436 to “authorize the striking of a
pleading due to improprieties in conformity the laws of this state.” Motion,
10:15-16. CCP § 435(a)(2) defines “pleading” to mean “a demurrer, answer,
complaint, or cross-complaint.” Townsend’s motion is none of those. DENIED.
Motion
for Leave to Amend:
The FAC (1) defamation, (2) invasion of privacy against Townsend, (3) fraud
against Townsend, and (4) public entity liability against the County of Los
Angeles. The first cause of action contains five counts: (a) slander per se
against Silverman and Mokayef, (b) libel against Ryan, (c) conspiracy to
qualify defamation against Silverman, Mokayef, Cotter, Martindale and Ryan, (d)
District Attorney’s ratification against DA Gascon, and (e) slander per se
against Townsend.
Silverman
and Mokayef are/were LA County Deputy District Attorneys. Cotter and Martindale
are/were Los Angeles Sheriff Department homicide detectives. Ryan was a
prosecution witness in the trial. 
On February
7, 2024, the County, Silverman, Mokayef, Cotter, Martindale and Gascon filed a
demurrer to the FAC. On February 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proposed second
amended complaint (“SAC”). On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion
for leave to amend the FAC. 
The proposed
SAC would remove the invasion of privacy and fraud causes of action against
Townsend. The remaining claims would be consolidated into a single cause of
action for defamation, with the following proposed counts: (a) slander per se
against Townsend, (b) slander per se against Silverman and Mokayef, (c) libel
against Ryan, (d) conspiracy to qualify defamation against Silverman, Mokayef,
Cotter, Martindale and Ryan, (e) public entity liability against the County of
Los Angeles and Gascon, and (f) Government Claims Act waiver against the County
and Gascon. The count of slander per se against Townsend would be supported by
new allegations that Townsend violated Canada’s Personal Information Protection
and Electronic Documents Act.
Amendment
as of right
Plaintiff
moves for leave to amend based on an incorrect reading of CCP §472 that
guarantees a right to amend any pleading before the deadline to oppose a
demurrer. Section 472(a) provides “a party may amend its pleading once
without leave of the court at any time . . . after a demurrer or motion to
strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the
amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike.” CCP § 472(a) (emphasis added).
A plaintiff’s right to amend without a Court order is limited to the original
pleading. Plaintiff had the right to file an FAC as of right, and he did so.
Leave to amend is required for subsequent amendments. He did not seek leave
prior to filing the SAC.
Prejudice
to defendants
Plaintiff
moves for leave to amend on the ground that the proposed changes do not
prejudice defendants, arguing the SAC “effects no change in the nature of the
case” and “merely provides the addition of matters essential to make the
original cause of action complete.” Motion, 6:11-14. 
Leave to
amend is generally liberally granted, as judicial policy favors resolution of
all disputed matters between the parties. See
Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 402, 412. Townsend agreed to
stipulate to the amendment (Tenser Decl., ¶ 2) and filed notice of
non-opposition.
Plaintiff
contends the remaining proposed changes were made in response to the demurrer
filed by County defendants, so there is good cause to grant the amendment.
County defendants argue the proposed SAC only addresses one of the seven
grounds raised in the demurrer.
Plaintiff’s
motion does not meet the procedural requirements of Cal. Rules of Court rule
3.1324. A motion to amend a pleading before trial must (1) state what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are located;
(2) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading,
if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional
allegations are located. CRC 3.1324(a). A separate supporting declaration
specifying (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary
and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) the reason why the request for amendment was not made
earlier must accompany the motion. CRC 3.1324(b).
The
redline attached to the reply shows the FAC and SAC are substantially
different. In County defendants’ words, the SAC includes “numerous other
additions, rearrangements, and deletions, with no explanation and therefore
without any showing of how justice could possibly be served by them.” Opp.
4:3-6. Nowhere does plaintiff state by page, paragraph and line number the
deletions and additions. DENIED
without prejudice. Alternatively, the court will consider granting the motion
if plaintiff complies with CRC 3.1324.
