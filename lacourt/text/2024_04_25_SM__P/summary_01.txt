And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to stay the discovery process pending the resolution of the defendant's criminal appeal. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, seeks to stay the discovery process due to the parallel criminal proceeding against the defendant, Weinstein. The court has broad discretion to stay cases in the interest of efficiency and justice. The judge considered the factors outlined in Avant! Corp. v. Superior Court, including the interest of the plaintiff in proceeding expeditiously with the litigation, the burden on the defendant, the convenience of the court, and the interest of the public in the pending civil and criminal litigation. The court found that the plaintiff has met her burden and granted the stay.
