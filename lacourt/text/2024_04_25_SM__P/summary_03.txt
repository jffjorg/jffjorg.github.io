And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tenser v. Ryan, et al. The court has sustained the demurrer filed by the County Defendants and denied the plaintiff's motion to strike Townsend's anti-SLAPP motion. The court has also denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the First Amended Complaint (FAC) without prejudice. The plaintiff's FAC alleges defamation, invasion of privacy, and fraud against Townsend, and public entity liability against the County of Los Angeles. The court has determined that the plaintiff's government claim was timely presented to the County, but the court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend because the plaintiff failed to show that the alleged slanderous statement was made after July 2018. The court has also denied the motion for leave to amend the FAC because the plaintiff failed to comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court rule 3.1324.
