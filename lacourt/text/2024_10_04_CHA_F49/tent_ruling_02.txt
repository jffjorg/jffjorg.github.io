BACKGROUND
 
On December 15, 2023, Plaintiff
Fifth Third Bank, National Association (“Plaintiff” or “Fifth Third Bank”)
filed a Complaint against Defendant/Cross-Complainant Aminah Ssenyondo (“Defendant/Cross-Complainant”
or “Ssenyondo”), and Does 1 through 15, alleging breach of contract. Plaintiff claims
that Ssenyondo failed to repay the monies loaned for financing of a motor
vehicle sale. (Compl. PLD-C-001(1) “BC-2”) Subsequently, Ssenyondo filed an
Answer to the Complaint on January 29, 2024.
 
On
June 10, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ssenyondo filed a Cross-Complaint
against Cross-Defendant Garlyn O. Shelton Inc. d/b/a
BMW of Temple (“Cross-Defendant” or “BMW of Temple”), and Does 1 to 50,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) Partial Indemnity and
Apportionment of Fault, and (2) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On July 24, 2024, BMW of Temple
filed the instant Motion to Quash Service of Summons for Lack of Personal
Jurisdiction (the “Motion”) 
 
No Opposition or Reply papers have
been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 418.10, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part, “A
defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the
following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack
of jurisdiction of the court over him or her....”
 
A.   
Service of Process on Cross-Defendant
 
“In an action against a
corporation or an unincorporated association (including a partnership), the
copy of the summons that is served shall contain a notice stating in substance:
‘To the person served:¿ You
are hereby served in the within action (or special proceeding) on behalf of
(here state the name of the corporation or the unincorporated association) as a
person upon whom a copy of the summons and of the complaint may be delivered to
effect service on said party under the provisions of (here state appropriate
provisions of Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10) of the Code of Civil
Procedure).’ If service is also made on such person as an individual, the
notice shall also indicate that service is being made on such person as an
individual as well as on behalf of the corporation or the unincorporated
association.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 412.30.)
 
“A summons may be served on a
corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and the complaint by any of the
following methods: (a) To the person designated as agent for service of
process ... (b) To the president, chief executive officer, or other head
of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a
treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief financial officer, a
general manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to receive service
of process. (c) [inapplicable] (d) If authorized by any provision in
Section 1701, 1702, 2110, or 2111 of the Corporations Code[.]” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 416.10.)    
 
“[C]ompliance
with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish
personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)  “[T]he filing of a proof of service
creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper” but only if it
“complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.”  (Id.
at pp. 1441-1442.)  When a defendant moves to quash service of the summons
and complaint, the plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give
the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective
service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866,
868.)  “A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been
proper service of process.”  (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 808.) 
 
Here, BMW of Temple argues that the Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s
Summons was improper and invalid because it failed to provide the required
notice regarding the corporation and was not served on its registered agent or
a person authorized to accept service of process. (Mot. at p. 5.)
 
BMW of Temple’s counsel, Manuel Saldana (“Saldana”),
presents a true and correct copy of the Summons and Cross-Complaint filed by Ssenyondo on June 10, 2024, pointing out that the Summons is blank
with regard to the person being served and in what capacity. (Saldana Decl. ¶
3.) Additionally, BMW of Temple’s Chief Financial Officer, Tanya Holekamp
(“Holekamp”), attests that BMW is an S-Corporation incorporated in Texas, and
its registered agent for service of process is Garlyn O. Shelton located at its
principal place of business at 5625 S. General Bruce Dr. Temple, TX 76502.
(Holekamp Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.) However, the Summons and Cross-Complaint were
delivered to BMW of Temple’s business address at 6006 S. General Bruce Dr.
Temple, TX 76502, without including the name of an individual authorized to
accept service of process on behalf of BMW of Temple. (Id. ¶ 7.)
 
Based on the above evidence, the Court finds Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s
service of Summons and Cross-Complaint did not comply with the requirements
outlined in Code of Civil Procedure sections 412.30 and 416.10, subdivision
(a).
 
When a defendant
moves to quash service of the summons and complaint, the plaintiff has “the
burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that is the
facts requisite to an effective service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper,
supra, 245 Cal.App.2d at p. 868.)
 
Here, Defendant/Cross-Complainant
has failed to file an Opposition, thereby waiving the issues raised in the
Motion and failing to meet his burden of proving the facts requisite to an
effect service. 
 
B.    
The Court’s Personal Jurisdiction over
Cross-Defendant
 
The extent to which a California court can exercise
personal jurisdiction over a defendant depends on the nature and quality of
defendant’s “contacts” with the state.¿ U.S. Supreme Court decisions recognize
two types of jurisdiction: (1) “general” and (2) “specific.” (See¿Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Sup.Ct.
of Calif., San Francisco County¿(2017) 582
U.S. 255, 262¿(Bristol-Myers);¿Ford Motor Co. v.¿Montana Eighth
Judicial Dist. Ct.¿(2021) 141
S.Ct. 1017, 1024.)¿ 
 
General jurisdiction requires¿“substantial . . . continuous
and¿systematic” contacts¿with California, i.e., the defendant’s contacts with
the forum are so wide-ranging that they take the place of a physical
presence¿in the state.  (Vons Companies Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996)
16 Cal.4th 434, 452.)  Specific jurisdiction exists where contacts are
insufficient for¿general jurisdiction, but the contact is related to the cause
of action presented. (Epic Communications, Inc. v. Richwave
Technology, Inc.¿(2009) 179
Cal.App.4th 314, 327.)
 
Although the defendant¿is the moving party on a motion to
quash service of process, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in opposing
the motion: “[W]hen jurisdiction is challenged by a nonresident defendant, the
burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that ‘minimum contacts’
exist between defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal
jurisdiction.” (Mihlon v. Sup.Ct. (Mihlon)¿(1985) 169
Cal.App.3d 703, 710;¿Floveyor Int'l, Ltd. v. Sup.Ct. (Shick Tube-Veyor Corp.)¿(1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 789, 793;¿Elkman v. National States Ins. Co.¿(2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 1305, 1313.) 
The burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of the
evidence that all jurisdictional criteria are met. (Ziller Electronics Lab GmbH v.
Sup.Ct. (Grosh Scenic Studios)¿(1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232.)  If
plaintiff meets this burden, “it becomes the defendant’s burden to demonstrate
that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.” (Buchanan v. Soto¿(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1362;¿Swenberg v. Dmarcian, Inc.¿(2021) 68
Cal.App.5th 280, 291.)
 
Jurisdictional facts must be proved by admissible evidence.
This generally requires documentary evidence and declarations by competent
witnesses. (Rivelli v. Hemm¿(2021) 67 Cal.App.5th 380, 402;¿In re Automobile Antitrust Cases I
& II¿(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 100, 110.) 
 
Here, there is no general jurisdiction over BMW of Temple in
California. This is because Cross-Defendant is incorporated and has its
principal place of business in Texas. It has no corporate operations within the
State of California. BMW of Temple has not performed any service on or provided
any parts for the vehicle since it was delivered on or about April 28, 2021.
((Holekamp Decl. ¶ 6.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that there is no evidence supporting any
physical presence of Cross-Defendant in the forum. Nor has Ssenyondo presented any evidence to establish BMW of Temple’s substantial,
continuous, and systematic contacts with California. Therefore, the Court
concludes that there is no general jurisdiction over BMW of Temple.
 
Here, BMW of Temple also argues that the Court lacks specific
jurisdiction over it. First, Cross-Defendant has not purposefully availed
itself of the benefits of California. The only connection with California is
the existence of a vehicle in California that was sold and delivered by it in
Texas. Second, the alleged action in the Cross-Complaint does not arise out of
or related to BMW of Temple’s conduct. The Cross-Complaint arises out of the
purchase, sale and delivery of vehicle by Cross-Defendant to the Cross-Complaint
in Texas. The contract for the sale of the vehicle was entered into in Texas
pursuant to the laws of Texas. (Holekamp Decl. ¶ 5.)
 
The Court finds that there is no evidence supporting that BMW of
Temple purposefully availed itself of forum benefits, and the controversy is
neither related to nor arise out of Cross-Defendant’s contacts, if any, with
the forum. Therefore, the Court determines that it lacks specific jurisdiction
over Cross-Defendant. 
 
Furthermore, Defendant/Cross-Complainant has not met his
burden by failing to file an Opposition or present any evidence. (See e.g., Mihlon, surpa,¿169 Cal.App.3d at p. 710, [When jurisdiction is challenged by a nonresident
defendant, the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that
‘minimum contacts’ exist between defendant and the forum state to justify
imposition of personal jurisdiction.])
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Special appearing Cross-Defendant Garlyn O. Shelton Inc.
d/b/a BMW of Temple’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons for Lack of Personal
Jurisdiction is GRANTED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
