BACKGROUND
 
On August 17, 2023, Plaintiff Florence Bistline (“Plaintiff”
or “Bistline”) filed the Complaint against Defendants Kaiser Foundation
Hospitals d/b/a Kaiser Foundation Hospital – Santa Clarita, Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan, Inc., (collectively, “Defendants”) and Does 1 to 250, alleging a
single cause of action for wrongful death due to medical negligence.
Subsequently, Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint on October 31,
2023.
 
On August 17, 2024, Counsel filed the instant Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”).
 
            No Opposition papers have been
received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, “The attorney in an action or special proceeding may be
changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination, as
follows: 1. Upon the consent of both client and attorney, filed with the clerk,
or entered upon the minutes; 2. Upon the order of the court, upon the
application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other. 
Here, Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and
MC-052. Additionally, Counsel has lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the
Court.
 
The MC-051 form states, in pertinent part, that “Joseph
Farzam Law Firm; Joseph S. Farzam moves under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 284(2) and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, for an
order permitting the attorney to be relieved as attorney of record in this
action or proceedings.” (MC-051 ¶ 1.) (Underlines added.)
 
The MC-052 form also indicates that “Reason for Motion.
Attorney makes this motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284(2) instead of filing a consent under section 284(1)
...” (MC-052 ¶ 2.) (Underlines added.)
 
The proposed order form, MC-053, also states that “Attorney
has shown sufficient reasons why the motion to be relieved as counsel should be
granted and why the attorney has brought a motion under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284(2) instead of a consent under section 284(1).”
(MC-053 ¶ 4.) (Underlines added.)
 
However, Counsel declares that the reason for the motion is
“Both client and counsel agree on the withdrawal.” (MC-052 ¶ 2.) This reason
necessitates a filing based on consent under Civil Procedure section 284(1).
Consequently, it is evident that Counsel has submitted the incorrect forms
which are inapplicable for the stated reason for the withdrawal.
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
Court DENIES the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Plaintiff Florence Bistline’s counsel Joseph S. Farzam of Joseph
Farzam Law Firm.
 
Moving
counsel to give notice.
