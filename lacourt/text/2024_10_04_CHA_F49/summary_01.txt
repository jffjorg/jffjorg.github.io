And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Plaintiff Florence Bistline's counsel, Joseph S. Farzam, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on August 17, 2024, stating that both the client and counsel agree on the withdrawal. However, the court found that the forms submitted by counsel were incorrect and did not follow the proper procedure for a consent-based withdrawal under California Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1). The court notes that the reason for the motion is based on consent, which requires a filing based on section 284(1), rather than a motion under section 284(2). As a result, the court denied the motion.
