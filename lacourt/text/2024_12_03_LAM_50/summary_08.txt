Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court notes that the Plaintiff's Complaint does not mention "disgorgement" despite referencing it on the caption page. The Plaintiff has filed a motion to reconsider and a statement of disqualification, and is also requesting a statement of decision to exercise her right to appeal if necessary. The Court is considering the disqualification motion and notes that the determination of disqualification is not appealable, but rather can only be reviewed by a writ of mandate from the appropriate court of appeal. The Court also references a prior case, Gilberd v. AC Transit, which discusses the importance of restricting motions to reconsider to circumstances where a party offers new facts or authority. The Court is unclear if the Plaintiff is simply requesting a written order on the instant motion or if she is seeking a statement of decision for appeal purposes.
