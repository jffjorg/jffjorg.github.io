And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the disputes between the parties regarding the merits of the plaintiff's claims. The judge notes that the plaintiff's supplemental brief cites to Pashley v. Pacific Elec. Ry. Co., but that case does not address the equitable estoppel doctrine. The judge also notes that the defendant's supplemental brief cites to certain exhibits that were not provided with the brief. The judge declines to consider the defendant's argument regarding the special verdict form, as it was not requested in the November 7, 2024 minute order. The judge also questions the plaintiff's assertion that Champlin agreed informally to produce documents, as there is no evidence that Champlin ever agreed to the request. As a result, the judge does not need to consider the plaintiff's remaining arguments.
