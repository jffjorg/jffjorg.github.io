[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTIONS TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL (2) 
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION TO VACATE ORDER COMPELLING ARBITRATION BASED ON STATUTORY WAIVER
  PURSUANT TO CAL. CIV. PROC. § 1281.97, AND REQUEST
  FOR SANCTIONS UNDER CAL. CIV. PROC. § 1281.99 IN

Cory J. King of Constangy, Brooks, Smith & Prophete, LLP
(“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel for
Defendants Kent E. Chesley and Radiance Hospice, Inc. (jointly,
“Defendants”). 
In addition, Plaintiff Yvonne Hanson (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order “[v]acating
the July 20, 2023 Order Compelling Arbitration…and for an award of sanctions
against Defendants RADIANCE HOSPICE, INC. and KENT E. CHESLEY (‘Defendants’),
CONSTANGY, BROOKS, SMITH & PROPHETE, LLP, and Defendants’ counsel of
record, Cory J. King, of jointly and severally, in the amount of $13,276.25.” 
The Court notes that on April 26, 2024, a Notice of Stay of
Proceedings was filed in this action. The Notice indicates that this case is
stayed with regard to Defendants due to the filing of a bankruptcy case. The
“Notice of Bankruptcy Case Filing” attached to the April 26, 2024 Notice of
Stay of Proceedings indicates that a “[a] bankruptcy case concerning the
debtor(s) listed below was filed under Chapter 7 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code…” The Court notes that “[t]he
filing of a voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy petition operates as a stay,
applicable to all entities, of…(1) the commencement or continuation…of a
judicial…action or proceeding against the debtor.
The automatic stay is self-executing and is effective upon filing the
bankruptcy petition.” ((Higgins v. Superior Court (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 973, 979 [internal quotations, citations, and
emphasis omitted]); (see 11
U.S.C. § 362, subd. (a)(1).)  
In light of the foregoing, the Court
continues the hearings on Counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel to __________________, at 10:00 a.m. in Dept. 50 for
resetting purposes. 
In addition, the Court continues the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion
to vacate order compelling arbitration to __________________,
at 10:00 a.m. in Dept. 50 for resetting purposes.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this
order.
