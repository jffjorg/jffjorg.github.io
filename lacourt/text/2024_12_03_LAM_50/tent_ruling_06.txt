[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Petitioner The Cemetery and Funeral Bureau, Department of Consumer
Affairs, State of California (“Petitioner”) requests entry of default judgment
against Respondents Lincoln Memorial Park, Inc., and John Michael Mintz.  
The Court notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment
package.
First, Petitioner submitted a
“[Proposed] Judgment in Favor of Petitioner the Cemetery and Funeral Bureau”
providing that “[d]efault having been entered against Respondents
Lincoln Memorial Park, Inc., and John Michael Mintz (‘Respondents’), and the
application of Petitioner The Cemetery and Funeral Bureau for appointment of
The Cemetery and Funeral Bureau as conservator over Respondents’ endowment care
fund and special care fund having been granted, the Court here enters…JUDGMENT
in favor of the Petitioner, The Cemetery and Funeral Bureau, Department of
Consumer Affairs, State of California.” However,
a request for default judgment is before the Court, not the foregoing
application. In addition, the proposed judgment does not specify the specific
relief Petitioner seeks. Rather, the proposed judgment provides that “the
Court here enters…JUDGMENT in favor of the Petitioner, The Cemetery and Funeral
Bureau, Department of Consumer Affairs, State of California.”  
Second, Petitioner submitted
a “[Proposed] Order Granting the First Amended Petition of the Cemetery and
Funeral Bureau and Appointing the Cemetery and Funeral Bureau as Conservator
Over Lincoln Memorial Park Inc.’s Endowment Care Fund and Special Care Fund.”
The proposed order provides, inter alia, that the Court “GRANTS
THE FIRST AMENDED PETITION OF The Cemetery and Funeral Bureau, Department of
Consumer Affairs, State of California.” However, Petitioner’s request for
default judgment is before the Court, not Petitioner’s First Amended Verified
Petition. In addition, the Court notes that a proposed judgment is required to
be submitted in connection with the request for default judgment as opposed to
a proposed order. Pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(6), the request for default judgment must
include “[a] proposed form of judgment.”
Third, the proposed order
provides, inter alia, that the Court “ORDERS THAT The Cemetery
and Funeral Bureau, Department of Consumer Affairs, State of California, is
appointed as Conservator over Lincoln Memorial Park, Inc.’s endowment
care fund and special care fund held by the American Funeral & Cemetery
Trust Service for the maintenance and upkeep of Lincoln Memorial Park, Inc.”
(Emphasis added.) However, this order appears to be inconsistent with the
relief requested in Petitioner’s First Amended Verified Petition. The “Prayer” indicates
that Petitioner seeks “[a]n order
appointing the Cemetery and Funeral Bureau as a conservator over the Endowment
Care Fund and Special Care Fund held by American Funeral & Cemetery Trust
Services for the maintenance and upkeep of Lincoln Memorial Park Cemetery…”
(First Amended Verified Petition, p. 4, emphasis added.) The proposed order
refers to the entity “Lincoln Memorial Park, Inc.,” not Lincoln Memorial Park
Cemetery. The Court notes that that “[a] complaint…shall
contain…the following:…(2) A demand for judgment for the relief to which the
pleader claims to be entitled. If the recovery of money or damages is demanded,
the amount demanded shall be stated.¿” (¿Code Civ.
Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)¿.) ¿Code of Civil
Procedure section 580, subdivision (a)¿ “¿limits a trial court’s
jurisdiction to grant relief on a default judgment to the amount stated in the
complaint.¿” (¿Dhawan v. Biring (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 963, 968¿.)
“[I]n all default judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” ((Finney v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 527, 534.) 
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Petitioner’s request for
default judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Petitioner a
schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
