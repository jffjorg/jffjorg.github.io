[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to expunge notice of pendency of
  action  



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
            Plaintiffs Michelle Hu (“Hu”), Los
Angeles City Plaza, LP (“LACP”), and LA Valley Garden Plaza LP (“LAVGP”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) allege that they are the current or prior owners of the
properties located at 1598 Long Beach Boulevard, Long Beach, CA 90813 (“Long
Beach Property”), 9933 Valley Boulevard, El Monte, California 91731 (“El Monte
Property”), and 1125 S. 1st Avenue, Arcadia, California 91006
(“Arcadia Property”).  Plaintiffs allege
that the Arcadia Property is Hu’s principal residence.  
Plaintiffs allege that on November 11,
2021, Plaintiffs and Defendant The Evergreen Advantage, LLC (“Evergreen”)
entered into a secured mortgage transaction (construction loan) for
$17,500,000, which carried a 9% per annum interest rate and contained a
maturity date of December 1, 2022, secured by the 3 properties.  Plaintiffs allege that Evergreen is the
lender under the Promissory Note Secured by Deed of Trust dated November 11,
2021 (“Note”), secured by the certain Deed of Trust, Assignment of Rents, Security
Agreement and Fixture Filing dated November 11, 2021 and recorded on November
29, 2021; and that Evergreen is the beneficiary under the DOT.  On November 8, 2022, Plaintiffs and Evergreen
entered into a Modification and Extension Agreement (“Extension Agreement”),
which had a principal balance of $11,080,000, 10.5% per annum interest rate,
required interest payments of $96,950 per month beginning January 1, 2023, and
extended the maturity date to June 1, 2023. 

Plaintiffs allege they were ultimately unable
to make the payment beginning June 2023. 
On July 3, 2023, Evergreen caused a Notice of Default (“NOD”) to be
recorded against each property, for an estimated default of
$11,359,476.46.  On March 1, 2024,
Evergreen caused a Notice of Trustee’s Sale (“NOTS”) to be recorded for the
properties, pursuant to which it sought $13,949,223.81 (estimated) through the
foreclosure of the properties.  Plaintiffs
allege that Evergreen caused the properties to be sold at foreclosure
sale.  
             The complaint, filed April 24, 2024, alleges
causes of action for: (1) violation of California Usury Law; (2) recovery of
usury interest; (3) declaratory relief; (4) violation of Civil Code, §
2924(c)-(d); and (5) unfair business practices – violation of Business &
Professions Code, § 17200 et seq. 

B.    
Cross-Complaint 
On September 6, 2024, Evergreen filed a
cross-complaint against Hu, LACP, LAVGP, and Zhong Fang for: (1) breach of
contract; (2) fraud – intentional misrepresentation; (3) declaratory relief;
(4) violation of Civil Code, § 1950.5; and (5) breach of contract.  
C.    
Motion on Calendar
On August 7, 2024, Evergreen filed a
motion to expunge the notice of pendency of action and for attorney’s fees in
the amount of $4,135.00.  
On September 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an
opposition brief.
On October 3, 2024, Evergreen filed a
reply brief. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
Under CCP § 405.30, at any time after a
notice of pendency of action has been recorded, any party with an interest in
the real property may apply to the Court to expunge the notice.  A lis pendens may be expunged either under:
(a) CCP § 405.31 if the pleadings do not contain a real property claim or (b)
CCP § 405.32 if the Court finds that the party claiming the lis pendens has not
established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the
real property claim.  Under CCP § 405.30,
the party claiming the lis pendens has the burden of proof under sections
405.31 and 405.32.  
Accordingly, the plaintiff has the burden
of demonstrating that their pleadings contain a real property claim and that
the probable validity of their real property claim can be established by a
preponderance of the evidence. 
"Probable validity" exists when "it is more likely than
not that the claimant will obtain a judgment on the claim."  (CCP § 405.3.) 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            With the motion papers, Evergreen requested judicial notice of Exhibit A:
the license information of Secured Capital Lending, Inc. taken from the records
of the Department of Real Estate.  The
request is granted.  (Evid. Code, §
452(c), (g).)  
            With
the opposition papers, Plaintiffs request judicial notice of Exhibits A to FF,
which include chain of title and property documents.  However, not all of these documents are
recorded documents.  The Court will take
judicial notice of the recorded documents in Exhibits D-EE, which are recorded
documents.  (See Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 256, 264-267, disapproved on
other grounds.)  
            With the reply papers, Evergreen
requests judicial notice of Exhibit A, which includes the declaration of
Evergreen in support of the opposition to the application for temporary
restraining order.  The request is
granted.  
DISCUSSION
            Evergreen moves to
expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action recorded by Hu dba LACP and LAVGP on
May 10, 2024 as Instrument No. 20240311230. 
Evergreen argues that Plaintiffs do not have a viable pending cause of
action affecting title to the real property. 
 
1.     
Real Property Claim
            Pursuant
to CCP § 405.31, a lis pendens may be expunged if the pleadings do not contain
a real property claim.  In making a determination
pursuant to section 405.31, the court must engage in a
demurrer-like analysis.  (Kirkeby
v. Superior Court (2004) 33 Cal.4th 642, 647–648.)  “‘Rather than analyzing whether the pleading states any claim
at all, as on a general demurrer, the court must undertake the more limited
analysis of whether the pleading states a real property claim.’ [Citation.]
Review ‘involves only a review of the adequacy of the pleading and normally should
not involve evidence from either side, other than possibly that which may be
judicially noticed as on a demurrer.’ [Citation.] Therefore, review of an
expungement order under section 405.31 is limited to whether a real
property claim has been properly pled by the claimant. [Citation.]”  (Id. at 648.)  
            Neither
party disputes that the action involves a real property claim.  The parties dispute whether Plaintiffs can
establish their burden regarding the probable validity of their claims. 
2.      Probable Validity of the Claim.
Evergreen argues that Plaintiffs cannot establish the probable validity
of their claims and that this Court has already found that Plaintiffs failed to
establish the probability of success on the merits of their causes of action in
its ruling on the motion for preliminary injunction.  
“The essential elements of
usury are: (1) The transaction must be a loan or forbearance; (2) the interest
to be paid must exceed the statutory maximum; (3) the loan and interest must be
absolutely repayable by the borrower; and (4) the lender must have a willful
intent to enter into a usurious transaction.” 
(Korchemny
v. Piterman
(2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1043.)  “The element
of intent is narrow. ‘[T]he intent sufficient to support the judgment [of
usury] does not require a conscious attempt, with knowledge of the law, to
evade it. The conscious and voluntary taking of more than the legal rate of
interest constitutes usury and the only intent necessary on the part of the
lender is to take the amount of interest which he receives; if that amount is
more than the law allows, the offense is complete.’”  (Id.) 
 
“California Constitution, article XV, section 1 limits
the interest rate for a ‘loan or forbearance’ of money not primarily for
personal, family or household purposes, to the higher of: (1) 10 percent per
annum or (2) 5 percent plus the rate of interest prevailing on the 25th day of
the month preceding the earlier of the date of the extension of the contract to
make the loan or forbearance or the date of making the loan or forbearance,
established by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco on advances to member
banks under sections 13 and 13(1) of the Federal Reserve Act. [Citation.]”  (Id. at 1042.)  Civil Code, § 1916.1 states:
The restrictions upon rates of interest contained in Section 1 of Article
XV of the California Constitution shall not apply to any loan or forbearance
made or arranged by any person licensed as a real estate broker by the State of
California, and secured, directly or collaterally, in whole or in part by liens
on real property. For purposes of this section,
a loan or forbearance is arranged by a person licensed as a real estate broker
when the broker (1) acts for compensation or in expectation of compensation for
soliciting, negotiating, or arranging the loan for another, (2) acts for
compensation or in expectation of compensation for selling, buying, leasing,
exchanging, or negotiating the sale, purchase, lease, or exchange of real
property or a business for another and (A) arranges a loan to pay all or any
portion of the purchase price of, or of an improvement to, that property or
business or (B) arranges a forbearance, extension, or refinancing of any loan
in connection with that sale, purchase, lease, exchange of, or an improvement
to, real property or a business, or (3) arranges or negotiates for another a
forbearance, extension, or refinancing of any loan secured by real property in
connection with a past transaction in which the broker had acted for compensation
or in expectation of compensation for selling, buying, leasing, exchanging, or
negotiating the sale, purchase, lease, or exchange of real property or a
business. The term “made or arranged” includes any loan made
by a person licensed as a real estate broker as a principal or as an agent for
others, and whether or not the person is acting within the course and scope of
such license.
(Civ. Code, §
1916.1.)  “A forbearance is an agreement not
to insist upon payment at the date of maturity of a debt, or the giving of
further time to pay.” (Buck v. Dahlgren (1972) 23
Cal.App.3d 779, 785.)  
            By
way of background, Evergreen argues that on November 11, 2021, Evergreen
originated at $17.5 million loan (“Loan”) in favor of Plaintiffs, which was secured
by a Deed of Trust.  Evergreen argues
that the Loan was arranged by Plaintiffs’ real estate broker, Secured Capital
Lending (“Secured Capital”), which is licensed by the Department of Real estate
and received a commission on the transaction. 
(Evergreen RJN, Ex. A.)  On
November 8, 2022, Plaintiffs and Evergreen entered into a Modification and
Extension Agreement (“Extension Agreement”; Evergreen refers to this document
as the “Forbearance” in its papers), which was jointly arranged by Secured
Capital and The Evergreen Advantage Management, Inc. (“TEAM”).  Evergreen argues that Secured Capital
communicated directly with Hu and received $27,700 in compensation for the
Extension Agreement.  Evergreen argues
that Plaintiffs defaulted on their repayment obligations on the Loan (as
modified by the Extension Agreement), such that the Arcadia Property was
foreclosed upon and title revered back to Evergreen by virtue of a Trustee’s
Deed Upon Sale.  
Evergreen argues
that the Extension Agreement on which each of Plaintiffs’ claims is based is
not subject to the usury restrictions because it falls under the exemption in
Civil Code, § 1916.1.  Evergreen argues
that the Extension Agreement was arranged for Plaintiffs and Evergreen by
Secured Capital, and that Secured Capital dealt directly with Hu such that
usury restrictions do not apply to the Extension Agreement at issue.  (Evergreen RJN Ex. A.)  
In opposition,
Plaintiffs argue that this 24NNCV01213 action (“Hu Action 1”) was based
on limited information and alleged that the Extension Agreement contained a
usurious interest rate.  Plaintiffs argue
that on June 20, 2024, Evergreen filed an unlawful detainer action against Hu
regarding the Arcadia Property (“Evergreen UD Action”).  On August 5, 2024, Plaintiffs initiated a
second action against Evergreen in 24STCV19566 (“Hu Action 2”), which
challenge the foreclosure of the Arcadia Property and includes causes of action
for unjust enrichment, violation of Civil Code, § 2924f, wrongful foreclosure,
and quiet title.  The parties agreed that
Hu Action 1 and Hu Action 2 should be consolidated, and a motion
to consolidate and a motion for preliminary injunction is scheduled to be heard
on October 17, 2024 in Department 40 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in the Hu
Action 2 matter.  
In the opposition
papers, Plaintiffs prematurely rely on arguments that depend on Hu Action 1
being consolidated with Hu Action 2—namely that the interest is usurious
under Hu Action 1 and challenging the foreclosure of the Arcadia
Property and disputing title in Hu Action 2.  The actions have not yet been consolidated
and the motion to consolidate the actions will be heard by Department 40 after
the hearing on this motion to expunge lis pendens.  Thus, at this time, the Court will continue
the hearing on this motion to expunge lis pendens following Department 40’s
October 17, 2024 hearing date.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Defendant The Evergreen Advantage, LLC’s motion to expunge lis pendens is
continued to October 25, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. following the October 17, 2024
hearings scheduled in Department 40 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse regarding
the motion to consolidate and motion for preliminary injunction.  
Defendant shall
provide notice of this order.
