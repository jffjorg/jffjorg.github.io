And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Winnie Luo's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The judge found that there was substantive merit to granting the motion because Luo was not personally served with the summons and complaint, her name is not "Weixian Lo", and she did not reside at the property where service was purportedly made. The judge also noted that the policy of the law strongly favors a hearing on the merits, which supports granting this motion. As a result, the motion is granted, and Defendant Winnie Luo is ordered to electronically file a responsive pleading following the hearing.
