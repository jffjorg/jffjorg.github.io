And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to undergo a neuropsychological examination and assessment is granted. The examination will be conducted by neuropsychologist Philip K. Stenquist on November 19, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. at 9001 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 204, Beverly Hills, CA 90211. The defendants argue that they need to conduct the examination to investigate the plaintiff's injuries and damages, and that the plaintiff has already claimed traumatic brain injury and undergone neuropsychological testing. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the examination is unnecessary and would cause undue burden. The judge finds that the defendants have established good cause to warrant the examination and grants the motion.
