[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motions to compel further responses 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
            Plaintiff Epicurus Gourmet
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that it is in the business of selling gourmet food
products and is located at 12140 Sherman Way, North Hollywood, California
91605.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant
Hillary Hirsch was an employee of Plaintiff from 2016 until March 17, 2023 and
was the secretary of the Board of Directors. 
Defendant Eric Gitter is alleged to have conspired with Hirsch by
directing, encouraging, ratifying, and approving Hirsch’s unlawful
conduct.  
            In January 2016, Kevin Jones (president
and sole shareholder of Plaintiff) formed Plaintiff.  In March 2016, Hirsch began working to start
Plaintiff’s business as a manager and secretary for the Board of Directors,
such that she owed fiduciary duties and had job responsibilities to order
products, keep financial books, pay bills, etc. 
However, she was employed by Jones through his company Liquid Assets
Cellars since Plaintiff did not yet have capital.  At that time, Plaintiff was running its
business from the premises leased by Liquid Assets Cellars located at 12134
Sherman Way.  Plaintiff alleges that as a
part of her duties, Hirsch had access to Plaintiff’s Sales Order System
(“SOS”), a proprietary database with confidential trade secrets, customer
lists, and sales data.  She also had
access to confidential business passwords for bank accounts, QuickBooks
accounting, social media, payroll, and credit card processing.  
            Plaintiff alleges that in December
2016, Jones approached the landlord of Liquid Assets Cellars’ to lease another
unit for Plaintiff and notified Gitter of the terms.  Plaintiff alleges that in January 2017, Jones
entered the lease for the 12140 Sherman Way premises and in May 2017, the
premises was opened by Plaintiff for business. 

            Plaintiff alleges that Jones had
discussed with Gitter about whether Gitter was interested in investing in
Plaintiff, but Gitter never committed to any of Jones’ offered terms and
instead began loaning money to Plaintiff through Gitter’s company Chickie the
Cop Entertaining for repayment, regarding the construction of the
premises.  On February 3, 2018, Gitter
filed his own Articles of Incorporation for Epicurus Gourmet LA, LLC and
thereafter Defendants conspired to convert Plaintiff’s confidential proprietary
information.  Plaintiff alleges that in
August 2018, Hirsch opened a Wells Fargo account in Plaintiff’s name, made
herself the sole signatory, and began depositing all proceeds from Plaintiff
into the account in September 2018. 
Hirsch also allegedly changed all passwords for Plaintiff.  
            Plaintiff alleges that it pays all
local, state, and federal taxes from Jones’ personal funds and that Jones
renegotiated and extended Plaintiff’s lease at the premises.  On March 23, 2023, Hirsch was removed as
secretary and on October 10, 2023 was terminated from employment.  Upon her termination, Plaintiff demanded
Hirsch provide Jones with the passwords and access to the bank account, but
Defendants contacted Plaintiff’s vendors and customers, instructing them to
discontinue conducting business with Plaintiff. 
            The second amended complaint (“SAC”),
filed June 6, 2024, alleges causes of action for: (1) breach of fiduciary duty;
(2) conversion; (3) intentional interference with prospective economic
advantage; (4) unfair competition; (5) misappropriation of trade secrets; and
(6) declaratory relief.   
B.    
Cross-Complaint
On December 14, 2023, Hillary Hirsch filed
a cross-complaint against Kevin Jones, Epicurus Gourmet, Liquid Assets Cellars,
Inc., and Service West Construction, Inc. for: (1) accounting; (2) declaratory
relief; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of contract; (5) conversion; (6)
conversion; (7) fraud; (8) breach of fiduciary duty; (9) aiding and abetting
breach of fiduciary duty; (10) intentional interference with prospective economic
advantage; (11) unjust enrichment; (12) unjust enrichment; (13) declaratory
relief; (14) unfair business practices; (15) conversion; and (16) appointment
of receiver. 
C.

There are 3 discovery motions on calendar.

On September 12, 2024, Defendants Eric
Gitter and Hillary Hirsch filed a motion: (1) to compel Kevin Jones’ further
responses to Request for Production, set one (“RPD”), (2) for evidentiary and issue
sanctions, and (3) for monetary sanctions. 
On September 30, 2024, Kevin Jones filed an opposition brief.  On October 4, 2024, Defendants filed a reply
brief. 
On September 13, 2024, Defendants Eric
Gitter and Hillary Hirsch filed a motion: (1) to compel Liquid Assets Cellars,
Inc.’s (“LAC”) further responses to RPD, set one, (2) for evidentiary and issue

On September 13, 2024, Defendants Eric
Gitter and Hillary Hirsch filed a motion: (1) to compel Service West
Construction, Inc.’s (“SWC”) further responses to RPD, set one, (2) for
evidentiary and issue sanctions, and (3) for monetary sanctions.  On September 30, 2024, LAC filed an
opposition brief.  On October 4, 2024,
Defendants filed a reply brief. 
DISCUSSION
RE MOTION TO COMPEL KEVIN JONES’ FURTHER RESPONSES

RPD 

Defendants Eric Gitter and Hillary Hirsch
(hereinafter, “Defendants”) move to compel Jones’ further responses to RPD Nos.
5-6, 17-20, and 25-27.  
In opposition, Jones argues that the
motion is moot as to RPD Nos. 17-20 and 25-27 as Jones served supplemental
responses and amended responses on September 25, 2024 by electronic service.  (Sunkin Decl., ¶6, Ex. A.)  These responses were served after Defendants
filed the motion and before Jones filed the opposition brief.  As supplemental responses were provided with respect to RPD Nos. 17-20 and
25-27, the motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses is denied as moot as
to these RPDs.  However, the Court will
consider the appropriate nature of the sanctions to be awarded.  If Defendants find the supplemental responses
to be insufficient or inadequate, the parties should again meet and confer
prior to the filing of a subsequent motion on RPD Nos. 17-20 and 25-27.  
The remaining RPDs at issue are RPD Nos. 5 and 6.  RPD Nos. 5 and 6 seek all documents,
including promissory notes, checks, wire transfers, ACH transfers, and
agreements, receipts, journals, and ledgers, reflecting capital contributions
by Jones to (5) LAC from January 2007 to the present; and (6) SWC from January
1995 to the present.  Jones objected
generally that the RPDs seek documents protected by the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine, and right of privacy and financial privacy;
the documents are not in Jones’ possession; the RPDs are burdensome,
irrelevant, and are intended to harass and annoy Jones and his counsel.  Jones also objected on the grounds that the
scope of the RPDs was unreasonable; the RPDs are irrelevant, overly broad,
vague, and burdensome; and the RPDs are duplicative.  Defendants argue that there is good cause for
the documents sought because the documents are relevant to the
cross-complaint’s alter-ego claims regarding Jones, LAC, and SWC.  Defendants argue that the documents will show
whether LAC and SWC were undercapitalized, whether Jones used their assets as
his own, etc. 
Defendants have established good cause for the documents sought in RPD Nos.
5-6 based on their relevance regarding alter ego allegations.  Further, there does not appear to be any
issues with the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine, such that
those objections are overruled.  With
respect to Jones’ financial privacy interest, the Court notes that the RPDs
only seek Jones’ financial records related to LAC and SWC only, such that any
other financial records (personal or business) may be redacted.  With respect to scope of time, Jones argues
that Epicurus was formed in January 2016 and the substantive causes of action
in the cross-complaint occurred after January 2016, such that the production of
documents dating back to 1995 for SWC and 2007 for LAC is unreasonable.  Defendants have not substantiated why
documents dating back to 1995 for SWC and 2007 for LAC are required.  As such, the Court will limit the RPDs to
January 2015 to the present.  The motion
to compel further responses is granted as to RPD Nos. 5-6, subject to the
limitations stated herein.    

Evidentiary and Issue Sanctions

Under CCP § 2023.030, the Court may impose
issue sanctions ordering that designated facts be taken as established in the
action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process.  (CCP §
2023.030(b).)  The Court may impose an
evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.  (CCP § 2023.030(c).)  Evidence or issue sanctions may be imposed
only after parties violated discovery orders compelling further responses,
except in exceptional circumstances, including where there was sufficiently
egregious misconduct regarding a failure to respond to discovery, or a prior
discovery order would be futile. (New
Albertsons, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1426.)  Two prerequisites for the imposition of
non-monetary sanctions are: (1) there must be a failure to comply; and (2) the
failure must be willful.  (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43
Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)  The party
requesting sanctions under CCP §2023.030 and §2023.010(g) must establish that
the other party has failed to comply or disobeyed a court order to provide
discovery.  (CCP §2023.010(g); Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2004)
117 Cal.App.4th 913, 929 [first requirement of failure to comply].)  To avoid sanctions, the burden of proving
that a discovery violation was not willful is on the party on whom the
discovery was served. (Cornwall v. Santa
Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252- 253.) 
In the notice of motion, Defendants request
evidentiary and issue sanctions against Jones. 
However, in the memorandum of points and authorities, they have not
stated the scope of the evidentiary or issue sanctions requested.  They have also not shown that nonmonetary
sanctions are appropriate.  As such, the
request for evidentiary and issue sanctions is denied.  

Monetary Sanctions

Defendants
seek monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,600 against Jones only (= [6 hours
for the motion + 2 anticipated hours for the reply brief and to attend the
hearing] at $575/hour).  Defendants’
request for sanctions is denied.  CCP §
2023.040 requires that the party requesting sanctions “identify every person,
party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought,” and Defendants’
notice of motion asks only for sanctions against Jones but not against Jones’
counsel.  Defendants have failed to
provide the Court with facts to support a conclusion that the insufficient
responses were the fault of Jones, and because Defendants did not properly
request sanctions against Jones’ counsel under CCP §2023.040, Defendants’
request for sanctions is denied. 
DISCUSSION RE MOTION TO COMPEL LAC’S
FURTHER RESPONSES

RPD 

Defendants move to
compel LAC’s further responses to RPD Nos. 4, 7, 9, 12-14, 24, 39, 42, 49-50,
59, 61, 76, 80-83, and 86-88.   
RPD Nos. 4 and 39 seek all (4) journals
from January 2007 to the present and (39) documents from January 2015 to the
present, reflecting capital contributions to LAC.  RPD Nos. 76 and 80 seek all LAC’s
applications for loans with the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and
documents relating to loans LAC received from SBA, from January 2016 to the
present.  RPD No. 81 seeks all
documents reflecting withdrawal of loan proceeds that LAC received from the SBA
from January 2016 to the present.  RPD
No. 82 seeks all documents reflecting withdrawal of loan proceeds that LAC
received from the SBA from any bank account owned by LAC, from January 2016 to
the present.  RPD No. 83 seeks all
documents reflecting the transfer of loan proceeds that LAC received from the
SBA to any bank account owned by Jones from January 2016 to the present.  RPD No. 86 seeks all documents
reflecting the manner in which LAC has spent the loan proceeds it received from
the SBA from January 2016 to the present. 
RPD No. 87 seeks all documents reflecting the total amount that
LAC has borrowed from the SBA from January 2016 to the present.  RPD No. 88 seeks all documents
reflecting the balance that LAC owed on loans it received from the SBA from
January 2016 to the present.  LAC
objected to the RPDs on similar grounds that Jones objected to the RPDs (as
summarized above).  
Defendants argue that RPDs are relevant to
determine whether LAC is the alter ego of Jones, LAC was undercapitalized at
inception, Jones used LAC’s assets as his own, and there was a unity of
interest and ownership between LAC and Jones. 
Thus, the documents sought are relevant to the action and the claim
related to the alter ego doctrine.  Similar
to the discussion above, LAC has not justified its objections based on the
attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine.  Further, LAC is a corporate entity, such that
it has a lesser right of privacy in its financial records.  “[I]ndividuals have a legally recognized
privacy interest in their personal financial information.”  (International
Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, Local 21, AFL-CIO v. Sup.
Ct. (2007) 42 Cal. 4th 319, 330.) “The corporate right to privacy is a lesser
right than that held by human beings and is not considered a fundamental
right.”  (SCC Acquisitions, Inc. v. Superior Court (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 741, 756.)  Finally, the
documents requested are limited in scope of time from January 2015 or 2016 to
the present.  As such, the Court will
allow the RPDs to go forward and grants the motion as to RPD Nos. 4, 39, 76,
80-83, and 86-88.  
RPD No. 7 seeks all
documents reflecting loans from LAC to Jones from January 2007 to the
present.  RPD No. 9 seeks all
journals reflecting loans to LAC from January 2007 to the present.  RPD No. 12 seeks all journals
reflecting debts owed by LAC to Jones from January 2007 to the present.  RPD Nos. 13-14 seek all journals
reflecting payments by (13) LAC to Jones and (14) Jones to LAC, from January
2007 to the present.  RPD No. 24
seeks all journals reflecting debts owed by LAC from January 2007 to the present.  RPD No. 42 seeks all documents
reflecting loans from Jones to LAC from January 2015 to the present.  RPD Nos. 49-50 seek all documents
reflecting payments of money by (49) LAC to Jones and (50) Jones to LAC, from
January 2015 to the present.  RPD No. 59
seeks all monthly statements for credit cards taken out in the name of LAC from
January 2015 to the present.  RPD No.
61 seeks all credit card statements reflecting charges made on behalf of
LAC from January 2015 to the present.  LAC
objected to the RPDs on similar grounds that Jones objected to the RPDs (as
summarized above).  
Defendants, again, argue that these
documents are relevant to establish alter ego allegations.  For the same reasons discussed above, the Court
grants the motion as to RPD Nos. 7, 9, 12-14, 24, 42, 49, 50, 59, and 61, but
will limit the RPDs in scope of time. 
RPD Nos. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 24, shall be limited in scope from
January 2015 to the present.

Evidentiary and Issue
     Sanctions

In the notice of motion, Defendants state
that they are seeking evidentiary and issue sanctions against LAC.  However, in the memorandum of points and
authorities, they have not stated the scope of the evidentiary or issue
sanctions requested.  They have also not
shown that nonmonetary sanctions are appropriate against LAC.  As such, the request for evidentiary and
issue sanctions is denied.  

Monetary Sanctions

Defendants seek monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,600 against LAC
only.  Defendants’ request for
sanctions is denied for the same reasons stated above.  
DISCUSSION RE MOTION TO COMPEL SWC’S
FURTHER RESPONSES

RPD 

Defendants move to
compel LAC’s further responses to RPD Nos. 4, 9-10, 12-14, 39, 42, 49-50, 59,
61, 67, 73-74, and 77-79.    
RPD No. 4 seeks all
journals from January 1994 to the present reflecting capital contributions to SWC.
 RPD No. 73 seeks all
documents, reflecting withdrawal of loan proceeds that SWC received from the
SBA from any bank account owned by SWC from January 2016 to the present.   RPD No. 74 seeks all documents
reflecting the transfer of loan proceeds that SWC received from the SBA to any
bank account owned by Jones from January 2016 to the present.  RPD No. 77 seeks all documents
reflecting the manner in which SWC has spent the loan proceeds it received from
the SBA from January 2016 to the present. 
RPD No. 78 seeks all documents reflecting the total amount that SWC
has borrowed from the SBA from January 2016 to the present.  RPD No. 79 seeks all documents
reflecting the balance that SWC owed on loans it received from the SBA from
January 2016 to the present.  SWC
objected to the RPDs on similar grounds that Jones objected to the RPDs (as
summarized above).  
            For the same reasons discussed
above regarding RPD Nos. 4, 39, 76, 80-83, and 86-88
directed against LAC, the Court grants the motion to compel SWC’s further
responses as to RPD Nos. 4, 73-74, and 77-79. 
The Court will limit the scope of RPD No. 4 to January 2015 to the present.  
RPD Nos. 9-10 seek all journals
reflecting (9) loans to and (10) debts owed to SWC from January 1994 to the
present.  RPD Nos. 12-13 seek all
journals reflecting (12) debts owed by and (13) payments by SWC to Jones
from 1994 to the present.  RPD No. 14
seeks all journals reflecting payments by Jones to SWC from January 1994 to the
present.  RPD No. 39 seeks all
documents reflecting capital contributions made to SWC from January 1994 to the
present.   RPD No. 42 seeks all
documents reflecting loans from Jones to SWC from January 1994 to the
present.  RPD Nos. 49-50 seek all
documents reflecting payments of money by (49) SWC to Jones and (50) Jones to SWC,
from January 1994 to the present.  RPD
No. 59 seeks all monthly statements for credit cards taken out in the name
of SWC from January 2015 to the present. 
RPD No. 61 seeks all credit card statements reflecting charges
made on behalf of SWC from January 2015 to the present.  SWC objected to the RPDs on similar grounds
that Jones and LAC objected to the RPDs (as summarized above).  
For the same
reasons discussed above, the Court grants the motion as to RPD Nos. 9-10, 12-14,
39, 42, 49-50, 59, and 61, but will limit the RPDs in scope of time.  RPD Nos. 79-10, 12-14, 39, 42, and 49-50
shall be limited in scope from January 2015 to the present.
The Court notes that the notice of motion and the memorandum of points and
authorities state that RPD No. 67 is at issue. 
However, the separate statement does not discuss No. 67.  As such, the motion is denied as to RPD No.
67.  

Evidentiary
     and Issue Sanctions

In the notice of
motion, Defendants state that they are seeking evidentiary and issue sanctions
against SWC.  However, in the memorandum
of points and authorities, they have not stated the scope of the evidentiary or
issue sanctions requested.  They have
also not shown that nonmonetary sanctions are appropriate against SWC.  As such, the request for evidentiary and
issue sanctions is denied.  

Monetary Sanctions

Defendants seek monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,600 against SWC
only.  Defendants’ request for
sanctions is denied for the same reasons stated above.
