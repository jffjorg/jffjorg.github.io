**Significant Statements**

* "Probable validity" exists when "it is more likely than not that the claimant will obtain a judgment on the claim."
* "The element of intent is narrow. The conscious and voluntary taking of more than the legal rate of interest constitutes usury and the only intent necessary on the part of the lender is to take the amount of interest which he receives; if that amount is more than the law allows, the offense is complete."
