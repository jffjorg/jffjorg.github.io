 [TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to set aside default and default judgment and default
  judgment



 
BACKGROUND
A.    Allegations

Plaintiff
Highland Industrial Center, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on July 23, 2020, it
entered into a lease agreement with Defendants American Sunshine Transportation
Corp. (“American Sunshine”) and Ye Jin (“Jin”) for real property located at
1801 Highland Avenue, Unit D, Duarte, California 91010.  The lease agreement included monthly rent
amounts in increasing amounts from the years 2021 to 2024 and called for
Defendants to pay additional costs, including Common Area Maintenance charges,
taxes, and insurance.  During
negotiations and prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff alleges it relied on Jin’s
representation that the property would be used for distribution operations of a
third-party logistics provider and related office use.  
On August 1,
2020, Defendants moved into the subject property, but the property was not used
for the represented purpose, but instead was used to operate a large scale
and/or commercial cannabis cultivation operation.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants falsely
represented the use of the property and that it would not have leased the
property to Defendants had it known the true intentions.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ use of the
property for cannabis operations is unpermitted and Defendant lacks proper
licensures. 
The complaint,
filed March 30, 2021, alleges causes of action for: (1) fraud; (2) fraud by
omission; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of contract; (5) negligence; and
(6) damage to property. 
On April 29,
2021, Plaintiff filed Amendments to the Complaint naming Li Fan (Doe 1),
Krystal Williams (Doe 2), Weixian Lo (Doe 3), and Peng Gao (Doe 4).

C.     Motion
on Calendar

supplemental declaration.  
            On October 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed
an untimely opposition brief. 
            On October 4, 2024, Defendant Luo
filed a reply brief.  
DISCUSSION
Defendant Winnie
Luo (“Luo”) moves to set aside the default and default judgment pursuant to CCP
§ 473(d).  Luo argues that she was never
served with the summons and complaint, making the default and default judgment
void.  
The proof of
service of the summons and complaint (filed June 30, 2021) shows that Weixian
Lo was personally served on May 18, 2021 at 7:20 p.m. at 1456 W 11th
Street, Pomona, CA 91766.  Service was
effectuated by Brian Sevilla, a registered California process server.  (Li Decl., Ex. 2.)  
Luo provides her
declaration in support of the motion. 
She states that on May 18, 2021, she was not personally served with the
summons and complaint and has never been served in this manner.  (Luo Decl., ¶2.)  She states that she did not receive service
of any documents regarding this lawsuit prior to June 2024.  (Id.)  She states that from 2017 to
September 2020, she lived at 301 S. Glendora Ave., #14149, West Covina, CA
91790; and from September 2020 to October 2021, she moved in with Qiuping LI at
754 Lincoln Ave., Walnut, CA 91789.  (Id., ¶3.)  She states that she gave
birth to her daughter in November 2020 and in December 2020, she and her
husband (who works in China) bought 1456 W. 11th Pomona Street, but
she was unable to live alone without help, such that she did not move into the
property and the property was leased to Chunxin Fu from January 2021 to January
2024.  (Id., ¶¶5-6, Ex. 4 [Rental
Agreement between Luo and Fu].)  She
states that in October 2021, Li bought 7941 Via Casitas, Chino Hills, CA 91789
and she moved with Li into the new home. 
(Id., ¶7.) 
Luo states that in February 2024, she moved into the 1456 W 11th
Street property.  (Id., ¶8.)  She states that she was not personally served
with the summons and complaint on May 18, 2021, because she was not living at
1456 W 11th Street at that time. 
(Id., ¶9.)  She states that
Lo and Luo are different last names in Chinese. 
(Id., ¶10.)  She states
that she did not learn about this lawsuit until April 2024 when Li Fan (her
former boss at American Sunshine) informed her about the lawsuit.  (Id., ¶11.)  She states that she believed Li Fan would
reopen the lawsuit and fight the case for her, but she realized on June 28,
2024, that she needed her own attorney. 
(Id.)  Luo states that when
she received a copy of Li Fan’s motion to set aside, she believed she needed to
attend the hearing to have the case reopened as to her as well, but learned at
the hearing from the Court that she needed to hire her own attorney.  (Id., ¶12.)  She states after the hearing, she retained
Supreme Law Group, APC on July 17, 2024. 
(Id.)  In her supplemental
declaration (filed September 18, 2024), Luo states that her legal name is
“Winnie Wei Xian Luo,” she goes by “Winnie Luo,” and she has never gone by the
name “Weixian Lo.”  (Luo Suppl. Decl., ¶1
[driver’s license].)  
In support of the motion, Luo also provides the declarations of Qiuping
Li and Chunxin Fu.  Li states that she is
Luo’s friend and confirms that Luo moved in with her at 754 Lincoln Ave. due to
Luo’s pregnancy in September 2020 until October 2021, and that they moved to
7941 Via Casitas from October 2021 to February 2024.  (Li Decl., ¶¶1-3.)  Fu states that he lived at the 1456
W 11th Street property from January 2021 to January 2024, that Luo
and her husband were his landlords, and that he did not receive Plaintiff’s
summons and complaint on May 18, 2021. 
(Fu Decl., ¶¶2-5.)  
In opposition,
Plaintiff argues that the default judgment is not void on its face and thus the
motion must be denied.  However, as shown
by Luo, “Weixian Lo” is not her legal name and she did not reside at the property
at the time of purported personal service. 
Even if the Court were to apply the presumption of proper service by a
registered process server, the Court can only make the presumption that a
person named “Weixan Lo” was personally served—the Court would not apply this
to mean that moving party Winnie Luo was personally served.  In the opposition papers, Plaintiff does not
deny that the defendant’s name is “Winnie Luo” but instead attempts to argue
that it is reasonable for a person to believe “Luo” and “Lo” or “Weixian” and
“Winnie” are similar enough that a reasonable person would conclude that they
are the same person.  However, the fact
of the matter is that “Weixian Lo” is not the moving party “Winnie Luo” (her
legal name as shown by her driver’s license). 
At this point in time, it appears that Plaintiff has a default judgment
against a nonexistent person or against “Weixian Lo”; however, having a
judgment against Weixian Lo would not be enforceable against Winnie Luo.  Further, Luo can choose to set aside the
default judgment and submit to the Court’s jurisdiction, or she can choose to
file a motion to quash service of the summons and complaint where service would
once again need to be attempted—she chose the former. 
Based on the declarations
provided in support of the motion, the Court finds that there is substantive
merit to granting the motion pursuant to CCP § 473(d).  Luo has shown that she was not personally
served with the summons and complaint on May 18, 2021, her name is not “Weixian
Lo,” and
she did not reside at the property where service was purportedly made.  Finally, the policy of the law strongly
favors a hearing on the merits, which supports granting this motion.  (Thompson
v. Sutton (1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 272, 276.) 
The motion is granted.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER 
            Defendant
Winnie Luo motion to set aside the default and
default judgment is granted.  Defendant
is ordered to electronically file a responsive pleading following the hearing
on the matter.   
Defendant shall provide notice of this order.
