ORDER CONTINUING THE HEARING ON PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST
 FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST DEFENDANT, MARIA CASTELLON 
 
      Plaintiff filed the fourth amended
complaint (“4AC”) on May 24, 2021. Plaintiff served Defendant Mary Castellon by
substituted service on July 24, 2022. The Request for Court Judgment
incorrectly reflects entry of judgment on the Complaint filed January 29, 2020.
The original complaint has been superseded by the 4AC. Plaintiff shall resubmit
the request for entry of default (Judicial Council Form CIV-100) to reflect the
fourth amended complaint (line 1) filed on May 24, 2021 (line 1.a.)
      The 4AC alleges two causes of action for
fraud and violation of Civil Code § 1102 against Defendant Castellon (fourth
and fifth causes of action, respectively). The fraud claim adequately and
specifically alleges the misrepresentations made by Defendant with respect to
the condition of the home and Plaintiff’s reliance thereon. The fifth cause of
action governing a seller’s required disclosures pertaining to the condition of
the property and Defendant’s alleged failure to adhere to the statute’s
requirements are also adequately alleged. (Civ. Code, § 1102.6.)
      With respect to damages, the 4AC alleges that
contrary to Defendant’s representations, Plaintiff discovered defects in
construction that were contrary to Defendant’s representations involving the external
stucco, flooring and subflooring, garage floor, and the incomplete drainage
system. Plaintiff alleges damages totaling $259,822. (4AC .pdf p. 30).
      In support of the damage claim, Plaintiff
provided the following evidence:
