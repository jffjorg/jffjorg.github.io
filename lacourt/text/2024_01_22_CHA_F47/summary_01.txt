And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion for terminating sanctions and grants the request for adverse jury instructions, in part. The motion was filed by the Plaintiff, Anthony Joseph Lazzara, Jr., against the Defendants, Mercedes-Benz of Valencia, Trophy Automotive Dealer Group, LLC, Second Motor Group of Valencia, LLC, and Kasra Foroutan. The Plaintiff alleges sexual harassment and discrimination by Foroutan and the Defendants' alleged failure to prevent, investigate and remedy discrimination and harassment.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has failed to establish that the Defendants had possession and/or control of the text messages between Plaintiff and Tom Swire, and that the Defendants were not aware that such communications existed. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has failed to establish that the Defendants can be held responsible for Swire's deletion of the text messages from his and/or Plaintiff's personal phones.

However, the Judge finds that the trier of fact could conclude that the Defendants, acting through Swire, acted to destroy the text messages, and grants the request for adverse jury instruction, in part, as set forth above. The Judge denies the request for terminating, evidentiary and/or issue sanctions.
