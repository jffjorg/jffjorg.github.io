And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has continued the hearing on the petition for relief from government claim filing requirements to allow for proper service of the petition and notice of hearing. The petition was filed on April 10, 2023, and the previous hearing was continued to November 2, 2023 due to service issues. The court found that the service proofs were insufficient and the petitioner failed to establish that service by certified mail was appropriate. The judge has ordered the petitioner to properly serve the respondents with the petition and notice of the hearing date, and proof of such service must be filed at least five court days before the hearing.
