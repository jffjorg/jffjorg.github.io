Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer filed by Pacific Pharmacy Group to the entire complaint, giving the plaintiff 30 days to amend the pleading. The plaintiff, Jacques Wylan, alleged that he suffered injuries when a bolt in the JusGo knee scooter he rented from Pacific failed, causing him to fall. Pacific argued that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute the causes of action. The court found that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to establish that Pacific owed him a duty of care, but failed to plead facts showing how Pacific allegedly breached that duty and caused the plaintiff's harm. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to impose strict liability on Pacific. The court gave the plaintiff the opportunity to try to cure the defects in the pleading.
