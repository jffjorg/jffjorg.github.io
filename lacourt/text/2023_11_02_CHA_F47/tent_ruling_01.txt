Case #23CHCP00158
 
PETITION FOR
RELIEF FROM GOVERNMENT CLAIM FILING REQUIREMENTS, 
OR, IN THE
ALTERNATIVE, 
FOR ORDER
FINDING SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE
 
Petition filed on 4/10/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Petitioner E.A., a minor, by
and through her Guardian ad Litem, J.A.

RESPONDING PARTY : Respondents County of Los Angeles and
City of Los Angeles
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
pursuant to Government Code 946.6 relieving Petitioner from the requirements of
Government Code 945.4.  Alternatively,
Petitioner seeks an order that she has substantially complied with said
requirements.  
 
RULING: The hearing on the petition will be continued.  
 
On 9/27/23, the hearing on the petition was continued to
11/2/23 due to issues with the service of the petition and notice of
hearing.  (See 9/27/23 Nunc Pro
Tunc Minute Order).  Specifically, the
Court found:  
 
“The proofs of service for the
underlying petition and the notice of hearing fail to set forth the name of the
actual city and/or county clerk for whom Dee Gentry is purportedly the deputy.
The Court finds it insufficient to serve a deputy clerk without providing any
information regarding the superior to whom that individual is a deputy and/or
as to why service on such deputy clerk is sufficient under Government Code
Section 946.6(d). Additionally, petitioner has failed to establish that service
of the notice of hearing by certified mail is appropriate under the
circumstances where the respondent has not appeared in the action.”
 
(See 9/27/23 Nunc Pro Tunc Minute Order, pp.4-5).
 
Government Code 946.6(d) provides:
 
“A copy of the petition and a
written notice of the time and place of hearing shall be served before the
hearing as prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005 of the Code Section of
Civil Procedure on (1) the clerk or secretary or board of the local public
entity, if the respondent is a local public entity . . .”
 
The Court then ordered Petitioner to properly serve
respondents with the petition and notice of the 11/2/23 hearing date and
continued the matter to 11/2/23.  (Id.,
p.5).
 
Nothing has been filed since the 9/27/23 hearing.  See 
CRC 3.1300(c) (“Proof of service for of the moving [motion] papers must
be filed no later than five court days before the time appointed for the
hearing.”).
 
As such, the hearing on the petition will be continued
one last time to allow for proper service of same.  Proof of such service must be filed at least
five court days before the hearing.
