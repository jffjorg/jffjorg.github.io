And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the motions, oppositions, and replies in this case and has reached a tentative ruling. The Plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admissions admitted is no longer necessary since responses have been provided. However, the issue of sanctions remains. The Judge must impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion. In this case, the Plaintiff granted an initial 10-day extension to respond to discovery, and responses were due on November 8, 2024. However, the Defendant failed to provide responses by that date and sought a second extension, which was denied. The Plaintiff filed the motion on November 12, 2024, and the Defendant served responses on November 13, 2024. As a result, the Judge awards reasonable sanctions in the amount of $500.00 in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant Christopher L. Lopez and his counsel, Bretoi, Lutz & Steele, jointly and severally. The sanctions are payable to the Plaintiff's counsel and are due within 30 days of mailing of a notice of ruling.
