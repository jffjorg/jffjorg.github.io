(9938), ¶¶ 4-5; Manning Decl. (9415), ¶¶ 4-5.)  No oppositions have been filed. Because Defendants have provided no responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests, Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to form interrogatories and requests for production are granted.  Defendants are to provide verified responses within 30 days of Plaintiff’s mailing of a notice of ruling.  All objections have been waived.  (Code Civ.
