And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Neptune Shipping Limited's (Defendant) motion for judicial notice without prejudice. The Defendant had requested the court to take judicial notice of various court records, but the judge found that the request was premature and lacked context. The judge cites two previous cases, Ellis-Hall Consultants, LLC v. Hofmann and White River Vill. LLP v. Fid. & Deposit Co., which support the decision to deny the motion. The Defendant will have the opportunity to provide further context and address the purpose of its request for judicial notice at the motion hearing and case management conference on August 15, 2024.
