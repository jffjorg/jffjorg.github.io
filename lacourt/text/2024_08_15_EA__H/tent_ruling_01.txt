  Case Number:  23PSCV02690    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  H Defendant
Neptune Shipping Limited’s Motion for Request for Judicial Notice is summarily
DENIED without prejudice.
Plaintiff Home
Accent Pillows, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges in the instant lawsuit that Neptune
Shipping Limited (“Defendant”) overcharged Plaintiff for shipping costs and
then withheld products from Plaintiff until Plaintiff paid the inflated price. 
Defendant has
filed a motion for the Court to take judicial notice of various court
records. The Court may take judicial notice of “[r]ecords of . . . any court of
this state” (Evid. Code § 452), provided that the requesting party “[g]ives
each adverse party sufficient notice of the request . . . to enable such
adverse party to prepare to meet the request” and “[f]urnishes the court with
sufficient information to enable it to take judicial notice of the matter”
(Evid. Code § 453). 
The Court denies
Defendant’s motion as premature. Defendant’s motion is “untethered to any
specific motion or action” and thus seeks judicial notice in a vacuum. (Ellis-Hall
Consultants, LLC v. Hofmann (D. Utah Sept. 19, 2018) No. 2:12-CV-00771,
2018 WL 11411607, at *1.) While Defendant is free to seek judicial notice of
these same documents in connection with trial or a specific motion or hearing,
the Court will not entertain a standalone request for judicial notice absent
any context as to the ultimate purpose or relevance of the documents in
question.  (Id.; see also White
River Vill. LLP v. Fid. & Deposit Co. (D. Colo. 2009) 2009 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 86514, at *5 [refusing to take judicial notice of other court orders due
to failure to show that the orders’ contents “are relevant to the resolution of
the claims at issue in this case”].)
Defendant will
have the opportunity to provide further context and address the purpose of its
request for judicial notice at the motion hearing and case management
conference on August 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department H.
