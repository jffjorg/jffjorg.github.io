And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between Bank of America, N.A. (Plaintiff) and Yeong Ryu (Defendant). The Plaintiff alleges a balance due of $25,535.59, which was agreed upon in a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement includes terms for payment and filing fees. The Defendant did not file opposition or reply to the motion, making it unopposed. The Judge determines that the settlement agreement is valid and binding, and that the Plaintiff correctly enumerates the totals based on the stipulated agreement. The motion is therefore granted.
