SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff, Joycelyne Lew 
RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed/Defendant, Jerome
Maida
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion for Summary Judgment on the Complaint
for Unlawful Detainer
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On
June 24, 2024, plaintiff Joycelyne Lew filed a complaint for unlawful detainer
against defendant Jerome Maida. Defendant answered the complaint on July 8,
2024.
 
RULING : Off-Calendar.
Plaintiff Joycelyne Lew moves for summary
judgment on grounds that Defendant Jerome Maida failed to pay rent. Plaintiff
only moves for possession of the property.
 
The
court electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply on file at the time
of the tentative ruling publication cutoff. The court reserves the right to
take the motion under submission pending oral argument opposition or later
posted electronically filed documents.
 
The propriety
of granting a motion for summary is subject to the same standards a motion in a
general civil action brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.7.) The law of summary judgment provides courts
“a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine
whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their
dispute.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 (Aguilar).)  In reviewing a motion for summary judgment,
courts employ a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the
pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s
claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence
of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) 
 
The pleadings frame
the issues for motions, “since it is those allegations to which the
motion must respond. (Citation.)” 
(Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37
Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD., v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) “On a motion for summary judgment, the initial
burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there
are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A plaintiff or cross-complainant has met
his or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if
that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party
to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Plaintiff need not disprove all defenses, if
the elements of a cause of action are made. (Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. (2009)
170 Cal.App.4th 554, 564; WRI Opportunity
Loans II, LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 525, 532.) “An issue of fact
can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)  
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi,
159 Cal.App.4th at 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An issue
of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.” (Lyons v.
Security Pacific National Bank (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation
omitted).)
 
The
motion for summary judgment comes following the June 24, 2024, verified
complaint for unlawful detainer. The complaint alleges Defendant owes $49,800
in rent payments beginning on August 13, 2017, and accumulating through June
30, 2024. 
 
The answer alleges a number of affirmative defenses,
including improper overstatement of rent due, denial of the nuisance
allegations in the operative complaint, denial of service, defective complaint,
habitability challenges, estoppel, waiver, abatement due to another pending
action (23STCV23692, 22STCV07730, 22STCV26093), violation of covenant of good
faith and fair dealing and covenant of quiet enjoyment, and violation of Los
Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance (LARSO).
 
The
court takes notice that the exact parties are/were in fact invovled in three
other cases: Maida v. Lew, 23STCV23692; Lew v. Maida, 22STCV0730 (dismissed on
December 4, 2023); and, Lew v. Maida, 22STCV26093 (dismissed on December 4,
2023). The two complaints filed by Lew were for forced detainer and unlawful
detainer. The Maida v. Lew case is currently pending in Department 72. The
subject case was filed before the instant motion for unlawful detainer.
 
Given Plaintiff raises a number of defenses in the subject action
and said defenses appear as part of the issues before the court in the Maida
v. Lew action, the court orders Plaintiff Lew to file a notice of related
cases in Maida v. Lew, 23STCV23692. The court takes the motion for summary
judgment off-calendar pending consideration by Department 72, due to potential
abatement of the subject action and demonstrated forum shopping. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 430.80, subd. (a), 597.) If the court declines to relate the cases,
Plaintiff may request special setting for the MSJ in this court, but the court
will demand briefing on the potential defenses raised as causes of action in
the previously filed action.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
