RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Bank of America, N.A. alleges the existence of
a $25,535.59 balance due owed by Defendant Yeong Ryu. On July 3, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a complaint for common counts. 
 
On October 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Settlement. On December 29, 2023, the court dismissed the action pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. On June 3, 2024, the court recused
itself, thereby leading to reassignment from Department 50 to Department 68. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Bank of America moves for enforcement of the parties’
settlement agreement. Plaintiff
moves for entry of judgment for $24,145 stated as follows: $26,092.09, less
$2,232.09 in credited payments, plus $285 in filing fees for the instant
motion. [Declaration of Flint Zide, Ex. 1.] The court electronic filing system
shows no opposition or reply at the time of the tentative ruling publication

Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6:
 
If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence
of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part
thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of
the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
664.6.) 
 
Strict compliance
with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a
settlement agreement under this statute. (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) Accordingly, “parties” under section 664.6 means the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. (Levy
v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586 (holding “we conclude that the
term ‘parties’ as used in section 664.6 means the litigants themselves, and
does not include their attorneys of record.”).) Additionally, the settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) 
 
“Section 664.6 was enacted to provide a summary procedure
for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the need for a new
lawsuit.” (Weddington Prods., Inc. v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.) When ruling on a section 664.6
motion, the trial court acts as a trier of fact to determine whether a
settlement has occurred, which is also an implicit authorization for the trial
court to interpret the terms and conditions to settlement. (Id.) The court may not “create the
material terms of a settlement,” and must instead decide on what terms the
parties agreed upon. (Id.; Terry v. Conlan (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th
1445, 1460; Osumi v. Sutton (2007)
151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1360; Fiore v.
Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 565-566.) “In acting upon a
section 664.6 motion, the trial court must determine whether the parties
entered into a valid and binding settlement of all or part of the case. In
making this determination, trial judges, in the sound exercise of their
discretion, may receive oral testimony or may determine the motion upon
declarations alone.” (Corkland v. Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.)
 
Plaintiff correctly enumerates the totals based on the
stipulated agreement. The unopposed motion is therefore granted.
 
Moving party to give notice.
