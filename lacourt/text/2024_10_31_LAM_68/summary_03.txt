And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff Joycelyne Lew. The motion seeks summary judgment on the grounds that Defendant Jerome Maida failed to pay rent. The court notes that the motion is unopposed and that the court's electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply on file at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.

The court will consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers, as well as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. The court will also consider the affirmative defenses raised by Defendant, including improper overstatement of rent due, denial of the nuisance allegations in the operative complaint, denial of service, defective complaint, habitability challenges, estoppel, waiver, abatement due to another pending action, violation of covenant of good faith and fair dealing and covenant of quiet enjoyment, and violation of Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance.

The court notes that the exact parties are/were in fact involved in three other cases, including Maida v. Lew, 23STCV23692; Lew v. Maida, 22STCV0730; and Lew v. Maida, 22STCV26093. The court orders Plaintiff Lew to file a notice of related cases in Maida v. Lew, 23STCV23692, and takes the motion for summary judgment off-calendar pending consideration by Department 72, due to potential abatement of the subject action and demonstrated forum shopping.

If the court declines to relate the cases, Plaintiff may request special setting for the MSJ in this court, but the court will demand briefing on the potential defenses raised as causes of action in the previously filed action.
