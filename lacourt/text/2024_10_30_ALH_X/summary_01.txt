And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion to compel responses to the Form Interrogatories (Set Two) and Requests for Production (Set Two) served on the plaintiff. The discovery requests were served on July 9, 2024, and the answers were due on August 13, 2024. However, the plaintiff has not provided any responses to the discovery requests and has not requested an extension or communicated with the defendant. The judge finds that an order compelling the plaintiff to provide initial responses to the interrogatories and request for production is warranted. The plaintiff's objections are waived, and no sanctions are requested. The defendant's motions are granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses within 30 days of the defendant's mailing of a notice of ruling.
