And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the requests for production of documents, set one, nos. 16-21. The plaintiff is seeking documents related to General Motors' internal investigation and analysis of the defects plaguing his vehicle, including documents regarding the company's knowledge of the defects, its attempts to repair the vehicle, and its decision to refuse to repurchase or replace the vehicle. The judge finds that the information sought is relevant to the case and necessary for the plaintiff's claims, and that the defendant's objections to the requests are not sufficient to prevent the plaintiff from obtaining the information. The defendant is ordered to provide code-compliant responses to the requests within 30 days.
