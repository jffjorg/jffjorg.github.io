Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, East Valley Towing, Inc., has filed a motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff, Edward Sandstrom, regarding requests for production, set 1, nos. 7, 8, and 9. The requests seek documents to support Sandstrom's claim for loss of income and loss of future earning capacity. The court grants the motion, finding that Sandstrom's objections to the requests are meritless and/or unsupported. The court also denies the defendant's request for sanctions against Sandstrom and his counsel.

The court orders Sandstrom to provide further responses to the requests and to produce any financial documents in accordance with a protective order. The parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding the execution of the protective order. The court also warns counsel that failure to comply with the electronic bookmarking rule may result in sanctions.

The court notes that Sandstrom's claim of privilege is without merit and that he must produce documents responsive to the requests. The court finds that imposing sanctions against Sandstrom would be unjust under the circumstances. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change after hearing from the parties and considering further arguments.
