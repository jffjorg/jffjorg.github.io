Case #24CHCV01905
 
APPLICATION TO
APPEAR PRO HAC VICE
 
Application filed on 6/7/24.
 
APPLICANT: Edward Andrew Paltzik
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order allowing Edward Andrew
Paltzik to appear as counsel pro hac vice in
this action for Plaintiffs Alan Gottlieb and Eleanor Gottlieb.

 
RULING: The application is denied without
prejudice.
 
On 6/7/24, Edward Andrew Paltzik filed this application
to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this action for Plaintiffs Alan
Gottlieb and Eleanor Gottlieb.  No other
party has appeared in the action.  
 
The declaration of attorney Paltzik is not executed in
compliance with CCP 2015.5.  
 
There is no proof of service showing that the motion was
served on the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office in compliance
with CCP 1005 as required.  See
CRC 9.40(c)(1).  The declaration of
attorney Curtis Smolar merely states: “I have caused a copy of this declaration
and the application for admission [ ] on the San Francisco offices of the State
Bar of California with the necessary fee.” 
(See Smolar Decl. ¶7).  The
declaration seemingly mistakenly omits the phrase “to be served.”  Even if the missing phrase had been included,
attorney Smolar does not state how or when the declaration and application were
served.  As such, it is not a proper
proof of service.
