English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer is sustained because the FAC fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract. The Court finds that the FAC is confusing and unclear as to what Plaintiff's claims are, and that it fails to clearly set forth the terms of any purported contract between the parties. The Court also finds that the FAC does not allege facts showing Plaintiff is entitled to the $15,000,000 in damages sought. The Court denies the motion to strike as moot, as the demurrer has been sustained. The Court will hear from Plaintiff at the hearing on the demurrer to determine whether Plaintiff can make an offer of proof to address the defects identified herein.
