[1] The Court
does note, however, that Plaintiff’s opposition mentions three months of unpaid
rent from July 27, 2020 to July 31, 2021, (Opp., pp. 3-4), which appears to
have been the subject of Plaintiff’s prior small claims suit against Defendants
Liang Xiuhua and Guan Long Ji that was litigated to conclusion in a bench
trial, (FAC, Ex. A.) If Plaintiff is attempting to relitigate those claims,
that would definitely be subject to res judicata for Defendants Liang Xiuhua
and Guan Long Ji. (See Fed'n of Hillside & Canyon Assns., supra, 126
Cal.App.4th at p. 1202.)
