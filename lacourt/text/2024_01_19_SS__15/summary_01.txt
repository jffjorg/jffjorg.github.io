Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, The Sherwin-Williams Company, and a motion to bifurcate filed by the same party. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are barred by its prior bankruptcy and that the plaintiff has no evidence of exposure to asbestos-containing products. The judge finds that the defendant did not show that the plaintiff had notice of the claims bar date and that the plaintiff's deposition testimony and discovery responses do not provide evidence of exposure to asbestos-containing products. The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and its motion to bifurcate.
