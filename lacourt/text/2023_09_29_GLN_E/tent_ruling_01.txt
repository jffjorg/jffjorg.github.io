[TENTATIVE RULING ON
MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT]
RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiff Eligio Sanchez will and hereby does
move this Court for an order enforcing the terms of the settlement agreement
between the parties pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6. Defendant
Horizon Personnel Services, Inc. (hereinafter "Horizon") wrote a
check from a closed account for the settlement payment and has not made good on
the check. Accordingly, Plaintiff moves this Court for a Judgment against
Horizon in the principal amount of $20,475 plus costs in the amount of $61.65
for a total judgment amount of $20,536.65.
 
This motion will be based on this Notice of
Motion, Motion, the attached points and authorities, the Declaration of Raphael
Hedwat, and Exhibits, and upon such oral and documentary evidence as may be
presented by the moving party at the time of the hearing.
 
PROCEDURAL
Moving Party:  Plaintiff, Eligio Sanchez
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Eligio
Sanchez, filed a Complaint on 02/22/2021 alleging ten causes of action. The
three named Defendants in the Complaint are Horizon Personnel Services, Inc.,
Greencastle Cabinetry, and Joel Romero. 
In
¶4 of the Hedwat (attorney for Plaintiff) Declaration, Hedwat notes that although
Joel Romero is named as one of the original Defendants in the pleadings,
Plaintiff dismissed him in October 2022. (Hedwat Decl. ¶4.) The Court will need
to confirm this with counsel at the hearing.
On
09/15/2021, Joel Romero filed a Cross-Complaint alleging seven causes of
action. The named Cross-Defendants were Horizon Personnel Services, Inc.,
Greencastle Cabinetry, Inc., and Eligio Sanchez. The Court will need to confirm
this with Counsel at the hearing.
As
to the instant motion, Plaintiff argues that Defendant, Horizon, owes Plaintiff
$20,475 according to the settlement agreement plus $61.65 as an award of costs
in the amount of $61.65. Plaintiff argues it is owed a total judgment of
$20,536.65.
Plaintiff
argues that it entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release wherein the
parties settled the case for a total of $45,000. Plaintiff argues that
Defendant Greencastle was obligated to pay $24,525 and Horizon agreed to pay
$20,475. Plaintiff argues payment was due 30 days after documents referenced in
the Agreement at section 2. Plaintiff argues that all conditions to payment
were satisfied December 28, 2022, that Greencastle made its payment pursuant to
the settlement, but the check that Horizon sent Plaintiff was returned unpaid
with the explanation that it was drawn on a closed account. 
LEGAL STANDARD – MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT
CCP
§ 664.6 states as follows: 
(a) If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing
is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent
who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.
 
(CCP § 664.6(a)-(b).)
 
In relevant part as stated in Weddington:
Section
664.6 was enacted to provide a summary procedure for specifically
enforcing a settlement contract without the need for a new lawsuit….
 
Although a judge
hearing a section 664.6 motion may receive evidence, determine
disputed facts, and enter the terms of a settlement agreement as a judgment,
(Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial supra, at
§ 12:975 et seq.; Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561,
221 Cal.Rptr. 400 [court may interpret terms of settlement agreement] )
nothing in section 664.6 authorizes a judge to create the
material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the
parties themselves have previously agreed upon…
 
In order to be
enforceable pursuant to the summary procedures of section 664.6, a
settlement agreement must either be entered into orally before a court (a
possibility not involved here) or must be in writing and signed by the parties.
The reason for the party-signature requirement is that “settlement is such a
serious step that it requires the client's knowledge and express consent. (1
Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Attorneys, § 194, pp. 221–222.)” (Levy
v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 583, 41 Cal.Rptr.2d 878, 896
P.2d 171.) “... in 1981 ... the Legislature enacted section 664.6,
which created a summary, expedited procedure to enforce settlement agreements
when certain requirements that decrease the likelihood of misunderstandings are
met. Thus the statute requires the ‘parties' to stipulate in writing or orally
before the court that they have settled the case. The litigants' direct
participation tends to ensure that the settlement is the result of their mature
reflection and deliberate assent. This protects the parties against hasty and
improvident settlement agreements by impressing upon them the seriousness and
finality of the decision to settle, and minimizes the possibility of
conflicting interpretations of the settlement. (See In re Marriage of
Assemi, [1994], 7 Cal.4th at p. 905 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 265, 872 P.2d
1190]; City of Fresno v. Maroot, [1987], 189 Cal.App.3d [755]
at p. 762 [234 Cal.Rptr. 353]; Datatronic Systems Corp. v. Speron,
Inc., [1986] 176 Cal.App.3d [1168] at p. 1174 [222 Cal.Rptr.
658].) It also protects parties from impairment of their substantial
rights without their knowledge and consent. (See Blanton v. Womancare,
Inc., supra, 38 Cal.3d [396] at p. 404 [212 Cal.Rptr. 151, 696 P.2d
645].) [Fn. omitted.]” (Levy, supra, 10 Cal.4th at pp.
585–586, 41 Cal.Rptr.2d 878, 896 P.2d 171.)

Cal.App.4th 793, 809-810.)
 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff
submitted the Declaration of Raphael B. Hedwat, counsel for Plaintiff. In his
declaration counsel stated in relevant part as follows:
 
3. I make this
declaration in support of the foregoing motion for enforcement of the
Settlement Agreement and Release (a true and correct copy of the fully executed
Settlement Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit A). 
 
4. On October 26,
2022, the parties participated in a mediation officiated by Judge Margaret
Nagle (Ret.) of JAMS, reference # 1220073012. The parties settled the case for
a total of $45,000. Counsel for Defendant Horizon drafted the settlement
Agreement and Release (hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement")
which was fully executed by all parties (See Exhibit "A".) Note that
although Joel Romero is named as one of the original Defendant in the
pleadings, Plaintiff dismissed him in October of 2022. 
 
5. Under the terms
of the Agreement, Defendant Greencastle was obligated to pay $24,525 and
Horizon agreed to pay $20,475. The payment was due 30 days after documents
referenced in the Agreement at section 2. Timing of Settlement Payment were
provided and executed. All conditions to payment as per the Agreement were
satisfied December 28, 2022. Defendant Greencastle made its payment pursuant to
the Agreement. Plaintiff received a check from Horizon on February 3, 2023. (A
true and correct copy of the check is attached hereto as Exhibit B).,On
February 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel received notice that the Horizon check
was returned unpaid with the explanation that it was drawn on a closed account.
(A true and correct copy of the check is attached hereto as Exhibit C).
 
6. Upon learning
that the Horizon check had bounced, Horizon Counsel Alis Moon was contacted and
advised Plaintiff's counsel that she would look into the matter. Subsequently,
Ms. Moon represented that she was no longer representing Horizon. Plaintiff's counsel
received no substitution of counsel and so did not contact Horizon directly. 
 
7. On April 11,
2023, this court held a hearing for Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal
(Settlement). Defendant nor their counsel appeared. Accordingly, the Court set
a hearing for Order to Show Cause Re: Sanctions of up to $250 Against Defendant
Horizon Personnel Services and Defendant's Attorney for Defendant's failure to
Appear on 4/11/23 to be held May 10, 2023. On May 10, 2023, both Plaintiff and
Defense counsel appeared and the failure to appear was discharged. Counsel was
ordered to meet and confer, forthwith, via telephone, video conference, or in
person, regarding the Horizon payment. The Court further indicated that it
would entertain Plaintiffs Motion to Enforce Settlement pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 664.6 should the parties fail to resolve the issue. 
 
8. On May 17,
2023, Plaintiff's counsel Raphael B. Hedwat and Defendant's counsel Tara
Mohseni telephonically met and conferred as per this Court's Order regarding
payment of the settlement. Ms. Mohseni stated that she had no recent contact
with her client and that there is no reason Plaintiff should expect a
settlement check from her client. Accordingly, Plaintiff is forced to file this
Motion to Enforce Settlement pursuant to section 18 of the Agreement.
 
(Hedwat Decl. ¶¶3-8.)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff’s
counsel submitted a declaration along with Exhibits A, B, and C. 
 
Exhibit A is the Confidential Settlement
Agreement between Plaintiff, Horizon, and Greencastle. This Settlement
Agreement appears to be signed by Plaintiff, Horizon, and Greencastle. Section
18 of the signed Settlement Agreement states that “…The parties agree that the
Court retains jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement pursuant to California
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.” (Ex. A. §18.) 
 
Section 1 of the Settlement Agreement
mentions the amount of the payments to be made. Here, Plaintiff argues it is
owed $20,536.65 from Horizon. Plaintiff states this amount is based on $20,475
according to the settlement agreement plus $61.65 as an award of costs. Section
1 states that Horizon agrees to pay Plaintiff $2,800, $11,200, and $6,475.
These three numbers appear to total $20,475.00.
 
Section 2 of the Settlement Agreement mentions
the timing of the settlement and Plaintiff’s counsel states all conditions to
payment as per the Agreement were satisfied December 28, 2022. (Hedwat Decl.
¶5.)
 
Counsel states that Plaintiff received a
check from Horizon on February 3, 2023, but he received notice that the Horizon
check was returned unpaid with the explanation that it was drawn on a closed
account. (Hedwat Decl. ¶5.) Further, counsel states that Horizon’s counsel,
Alis Moon, stated she would look into the matter and that subsequently Ms. Moon
stated she was no longer representing Horizon. (Hedwat Decl. ¶6.) Counsel stated
that no substitution of counsel was received, so he did not contract Horizon
directly. (Hedwat Decl. ¶6.)
 
Counsel also stated that on May 17, 2023,
he spoke with Tara Mohseni about the payment of the settlement, but Mohseni
stated that she had no recent contact with her client and that there is no
reason Plaintiff should expect a settlement check from her client. (Hedwat
Decl. ¶8.)
 
Here, since Movant has appeared to comply
with CCP § 664.6, and because there is no opposition, the Court’s inclination
is to GRANT the instant motion. 
 
However, at the hearing, movant is to demonstrate
proper proof of service of the instant motion on Defendant, Horizon. 
 
Further, while the Court understands how
Plaintiff arrived at requesting $20,475 based on the Settlement Agreement,
Plaintiff did not explain how it is entitled to $61.65 in costs; therefore,
Plaintiff is to explain how it is entitled to costs.
 
Finally, the Court will have questions as
noted above regarding party Joel Romero’s role in this case, if any.
