The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant Pasadena Hospital Association, LTD's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Patrisia Luna, had alleged medical negligence and negligent hiring, training, supervision, and retention against the defendants. However, the defendant PHA argued that it owed no duty to the plaintiff and had no role or duty with regard to the operative event in this case. The plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, and the court has determined that PHA has met its burden of proof. The court is inclined to grant the motion for summary judgment, as the plaintiff has waived any objections to the motion being granted by failing to raise any issues in the trial court. The court notes that the plaintiff's failure to oppose the motion leaves the court without any way to know if there is a dispute of material fact. The tentative ruling is subject to change after the hearing, but it appears that the defendant PHA has successfully argued that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

  - The Court is inclined to conclude that the Plaintiff has waived any objections to the motion being granted due to the Plaintiff's failure to file an Opposition.

The tentative ruling by the Judge indicates that the Pasadena Hospital Association, LTD (PHA) is entitled to summary judgment in its favor on the Complaint. The Judge has found that there is no triable issue of material fact that PHA was negligent or that it caused or contributed to any injury claimed by Patrisia Luna. The Judge has also noted that Patrisia Luna has failed to oppose the motion for summary judgment, which may indicate that she is unable to make a showing of a substantial and meritorious defense. The Judge has further noted that a party who fails to raise an issue in the trial court has waived the right to do so on appeal.
