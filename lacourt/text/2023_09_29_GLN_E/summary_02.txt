And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is tentatively ruling in favor of defendant Pasadena Hospital Association, LTD (PHA) and granting its motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Patrisia Luna, has failed to oppose the motion. PHA argues that it had no duty to the plaintiff and no act or omission by it caused or contributed to the alleged injury. The judge finds that PHA has met its initial burden in showing that it had no duty to the plaintiff and no causation. The plaintiff has not presented any evidence to dispute these facts. As a result, the judge is inclined to grant the motion for summary judgment, finding that there are no triable issues of fact and that PHA is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
