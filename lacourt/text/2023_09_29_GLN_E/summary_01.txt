Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties, but with certain conditions. The court finds that the parties signed a settlement agreement and release, and that Horizon's check bounced due to being drawn on a closed account. The court also notes that Horizon's counsel, Alis Moon, stated she would look into the matter but later stated she was no longer representing Horizon. The court orders plaintiff to demonstrate proper proof of service of the instant motion on the defendant and to explain how it is entitled to $61.65 in costs. Additionally, the court will have questions regarding party Joel Romero's role in this case, if any, at the hearing.
