**Case Information**

* Case Number: 22GDCV00586
* Hearing Date: September 29, 2023
* Department: E
* Relating to: Motion to Consolidate Unlawful Detainer Case #23GDCV01538 with Lead Case #22GDCV00586

**Parties**

* Moving Party: Plaintiffs CJ Prime Investment, LLC; AA Premium, LLC; TM Prime, Inc.; Marvin C. Hur; Connie Kim Hur; Jonathan Hur; and Jennifer Hur
* Responding Party: Defendants Loma Vista Investment LLC (Loma Vista) and Albert Ahdoot (Ahdoot)

**Relief Requested**

* The Plaintiffs request that the Court consolidate the Unlawful Detainer case #23GDCV01538 with the lead case #22GDCV00586.

**Facts**

* The lead case #22GDCV00586 was filed on November 29, 2022, and alleges five causes of action against Loma Vista Investment LLC and Albert Ahdoot.
* The Unlawful Detainer case #23GDCV01538 was filed on July 20, 2023, and alleges that CJ Prime, AA Premium, TM Prime, Marvin C. Hur, Connie Kim Hur, Jonathan Hur, and Jennifer Hur are wrongfully in possession of the subject property.

**Analysis**

* The Court finds that the two cases involve common questions of law and fact and that consolidation is appropriate to promote judicial economy and avoid inconsistent adjudications.
* The Court notes that the issue of title would arise in the Unlawful Detainer case and that the parties have a common interest in resolving this issue.
* The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs' errors in failing to comply with some of the procedural aspects of the California Rules of Court to be minor and that denying the motion on those grounds would be focusing on form over substance.

**Substantive Analysis**

* The Court does not find the Defendants' arguments that the motion to consolidate should be denied based on the lack of standing, the tender rule, bankruptcy, and estoppel to be persuasive.
* The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits and that consolidation is appropriate to promote judicial economy and avoid inconsistent adjudications.

**Ruling**

* The Court grants the Plaintiffs' motion to consolidate the Unlawful Detainer case #23GDCV01538 with the lead case #22GDCV00586.
* The Court orders that the lower numbered case #22GDCV00586 shall be the lead case.
* The Court notes that the parties are expected to address the issue of the bond at the hearing.
* The Court also notes that Under the Los Angeles County Court Rules, rule 3.3(g), all future papers to be filed in the consolidated case must be filed only in the case designated as the lead case.
