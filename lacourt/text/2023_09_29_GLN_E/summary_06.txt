  * Defendant's demurrer is unclear and the Court will not attempt to decipher what conduct in the general allegations is time-barred as to every cause of action.
  * The Court finds that the statute of limitations for negligence does not apply to the entire complaint, and even if some of the allegations in the General Allegations are time-barred, it does not establish that an entire cause of action is time-barred.
  * Defendant's argument that the receiver is an indispensable party is unclear and the Court requests that both parties address this issue at the hearing.
  * The Court's tentative ruling is to OVERRULE the demurrer.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, William Lee. The defendant argues that the statute of limitations for negligence bars the second amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Cameron Stallones and Erica Ryan Stallones. The judge finds that the statute of limitations for negligence does not apply to the entire complaint and that even if some of the allegations in the General Allegations are time-barred, it does not establish that an entire cause of action is time-barred. The judge also notes that the defendant's demurrer is unclear and that the Court will not attempt to decipher what conduct in the general allegations is time-barred as to every cause of action.

Additionally, the defendant argues that the receiver, Eric P. Beatty, is an indispensable party and that the plaintiffs failed to join him as a defendant. The judge requests that both parties address this issue at the hearing and notes that the Court's tentative ruling is to OVERRULE the demurrer.
