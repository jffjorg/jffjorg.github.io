Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23GDCV00389
* Hearing Date: September 29, 2023
* Department: E
* Trial Date: January 21, 2025
* Case Name: Gary Bunkofske vs. Yvette J. Kelley

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Gary Bunkofske
* Defendant: Yvette J. Kelley
* Pro Se Defendant: Yes

**Relief Requested**

* Motion 1: Compel Further Responses to RFP, Set One (Numbers 33-44)
* Motion 2: Compel Further Responses to SROG, Set One (Numbers 81-94)

**Facts**

* The case involves a dispute over a ring and a condominium in Rosarita Beach, Mexico, which was allegedly purchased by Bunkofske during the parties' engagement.
* Kelley has refused to respond to Bunkofske's requests for further information, citing lack of relevance and protected privacy rights.

**Legal Standard**

* CCP ยง 2017.010: Any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.
* CCP ยง 2031.310: A party demanding a document inspection may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete, a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.

**Tentative Ruling**

* Motion 1: Denied. Bunkofske has not demonstrated good cause for the discovery requested, as the requests pertain to a property in Mexico that is the subject of a separate dispute in Mexico.
* Motion 2: Denied. Bunkofske has not demonstrated good cause for the discovery requested, as the requests pertain to matters that are not relevant to the instant action.

**Sanctions**

* No sanctions granted, as neither party requested sanctions.

**Key Points**

* The Court has liberally applied the discovery rules in favor of discovery.
* Relevance in discovery is broader than relevance at trial.
* The Court has resolved doubts in favor of permitting discovery.
* The parties are entitled to substantial leeway in defining what evidence will be relevant at trial.
