**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling to deny the plaintiff's (John Fralish) motion to compel arbitration. 

**Background:**

John Fralish alleges that Dine Brands Global, Inc. (Respondent) failed to honor an arbitration agreement after sending him unsolicited telephonic solicitations. Although Fralish initiated a petition to compel arbitration, both parties have since agreed that Respondent has paid the required arbitration fees.

**Legal Issues:**

The primary legal issue centers on whether Respondent's initial delay in paying the arbitration fees constitutes a material breach of the agreement. The judge acknowledges that this breach occurred but is hesitant to award all attorney's fees requested by Fralish for the entire arbitration process. The judge points to a clause in the Terms of Use/Arbitration Agreement stating that the arbitrator, not the court, should decide on attorney's fees in the arbitration.

**Tentative Ruling:**

The judge tentatively rules to deny the motion to compel arbitration as moot due to the parties' agreement on the arbitration fees. However, the judge will still address the issue of attorney's fees and costs at the hearing. The judge is inclined to award some fees related to Fralish's petition but remains uncertain about awarding all attorney's fees for the entire arbitration process.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration in the case of John Fralish v. Dine Brands Global, Inc. The judge finds that the petition to compel arbitration should be denied as moot because the parties have already begun the arbitration process and have paid the required fees. The judge notes that the parties' written agreement calls for arbitration of the dispute and that Respondent has failed to arbitrate the dispute and failed to pay the fees and costs necessary for the arbitration to proceed.

The judge also finds that Respondent has committed a material breach of the arbitration agreement by failing to pay the fees and costs in a timely manner. The judge is inclined to award at least some attorney's fees and costs for the filing of this petition based on the sanctions portion of CCP §1281.99(a).

The judge will hear argument at the hearing as to the proper amount of fees and costs that should be awarded. The judge notes that the parties' agreement allows for the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs to a claimant who prevails against Dine Brands, but the judge is uncertain about awarding fees and costs for the entire arbitration. The judge will likely order at least some fees and costs related to this petition based on CCP §1281.97(a) and 1281.99(a).

## English-text Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case where John Fralish is trying to force Dine Brands Global, Inc. to participate in an arbitration process. 

The judge initially determined that arbitration was appropriate because Fralish and Dine Brands had a valid agreement to arbitrate disputes. However, the judge later found the case moot because both parties confirmed they were now proceeding with arbitration.

The judge still needs to decide how much, if any, attorney's fees Fralish should be awarded.  Fralish is requesting fees for both filing the original motion to compel arbitration and for the entire arbitration process. The judge expressed some doubt about awarding fees for the entire arbitration, pointing to the specific language in the parties' agreement which allows for attorney's fees to be awarded by the arbitrator, not the court.  

A hearing will be held to determine the amount of attorney's fees to be awarded.

significant\_statements: [Petition to compel arbitration is moot, issues of sanctions and attorney's fees are not moot]

Summary:
The tentative ruling is to deny the petition to compel arbitration as moot, based on the information provided in the respondent's opposition. The parties have each appeared and paid the appropriate arbitration fees and are set to arbitrate the underlying matter if it does not settle. However, the issues of sanctions and attorney's fees are not moot. The petitioner has requested that the respondent pay the petitioner's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in the arbitration, and in connection with this petition. The petitioner appears to be basing its request for attorneys' fees and costs on CCP §1281.97(a), 1281.97(b), and 1281.99(a). The respondent has committed a material breach according to 1281.97(a) by not timely paying the fees required before the arbitration could proceed. The court is inclined to award at least some attorney's fees and costs for the filing of this petition based on the sanctions portion of 1281.99(a), but is uncertain about awarding other fees requested by the petitioner.
