[TENTATIVE RULING -
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES]
RELIEF REQUESTED


Plaintiff, Cheryl Ollison, (“Plaintiff”) moves
to compel Defendant Pasadena Huntington Hospital Association, LTD DBA Huntington
Hospital (“Defendant”), to serve responses, without objections, to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, under C.C.P. § 2030.290 and Request for Costs,
Sanctions, and Attorney’s Fees under C.C.P. §§ 2023.010 et seq. and 2030.290 et
seq. against Defendant and/or the Attorney of Record, Hester Law Group, APC.
 
Plaintiff will also seek sanctions,
reimbursement of costs and attorney's fees against Defendant and its counsel of
record, Hester Law Group, APC in the amount of $1,811.65 under Cal. Civ. Proc.
Code §§ 2023.010 et seq. and 2030.290.
 
The Defendant has failed to file an opposition
to this motion.
 
For the reasons set out below, the Court’s
tentative is to GRANT the motion.


BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff filed a form complaint on 08/05/2022
alleging two causes of action: (1) General Negligence and (2) Premises
Liability. This action pertains to injuries that Plaintiff allegedly suffered
at Huntington Hospital when Plaintiff was left alone after a knee surgery and
was injured when she fell getting dressed.
 
On 04/21/2023, this Court heard Defendant’s
demurrer to the Complaint and overruled the demurrer as to the first cause of
action and sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the second cause of
action.
 
In the moving papers, Plaintiff states that the
First Amended Complaint (FAC) was served on Defendant on May 11, 2023 and that
Defendant served its Answer to Plaintiff’s FAC on June 8, 2023.
 
The Court notes that an FAC has not been filed
with the Court. There is an Answer to the FAC filed with the Court on
06/08/2023, but no FAC has been filed.

LEGAL STANDARD –
COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30 days after service
of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are propounded shall
serve the original of the response to them on the propounding party, unless on
motion of the propounding party the court has shortened the time for response,
or unless on motion of the responding party the court has extended the time for
response. (CCP 2030.260(a).)
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (CCP §2030.290(b).)
“The party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §2030.290(a).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
As no Opposition was
submitted, Plaintiff simply needs to demonstrate proper proof of service for
the Court to grant this motion. Plaintiff’s proof of service alleges service by
electronic mail. On the proof of service, Plaintiff indicates it served
clh@hester-lawgroup.com and glgmail@hester-lawgroup.com; however, on eCourt,
Defendant’s counsel’s email address is listed as aab@hester-lawgroup.com. 
Plaintiff’s counsel
states that Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant on
June 21, 2023. (Elechyan Decl. ¶5.) Plaintiff granted Defendant several
extensions for Defendant to respond. (Elechyan Decl. ¶¶6-7.) As of the date of
filing the motion on 08/21/2023, Plaintiff’s counsel had still not received
responses. (Elechyan Decl. ¶8.)
If Plaintiff can demonstrate proof of service of the instant motion,
the Court is inclined to grant this motion and compel responses without
objection to Form Interrogatories, Set One, because Defendant has failed to
timely provide responses.

Sanctions

CCP
§2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§2030.290(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Here, Plaintiff requests sanctions be awarded to
Plaintiff and against Defendant and/or its attorney of record, Hester Law
Group, APC in the amount of $1,811.65. Plaintiff’s counsel requests sanctions
based on: (1) An hourly rate of $350.00; (2) Filing fee of $61.65; (3) 2.5
hours to prepare this motion; (4) 0.30 for anticipated review of Defendant’s
Opposition; (5) 1.0 for preparation of Plaintiff’s Reply; and (6) 1.0 for Court
Appearance.
The Court will take up the issue of sanctions at the
hearing.
