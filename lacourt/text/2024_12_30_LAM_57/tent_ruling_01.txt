  Case Number:  20STCV34041    Hearing Date:   December 30, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is granting the ex parte application of Defendant Joseph Ruffalo to continue the trial, which is currently set for February 5, 2025.  The Court is taking this step because, as explained in the ex parte application,  Ruffalo has recently  retained new counsel after having been self-represented for several months.  In the Court's view, Ruffalo's new counsel needs time to get up to speed in this very difficult and contentious case and thus a continuance of the trial is warranted.  The new date for the trial is May 5, 2025 at 9:30 a.m.  The new date for the final status conference is April 25, 2025 at 9:00 a.m.  The current dates for the trial and the final status conference are vacated.  The discovery and motion deadlines are not extended, except for the motions that already have been filed and that could not have been timely heard under the existing deadlines. The ex parte application of Defendant Patricia Gucci to advance the January 28, 2025 hearing date on her motion to compel a mental examination of Plaintiff Alexandra Zarini is denied.  The ex parte application was based on the deadline imposed by the former trial date of February 5, 2025.  The ex parte application of Zarini to compel the deposition of Gucci on January 20, 2025 is granted.  The Court is declining Zarini's request in this ex parte application for the appointment of a deposition referee for the deposition of Gucci and all subsequent depositions.   Zarini's ex parte application also sought to advance the hearing date on her motion to compel the deposition of Ruffalo, which is currently set for April 7, 2025.  The Court is granting that request.  The motion to compel Ruffalo's deposition will be heard on January 28, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.  The Court anticipates that, with new counsel on board for Ruffalo, the need for the motion to compel Ruffalo's deposition will wane and the motion can be withdrawn.The Court will advance to today and hear Zarini's ex parte application set for December 31, 2024 to seal the ex parte application to compel Gucci's deposition.
