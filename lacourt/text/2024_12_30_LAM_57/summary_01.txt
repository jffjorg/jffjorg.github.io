The new trial date is set for May 5, 2025 at 9:30 a.m. The judge is also granting the ex parte application of Plaintiff Alexandra Zarini to compel the deposition of Defendant Patricia Gucci, but is denying Zarini's request to advance the hearing date on her motion to compel a mental examination of Zarini. The judge is granting Zarini's request to advance the hearing date on her motion to compel the deposition of Ruffalo, which is now set for January 28, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
