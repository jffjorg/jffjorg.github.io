And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action on behalf of Minor Claimant Jane JE Doe. The Minor Claimant, through her guardian ad litem Jane BE Doe, settled with Defendant Lancaster School District for a total amount of $75,000. The court finds that the settlement is fair and reasonable, and that the requested attorney's fees of $18,475.62 are reasonable, constituting 25% of the gross settlement amount. The court also finds that the proposed use of the net proceeds, including deposit into blocked accounts on behalf of the minor claimant, is reasonable. Therefore, the petition to approve the compromise is granted.
