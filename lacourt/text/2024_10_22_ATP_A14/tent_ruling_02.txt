Analysis
 
Standard for Approving Minor’s Compromises
– Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim or that of
a person lacking the capacity to make decisions.  (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.)
 
“[T]he protective role the court
generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a role to assure that
whatever is done is in the minor’s best interests . . . .  [I]ts primary concern is whether the
compromise is sufficient to provide for the minor’s injuries, care and
treatment.”  (Goldberg v. Superior Court (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.)  
 
A petition for court approval of
a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 372
must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952.  The petition must be verified by the
petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any
bearing upon the reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  The person compromising the claim on behalf
of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must
attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless the court for good cause
dispenses with their personal appearance. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).)
 
An order for deposit of funds of
a minor or person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the
withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953
and 7.954.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)
 
-----
 
The petition shows that Minor Claimant settled with Defendant for a total
amount of $75,000. $0.00 will be used to pay medical expenses, $18,475.62 will
be used to pay attorney’s fees, and $6,524.38 will be used to pay non-medical
expenses, leaving a balance of $50,000.00 for Minor Claimant. Petitioner
proposes the net proceeds be deposited into blocked accounts on behalf of the
minor claimants.
 
The Court finds the settlement to be fair and reasonable.  The Court also finds the requested attorney’s
fees, which constitute 25% of the gross settlement amount to be reasonable.
 
Conclusion
 
The petition to approve compromise of pending action
on behalf of Minor Claiamnt Jane JE Doe is GRANTED.
