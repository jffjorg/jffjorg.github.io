Legal Standard
 
Standard for Summary Judgment – The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co.¿(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Cal. Code Civ. Proc.¿§437c(c)
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to¿any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)¿ “The function of the pleadings in a motion for
summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”¿ (Juge¿v. County of
Sacramento¿(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67 (“Juge”), citing¿FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima¿(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
381-382.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint,
the party moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.
(Cal.¿Code Civ.¿Proc.¿§437c(p)(2);¿Scalf¿v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc.¿(2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v.¿Paetkau¿(1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)¿¿¿¿¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – The
causes of action brought against Hermes are: (1) Second Cause of Action
(Negligent Hiring/Retention/Supervision); and (2) Third Cause of Action
(Vicarious Liability).
 
The gravamen of Hermes’ moving
arguments is that Butts is not an employee of Hermes, but LAMC. That is, the
alleged incident occurred when Butts was in the course and scope of his
employment with LAMC and, as such, there can be no liability placed on Hermes. 
 
Hermes relies on the following
evidence to show that Butts was LAMC’s employee: Exhibit "2" - Trip
Computer Printout, Yuldashev’s declaration at paragraphs four through six, and eight
through nine, and Edward J. Morales (“Morales”)’ declaration at paragraph 8.
(See Hermes’ Separate Statement at No. 1.) 
 
Exhibit 2 shows order information
for a LAMC job on November 15, 2020. It details the number of trucks, price,
customer information, gas fees, distances, and other pertinent information for
the order. It does not detail Hermes’ employees or the driver. Exhibit 2 is
inapposite as it does not provide any information on Butts’ employment.  
 
Yuldashev’s declaration describes
his ownership in both Hermes and LAMC, details the business information of both
Hermes and LAMC, states that Hermes was not involved, and presents that Butts
and Plaintiffs were employees of LAMC. (See Decl. Yuldashev, ¶¶ 4-6, 8-9.)
Yuldashev’s declaration is signed under the penalty of perjury under the laws
of the State of California. 
 
Morales is counsel of record for
Hermes. He declares at paragraph eight that Butts was employed by LAMC and this
fact is established by Yuldashev’s declaration. 
 
Yuldashev’s declaration is
sufficient to meet Hermes’ initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a
defense as both causes of action directed against Hermes requires an
employer-employee or agent-principal relationship. (See Perez v. Van
Groningen & Sons (1986) 41 Cal.3d 962, 967-970; Roman Catholic
Bishop v. Superior Court (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1556, 1564–1565; Doe v.
Capital Cities (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1054; Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo
Newhall Memorial Hospital (1995) 12 Cal.4th 291, 296-297.)  The burden shifts to Plaintiffs.
 
Plaintiffs present that Yuldashev
owns, manages, and controls both Hermes and LAMC. Specifically, Yuldashev is
the Chief Financial Officer of LAMC and the sole shareholder, officer, and
director of Hermes. Plaintiffs present that the companies use their names
interchangeably. (See Plaintiffs’ UMF No. 28 [LAMC’s Special Interrogatory No.
21 response states that no one uses the Hermes name to do business, but both
Hermes and LAMC use the name Calstate Moving and Storage; U.S. Department of
Transportation (“DOT”) Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Licensing
and Insurance page shows that Hermes does business as Calstate Moving and
Storage; California’s Public Utility Commission details for LAMC show that the
carrier’s DBA is Hermes].) Plaintiffs also dispute Yuldashev’s presentation of
the business information provided (i.e., intra state v. interstate services);
however, this does not impact the analysis of Butts’ employment. Because of the
presented facts, Plaintiffs argue that Butts was under the direct control of
Yuldashev. Plaintiffs further argue that (1) Butts admitted that he was an
employee of Hermes in his Answer and it is a settled law that any statements in
plaintiff’s complaint that were not denied by defendant will be taken as true
for the purposes of the case; (2) Butts’ Application for Employment does not
distinguish an employer name (Plaintiffs’ UMF No. 20), (3) Yuldashev sought
liability coverage from Hermes’ liability insurer (Plaintiff’s UMF Nos. 31-32),
and (4) Yuldashev admitted that Butts was an employee of Hermes in his Reply to
Plaintiffs’ Opposition to the Demurrer. 
 
The Court notes that the argument
that Butts was under the direct control of Yuldashev is attached to a statement
that reads, “Now Defendant BUTTS deceitfully misrepresents that he was employed
by LAMC.” The Court clarifies that this is Hermes’ Motion for Summary Judgment
and Hermes’ arguments, not Butts’.
 
The Court also notes that the
legal standard in a demurrer is distinguished from a motion for summary
judgment. Yuldashev’s Reply, which was untimely and not considered by the
Court, followed the legal standard for a demurrer by admitting the truth of all
factual, material allegations; acknowledged Plaintiffs’ own pleadings which allege
that all defendants are alter-egos or successors of each other and were to be
treated as a single entity; and provided argument under that assumption. 
 
Regarding Butts’ Answer, Butts
has admitted all allegations within the Complaint from paragraphs 30 through
37. This includes the allegation that “PLAINTIFFS incorporate herein by
reference each and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as
though the same were set forth in full herein.” (See Complaint ¶ 30.) As such,
Butts has admitted that all defendants are alter-egos and/or successors of each
other. (See Owens v. White Memorial Hospital (1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 634, 641-42
[citing to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 462.].) 
 
As such, Plaintiffs have shown that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists (i.e., Butts’ employment based on Butts’ own admission; and
whether Hermes, LAMC, and Yuldashev are to be treated as one entity for the
purposes of the determination of Butts’ employment) as to the causes of action
brought against Hermes. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.

Reply
 
Hermes’ Reply states that Yuldashev’s
Reply to the Opposition to the Demurrer does state what Plaintiffs were
presenting; however, it directly quotes from Plaintiffs’ Opposition and, as
such, Yuldashev’s Reply was addressing Plaintiffs’ statements and there was no
agreement or stipulation between Butts and Plaintiffs as to the employer of
Butts. Next, Hermes presents that Plaintiffs have submitted an objectionable
supplementary declaration admitting their erroneous understanding of the matter
and Paragraphs 30 through 37 of the Complaint that Butts’ has admitted do not
contain any allegations other than negligence. Hermes argues that Plaintiff’s
evidence is based on a lack of evidence (i.e., application does not state name
of employer) and does not meet the standard, Plaintiffs cannot rely on their
own pleadings, and Butts’ Answer is not a judicial admission as Paragraphs 31
through 37 contain nothing relating to employment and Paragraph 30, which
incorporates Paragraphs One through 29, alleges only a belief that Butts was
employed by Hermes. Further, Hermes argues that the truth of the incorporation
of allegation in paragraphs One through 29 is not considered a waiver. 
 
The Court believes that it has
addressed a majority of Hermes’ Reply arguments in its analysis, ante.
As to whether Butts’ admission of Paragraph 30, which incorporates Paragraphs
One through 29, Hermes cites to the legal standard regarding waiver, but does
not provide an argument as to why “the truth of the incorporated allegations. .
.cannot be treated [as] a waiver of a proof of fact and the concession of its
truth in this motion.” (See Reply 6:4-5.) 

Accordingly, the Reply does not impact the Court’s analysis, ante, and
the Court’s opinion remains unchanged.

Conclusion
 
Defendant Hermes Moving and Storage’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED.
