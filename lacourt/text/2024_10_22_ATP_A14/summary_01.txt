Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Hermes Moving and Storage, has moved for summary judgment on causes of action one and two, alleging negligent hiring/retention/supervision and vicarious liability, respectively. The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Butts was an employee of Hermes. The court notes that Yuldashev, the owner and manager of LAMC and Hermes, has presented evidence that Butts was an employee of LAMC, but Plaintiffs have presented evidence that Butts was under the direct control of Yuldashev and that Yuldashev admitted that Butts was an employee of Hermes in his reply to the opposition to the demurrer. The court also notes that Butts has admitted all allegations in the complaint, including the allegation that all defendants are alter-egos or successors of each other. Therefore, the court denies the motion for summary judgment.
