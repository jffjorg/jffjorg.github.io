Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of California Credits Group, LLC (Plaintiff) vs. Foster Poultry Farms, LLC, et al. (Defendants). The Court grants the Defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff's CEO, John Simpson. The cross-complaint alleges that the Plaintiff has engaged in false advertising and a fraudulent scheme to cash out client's credits after a "reorganization". The Court also grants the Defendants' motion for leave to amend their answer to add facts, modify affirmative defenses, and make other minor amendments.

Additionally, the Court grants the Defendants' motion to seal certain records filed in connection with the Plaintiff's opposition to the Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The Court finds that the records contain private financial and proprietary information of the Defendants that would be detrimental to them if made public, and that the factors in CRC Rule 2.550(d) have been established, justifying the sealing of these records.

The hearing date for this matter is set for December 3, 2024, in Department 54.
