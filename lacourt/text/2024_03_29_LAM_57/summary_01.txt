Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling concerns two motions filed by Plaintiff Barry Shy against Defendant Pedram Mansouri. The first motion seeks an order compelling Mansouri to produce documents as agreed upon in his written responses to Shy's discovery requests. The second motion requests an order to compel Mansouri to complete his deposition, which was previously conducted but was not completed within the seven-hour limit. The Judge grants both motions and orders Mansouri to produce the requested documents and complete his deposition within 21 days. Additionally, the Judge awards Shy $4,800 in sanctions against Mansouri and his counsel for their lack of substantial justification in their positions on the two motions.
