And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff, US Hospital Personnel, Inc., d/b/a Hospital Stafflink Network, seeks to add a claim for breach of contract based on a third breached contract, add fraud allegations against defendant Horace Winchester, and add allegations regarding the three contracts that are the subject of this action. The court finds that it is in furtherance of justice to allow the plaintiff to amend its complaint, and that this amendment will not unduly prejudice the defendants. The court orders the plaintiff to file its second amended complaint within five days of the date of this order.
