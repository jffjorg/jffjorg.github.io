Significant Statements:
  - "The clock on a motion to compel begins to run once 'verified responses' or 'supplemental verified responses' are served." (Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 135)
  - "The insertion of the word 'verified' before the word 'responses' necessarily requires [courts] to exclude from the provision what it does not mention – unverified responses." (Ibid.)
  - "The court finds that the 45-day deadline begins only on the date of service of verified responses, such that Defendant's responses to the Requests for Production of Documents, which consisted of only objections and were not verified (and did not need to be verified (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.250)), did not begin the 45-day time limit by which Plaintiff was required to file the pending motion."
