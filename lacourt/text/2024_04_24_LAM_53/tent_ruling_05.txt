  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for leave to file second
  amended complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff US Hospital
Personnel, Inc., d/b/a Hospital Stafflink Network       
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff US Hospital Personnel, Inc., d/b/a Hospital Stafflink
Network (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order granting it leave to file a
Second Amended Complaint (1) to add a claim for breach of contract based on a
third breached contract, (2) to add fraud allegations against defendant Horace
Winchester, and (3) to add allegations regarding the three contracts that are
the subject of this action.  (Teperson
Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6, 7, 10.) 
“The
court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow
a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name
of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect….The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice
to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars….”  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿473,
subd. (a)(1).)  “This discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of
amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in
the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989)
213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.) 
The court
finds that (1) it is in furtherance of justice to allow Plaintiff to amend its
complaint to add the additional claim and allegations for breach of a third
contract and allegations of fraud against defendant Horace Winchester, and (2)
this amendment will not unduly prejudice the defendants that have been named
(but have not made a general appearance) in this action.  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1); Kittredge Sports Co., supra, 213 Cal.App.3d at p.
1047.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff US
Hospital Personnel, Inc., d/b/a Hospital Stafflink Network’s motion for leave
to file second amended complaint. 
            The court orders plaintiff US
Hospital Personnel, Inc., d/b/a Hospital Stafflink Network to file its Second
Amended Complaint, in the form attached to its motion for leave to file second
amended complaint as Exhibit A, no later than five days from the date of this
order.
            The court orders plaintiff US
Hospital Personnel, Inc., d/b/a Hospital Stafflink Network to give notice of
this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  April 24, 2024
