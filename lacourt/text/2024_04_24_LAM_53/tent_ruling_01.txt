this motion. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants defendant AVX
Design & Integration, Inc.’s request for judicial notice as to exhibit
1.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (c).) 
The court denies defendant AVX
Design & Integration, Inc.’s request for judicial notice as to exhibits
2-4.  (SHR St. Francis, LLC v. City
and County of San Francisco (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 622, 642 [denying request
for judicial notice of unpublished superior court decision]; Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 8.1115, subd. (a).) 
 
 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Ian Patterson (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1)
compelling defendant AVX Design and Integration, Inc. (“Defendant”) to provide
further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers
1-70, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in
the amount of $3,260.
The parties dispute, as a threshold issue, whether Plaintiff’s motion
was timely filed.  For the reasons set
forth below, the court finds that Plaintiff timely filed this motion.   
“Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service
of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or
before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the responding
party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a
further response to the demand.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
“[T]he time within which to make a motion to compel production of
documents is mandatory and jurisdictional . . . .”  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
Plaintiff served Defendant with his Requests for Production of
Documents on May 20, 2020.  (Benyamin
Decl., ¶ 2; Benyamin Decl., Ex. 1.) 
On June 22, 2020, two days before responses were due, Defendant filed a
motion to compel arbitration.  (Benyamin
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 5.)  On June 24, 2020,
while its motion to compel arbitration was pending, Defendant served
objection-only responses to the Requests for Production.  (Benyamin Decl., ¶ 6; Benyamin Decl.,
Ex. 2.)  The objections were signed by
Defendant’s attorney but were not verified. 
(Benyamin Decl., Ex. 2, p. 122.)  On
May 14, 2021, the court issued an order denying Defendant’s motion to compel
arbitration.  (May 14, 2021 Order, p. 10.)  Thereafter, on July 12,
2021, Defendant and defendants Focus Universal and Desheng Wang filed a “Notice
of Appeal” with the court, stating that they were appealing the court’s May 14,
2021 order.  The Court of Appeal affirmed the court’s order on January 19,
2023, and issued its remittitur on May 4, 2023.  (Jan. 19, 2023 Order, p.
2; May 4, 2023 Remittitur.)  Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s motion is
untimely because it was filed on February 6, 2024, i.e., more than 45 days
after its signed responses were served and the stay in this action was lifted.  The court disagrees. 
As set forth above, the 45-day deadline by which to file a motion to
compel further responses begins on the date of service “of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response,” or any other date as the
parties may have agreed in writing. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)  The court acknowledges that responses
containing only objections do not need to be verified (i.e., signed under oath)
and instead must only be signed by the responding party’s attorney.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.250, subds. (a)
[“The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed shall sign the response under oath unless the response contains
only objections”] [emphasis added], (c) [“The attorney for the responding party
shall sign any responses that contain an objection”].)  However, “the clock on a motion to compel
begins to run once ‘verified responses’ or ‘supplemental verified responses’
are served.”  (Golf & Tennis Pro
Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 135 [citing Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.300].) 
“Under the canon expression unius est exlusio alterius, the
insertion of the word ‘verified’ before the word ‘responses’ necessarily
requires [courts] to exclude from the provision what it does not mention – unverified
responses.”  (Ibid. [emphasis in
original].) 
Thus, the court finds that (1) pursuant to the plain language of the
statute and statutory interpretation, the 45-day deadline begins only on the
date of service of verified responses, such that (2) Defendant’s responses to
the Requests for Production of Documents, which consisted of only objections and
were not verified (and did not need to be verified (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.250)), did not begin the 45-day time limit by which Plaintiff was
required to file the pending motion.  (Golf
& Tennis Pro Shop, Inc., supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at p. 135; Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c); Benyamin Decl., Ex. 2.)  The court further finds that the statements
made in the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Bill Analysis do not support
Defendant’s position on this issue.  (RJN
Ex. 1, pp. 2-3.)  Moreover, the court
disagrees that finding that the 45-day period does not begin to run upon
service of unverified responses consisting of only objections would create “an
‘absurd result[.]’”  (Opp., pp. 5:26-6:2;
Golf, supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at p. 127 [putting aside “the
possibility of an ‘absurd result,’ as the trial court put it, if there is no
time limit on a motion to compel involving objections” for another day].)  Instead, the court believes that it would be
an “absurd result” if the service of unverified hybrid responses would not commence
the running of the 45-day statutory deadline, but that service of
objection-only, unverified responses would. 
(Golf, supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at p. 136 [finding that 45-day
clock on hybrid responses did not begin to run until responses were verified].)

The court therefore finds that Plaintiff’s motion is timely. 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 1-43, 46-67, and
69-70 because Defendant’s objections in its responses to those demands are
without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).)
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 44-45 because those
demands improperly require Defendant to provide information instead of
producing for inspection documents and other tangible things by specially
defining the term “HUMAN RESOURCES TRAINING” to require Defendant “to state
with particularity the actual education and information provided, the names,
addresses, and telephone numbers of all persons who provided such training, and
the titles of all publications and visual presentations used in any manner
during the training.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.030, subd. (c)(1); Pl. Sep. Statement, p. 11:2-6.)
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, number 68 because this
demand does not designate the documents to be inspected “by specifically
describing each individual item or by reasonably particularizing each category
of item.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.030, subd. (c)(1).) 
The court finds that the circumstances presented would make the
imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore denies (1) Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions against Defendant, and (2) Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Ian Patterson’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production
of documents as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.310, the court orders defendant AVX Design and Integration, Inc. (1)
to serve on plaintiff Ian Patterson further written responses to plaintiff Ian
Patterson’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 1-43, 46-67, and
69-70, that comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.210-2031.250, and
(2) to produce to plaintiff Ian Patterson all documents and things in defendant
AVX Design and Integration, Inc.’s possession, custody, or control which are
responsive to those requests within 20 days of the date of this order. 
            The court denies all requests for
monetary sanctions.
            The court orders plaintiff Ian
Patterson to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
