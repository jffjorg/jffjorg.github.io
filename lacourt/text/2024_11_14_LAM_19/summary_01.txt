And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Motion to Quash Service of Summons filed by Meta Platforms, Inc. (sued as Facebook, Inc.), which was brought on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to properly effectuate service on the defendant. The plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, which is considered a consent to the granting of the motion. The judge finds that the defendant has not previously appeared in the matter and that the proof of service of summons filed on April 9, 2024, asserts that service was effectuated on April 3, 2024, by way of personal service. However, the judge notes that the proof of service does not comply with the statutory requirements regarding service of process, as it was served on Nadra San, a contingent worker of Meta's global security team, who is not one of the enumerated individuals in Code of Civil Procedure section 416.10 that may be properly served with a copy of the summons and complaint. As a result, the judge grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to give notice.
