And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the petition to reinstate DS Medi Spa LLC, a business entity dissolved by Synan Johnson, the Plaintiff, and Diana Dolmayan, the Defendant. The Court finds that the dissolution was not the result of false statements or fraudulent activity. The Plaintiff had consented to the dissolution and even attached an email correspondence to support this claim. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to show that DS Medi Spa conducted business activities or maintained assets. The Judge notes that the legislative history of the statute (Government Code Section 12261) suggests that it was designed to prevent the Secretary of State from being misled by a business entity's termination document, but does not apply to this case where the Plaintiff was the party who initiated the dissolution. Finally, the Court rules that the Plaintiff is estopped from reinstating DS Medi Spa as she would be profiting from her own wrong.
