English-text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion of Sheldon Pinchuk, the judgment debtor, to require Moussa Faor, the judgment creditor, to file a satisfaction of judgment. The judge found that Pinchuk has not shown that the judgment has been paid in full, and that the check tendered by Pinchuk on December 28, 2023, remains uncashed. The judge also declined to adjudicate the matter of the proposed offset for rent owed during the pendency of the unlawful detainer action, stating that it is not relevant to the motion. The motion is denied without prejudice, and Pinchuk is ordered to give notice to Faor unless all parties waive notice.
