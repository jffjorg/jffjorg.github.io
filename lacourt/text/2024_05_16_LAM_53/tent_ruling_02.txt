[1] The
court notes that Defendant’s notice of motion states that it is made “on the
ground that [it] had no legal duty to protect Plaintiff” from emotional
distress.  (Notice of Mot., p.
2:7-10.)  As set forth in the court’s
ruling, a motion for summary adjudication may be proper if it “completely
disposes of . . . an issue of duty.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).) 
However, Defendant did not argue that its motion completely disposes of
an issue of duty or otherwise assert its intention to dispose of an issue of
duty.  For example, the notice of motion
does not state that it was moving for summary adjudication on an issue of duty,
but rather moved for summary adjudication “with respect to Plaintiff Turner’s
negligence causes of action arising from the alleged inappropriate comments
made by two security guards (contained in the Ninth Cause of Action).”  (Notice of Mot., p. 2:3-7.)  Similarly, Defendant’s separate
statement—which is required to separately identify the cause of action or issue
of duty that is the subject of the motion—states that it is made “in support of
its motion for summary adjudication with respect to Plaintiff Annette Turner’s
ninth cause of action for negligence.” 
(Sep. Statement, p. 2:1-3; Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1350, subd.
(d)(1)(A).)  Thus, the court does not
construe Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication to be moving on “an issue
of duty” within the meaning of section 437c, subdivision (f)(1).
