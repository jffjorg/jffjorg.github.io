Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court is considering a motion for summary adjudication filed by the defendant AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The plaintiff, Annette Turner, opposes the motion. The defendant argues that two of the three incidents alleged in the plaintiff's complaint do not support the plaintiff's cause of action for willful or negligent failure to exercise ordinary care of property in violation of Civil Code section 1714. The court finds that the defendant has not met its burden of showing that the plaintiff's cause of action has no merit. The court denies the defendant's motion for summary adjudication without prejudice. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
