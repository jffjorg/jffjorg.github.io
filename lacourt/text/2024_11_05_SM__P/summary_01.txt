And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the court will grant the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and enter judgment for $5,805 plus prejudgment interest from November 1, 2024, onwards. The plaintiff, Chan, sued the defendant, Shiflett, for breach of contract arising from unpaid rent. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 22, 2023, whereby the defendant would make monthly payments of $250 until December 1, 2025, totaling $6,250. However, the defendant failed to make payments, paying only $445 since December 22, 2023, leaving $5,805 unpaid. The plaintiff moves to enforce the settlement and obtain judgment for the unpaid amount plus prejudgment interest. The defendant has not opposed the motion. The ruling is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6(a), which allows the court to enter judgment on a settlement agreement if the parties stipulate to it in writing. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement, as stipulated in the agreement and section 664.6(a).
