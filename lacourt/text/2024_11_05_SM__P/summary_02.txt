And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on several pending motions in the case of Ferrazzi Greenlight, Inc. v. Whitfield.

FG has moved for attorney's fees for its anti-SLAPP motion, which was granted on July 15, 2024. FG has requested $43,984.50 for 56.4 hours of work by three partners, a senior associate, and a paralegal. The court has reduced the requested fees to $20,000.

Whitfield has moved to disqualify Gallo LLP from representing FG, alleging that Gallo provided legal advice to Whitfield while he was employed by FG. The court has denied the motion, finding that the evidence presented is not sufficient to establish a conflict of interest.

FG has demurred to Whitfield and Wakefield's cross-complaint, which was initially sustained without leave to amend as to the sixth COA. The court has granted leave to amend, and Whitfield and Wakefield have alleged new facts, including a separate statutory basis under Bus. & Prof. Code §16600.1 for failure to provide timely notice of voided noncompete clauses. The court has sustained FG's demurrer, finding that Whitfield and Wakefield have failed to allege monetary or property damages.

Whitfield and Wakefield have moved to strike certain allegations in FG's complaint, including allegations of injunctive relief. The court has granted the motion, finding that FG has failed to allege a basis to enjoin FG.

In summary, the court has denied Whitfield's motion to disqualify Gallo LLP, granted FG's motion for attorney's fees, sustained FG's demurrer, and granted Whitfield and Wakefield's motion to strike certain allegations in FG's complaint.
