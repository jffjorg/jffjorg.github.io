Ferrazzi Greenlight, Inc. v. Whitfield,
Case no. 24SMCV00144
Hearing date November 5, 2024
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Ferrazzi
Greenlight, Inc.’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees
Defendant Whitfield’s Motion to
Disqualify Counsel Gallo and Gallo LLP
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Ferrazzi Greenlight, Inc.’s Demurrer with Motion to Strike
Plaintiff/cross-defendant
Ferrazzi Greenlight, Inc. (“FG”) sues defendants/cross-complainants Whitfield
and Wakefield for wrongful use of confidential or proprietary information to
operate a competing business. 
FG’s
anti-SLAPP motion regarding defendants’ cause of action for unfair business
practices was granted on 7/15/2024. The court granted leave for the parties to
submit supplemental briefings on the attorney fees request.
FG
demurs to the sixth COA of Whitfield and Wakefield’s cross complaint and moves
to strike prayers for relief, attorney’s fees and references to damages.
Whitfield
moves to disqualify Gallo LLP, and counsel Ray Gallo and Mark Moore, from
representing plaintiff or cross-defendants.
Ferrazzi Greenlight, Inc.’s Motion
for Attorney’s Fees
The
court granted FG’s 3/18/24 anti-SLAPP motion. Min. Order 9/26/24. Whitfield and
Wakefield argued FG had not sufficiently described the work performed nor the
qualifications of counsel to justify the hourly rates claimed. Id. There
was no information about the experience of the attorneys who submitted bills,
precluding the court or counsel from making an informed decision regarding the
reasonableness and necessity of claimed fees. Id. The matter was continued
to allow FG to provide information regarding (1) the basis for the hourly rates
charged and (2) a breakdown of how many hours was spent on each task, and by
whom.
FG
requests $43,984.50 for 56.4 hours. Romeo is a partner with 30 years’
experience billing at $1,180/hour, Hecht is a partner with 14 years’ experience
billing $860/hour, Taylor is a partner with 28 years’ experience billing at $720/hour
and Molleck is an attorney with 8 years’ experience billing at $535/hour. Decl.
Romeo paras. 9-14. FG provided a breakdown of each attorney’s rate, task, hours
billed and experience. 
Whitfield
and Wakefield argue time billed by paralegal St. Pierre is non-billable
administrative work under Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635. The
time billed is described as “prepare examples of anti-SLAPP motions,” “draft
proof of service for anti-SLAPP motion” and “draft notice of motion for
anti-SLAPP motion.” These are unbillable administrative work, so are not
granted. 
Whitfield
and Wakefield argue FG has not substantiated the need to staff three partners
and an associate on the motion. They request the court reduce FG’s fees for
March 2024 by $2,961.50, including the $258 for St. Pierre’s work, and award no
more than $13,248.00. Whitfield and Wakefield request the fees for April 2024
be reduced by $214.00, and that this Court award no more than $7,200.00 for
April 2024. They request fees for May 2024 for Romeo to prepare for hearing be
reduced to $5,900.00 and the court award no fees for Taylor and Molleck for May
2024. Whitfield and Wakefield request total reductions of $17,636.5.
FG’s
requested $43,984.50 is unreasonable for 56.4 hours of work by three partners,
a senior associate and a paralegal; it is unnecessary and duplicative for this
anti-SLAPP that did not raise novel issues. The court reduces total hours awarded
to 40 at a reasonable hourly rate of $500/hour for all attorneys’ work. The
court awards no fees for St. Pierre’s administrative work. GRANTED as modified
to 40 hours x $500 = $20,000.
Ferrazzi Greenlight, Inc.’s
Demurrer with Motion to Strike
FG
demurred to Whitfield and Wakefield’s cross-complaint, which was initially
sustained without leave to amend as to the sixth COA. The court later granted
leave to amend after a request to assert a new basis for the claim. Whitfield
and Wakefield alleged new facts, including a separate statutory basis under
Bus. & Prof. Code §16600.1 for failure to provide timely notice of voided
noncompete clauses. 
Whitfield
and Wakefield’s request judicial notice pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §§452 and
453 of the legislative intent of SB699 is GRANTED.
“The
function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter
of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th
1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts,” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550, but plaintiff must allege essential facts “with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with the nature,
source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners
Ass’n., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.
To
have standing to bring a UCL cause of action, plaintiff must: “(1) establish a
loss or deprivation of money or property sufficient to qualify as injury in
fact, i.e., economic injury, and (2) show that economic injury was the result
of, i.e., caused by, the unfair business practice or false advertising that is
the gravamen of the claim.” Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51
Cal.4th 310, 322. FG argues Whitfield and Wakefield fail to allege lost money or
property as a result of FG’s alleged conduct, so lack standing. 
Whitfield
and Wakefield allege FG attempted to enforce a noncompete agreement (FAC, exhs.
B, C) and were damaged as a result. FAC para. 103. Whitfield and Wakefield
argue it is a reasonable inference that they suffered monetary or property
damages as required under Kwikset, supra. They do not allege they ceased
working while FG attempted to enforce the noncompete clause.
A
demurrer cannot be decided on inferences but on actual allegations. Whitfield
and Wakefield fail to allege monetary or property damages. General allegations
of damages lack the specificity to satisfy the pleading requirement. Whitfield
and Wakefield argue they alleged FG did not provide statutorily required notice
under Bus. & Prof. Code §16600.1. FAC para. 103. This does not absolve the failure
to allege monetary or property damages. The alleged failure to provide notice
goes to the causation analysis per Kwikset; it does not cure a missing
allegation. supra. The FAC alleges unidentified “statutory” and “actual”
damages, as well as “attorney’s fees.” FAC para. 103. These are not allegations
of monetary or property damages and are insufficient to establish standing for
a UCL claim. SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
Motion to Strike the Sixth COA
A
court may strike irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading
or all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. Cal. Code Civ.
Proc., § 436. “Irrelevant” matters include: allegations not essential to the
claim, allegations neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise
sufficient claim, or a demand for judgment requesting relief not supported by
the allegations of the complaint. Code Civ. Proc. §431.10(b). “In passing on
the correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a
pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context,
and assume their truth. In ruling on a motion to strike, courts do not read
allegations in isolation.” Clauson v. Superior Court (1988) 67
Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.
Whitfield
and Wakefield seek injunctive relief, compensatory damages, attorney’s fees and
statutory damages. FAC para. 103., prayer for relief para. 1. 
FG
moves to strike, arguing Whitfield and Wakefield seek relief unavailable under
the UCL claim for violation of Bus. & Prof. Code §16600.1(b)(1). Bank of
the West v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1266; Cel-Tech
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20
Cal.4th 163. FG argues that while injunctive relief is allowed under the UCL,
Whitfield and Wakefield failed to allege a basis to enjoin FG.
Whitfield
and Wakefield argue FG cites outdated case law, and Bus. & Prof. Code §16600.5
allows for compensatory damages. FG notes the court granted leave to amend the
sixth COA under a UCL theory of liability, and Bus. & Prof. Code §16600.5
falls outside the UCL claim alleged under Bus. & Prof. Code §16600.1.
A
claim under section §16600.1 cannot avail itself of remedies provided for
violation of section §16600.5. Further, the case law cited in support of the requested
relief addresses private causes of action under other statutes. Whitfield and
Wakefield fail to cite UCL cases supporting the contention that the UCL allows
for compensatory or statutory damages. There is no basis for statutory damages
under the UCL. Cel-Tech Communications, supra. 
Whitfield
and Wakefield argue they can seek compensatory damages under section §16600.5(e)(1).
That section allows for compensatory damages in an action brought under section
16600.5; it makes no such allowance for a UCL action brought under section 16600.1.
The
UCL does not permit recovery of attorney’s fees. Cel-Tech Communications,
supra; Bus. & Prof. Code, §17203; Zhang v. Superior Court
(2013) 47 Cal.4th 354, 371. Whitfield and Wakefield argue fees are permitted
under section 16600.5. But this case alleges violation of section 16600.1, not
16600.5.
FG
notes the FAC does not request injunctive relief with regards to Whitfield and
Wakefield themselves, who seek injunctive relief on the grounds FG failed to
provide notice regarding the enforceability of noncompete clauses. FG asserts
Whitfield and Wakefield received notice under section 16600.1, even if late, so
no grounds for injunction exist. The court concurs; injunctive relief cannot
issue when the action sought to be enjoined has already occurred. GRANTED as to
compensatory and statutory damages and attorney’s fees. The motion to strike injunctive
relief is MOOT.
Whitfield’s Motion to Disqualify
Counsel
Whitfield
moves to disqualify Gallo LLP and counsel, arguing he obtained legal advice
from Gallo while employed by FG. 
Evidentiary Objections
FG
objections to Whitfield declaration. Objections 1-9, 11, 13-14, 17-25 OVERRULED,
objections 10, 12, 15-16 SUSTAINED (hearsay). 
FG
objections to Gilchrest declaration. Objections 1-5 OVERRULED.
An
attorney’s former client may move to have the attorney disqualified from
representing an adverse party if there is a “substantial relationship” between
the subjects of the prior and the current relationships. City and County of
San Francisco v. Cobra Solutions, Inc. (2006) 38 Cal.4th 839, 847. If the
subject of the prior representation makes it “likely the attorney acquired
confidential information” that is relevant to the current representation, the
two representations are substantially related, and disqualification is proper. Id.
Whitfield
argues Gallo provided legal advice regarding making his employment contract
with FG AB5 complaint; this is the same contract FG is now suing Whitfield for
allegedly breaching. Decl. Whitfield para. 11. Whitfield argues this advice
constituted a substantial relationship between Gallo’s prior relationship with
Whitfield and Gallo’s current relationship with FG, as well as an
attorney-client relationship. 
FG
asserts Whitfield conferred with Gallo via telephone 1/17/20 for one to two
minutes. Decl. Gallo paras. 4-5. FG argues Gallo did not offer nor intend to
offer legal advice and was operating as legal counsel to FG. Additionally, Gallo
states Whitfield’s declaration is false. Decl. Gallo para. 2. Gallo states he
merely informed Whitfield what FG would be doing to legally comply with AB5 and
did not advise Whitfield on his personal situation. Decl. Gallo para. 6. Gallo
asserts he did not give Whitfield legal advice, did not represent Whitfield and
never received payment from Whitfield. Decl. Gallo para. 7. 
Though
Whitfield argues that Gallo provided legal advice (Decl. Whitfield paras. 11-14),
he fails to provide evidence demonstrating an attorney-client relationship was
created or that he received legal advice from Gallo. The burden is on the
moving party to establish evidence a conflict of interest. 
Absent
an attorney-client relationship, the only grounds to disqualify Gallo would be
if he acquired confidential information from Whitfield that would be prejudicial.
Whitfield argues he received legal advice from Gallo regarding contractual
language, which is now in dispute, hence prejudice. The language Whitfield
alleges was the subject of his discussion with Gallo was not included in the
contract at issue. Further, Whitfield fails to allege he provided Gallo with any
confidential information. Whitfield merely argues Gallo advised him, so he must
consent prior to Gallo’s representation of FG.
These
arguments are unavailing. To disqualify counsel is a significant step requiring
substantial justification and evidentiary support. To disqualify an entire
firm, noting said firm is the sole counsel, requires a high bar that has not
been met. Whitfield’s evidence is directly contradicted by FG. Absent compelling
evidence, the court cannot disqualify counsel and the firm. DENIED.
