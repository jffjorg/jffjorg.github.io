And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for summary judgment and oppositions filed by both parties. The court finds that Roberto D. Banuelos, Jr. is the sole owner of Revel Management Group, LLC, and that Hugo Villasenor is an independent contractor and not an employee. The court grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to all claims, including the employment claims. The court finds that the defendants have provided sufficient evidence to show that Banuelos is the sole owner of Revel and that Villasenor's claims fail as a matter of law. The court also finds that Villasenor's employment claims are not meritorious and that he was properly classified as an independent contractor.
