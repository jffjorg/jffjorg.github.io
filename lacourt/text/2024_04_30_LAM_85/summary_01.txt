**Case Summary**

The tentative ruling is a summary of the case between Jose E. Buscaron and the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (CUIAB). The case involves two separate appeals: a benefits disqualification case and an overpayment case. The plaintiff, Herrera, seeks a writ of mandate compelling the CUIAB to set aside its ruling affirming the decision of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and order the Employment Development Department (EDD) to schedule him for an in-person appointment.

**Facts**

1. Herrera was laid off from his job in February 2020 and applied for unemployment benefits.
2. He received his first EDD unemployment benefit disbursement on April 11, 2020.
3. In April 2021, Herrera contracted COVID-19 and claimed it caused delays in his appeal process.
4. Herrera's appeal was dismissed for being late, and he appealed the CUIAB's decision.
5. The ALJ found that Herrera had not shown good cause for his late appeal and failure to appear at the hearing.

**Procedural Issues**

1. Herrera failed to timely file his opening brief.
2. The court considered only the authorized briefs: the opening brief, opposition, and reply brief
