  Case Number:  23STCP01571    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
Jose E. Buscaron
Herrera v. California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, 23STCP01571

 
Tentative decision on petition
for writ of mandate:    denied




 
            
Petitioner Jose E. Buscaron Herrera (“Herrera”) seeks a writ
of mandate compelling Respondent California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board
(“CUIAB”)  to (1) set aside its ruling
affirming the decision of the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) and (2) order Real
Party-in-Interest Employment Development Department (“EDD”), to schedule him
for an in-person appointment. 
Additionally, Herrera asks the court to issue a cease-and-desist order
to prevent the EDD from continuing to garnish Herrera’s wages. 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, (and Herrera’s
April 22, 2024 Brief) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Herrera commenced this action on May 1, 2023, alleging a cause of action for
administrative mandamus. The Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
            On
February 17, 2020, Herrera, along with numerous other employees, was laid off
by his full-time employer, the Holiday Inn. 
Herrera was then directed to the employees’ union for assistance with
filing for unemployment.  Herrera is
mono-lingual and speaks Spanish only. 
            Herrera
provided the EDD with all required documentation and identification information
online.  On April 11, 2020, Herrera
received his first EDD unemployment benefit disbursement.  Herrera continually sought new employment
during this period. 
On June 4, 2020, Herrera was hired by J&A Maintenance as
a part-time technician to disinfect City offices.  Herrera continued to report his part-time
income to EDD through the weekly documentation required.  
Sometime after he commenced employment with J&A
Maintenance, EDD ceased sending Herrera benefit disbursements.  Shortly thereafter, Herrera received notice
that EDD was unable to verify Herrera’s identity.  Herrera responded online, telephoned, wrote
letters, and also emailed EDD in an attempt to verify his identity.  Herrera was unable to connect with any
live-person, neither telephonically nor through an in-person appointment.  
Subsequently, Herrera received notice that he was indebted
to EDD due to overpayment.  Herrera
received a brochure with the notice, informing him of his right to appeal.  Herrera sought to attend to the matter but, being
mono-lingual, Herrera was only able to proceed after connecting with
live-assistance. 
Herrera filed an appeal with the EDD and a telephonic
hearing was scheduled for January 28, 2022. 
Immediately preceding the hearing, Herrera contracted Covid-19.  Herrera mailed EDD his Urgent Care
documentation evidencing his Covid contraction and also called EDD to
reschedule.  Herrera continued to be
impacted with residual Covid symptoms and suffered from respiratory
ailments.  Herrera mailed medical
documentation to EDD a second time. 
Herrera then attended his rescheduled telephonic hearing
with the ALJ.  On August 30, 2022, the
ALJ dismissed Herrera’s appeal, reasoning that Herrera had not shown good cause
for his untimely appeal and for his failure to appear at his prior
hearing.  Herrera appealed the ALJ’s
decision to the CUIAB, which affirmed the ALJ’s decision. 
Herrera now seeks a writ of mandate ordering the CUIAB to
set aside its ruling affirming the ALJ’s decision and order EDD to schedule Herrera
for an in-person appointment in order to reevaluate Herrera’s
documentation.  Herrera also requests a cease-and-desist
order to required EDD to discontinue the garnishment of Herrera’s tax refund or
further income until the matter is properly adjudicated by this court.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On May 10, 2023 Herrera
filed the Petition. 
On June 27, 2023, CUIAB
filed a General Denial.
On September 21,
2023, EDD filed a General Denial. 
On January 22, 2024,
Herrera filed a Notice of Deficient Administrative Record.
 
            B.
Standard of Review
            CCP
section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision which structures the
procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by
administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  The
pertinent issues under section 1094.5 are (1) whether the respondent has
proceeded without jurisdiction, (2) whether there was a fair trial, and (3)
whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. CCP § 1094.5(b).  An abuse of discretion is established if the
respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
CCP §1094.5(c).




            CCP
section 1094.5 does not in its face specify which cases are subject to
independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (1999) 20
Cal.4th 805, 811.  In reviewing decisions
which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court exercises independent
judgment on the evidence.  Bixby v.
Pierno, (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.  See
CCP §1094.5(c).  The right to practice a
trade or profession is deemed to be a fundamental right requiring application
of the independent judgment test.  Golde
v. Fox, (1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 167, 173.
            Under
the independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  Id. at 143.  The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City
of Los Angeles CUIAB of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860,
868.  In short, the court substitutes its
judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when,
why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon
v. CUIAB of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.  However, “[i]n exercising its independent
judgment, a trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness
concerning the administrative findings, and the party challenging the
administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the
administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.”  Fukuda v. City of Angels, supra,
20 Cal.4th at 817.  Further, an agency is
presumed to have regularly performed its official duties.  Evid. Code §664.
            The
agency’s decision must be based on the evidence presented at the hearing.  CUIAB of Medical Quality Assurance v.
Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860, 862.  The hearing officer is only required to issue
findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine whether,
and upon what basis, to review the decision. Topanga, supra, 11
Cal.3d at 514-15.  Implicit in section
1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the
analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Topanga, 11 Cal.3d at 15.
            An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code
§664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden of proof to demonstrate
wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or showed
prejudicial abuse of discretion. Alford v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d
682, 691.
            
            C.
Governing Law



            An
unemployment insurance claimant may appeal any written decision by the EDD to
the Office of Appeals where their appeal will be heard by an ALJ.   22 CCR
§§ 5000-168.  If the appeal is untimely,
the ALJ shall order the appeal dismissed unless the claimant shows good cause
for the untimeliness.  22 CCR §5051.  Only if good cause is shown will the appeal
be decided on the merits.  Ibid.  
“Good cause” is not defined in the UIC, but it means at
minimum real circumstances, substantial reasons, objective conditions that
operate to produce correlative results or adequate excuses that bear the test
of reason.  California Portland Cement
Co. v. California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, (1960) 178
Cal.App.2d 263, 272-73.  The
term “good cause” is not susceptible of precise definition.  Zorrero v. Unemployment Insurance Appeals
Board, (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 434, 439. 
Its definition varies with the context in which it is used.  Id. 
Very broadly, it means a legally sufficient ground or reason for a
certain action.  Id.  “Good cause” is defined in the regulations
to mean a substantial reason under the circumstances, considering the diligence
of the proponent and any burden or prejudice to any person involved.   22 CCR §5000(ii).  “Good cause” includes, but is not limited to,
mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  Ibid.
If a
claimant fails to appear at the hearing on their unemployment benefits appeal,
the ALJ may dismiss the appeal.   22 CCR §5066.1(h).  An appeal dismissed for non-appearance may be
reopened if the appellant shows good cause for failing to appear at the
hearing.  22 CCR §5067(e).  
The unemployment insurance laws are remedial and must be
construed liberally where benefits are concerned.  Kelley, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th
at 1075.  A person is presumed to have
been discharged for reasons other than misconduct and not to have voluntarily
quit work without good cause, and the employer has the burden to prove to the
contrary.  Id. 
 
D. Statement of Facts[1]
1. Benefits Disqualification
Case (708821) 
On April 2, 2021, the EDD mailed
petitioner a notice finding Herrera ineligible for UI benefits because of
outstanding issues with his identity verification.  AR 4-5, 89, 235.  The EDD determined that Herrera was
disqualified from receiving benefits for failing to provide sufficient
information and documentation to establish his identity.  Id. 
EDD maintained it was unable to verify Herrera’s identity and process
his claim because the information provided at claim filing did not match the
information provided to verify him as claimant. 
AR 4-5, 89.  Thus, EDD deemed Herrera
ineligible for benefits per UIC section 1253(a), suspended the benefits as of
January 11, 2021, and retroactively designated the first affected week of
suspension as April 5, 2020.  AR 4-5,
120.  The notice informed Herrera that
his deadline to file an appeal was 30 days from the mailing of the notice, or
no later than May 3, 2021.  AR 4-5.  
Herrera did not file an appeal
until October 20, 2021.  AR 10-11,
12.  
 
2. Overpayment Case (7088213) 
On November 3, 2021, EDD mailed Herrera
another notice which notified Herrera of that he had received an overpayment.  AR 2-3. 
 Herrera was notified his benefits
were paid for a period in which he was disqualified under UIC section
1253(a).  AR 178.  EDD stated that, due to overpayment issued to
Herrera from April 11 to August 22, 2020, Herrera was liable to pay the EDD an
overpayment in the amount of $3,272 per UIC section 1375.  AR 178. 
The notice also advised Herrera to see “Notice of Determination Dated
April 2, 2021”.  
The notice specified that Herrera’s
deadline was to appeal was no later than December 3, 2021.  AR 179.  According to the CUIAB, Herrera timely
appealed on October 20, 2021.  AR 240.  (This appeal is not in the record unless the
CUIAB was relying on Herrera’s October 20 appeal from denial of benefits.  AR 10.
 
3. The January 28, 2022
Hearing
On January 15, 2022, the Office
of Appeals mailed Herrera notices for each of the benefits disqualification and
overpayment cases, informing him that EDD had scheduled a remote hearing on
January 28, 2022.  AR 36-40.  The issue to be considered for the 7088213 hearing
was whether or not the appeal was timely filed and if not, whether or not there
was good cause for delay.  AR 36. The
notice for the overpayment hearing was as follows: (1) Was the appeal timely
filed; and (2) Was the claimant overpaid benefits? If so, was any fault on the
part of the claimant? If not, would repayment cause an extraordinary financial
hardship?  AR 40, 235.  
Herrera failed to appear for the
scheduled January 28 hearing.  AR
235.  As a result, the ALJ dismissed Herrera’s
appeal and mailed Herrera a Notice of Dismissal for each case with a “date
mailed” stamp of February 1, 2022.  AR 244-47.
 
 
4. The April 2022 Hearing on Herrera’s
Application to Reopen Both Cases 
Herrera applied to re-open his appeals.  AR 30-31.  EDD scheduled a remote hearing on his
application to reopen both cases for April 19, 2022 before ALJ Brian Kim.  AR 30-31, 158.  The hearing was scheduled to address both the
(1) the benefits disqualification case due to Herrera’s failure to verify his
identification in accordance with the EDD (which was dismissed due to late
appeal) and (2) the overpayment case which was dismissed due to the January 28,
2021 missed hearing. AR 158, 160.
On April 18, 2022, Herrera
submitted a letter addressing (1) good cause why his appeal of the April 2,
2021 Notice of Disqualification of Benefits was five months late and (2) why he
missed the January 28, 2022 hearing.  AR
98.  Herrera also stated the October 20,
2021 appeal was late due to his contraction of COVID in April 2021 which caused
him to suffer residual and respiratory ailments.  AR 98. 

ALJ Kim set forth the issues:
 
“Today’s
hearing is an appeal of a determination which held the claimant not eligible
for benefits under code section 1253(a) and a notice of overpayment under code
section 1375.  The issues for today’s
hearing are as follows; (1) does the claim for benefits comply with
regulations; (2) was the client overpaid benefits; (3) if so, would repayment
cause an extraordinary financial or other hardship; (4) was the appeal timely
filed; (5) if not, is there good cause for any delay; and (6) was there good
cause for failure to appear at one or more hearings or for reopening a
dismissed appeal or petition?  AR 160. 
 
As ALJ Kim marked the exhibits,
he asked Herrera if he could confirm his receipt of the relevant documents in
the mail.  AR 161.   Herrera responded that he had not received
any such recent documentation.  AR
161.  When ALJ Kim asked Herrera if he
would like to either reschedule the hearing after receiving the exhibits via
mail or waive his right to receive and physically review the documents, Herrera
chose to reschedule.  AR 161-63. 
 
5. The June 27, 2022 Hearing
Sometime thereafter, Herrera’s hearing
for both cases was rescheduled to June 27, 2022.  AR 84, 90. 
Two separate notices of postponement were mailed to Herrera, one
corresponding to each case.  AR
83-86.  On June 3, 2022, EDD mailed Herrera
a Notice of Postponement, stating that the hearing for 718964 (overpayment case)
had to be postponed “due to circumstances beyond the control of this office.” AR
86.  EDD mailed a similar Notice of
Postponement for 718964 (benefits disqualification case).  AR 86. 
This notice was mailed on June 27, 2022. 
AR 86.  
 
6. The August 29, 2022 Hearing 
Herrera’s hearing to reopen both
cases was rescheduled to August 29, 2022 before ALJ Antoinette Morris by
telephone.  AR 43.  An interpreter for Herrera was present.  AR 45. 
ALJ Morris began by labeling the exhibits and Herrera asked questions about
them to confirm their dates. AR 48-49. 
On December 8, 2020, EDD
confirmed receipt of a picture of Herrera’s driver’s license and his social
security card.  AR 198.  Herrera had sent such documentation in
response to EDD’s request for further documentation to verify Herrera’s
identity.  AR 198.  Specifically, EDD alleged it was unable to
verify Herrera’s identity and process his claim because the information
provided at claim filing did not match the information provided to verify
claimant.  AR 4-5, 89.[2]  
 
a. Herrera’s Declaration
Herrera submitted the following
declaration dated August 29, 2022.  On
February 17, 2020, Herrera completed his last day of employment with
International Hotel Group (“Hotel Group”) because Herrera was involuntarily
discharged due to mass layoffs during the Covid Pandemic.  AR 213, Ex. A.   That same day, Herrera was advised by his
union to apply for unemployment benefits on the EDD portal.  Herrera applied and his first unemployment
insurance benefit was posted on April 5, 2020. 
AR 214, ¶1.  
On March 28, 2020, Herrera
received a Notice of Account Number from EDD and thereafter, EDD issued Herrera
a Bank of America debit card to receive his benefits.  AR 214, ¶2.  
On September 15, 2020, Herrera received Notice of his EDD benefits which
the EDD had set forth to expire on April 13, 2021.  AR 216, Ex. C. 
On April 15, 2020, Herrera
received EDD Stub #798760 which provided a benefit payment of $318 per week for
two weeks.  AR 216.  Additionally, EDD advised Herrera of a
$7,632.00 balance on the account.  AR
216, Ex. D. 
Herrera was then hired part-time
with J&J Maintenance, LLC (“J&J”) as a disinfectant technician and was
employed with J&J from June 4 until September 30, 2020.  AR 216, Ex. F.  Herrera reported all earnings from J&J
LLC on his EDD Benefit Form.  AR 216,
¶22. 
A CUIAB judge requested that he
provide identifying information to EDD. 
AR 216, ¶25.  Herrera asked the
judge for proof that he received an overpayment, which EDD has yet to
provide.  AR 216, ¶26.  It is EDD that owes Herrera unpaid
benefits.  AR 216, ¶27.
 
b. Other Evidence
On December 8, 2020, EDD confirmed
receipt of a picture of Herrera’s driver’s license and social security
card.  AR 198.  Herrera sent such documentation in response
to EDD’s request for further documentation to verify Herrera’s identity, as the
EDD had claimed grounds to question Herrera’s identity and documentation.  AR 198.   
Herrera made multiple attempts to send his documents, but the EDD portal
was experiencing processing errors due to the overwhelm of the Pandemic.  AR 98.  
Respondent EDD’s new identification verification system was experiencing
claim-processing overload and Herrera was one of many applicants whose
identifications remained unprocessed due to dysfunction of “ID.ME.”  Id. Herrera was also unable to get
through to anyone at EDD through telephone. 
Id.
On August 15, 2022, Herrera
provided an email which refers to a phone conversation between Herrera’s wife
and the CUIAB regarding whether he should subpoena documents from EDD or obtain
records via another method.  AR 55.  The email contains handwritten notes
indicating that the CUIAB attempted to follow up with Herrera but was unable to
reach him.  Id. 
 
c. The Hearing
At the August 29 hearing, ALJ Morris
asked Herrera why he was five months late in appealing EDD’s notice of
redetermination of benefits, Herrera responded that he had COVID.  AR 51. 
Herrera explained that he got COVID on April 4, 2021.  Id. 
ALJ asked Herrera when he recovered, and Herrera said he could not
remember.  AR 51.  ALJ Morris said she was trying to help him,
but she could not hear his case if she could not find good cause.  AR 51-52. 
Herrera said that “we will just…stop now and continue on another day
because I don’t remember.”  AR 52.  ALJ Morris stated that was not how it works.  If you file late or miss a hearing, he has to
have good cause.  AR 52.  If he does not remember, that is not good
cause and she could not rule in his favor. 
AR 52.  She asked Herrera twice
more why he was five months late in filing his appeal and Herrera said he did
not have the details.  Id.
 ALJ Morris then asked why Herrera missed the
first appeal hearing on January 28, 2022 to which Herrera responded that he
sent the reason why in the documents.  AR
52- 53.  She asked Herrera again why he
missed the hearing, and Herrera stated: “I had COVID”.  AR 53. 
ALJ Morris again asked “You had a hearing that was set for April 19 of
’22 and you missed it. Why did you miss the hearing?”  AR 52.  Herrera
responded: “Oh my God, again. You should have that documentation there.”[3]  AR 53. 
Herrera continued to reference the documents and ALJ Morris stated: “I’m
gonna go ahead and end your hearing. 
You’ll get a copy of the decision in the mail.  It seems that either you don’t want to
cooperate or you don’t understand my question regarding the good cause
explanation.”  AR 53-54.  
 
7. The ALJ’s Decisions
The ALJ found that Herrera had
not shown good cause for his late appeal and failure to appear at the January
28, 2022 hearing and issued a decision in each case denying Herrera’s application
to reopen his appeals.  AR 236-37, 258. 
For the benefits disqualification
case (718963), ALJ Morris found that Herrera was questioned repeatedly why he
delayed for five months in appealing.  AR
235.  He indicated that he contracted
COVID in April 2021, but was unwilling to offer further explanation, including
dates of incapacitation, recuperation time, or how his incapacitation impeded
his ability to timely appeal.  AR 235.[4]
Regarding the overpayment case
(7181964), ALJ Morris stated: “During the hearing, the claimant was questioned
about the missed hearing on January 28, 2022. 
He indicated that he contracted COVID in April 2021, but was unwilling
to offer further explanation, including dates of incapacitation, recuperation
time, or how his incapacitation impeded his ability to timely appeal.  AR 240.
 
8. Appeal to the CUIAB 
Herrera appealed the ALJ’s
decision to the CUIAB on or about September 12, 2022.  AR 248. 
The CUIAB consolidated the two appeals. 
AR 258.   
Herrera claimed that ALJ Morris had
been disrespectful and biased against him. 
AR 248.  Herrera alleged that ALJ
Morris berated him for documentation and addressed only one issue at the
hearing, denying him the ability to provide evidence on the merits of his
case.  AR 248.  He further alleged that EDD hid from him the
lateness of his appeal as an issue.  AR
248.  ALJ Morris did not give Plaintiff
opportunity to speak to the issues on both of his cases or address financial
hardship as good cause in reference to the overpayment case.  Id.
The CUAIB found that Herrera,
other than saying he had COVID, Herrera was non-responsive to the ALJ why he
was five months late in appealing and in missing the first hearing.  AR 259. 
Herrera provided no proof that he had COVID around the date of
redetermination.  Even if he did, that
does not explain why his appeal was five months late.  AR 259. 
He submitted proof of a positive test two weeks prior to the first
hearing, but without more testimony or other evidence that indicates he was
prevented from filing a timely appeal or appearing at the hearing, his reasons
are not good cause.  AR 259.
After reviewing the record, the CUIAB
determined that Herrera received a fair hearing and that the ALJ did not err in
denying his application to re-open his appeal. 
AR 259-60. 
 
            E. Analysis
Petitioner Herrera
contends that (1) EDD erred in discontinuing his unemployment benefits, he
followed verification instructions and provided all necessary information, and EDD
illegally placed a lien with the Franchise Tax Board, and (2) he did not
receive a fair hearing because the ALJ accepted “ghost declarations” from EDD
employees who never spoke with him, the CUIAB’s Presiding ALJ became an agent
for EDD by discouraging him from subpoenaing documents from EDD, and ALJ Morris
and the CUIAB did not focus on the reason for his appeal that EDD should have
processed his claim.
 
1. Procedural
Issues
a. The
Parties’ Briefs
On November 30, 2023, the Court held a trial setting
conference with both parties present in the courtroom. Herrera appeared in
pro per with the assistance of an interpreter.  Beres Decl., Ex. A.  During the trial setting conference, the court
set the trial for April 30, 2024 and ordered Herrera’s opening brief to be
filed and served no later than January 31, 2024, the CUIAB’s opposition to be
filed and served no later than March 13, 2024, and Herrera’s reply to be filed
and served no later than April 16, 2024. 

Herrera did not
timely file his opening brief on January 31, 2024.  
On February 26,
2024, CUIAB filed its opposition noting Herrera’s failure to file an opening
brief. 
On March 11, 2024,
Herrera untimely filed his opening brief.  Herrera begins the opening brief with the
statement: “This Brief may appear late due to California Governor’s State of
Emergency order during 2024 winter months due to storms, affecting and causing
major disruptions and delays in statewide processes and timelines.” Pet. Open.
Brief at 2.  Herrera may be referring to
the Governor’s State of Emergency orders in February of 2024 when it was
raining for a few days. This State of Emergency was limited to a few days and
should have had no impact on Herrera’s obligation to timely file his brief.  Nor does Herrera provide evidence of an
adverse impact from the rain.
On April 9, 2024,
Herrera filed “Herrera’s Reply Brief to Opposition.”
On April 15, 2024,
CUIAB filed a “Reply to Herrera’s Brief.” 

On April 22, 2024, CUIAB
lodged the Administrative Record, Trial Notebook, and Memory Stick.
Herrera filed
another brief titled “Herrera’s Final” on April 22, 2024 and an “Amended Final”
on April 25, 2024. 
The only briefs authorized
by statute and the court’s trial setting order are the opening, opposition, and
reply briefs.  The briefs that serve this
function are Herrera’s untimely March 11 opening brief, CUIAB’s April 15 “Reply”,
and Herrera’s April 25 Amended Final. 
The court has considered only these three briefs and refers to them as
“Pet. Op. Br.”, “Opp.” and “Reply”.[5]  
Although CUIAB argues
that the court should deny Herrera’s Petition on the ground that he failed to
timely file his opening brief (Opp. at 10-11), it has suffered no prejudice.  The court should address issues on their
merits, if possible, and will consider the late-filed brief.  Herrera’s failure to file a timely opening
brief is, however, reflective of ignoring deadlines, an issue that was before
the EDD and CUIAB.  See post.
 
b. Herrera’s
Opening Brief is Inadequate 
Petitioners
are obligated to lay out the evidence favorable to the other side and show why
it is lacking. The "[f]ailure to do so is fatal" to any substantial
evidence challenge and "is deemed a concession that the evidence supports
the findings."  Defend the Bay v.
City of Irvine, (2004) 11928 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1266.  The reviewing court should "not
independently review the record to make up for appellant's failure to carry his
burden."  Ibid.  
When
a petitioner challenges an administrative decision as unsupported by
substantial evidence in light of the record as a whole, it is the petitioner’s
burden to demonstrate that the administrative record does not contain
sufficient evidence to support the agency’s decision.  State Water Resources Control Board Cases,
(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 674, 749.  A
recitation of only the part of the evidence that supports the petitioner’s
position is not the “demonstration” contemplated by this rule.  Accordingly, if a petitioner contends that
some issue of fact is not sustained, he is required to set forth in his brief
all the material evidence on the point and note merely his own evidence.  Unless this is done, the error is deemed to
be waived.  Id. (quoting Foreman
& Clark Corp. v. Fallon, (1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 881).  
Despite
the court’s direction, Herrera’s opening brief mostly fails to cite evidence in
the record and completely fails to set forth all material evidence on the good
cause issues.  The CUIAB’s opposition
points this out.  Opp. at 11.   By itself, this failure is reason to deny Herrera’s
mandamus claim.
 
2.
Good Cause
Herrera
spends the bulk of his effort explaining why EDD erred in discontinuing his
benefits and seeking payment of an overpayment. 
Specifically, he contends that EDD
erred in discontinuing his unemployment benefits, he followed verification
instructions and provided all necessary information, and EDD illegally placed a
lien with the Franchise Tax Board.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 3-7, 9-10, 15.  
While
these were issues for his appeal before the ALJ, they are immaterial to the
CUIAB’s decision that he failed to show good cause to re-open the two appeals
and that he received a fair hearing.  As
the opposition argues, the good cause issue was a jurisdictional question that
the ALJ was required to decide before reaching the merits of Herrera’s
appeals.  Opp. at 12.  The ALJ decided the good cause issues against
Herrera, and the CUIAB upheld those decisions. 
The only issues for the court are whether Herrera has met his burden of
showing that the CUIAB erred.
For the benefits
disqualification case, Herrera was five months late in filing his appeal.  On
April 18, 2022, Herrera submitted a letter addressing good cause why his appeal
of the April 2, 2021 EDD decision was five months late.  AR 98. 
He stated that he was infected with COVID.  AR 98. 
He testified at the August 29 hearing that he got COVID on April 4,
2021.  AR 51.  ALJ asked Herrera when he recovered, and
Herrera said he could not remember.  AR
51.  Obviously, his contraction of COVID
in April does not explain why he waited until October 20, 2021 to appeal.  AR 10-11, 12. 
The CUIAB and ALJ correctly found that he had not shown good cause to
re-open the appeal after dismissal.
For the overpayment case, Herrera’s
letter explained that he also was infected with COVID in January 2022 and that
he moved to a different county, resulting in a five-day delay in delivery of
letters.  AR 98.  Hhis January 31, 2022 letter attached a January
12, 2022 positive COVID test result.  AR
110.  Herrera testified that he missed
the appeal hearing on January 28, 2022 and Herrera stated: “I had COVID”.  AR 53. 
ALJ Morris again asked “You had a hearing that was set for April 19 of
’22 and you missed it. Why did you miss the hearing?”  AR 52. 
Herrera responded: “Oh my God, again. You should have that documentation
there.”[6]  AR 53.
This evidence also was inadequate
to establish good cause.  Without more,
the fact that Herrera tested positive for COVID on January 12, 2022 is
insufficient to explain why he did not appear two weeks later on January 28 as
he provided no evidence that he had not recovered by January 28.  As for his forwarded mail, the notice of the
January 28 hearing was sent to Herrera on January 15, 2022.  AR 36-40. 
He had a duty to inform the ALJ if he moved to a new address and any fault
for a delay in receiving this notice was his own.  Additionally, his evidence shows a five-to-seven
day delay in forwarding his mail.  The notice
mailed to his old address on January 15 and forwarded to his new address should
have reached him no later than January 27 (five days for mailing plus seven
days for forwarding delay).  This was one
day before the January 28 hearing.  Herrera
provided no explanation when he actually received the notice.  The CUIAB was correct to conclude that Herrera
had not shown good cause for failing to appear on January 28, 2022.  AR 259.
 
3. Fair Hearing
Due process does not require a perfectly impartial hearing
officer, only a “reasonably impartial, noninvolved reviewer.”  Linney v. Turpen, (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th
763, 770.  The issue of personal or
political bias focuses on the actual adjudicator, and whether that person is
capable of judging a particular controversy “fairly on the basis of its own
circumstances.  Brown v. City of Los
Angeles, (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 155, 178.  This type of bias cannot be implied and must
be clearly established.  Id.  Adjudicators challenged for reasons other
than financial interest are afforded a presumption of impartiality.  Withrow v. Larkin, (1975) 421 U.S. 35,
47.  A party claiming that a
decision-maker was biased must show actual bias rather than an appearance of
bias, to establish a fair hearing violation. 
Southern California Underground Contractors, Inc. v. City of San
Diego, (“San Diego”) (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 527, 549.  Bias in an administrative hearing can never
be implied and must be shown through “concrete facts” rather than inferred from
mere appearances.  Weinberg v. Cedars
Sinai Medical Center, (“Weinberg”) (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1098,
1115.  The fact that a petitioner
received an unfavorable result does not, in and of itself, establish bias.  Andrews v. Agricultural Labor Relations
Board, (1981) 28 Cal.3d 781, 795-96.
Herrera argues that
he did not receive a fair hearing because the ALJ accepted “ghost declarations”
from EDD employees who never spoke with him, the CUIAB’s Presiding ALJ became
an agent for EDD by discouraging him from subpoenaing documents from EDD, and
ALJ Morris and the CUIAB did not focus on the reason for his appeal that EDD
should have processed his claim.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 13-15.
CUIAB’s opposition rebuts these claims.  Herrera argues that ALJ Morris “resorted
to intimidation and duress tactics” and “berated” him for information in his
file.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.  Yet, the transcript of the hearing shows that
the ALJ made many attempts to elicit testimony on the good cause issue and Herrera
Herrera repeatedly
contended that she had the documentation.  
AR 53.  When Herrera continued to
reference the documents, ALJ Morris stated: “I’m gonna go ahead and end your
hearing.  You’ll get a copy of the
decision in the mail.  It seems that
either you don’t want to cooperate or you don’t understand my question
regarding the good cause explanation.” 
AR 53-54.  This was not unfair.
Herrera’s argument
that he was denied a fair hearing because no one from EDD personally appeared
at his hearing is rebutted by the fact that the regulations permit EDD to
submit declarations in lieu of appearance for petitioner’s hearing.  22 CCR §5061(c).  Moreover, EDD’s declaration addressed the
merits of discontinuing benefits, not the good cause issue.  AR 62-63.
            Finally, Herrera’s allegation that
the presiding ALJ revoked his subpoena is not supported by the record.  There is no subpoena in the administrative
record.  Herrera cites an email he sent
to CUIAB, which refers to a phone conversation between his wife and CUIAB
regarding whether he should subpoena documents from EDD or obtain records via
another method.  AR 55.  The email contains handwritten notes
indicating that CUIAB attempted to follow up with Herrera on what documents he
wanted but was unable to reach him.  AR
55.  This document does not support Herrera’s
contention, and he fails to explain what documents would have been produced via
subpoena that were not before the ALJ.
 
4. Reply Argument
            In reply, Herrera argues that (a)
EDD secretly initiated the appeal, not himself (AR 10), (b) CUIAB never ruled
on the two original case numbers 7088213 and 7088214, (c) EDD sent letters to
him in English despite his selection on the application that he was a Spanish
speaker (AR 189, 217), (d) the Presiding ALJ discouraged a subpoena, (e) he
never applied to re-open any EDD claim, and (f) EDD and CUIAB are represented
by one law firm  Reply at 2-11.
Some of these arguments do not help Herrera.  If he never appealed, then the time has long
passed for any appeal and his mandamus claim cannot lie.  Additionally, CUIAB did rule on both his
cases; the different numbers exist because CUIAB assigns its own numbers to
appeals.  His argument that the CUIAB
lacks independence is not adequately presented.
Finally, Herrera’s argument concerning the lack of written
communication in Spanish might be a viable argument except that he never raised
this issue at the August 29 ALJ hearing or the CUIAB appeal hearing, and also failed
to mention it in his opening brief.  New evidence/issues raised for the first time in a reply
brief are not properly presented to a trial court and may be disregarded.  Regency Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina
Lances, Inc., (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333.  
 
            F.
Conclusion
Whatever the merits of Herrera’s claims concerning his
benefits disqualification and EDD’s demand for overpayment, this mandamus case
is about whether the CUIAB erred in affirming ALJ Morris’ denial of re-opening Herrera’s
appeals based on good cause.  Herrera did
not show good cause.   Nor was he denied
a fair appeal before the ALJ.  The
Petition is denied.
The CUIAB’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed
judgment, serve it on Herrera for approval as to form, wait ten days after
service for any objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then
submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the
existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for June 4, 2024
at 9:30 a.m.
