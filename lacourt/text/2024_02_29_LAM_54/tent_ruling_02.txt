Hearing Date: February 29, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Compel Responses to Discovery
Moving Party: Defendants Masoud Koshki, Shlomo
Harari and P&J LaBrea, LLC
Responding Party: Plaintiff Arthur Edward Ezor
 
T/R:     DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
DEFENDANTS TO
NOTICE.  
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply. 
 
Defendants move to compel responses
and/or further responses to special interrogatories, sets one and two, and
requests for production of documents, set one. Defendants served the discovery
on August 9, 2023. Plaintiff served a response via letter on October 10, 2023.
Defendants assert the letter is not a proper discovery response. Defendants do
not provide a separate statement showing which requests require further
response. In opposition, Plaintiff asserts he already responded to discovery.
Defendants seek monetary and terminating sanctions.
 
It is unclear exactly how and to what
extent Plaintiff has responded to discovery. An order compelling further
responses and awarding sanctions is not supported by this record. Plaintiff
must provide discovery responses that comply with the Code of Civil Procedure.  If Plaintiff’s responses are evasive or
incomplete, Defendants may then file a motion to compel further (which would
include a separate statement).
 
The Court will not require an informal
discovery conference before hearing any renewed motion.
