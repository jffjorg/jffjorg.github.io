And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Maurice Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joel Bernknopf and John Lamorte (Plaintiffs) against Brian M. Cronin, Natalie Gonzalez Cronin, ARC-V Inc., and Orthopros (Defendants). The case involves a dispute over the sale of Orthopros, an orthotics and prosthetics company, and allegations of fraudulent conduct by the Defendants.

The Judge has overruled the Defendants' demurrers to the first amended complaint, which challenged the legal sufficiency of the complaint. The Judge found that the complaint adequately alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, accounting, and constructive trust against the Defendants.

The Judge has ordered the Defendants to file and serve answers to the first amended complaint within 15 days of notice of the ruling. The Judge has also overruled the demurrers to the seventh, eleventh, thirteenth, and fourteenth causes of action, which were brought against Natalie Gonzalez Cronin and ARC-V Inc.

The case is set for a hearing on February 29, 2024, in Department 54 of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The parties may submit on the tentative ruling by emailing the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel or self-represented party before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
