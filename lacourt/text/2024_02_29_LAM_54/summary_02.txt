```

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to compel responses to discovery without prejudice. The defendants seek to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, but the plaintiff asserts that it has already responded to discovery. However, the court finds that it is unclear how and to what extent the plaintiff has responded to discovery, and therefore an order compelling further responses and awarding sanctions is not supported by the record. The court orders the plaintiff to provide discovery responses that comply with the Code of Civil Procedure, and if the plaintiff's responses are evasive or incomplete, the defendants may file a renewed motion to compel further responses.
