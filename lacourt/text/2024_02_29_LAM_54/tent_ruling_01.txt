BACKGROUND
 
On November 24, 2021, Plaintiffs Joel
Bernknopf and John Lamorte sued Defendants Brian M. Cronin, Natalie Gonzalez
Cronin, ARC-IV, LLC, ARC-V, Inc., and Orthopros, asserting causes of action for
(1) securities fraud; (2) fraud by concealment; (3) intentional
misrepresentation; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) breach of buyer note;
(6) breach of debt assumption agreement; (7) breach of employment agreement;
and (8) financial elder abuse. 
 
Plaintiffs founded Orthopros, an
orthotics and prosthetics company, in 1982. Plaintiffs allege they sold
Orthopros to Defendants via a stock purchase agreement in 2020 for $1,193,756.
Joel and John each received a Buyer Note from Orthopros for $471,886. ARC-IV
agreed to assume certain “contingent liabilities” that Orthopros owed to Joel
and John in an amount not to exceed $249,984 and in accordance with the terms
of a debt assumption agreement. Plaintiffs continued to work for Orthopros
until November 2021. Plaintiff alleges Orthopros defaulted on the buyer notes
by obtaining a $500,000.00 small business loan.
 
On February 28, 2022, Brian M. Cronin,
ARC-IV, LLC, ARC-V, Inc., and Orthopros filed a cross-complaint against Joel
Bernknopf and John Lamorte, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of
employment agreement; (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing; (3) fraud – concealment; and (4) fraud – intentional
misrepresentation.
 
On November 1, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a
first amended complaint.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken
to the whole complaint or to any of the causes of action in it.  (CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only the legal
sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual allegations or the
plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations. 
(Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.
App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court must treat
as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law. 
(Id. at 732-33.)  The
complaint is to be construed liberally to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
A. Defendant Natalie Gonzalez Cronin’s
Demurrer to First Amended Complaint
 
1.   
Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 
The elements for a breach of fiduciary
duty cause of action are “the existence of a fiduciary relationship, its
breach, and damage proximately caused by that breach.” (Thomson v. Canyon
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 594, 604.)
 
Defendant Gonzalez Cronin demurs to the
cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty on the ground that Gonzalez Cronin
does not owe Plaintiffs a fiduciary duty. Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs
became employees, rather than shareholders of Orthopros, when they sold the
company to Defendants; corporate officers do not owe fiduciary duties to
employees. Plaintiffs allege they continued to be shareholders after the sale
to Defendants. (FAC 127.) The demurrer cannot be sustained on this basis.
 
The demurrer to the seventh cause of
action is OVERRULED. 
 
2. Unjust Enrichment, Accounting,
and Constructive Trust
 
Defendant demurs to the causes of
action for unjust enrichment, accounting, and constructive trust on the ground
that Plaintiffs have failed to allege Defendant took actions to affect
Plaintiffs’ rights. 
 
Plaintiffs allege in detail the repeated and ongoing fraudulent conduct
of Cronin. (FAC ¶¶ 19-21, 24, 26, 28, 30-68, 74, 78-79, 136-140, 144-145 and
149). Plaintiffs allege Cronin and Gonzalez Cronin were agents for one another.
(FAC ¶ 17). Cronin’s fraudulent conduct is alleged to have been in the course
and scope of such agency and with the permission and consent of Gonzalez
Cronin. (Id.). Plaintiffs allege Gonzalez Cronin breached her fiduciary duties
as a director of Orthopros. (FAC ¶¶ 26, 125-133). As a result of the fraudulent
conduct and breach of fiduciary duties, Plaintiffs allege Gonzalez Cronin,
along with the other Defendants, wrongfully obtained property and money
rightfully belonging to Plaintiffs. This is sufficient to allege claims against
Gonzalez Cronin.
 
The demurrer to the eleventh, thirteenth and fourteenth causes of action
is OVERRULED.
 
 
B. Defendant ARC-V Inc.’s Demurrer to
the First Amended Complaint
 
Defendant ARC-V Inc. demurs to the
causes of action for unjust enrichment, accounting, and constructive trust on
the ground that Plaintiffs have failed to allege Defendant took actions to
affect Plaintiffs’ rights. Plaintiffs allege ARC-V is
an alter ego of Cronin and Gonzalez Cronin. (FAC ¶ 13). They allege Cronin and
Gonzalez Cronin formed ARC-V to acquire Human Designs and Ferraco with the
intention of using those two established, well-respected practices as lures to
induce owners of other orthopod practices to sell to them. This is sufficient
to state claims against Defendant.
 
Defendant ARC-V's demurrer is OVERRULED.
