And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Mellisa Lo to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Yu-Lin Yu. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the Complaint, alleging that it fails to state a cause of action for fraud. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff has 20 days to file a First Amended Complaint. The court's decision is based on the lack of particularity in the Complaint, which fails to allege specific facts sufficient to state a cause of action for fraud. The court has taken judicial notice of the Complaint and has liberally construed it to determine whether a cause of action has been stated.
