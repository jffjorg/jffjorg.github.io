Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to stay the trial pending the resolution of two pending writs regarding the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218). The defendant sought to stay the trial because the writs challenge the constitutionality of AB 218, which is relevant to the case. However, the judge found that the writs are being decided quickly, and the trial is not until next year. The judge also noted that if the writs are not decided by the time of trial, the defendant can bring an ex parte application to continue the trial. The judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that a court has discretion to stay proceedings pending the resolution of a writ, but must weigh the competing interests of the parties.
