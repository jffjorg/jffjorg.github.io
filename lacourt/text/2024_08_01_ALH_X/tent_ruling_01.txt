TENTATIVE RULING
 
             Defendant
La Canada Unified School District’s Motion to Stay the Trial is DENIED. 
 
 
REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Pursuant to Evidence
Code Section 452 and 453, the District requests the Court take judicial notice
of the following: 
 
1. On December 18,
2023, West Contra Costa Unified School District filed a Petition for a Writ of
Mandate seeking to have the First District Court of Appeal compel the Superior
Court of Contra Costa County to reverse its decision overruling a demurrer which
had been filed predicated on the fact that AB 218 was an unlawful gift
of public funds as applied to claims against public entities for childhood
sexual abuse which had occurred prior to January 1, 2009. 
 
2. On December 22, 2023, the Court issued an Order directing
that any Opposition to the Petition be filed before January 26, 2024 and a
Reply to any Opposition filed within fifteen days thereafter. Both the District
and the Plaintiff filed the permitted briefs. 
 
3. On February 27, 2024, the Court issued an Order to Show
Cause which provided in part that IT IS ORDERED that respondent superior court
show cause before this court, when the matter is ordered on calendar, why the
relief requested in the Petition should not be granted. 
 
4. The February 27, 2024 Order to Show Cause required Real
party in interest to serve and file a return to the petition on or before March
28, 2024 and the reply to the return to be served and filed within fifteen (15)
days of the filing of the return. No extensions of time for briefing are
contemplated. 
 
5. The February 27, 2024 Order to Show Cause provided in
part that any requests for oral argument must be served and filed on or before
March 8, 2024. 
 
6. On March 7, 2024, both parties requested oral argument.
Thereafter, Real Party in interest submitted a Return on March 28, 2024. 
 
7. Multiple amicus briefs were submitted in support of
Petitioner’s position by school districts and other Joint Powers Authorities
(JPAs) on April 11, 2024. 
 
8. On April 12, 2024, Petitioner filed its Reply and the West
Contra Costa USD matter was fully briefed and simply awaiting the requested
oral argument. 
 
9. On January 25, 2024, a public entity elementary school
district designated as “Roe 2) in an AB 218 Complaint filed a Petition for a
Writ of Mandate seeking to have the Second District Court of Appeal, Division
Six compel the Superior Court of Santa Barbara County reverse its decision
overruling a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings which had been filed
predicated on the fact that AB 218 was an unlawful gift of public funds as
applied to claims against public entities for childhood sexual abuse which had
occurred prior to January 1, 2009.
 
10. On March 27, 2024, the Second District, Division Six
requested an informal response to the writ to be filed on or before April 22,
2024 which addressed the question of whether the trial court had conflated the
‘public policy’ reasons motivating the legislative enactment of AB218 with the
constitutional requirement that the appropriation of public funds serve a
‘public purpose’. 
 
11. The March 27, 2024 Order of the Second District,
Division Six requested an informal response to be filed on or before April 22,
2024 which addressed the question of whether the retroactive elimination of the
claims presentation requirements for legally invalid claims serve a public
purpose, i.e. does it benefit the state or does it solely benefit the private
individual plaintiffs? In responding to this question, the Court directed the
parties to consider the following authorities “Conlin v. Board of
Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal. 17, 21-22 [“An appropriation of money by the
legislature for the relief of one who has no legal claim therefor must be
regarded as a ‘gift,’ within the meaning of that term, as used in [article XVI,
section 6, of the California Constitution], and it is none the less a gift that
a sufficient motive appears for its appropriation, if the motive does not rest
upon a valid consideration”]; Orange County Foundation v. Irvine Co.
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 195, 201 [where state funds are expended in exchange for
relinquishment of an invalid claim, no public purpose is achieved; such
expenditure violates the gift clause]; County of Alameda v. Carleson
(1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 745-746 [the benefit to the state from an expenditure for
a public purpose is in the nature of consideration and the funds expended are
therefore not a gift even though private persons are benefited]; Civ. Code
Section 1146 [“A gift is a transfer of personal property, made voluntarily,
without consideration”].”
 
12. The March 27, 2024, Order of the Second District,
Division Six provided that the school district could file an informal reply to
the letter response on or before May 17, 2024.
 
The Court takes
judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code Section 452 and 453. But, the Court
takes judicial notice only as to the existence, content, and authenticity of
such documents; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of the factual
matters asserted therein. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th
389, 400.) 
            
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Any party may file a
motion for an order under Code of Civil Procedure section 404.5 staying the
proceedings in any action being considered for, or affecting an action being
considered for, coordination, or the court may stay the proceedings on its own
motion.” (Cal. Rules Ct., Rule 3.515(a).)
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 404.5, “Pending any
determination of whether coordination is appropriate, the judge making that
determination may stay any action being considered for, or affecting an action
being considered for, coordination.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 404.5.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            The
District moves for an order staying the trial of this matter pending resolution
of the Court of Appeals’ decision on two writs regarding the constitutionality
of California Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”).  
 
In Caiafa Prof. Law Corp. v.
State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 800, the court held,
[i]t is black letter law that, when a Federal action has been filed covering
the same subject matter as is involved in a California action, the California
court has the discretion but not the obligation to stay the state court action.”
(Caiafa Prof. Law Corp. v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. (1993) 15
Cal.App.4th 800, 804.) However, the court in California Dept. of Water
Resources v. Powerex Corp. (E.D. Cal.
2009) 653 F.Supp.2d 1057, held “[w]here it is proposed that a
pending proceeding be stayed, the competing interests which will be affected by
the granting or refusal to grant a stay must be weighed. Among those competing
interests are the possible damage which may result from the granting of a stay,
the hardship or inequity which a party may suffer in being required to go
forward, and the orderly course of justice measured in terms of the simplifying
or complicating of issues, proof, and questions of law which could be expected
to result from a stay.” (California Dept. of Water
Resources v. Powerex Corp. (E.D. Cal.
2009) 653 F.Supp.2d 1057, 1063 [citing to Lockyer v. Mirant Corp. (9th
Cir. 2005) 398 F.3d 1098, 1110)].)
 
            Here,
the Court recognizes that two petitions for writ of mandate are currently
pending before the First and Second District Appellate Courts in West Contra
Costa USD v. Superior Court, Case No. A16934 (concerning decision to
overrule demurrer predicated on unconstitutionality of AB 218) and Roe #2 v.
Superior Court, Case No. B334707 (concerning decision to deny motion for
judgment on the pleadings predicated on unconstitutionality of AB 218). While these
two writs challenge the rulings of the trial courts in Contra Costa County and
Santa Barbara County, respectively and not a judgment or order made by this
Court, they do relate to the same issue as was raised in this Court, i.e., the
constitutionality of AB 218 raised on the Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings. Nevertheless, the writ process is much quicker than that in
the case of appeals, such that this Court anticipates that the Appellate Courts
will rule relatively soon. In fact, the writ in the Contra Costa case has been
fully briefed and awaits oral argument. (Def. RJN 8 – Ex. C.) Likewise, trial
in the instant case is not until April 7 of next year (2025). If in fact
no ruling is made by the Appellate Courts until closer to the trial date, or if
the ruling of the Appellate Courts results in a Petition for Review in the
California Supreme Court, then the Defendant may bring an ex parte application
to continue the trial. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Based on
the foregoing, Defendant La Canada
Unified School District’s Motion to Stay the Trial is DENIED.
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
