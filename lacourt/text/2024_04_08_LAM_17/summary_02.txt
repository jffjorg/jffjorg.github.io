And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains Fusion's demurrer with 15 days leave to amend. The case revolves around the Jeffrey S. Marks Separate Property Trust and the Harb Family Trust, among others. The Plaintiffs initiated the action on November 4, 2021, and filed a verified third amended complaint on February 8, 2024. Fusion demurred to the complaint on March 7, 2024. The Judge agrees that the Plaintiffs' complaint still fails to allege sufficient facts to support a claim, and that the addition of the adverse possession claim was procedurally improper. However, the Judge grants leave to amend, citing the strong policy favoring leave to amend and the possibility that the Plaintiffs could assert a valid claim with adequate supporting facts. The Judge orders that the demurrer be sustained with 15 days leave to amend.
