 Hearing
  Date:  April 8, 2024



 
 
Fusion’s demurrer is SUSTAINED, WITH 15 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
On 11/4/2021, the Jeffrey S. Marks Separate Property Trust
established under the Jeffery and Loretta Marks Family Trust, Jeffrey S. Mark
as trustee, the Mae Durant family Trust, and South Main Street Properties, LLC
(collectively, Plaintiffs) initiated this action.
 
            On 2/8/2024, Plaintiffs filed a
verified third amended complaint (TAC) against the Harb Family Trust dated
11/1/1996, the Irrevocable Trust of chou Bo Chan Chiu (1997) for the benefit of
Samson Chiu, and Fusion Investments, LLC (Fusion) alleging: (1) declaratory
relief; and (2) quiet title-adverse possession.
 
            On 3/7/2024, Fusion demurred to
Plaintiff’s TAC. 
 
Discussion

 
            Fusion argues that Plaintiffs’ TAC
still fails to allege sufficient facts to support a claim, and contains an
impermissible amendment. 
 
            As to the latter claim, the Court
agrees. Where a court grants leave to amend after sustaining a demurrer, “such
granting of leave to amend must be construed as permission to the pleader to
amend the cause of action which he pleaded in the pleading to which the
demurrer has been sustained.” (People v. Clausen (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d
770, 785-786.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff did not obtain leave to amend to allege a new cause
of action for adverse possession. Accordingly, the Court strikes this cause of
action from the TAC and does not consider it. 
 
This leaves only the first cause of action for declaratory relief.  The Court agrees with Defendant that it is
insufficiently pled given that there is no specific controversy alleged.
Instead, Plaintiffs allege: “an actual controversy has arisen and now exists
between Plaintiff and the Defendants concerning their respective rights and
duties relative to and under the Indenture” (3AC, ¶ 32), and “[t]here exists a
substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the
issuance of a declaratory judgment” (3AC, ¶ 35). To state a cause of action for
declaratory relief, ‘the actual, present controversy must be pleaded
specifically.’” (Jenkins v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 216
Cal.App.4th 497, 513- 14 (emphasis added), abrogated on other grounds by Yvanova
v. New Century Mort. Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919.) “Thus, a claim must
provide specific facts, as opposed to conclusions of law, which show a
‘controversy of concrete actuality.’” (Id. at p. 514.)
 
Plaintiff will be afforded leave to amend for two reasons. First,
given that the demurrer was sustained as to the first cause of action for lack
of specificity, there is a chance Plaintiff could assert a valid claim if
adequately supported by facts. Second, while Plaintiff’s addition of the
adverse possession claim was procedurally improper, it does indicate that
Plaintiff may be able to allege a valid claim. Plaintiff is granted leave to
amend to allege this claim. This is in the interest of judicial economy, and
given that the policy favoring leave to amend is so
strong that it is an abuse of discretion to deny an amendment unless the
adverse party can show meaningful prejudice. (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003)
109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.)
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer is sustained, with 15
days leave to amend. 
 
It is so
ordered.
