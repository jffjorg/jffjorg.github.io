And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has identified several deficiencies in the plaintiff's default judgment packet. The plaintiff must file an updated proposed judgment and address the issues previously raised by the court. Specifically, the plaintiff must provide a legal basis for recovering damages from the defendant individually for breach of contract, and explain how the damages award for breach of contract is not duplicative or overlapping with the damages awarded via the settlement agreement. The plaintiff must also provide supporting evidence for its claims of damages, which are currently unsupported by declaration or extrinsic evidence. The plaintiff's application now removes a damages section which it previously included, and which set forth a breakdown of the estimated damages. The plaintiff must refile the entire default judgment packet within 30 days.
