  Case Number:  20STCV15518    Hearing Date:   April 19, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Continue Trial
Defendant’s Motion for an Order Deeming Admitted as True
the Matters Specified in Requests for Admission
 
Tentative
The motion to continue trial is granted in
part and denied in part.
The motion for an order deeming Requests for
Admission admitted as true is denied.
Background
This action arises from an automobile accident
that occurred on April 25, 2018, involving Plaintiff Brad Bello (“Plaintiff”)
and Defendant Francisco Jose Maisch (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed the
complaint in this action on April 23, 2020, against Defendant and Does 1
through 30, asserting one cause of action for motor vehicle
negligence.  Defendant filed his answer on November 19, 2021.
On April 28, 2023, the Court granted the motion
of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved.  Since that time, Plaintiff
has been representing himself.
Two motions are currently before the Court and
set for hearing on April 19.
First, Defendant filed a motion to continue
trial on March 18, 2024.  No opposition
has been received.
Second, Defendant filed a motion for an order
deeming admitted as true the matters specified in Requests for Admission
(RFAs).
As to that motion, on May 12, 2023, Defendant
served Plaintiff with RFAs (Set One).  (Mittskus Decl., ¶ 4 &
Exh. A.)  Plaintiff was served by mail.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff
did not respond.  (Id., ¶¶ 6, 10.)
On February 22, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for a deemed admitted order.  Plaintiff was served by mail.  No timely opposition has been filed.  The matter was initially set for hearing on
April 9.  At the hearing, Plaintiff
appeared, as did Defendant’s counsel.  After
hearing from both sides, the Court continued the hearing to April 19.  
On April 17, Plaintiff filed a copy of his responses
to the RFAs.  It is unclear whether the
responses were served on Defendant’s counsel (no proof of service is attached).
Legal Standard
Motion to Continue Trial
Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision
(a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control its process
and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The power to
determine when a continuance should be granted is within the discretion of the
trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599,
1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of calendar control
including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v.
Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.) 

Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:  
“(1) The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(2) The unavailability of a party because of
death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(3) The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The
new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare
for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's
involvement in the case;  
(6) A party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or  
(7) A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for
trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)  
 
California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be
analyzed when determining whether good cause for a trial continuance is
present. A court considers factors such as: 

“(1) The proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;  
(3) The length of the continuance
requested;  
(4) The availability of alternative means to
address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;  
(5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses
will suffer as a result of the continuance; 
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential
trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a
continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;  
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance;  
(10) Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Motion for Order Deeming RFAs Admitted

A party must respond to requests for admission
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a
party to whom requests for admission are directed does not provide a timely
response, the propounding party “may move for an order that … the truth of
[the] matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to
provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
The court “shall” make the order that the truth
of the matters specified in the request be deemed admitted unless the court
“finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St.
Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem admitted the truth of
the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Discussion
Motion to Continue
The trial date in this matter is June 5, 2024.
Defendant has motions to compel (filed on April 3) scheduled for
hearing on May 28, the week before trial. 
Defendant also has reserved a hearing date of December 3, 2024, for a
motion for summary judgment, but Defendant has not filed the motion yet.
No other grounds for the motion are identified in the moving papers.
The motion to continue the trial date is granted in part.  
The Court finds good cause for a brief continuance of the trial date so
that the discovery motions may be heard and, if the motion granted, so that the
discovery responses may be provided.  A
continuance of 30 days should be more than adequate to address that issue.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a)
[setting cutoff for discovery motions to be heard 15 days before trial.].)
The Court does not find good cause at this time for a continuance of the
trial date based on Defendant’s reservation of a hearing date for a summary judgment
motion.  Reserving a hearing date for a
motion is not the equivalent of filing a motion.  It is not uncommon for a party to reserve a
hearing date but then not file the motion.
A party has a
right to have a timely filed more for summary judgment heard before trial.  (Cole v. Superior Court
(2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88; Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989)
207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529.)  Here, however,
Defendant has not filed any such motion.
Motion for Order Deeming RFAs Admitted 
Defendant served Plaintiff with RFAs (Set One) on
May 12, 2023.  (Mittskus Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.)  Prior
to the filing of the motion, Plaintiff had not responded.  (Id., ¶¶ 6, 10.)
Plaintiff did file with the Court
responses to the RFAs on April 17, 2024. 

 
These responses are in substantial compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.220.  Accordingly,
the motion for a deemed-admitted order is denied.
 
Defendant does not request
sanctions.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
in part and DENIES in part Defendant’s Motion to Continue Trial.
The trial date
is continued for approximately 30 days. 
The Final Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new
trial date.
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for an order deeming admitted as true
the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One).
Moving
Party is ORDERED to give notice.
