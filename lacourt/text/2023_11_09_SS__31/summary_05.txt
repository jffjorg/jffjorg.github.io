And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Willie Juanita Moss, the plaintiff, and Lucky Nails & Foot Spa, Hang Thanh Doan, and Huyen Gale, the defendants. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to implement and/or follow adequate safeguards and safety equipment and supplies, resulting in an acrylic fingernail striking the plaintiff's eye.

The defendants have moved to demur to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's Doe amendment naming Hang Thanh Doan as Doe 1 is time-barred and that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against him. The plaintiff disputes these contentions, arguing that the amendment relates back to the original complaint and that there has been no showing of actual prejudice.

The judge has found that the plaintiff may have been genuinely ignorant of Hang Thanh Doan's identity at the time of the filing of the complaint, and therefore the amendment relating back to the original complaint is satisfied. However, the judge has also found that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed in filing the Doe amendment, and therefore the amendment is not deemed to relate back to the original complaint.

The judge has overruled the demurrer and ordered the moving defendant to give notice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if they do not, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
