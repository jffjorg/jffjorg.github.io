The amount sought against each Defendant appear duplicative, and further do not correlate with the amounts sought in Plaintiff’s default prove-up brief.   Plaintiff’s prove-up brief and evidentiary support provides she is seeking $8,753.20 in special damages, and $100,000 in general damages against Defendants collectively.   As Defendants appear to be jointly and severally liable for the same amount, Plaintiff should submit a single CIV-100 form naming both Defendants on Item 1(d), and ensure the amount sought on CIV-100 accurately reflects and correlates the amount provided in Plaintiff’s prove-up. If Defendants are not jointly and separately liable for the same amount, then Plaintiff must ensure that the amounts sought against each Defendant is not duplicative, and substantiate the liability of and damages sought against each separate Defendant.   Additionally, Plaintiff failed to file a proposed judgment on JUD-100. A proposed judgment is required per CRC 3.1800(a)(6). For the same reason as provided above, if Defendants are jointly and severally liable for the same amount, then Plaintiff must submit a single JUD-100 naming both Defendants on Item 5(a).   No later than ______________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects.  Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ________________.
