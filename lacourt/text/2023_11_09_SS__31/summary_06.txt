```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff Anton Davis to relieve him from waiving his right to a jury trial. The motion is unopposed. The judge notes that Plaintiff failed to post jury fees before the trial date, but has now posted the required deposit. The judge finds that the failure to post jury fees was an inadvertent mistake and that there is no prejudice to any party by granting the motion. Therefore, the judge grants the motion, but orders Plaintiff to post the jury deposit within five days and to provide proof of service of the ruling. The judge also encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and sets a deadline for submitting written arguments or appearing remotely or in person for oral argument.
