And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel a second physical examination of the plaintiff, Mariana Melikova. The defendants had argued that a second examination was necessary because the plaintiff had undergone a total knee replacement and was recommended for lumbar spine fusion surgery, and that a second examination would be necessary to assess the plaintiff's condition. The plaintiff had already undergone a first physical examination with Dr. Grossman, which had included an examination of her right knee. The judge found that the defendants had not demonstrated good cause for a second physical examination, as the first examination had already covered the same areas of the plaintiff's body. The judge also noted that the defendants had not shown how the proposed second examination with Dr. Brien would be substantially different from the first examination with Dr. Grossman. As a result, the motion was denied, and the request for sanctions was also denied. The defendants were ordered to give notice of the ruling.
