Background On May 27, 2021, Plaintiff, Willie Juanita Moss (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants, Lucky Nails & Foot Spa (“Lucky Nails”) and Does 1 to 100, alleging a failure to implement and/or follow adequate safeguards and safety equipment and supplies, resulting in an acrylic fingernail striking Plaintiff’s eye on June 1, 2019.  On July 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed amendments to complaint naming Hang Thanh Doan as Doe 1 and Huyen Gale as Doe 2. Defendant Hang Thanh Doan (“Doan”) now demurs to the complaint arguing the Doe Amendment is time barred, and that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Doan. Plaintiff opposes the motion, and Doan filed a reply.  II. Judicial Notice In connection with the motion, Doan request the Court take judicial notice of (1) Plaintiff’s Complaint, (2) Plaintiff’s Doe 1 Amendment to Complaint, (3) Plaintiff’s Doe 2 Amendment to Complaint, (4) Defendant Lucky Nails’ Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint, (5) Manicurist License issued to Doan, Lucky Nails’ Establishment License, Lucky Nail’s Fictitious Business Name Statement, and Plaintiff’s responses to interrogatories, attached as exhibits to Lucky Nail’s motion for summary judgment (“MSJ”), (6) Plaintiff’s attorney’s supplemental declaration filed in support of Plaintiff’s opposition to Lucky Nail’s MSJ, (7) Declaration of Plaintiff filed in opposition to Lucky Nail’s MSJ, and (8) 16 CCR § 965 titled “Display of Licenses” under Division 9 of the California Barbering and Cosmetology regulations, Article 9, licenses.  Requests 1, 2, 3, and 4 are granted to the extent that Courts can take judicial notice of the fact that complaints were filed, but not of the truth of the statements contained in those. (Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.  (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 483.) Judges cannot take judicial notice of hearsay statements asserted in court filings, but can take judicial notice of the existence of such documents.  (Johnson & Johnson v. Sup. Ct. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 768;  Williams v. Wraxall (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 120, 130 n. 7  (judges may take judicial notice of the existence of court documents, “but cannot take judicial notice of the truth of hearsay statements in decisions or court files, including pleadings, affidavits, testimony, or statements of fact.”).) Judicial notice of inferences derived from discovery responses is unauthorized where there can be factual disputes. (Williams v. So. Cal. Gas Co. (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 591, 598-600.) Plaintiff objects to Request 5. The objection is sustained. Plaintiff’s objections to Requests 6 and 7 are overruled. Requests 6 and 7 are granted only to the extent of any pleading inconsistencies. “ ‘Although the existence of statements contained in a deposition transcript [or declaration] filed as part of the court record can be judicially noticed, their truth is not subject to judicial notice.’ ” (Judicial notice of the truth of statements in declaration would impermissibly transform the demurrer proceeding into contested evidentiary dispute).  Big Valley Band of Pomo Indians v. Sup. Ct. (2005) 133 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1191–92.  Accord  Garcia v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 17, 22.  But see Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.  (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604-605 (“The court will take judicial notice of records such as admissions, answers to interrogatories, affidavits, and the like, when considering a demurrer, only where they contain statements of the plaintiff or his agent which are inconsistent with the allegations of the pleading before the court.”).)    The objection to Request 8 is overruled. Request 8 is granted.  III. Legal Standard Procedural Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (CCP § 430.41(a).)   The Court finds Doan fulfilled this requirement prior to filing its demurrer.  (Torres. Decl. ¶¶ 2-4)  Demurrer A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings.  It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer, or cross-complaint).  (CCP §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.)  The “face of the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]). A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action.  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)  IV. Discussion First, Doan argues Plaintiff’s Doe Amendment naming Doan as Doe 1 is invalid because CCP § 472(a) provides in part, “A party may amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed …,” and in this case, an answer was already filed by Lucky Nails on July 22, 2021. Doan contends that as a result, Plaintiff was required to obtain leave of court to file the Doe Amendment.  (CCP § 473(a).)   While Code of Civil Procedure § 472 does require “leave of court” before filing amended pleadings once there has been a response to a complaint, § 472 is a general provision relating to the amendment of pleadings. Code of Civil Procedure § 473(a)(1) provides that the court may allow an amendment to add the name of a party on any terms it deems proper, which could include allowing amendment by use of a court form.  Further, CCP § 474 is narrower in its scope than § 472 and relates only to the substitution of “Doe” defendants, the very issue presented here.  Because the more specific provision takes precedence over the more general one, (Strother v. Cal. Coastal Com. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 873, 879), and because CCP § 474 nowhere explicitly indicates leave of court is required for “Doe” amendments, the Court finds Doan’s reliance on CCP §§ 472 requirement of “leave of court” insufficient.   Second, Doan argues Plaintiff unreasonably delayed in filing the Doe Amendment, and that Plaintiff was not ignorant of Doan’s identity for the amendment to relate back, and that the amendment is therefore time-barred. CCP § 474 provides, “When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, he must state that fact in the complaint, or the affidavit if the action is commenced by affidavit, and such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name, and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly …”  “The general rule is that an amended complaint that adds a new defendant does not relate back to the date of filing the original complaint and the statute of limitations is applied as of the date the amended complaint is filed, not the date the original complaint is filed.”  (Woo v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 169, 176.)  “A recognized exception to the general rule is the substitution under [CCP §] 474 of a new defendant for a fictitious Doe defendant named in the original complaint as to whom a cause of action was stated in the original complaint… If the requirements of section 474 are satisfied, the amended complaint substituting a new defendant for a fictitious Doe defendant filed after the statute of limitations has expired is deemed filed as of the date the original complaint was filed.”  (Id.)   “Among the requirements for application of the section 474 relation-back doctrine is that the new defendant in an amended complaint be substituted for an existing fictitious Doe defendant named in the original complaint.”  (Id.) Doan contends Plaintiff was aware of Doan’s name and Doan’s identity as the co-owner of Lucky Nails, and that Doan was the only manicurist to perform services for Plaintiff, including those provided on the date of the incident. However, Plaintiff waited until over two years since the filing of the Complaint to file an amendment to complaint on July 27, 2023 designating Doan as Doe 1. Further, Doan argues Plaintiff took Doan’s deposition in her individual capacity as the person most qualified (PMQ) on behalf of Lucky Nails on October 17, 2022 and December 19, 2022. Doan also avers her manicurist license was on display at her workstation, and that Plaintiff cannot claim to be ignorant of Doan’s true name when the establishment license identifies Doan and Huyen Gale (“Gale”) as owners of the salon.  Plaintiff, in opposition, objects to various documents Doan requests the Court to take judicial notice. Plaintiff also argues she determined there was sufficient information to identify Doan and Gale as necessary Doe amendments after Plaintiff deposed Gale on April 14, 2023. Further, Plaintiff also contends Plaintiff did not appear at Doan’s deposition to have identified Doan, and that Doan testified as a PMK and not in an individual capacity. Plaintiff avers she had insufficient information to identify Lucky Nail’s business form, hierarchy, business structure, ownership and involved management before June 1, 2021. Lastly, Plaintiff contends there is no showing of prejudice to Doan. In reply, Doan relies on Hazel v. Hewlett. (1988) 201 Cal. App. 3d 1458 to argue where the requirements of section 474 are not met, lack of prejudice alone does not allow the addition of a new defendant by amendment after the statute of limitations has run. Further, Doan argues Plaintiff concedes the addition of Doan in her individual capacity presents the risk of imposing liability on all partners and the partnership of the business.  Here, Plaintiff’s contention that she personally did not appear for Doan’s deposition on October 17, 2022 and December 19, 2022, and was therefore ignorant of Doan’s identity and role with Lucky Nails at that point, is not well-taken. Plaintiff cannot argue that her counsel’s knowledge and discovery of the facts of the matter is not imparted upon Plaintiff. However, although Plaintiff learned of Doan’s identity at the time of Doan’s deposition on October 17, 2022, the Court cannot say that Plaintiff knew the identity of Doan and her full relationship to Lucky Nails at the time of the filing of the complaint, which is the central factor for determining whether the amendment relates back to the original complaint. The ignorance of which Code of Civil Procedure section 474 speaks is actual ignorance, and a plaintiff will not be refused the right to use a Doe pleading even where the plaintiff's lack of actual knowledge is attributable to plaintiff's own negligence. (Grinnell Fire Prot. Sys. Co. v. Am. Sav. & Loan Assn. (1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 352, 359.) Therefore, as it appears that Plaintiff may have been genuinely ignorant of Doan’s identity at the time of the filing of the complaint, CCP § 474 is satisfied.   However, CCP § 474 “includes an implicit requirement that a plaintiff may not ‘unreasonably delay’ his or her filing of a Doe amendment after learning of defendant's identity” and unreasonable delay “includes a prejudice element, which requires a showing by the defendant that he or she would suffer prejudice from plaintiff's delay in filing the Doe amendment.”  (A.N. v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1066-67.) Here, Plaintiff unreasonably delayed in filing the Doe amendment, because Plaintiff learned of Doan’s identity on October 17, 2022, yet waited nine months to name Doan on July 27, 2023. As to the element of prejudice, the Court finds Hazel v. Hewlett. (1988) 201 Cal. App. 3d 1458 distinguishable from this matter, in which prejudice need not be shown, because the plaintiff in Hazel actually knew the identity and role of the person at the time of the filing of the complaint, and waited until after the expiration of the statute of limitations to amend the complaint. As provided above, the Court cannot say the same for Plaintiff here.  The Court finds there has been no showing of actual prejudice. The action, filed on May 27, 2021, is not yet old, and currently there is no trial date set. Further, the Court is not persuaded that there will be any expansion of liability, when the only amendment is to substitute Doan as Doe 1, and the allegations in the complaint remain the same. There is still ample time to conduct any additional discovery and for Doan to prepare a defense in this matter.   Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is OVERRULED.    Moving Defendant is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 8th day of November 2023      Hon.
