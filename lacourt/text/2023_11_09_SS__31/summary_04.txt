And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to intervene in a lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed by Deanna Boulton against Vigen Tsarukyan, and it relates to an automobile accident. Progressive West Insurance Company, which issued an automobile policy to Tsarukyan, is seeking to intervene in the lawsuit. The company is seeking to protect its interests in the distribution of the applicable liability limit. The court finds that Progressive has a sufficient interest to intervene in the action to protect its interests, and that the company's interests will be prejudiced if it is not allowed to intervene. The court grants the motion for leave to intervene and orders Progressive to file a separate copy of its complaint-in-intervention and serve it on all parties within 10 days.
