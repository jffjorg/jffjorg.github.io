And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling, issued by Judge Hon. Michelle C. Kim on November 8, 2023, addresses the motion to continue trial filed by Defendant Arash Farin on August 29, 2023. The motion requested to continue the then September 21, 2023 trial date to April 8, 2024. However, on September 7, 2023, the trial was continued to June 25, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. and the Final Status Conference was continued to September 7, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. due to an oral stipulation at the Final Status Conference. Therefore, the motion to continue trial is now moot and taken off-calendar. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must notify the court. If no party submits, the parties should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
