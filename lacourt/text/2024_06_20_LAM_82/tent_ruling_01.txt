[Tentative] Decision
on Complaint for Declaratory Relief 
 

 
INTRODUCTION

            
             Plaintiff Ismael Navarro (“Plaintiff”) is a police
officer for the City of Montebello (“Defendant” or the “City”) and was injured
on duty.  Plaintiff filed an Application
for Adjudication with the Worker’s Compensation Appeals Board (the
“WCAB”).  On Jule 29, 2021, the WCAB
issued an order finding that Plaintiff was entitled to benefits under Labor
Code section 4850.  Then, on March 22,
2023, Plaintiff discovered that the City was taxing the benefits, which gives
rise to this action for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiff contends that the CPRA requires the
City to produce “any and all policies and procedures that allow for taxation of
Lab. Code § 4850 benefits” and “a list of any and all employees that have been
taxed on Lab. Code § 4850 benefits.”  The
court issues a judgment in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Pursuant to the California Public Records Act,
Government Code sections 7921.000, et seq., individual citizens have a
right to access government records.[1]  In enacting the CPRA, the California
Legislature declared that “access to information concerning the conduct of the
people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this
state.”  (Gov. Code, § 7921.000; see also
County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2012)
211 Cal.App.4th 57, 63.) 
 
Article
1, Section 3(b) of the Constitution affirms that “[t]he people have the right
of access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business.” The
Constitution mandates that the CPRA be “broadly construed,” while any statute
“that limits the right of access” must be “narrowly construed.”  (See Nat’l Lawyers Guild v. City of
Hayward (2020) 9 Cal.5th 488, 507.)  “Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be available for
inspection by any person requesting the record after deletion of the portions
that are exempted by law.”  (Gov. Code §
7922.525(b).)
 


 
“To establish an agency has a duty to disclose
under [the CPRA], the petitioner must show that: (1) the record ‘qualif[ies] as
[a] ‘public record[ ]’ …; and (2) the record is ‘in the possession of the
agency.’”  (Anderson-Barker v Sup.Ct. (2019)
31 Cal.App.5th 528, 538.) CPRA exemptions must be narrowly construed and the
agency bears the burden of showing that a specific exemption applies.  (Sacramento
County Employees’ Retirement System v. Superior Court (2013) 195
Cal.App.4th 440, 453.) 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.        The City Does Not Have Possession of
Responsive Records 
 
Plaintiff seeks two sets of records: (1) The City’s policies
and procedures allowing for taxation of Labor Code section 4850 benefits, and
(2) A list of employees who have been taxed on Labor Code section 4850
benefits.  Even assuming these records
fall within the scope of the CPRA, the City does not have responsive records.  The City informed Plaintiff’s counsel on November 9, 2023, that “[a]fter a diligent search, the
city has no documents responsive to your request.”  (Hitzke Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. F.)  In her sworn declaration in support of the
opposition, Skibar, Defendant’s Risk Manager, similarly declares: “The City has
conducted a diligent search and has found no responsive documents to Mr.
Hitzke’s August 24, 2023 PRA request.” 
(Skibar Decl. ¶ 11.)  
 
Plaintiff could have pursued
discovery regarding the adequacy of Defendant’s search for records and to
obtain further information concerning Defendant’s determination that it has no
responsive records.  (See City of Los Angeles v. Sup. Ct. (Anderson-Barker) (2017) 9
Cal.App.5th 272, 284-290; County of San Benito v. Sup.Ct. (2023) 96
Cal.App.5th 243, 255-258.)  Plaintiff
apparently did not pursue discovery on this issue.  Instead, Plaintiff relies on the trial testimony
of the City’s human resources representative, Eliazbeth Ortega, before the
WCAB.  (See Hitzke Decl., Exh. B.)  Ortega testified as follows:
 
Q:        And under what belief -- or under what
authority do you believe that any of the salary [Plaintiff] was earning while
out on IOD incentives or otherwise would be taxable?
 
A:        That’s our practice.  The system is set up for IOD to be
nontaxed.  All the other incentives, just
like any other employee that is covered under the MOU to receive those incentives,
are considered taxable.   
 
. . . 
 
Q:        When you say your practice, is there a
memorandum or some type of document you could point me to, an administrative
code from the City of Montebello on the payroll for that?
 
A:        Showing that any leave payouts are
considered taxable hours?
 
Q:        Yes.
 
A:        Um, if you look back and see, we have --
do have policies, City policies, and we do have what we call civil service
rules that shows -- outlines how a leave payout is paid.  I’m not sure if it reflects whether it’s taxable
or not taxable.
 
  (Id., Exh. B, pp. 63:12-63:18;
77:25-78:10.)  
 
This
testimony does not support Plaintiff’s argument that the City has responsive
documents.  Plaintiff requested “any and
all policies and procedures that allow for taxation of Lab. Code § 4850
benefits.”  Ortega merely testified that
there are civil service rules outlining “how a leave payout is paid,” but she
did not know whether those documents address the dispositive issue: Whether the
benefits are “taxable or not taxable.” 
Therefore, this testimony does not establish that the City has concealed
policies and procedures allowing for taxation of section 4850 benefits.  It is unclear why Plaintiff did not submit a
CPRA request for policies and procedures concerning “how a leave payout is paid,”
which might resolve this issue.  
 
Nor
does Ortega’s testimony suggest that the City has a “list of employees who have been taxed
on Labor Code section 4850 benefits.”  Plaintiff does not argue or demonstrate that Defendant has
any obligation under the CPRA to create such a list from other data that may be
within Defendant’s possession.  “It is
well established under California law and guiding federal precedent under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) that, while the CPRA requires public agencies
to provide access to their existing records, it does not require them to create
new records to satisfy a request.”  (Sander
v. Superior Court (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 651, 665-666, citations omitted.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s evidence does not
prove that Defendant has records that are responsive to the second part of the
CPRA request.
 
B.        Any List of Employees is Exempt from
Disclosure
 
Defendant
contends that even if it had a list of employees who were taxed on their
section 4850 benefits, this record would constitute “private and confidential
medical and tax information about disabled City first responders and public
safety officers” and would be exempt from disclosure.  (Oppo. 6-7.) 
The court agrees that
an unredacted list of employees that have been taxed on section 4850 benefits,
if it existed, would be exempt from disclosure under multiple state and federal
laws because the list would identify officers who have been disabled in the
course of their duties.  (See e.g. Penal
Code §§ 832.7, 832.8(a); Cal. Const., Art. I, § 1; Gov. Code §§ 7927.700 and
7927.705; Lab. Code § 138.7; 26 U.S.C. § 6103.) 
The CPRA “does not require disclosure of personnel, medical, or similar
files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy.”  (Doe v. Regents of
the University of California (2024) --- Cal.Rptr.3d ---, 2024 WL 2873475,
at *4, citing Gov. Code § 7927.700.)  Plaintiff
develops no argument to the contrary in his reply.  (See Reply 2.)  Therefore, even if such records exist, as
Plaintiff maintains, they are exempt from disclosure.[2]  Plaintiff argues that “the records must be
disclosed because Defendant did not assert an exemption applies.”  (Opening Brief, 5:26-27.)  Plaintiff cites no authority for the
proposition that the City’s failure to provide an “in the alternative” response
waives the privacy rights of third-party employees that are protected by
law.   
 
C.        Timeliness
of Defendant’s Response to the CPRA Request 
 
The
parties dispute whether Plaintiff agreed to toll the CPRA request pending
settlement discussions in the workers’ compensation case and whether
Defendant’s extension of the time to respond until November 6, 2023, complied
with the CPRA.  (See Oppo. 4-5; Reply
3-5.)  The court finds that the response
was timely for the reasons stated by Defendant. 
(See Oppo. 4-5.)  Regardless, the
remedy for an untimely response is to file a lawsuit to compel compliance,
which he has done.  Plaintiff cites no
authority in support of any suggestion that an untimely CPRA response requires
the court to grant the petition.  (See
Reply 4-5; see also Gov. Code § 6253.)  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the court
orders as follows:
 
1.         The
court issues a judgment on behalf of Defendant, and against Plaintiff.
 
2.         Defendant shall lodge a proposed
judgment.
 
3.         Defendant shall provide notice and file
proof of service with the court. 
 
 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
