And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the defendant, the City of Montebello, in a case brought by plaintiff Ismael Navarro, a police officer who was injured on duty. Navarro seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to challenge the taxation of his Labor Code section 4850 benefits. The court has found that the City does not have responsive records, as it has conducted a diligent search and found no documents responsive to Navarro's request. The court has also determined that any list of employees who have been taxed on section 4850 benefits would be exempt from disclosure due to the private and confidential nature of the information. Finally, the court has ruled that the City's response to Navarro's CPRA request was timely and that Navarro's failure to pursue discovery on the adequacy of the City's search was a strategic decision.
