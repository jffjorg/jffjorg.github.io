And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted plaintiff Gerardo Sanchez's motion for monetary sanctions against General Motors LLC (the defendant) for its failure to comply with a court order to produce an expert witness for deposition. The defendant had been ordered to produce the expert by August 23, 2023, but failed to do so. Although the defendant subsequently de-designated its expert, it did not provide a valid reason for its delayed action. The court found that the defendant's failure to comply with the court's order was willful and therefore exercised its discretion to grant the motion and impose sanctions. Specifically, the court will not permit the defendant to present any evidence or facts in opposition to the plaintiff's claims for breach of implied warranty and breach of express warranty at trial.
