And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the motion to quash service of the Summons and Complaint filed by Cosentino Group, S.A., a specially appearing defendant. The plaintiffs, Jaime Blanco Maciel and Helen Ortiz-Blanco, have filed a lawsuit against over 50 defendants, including Cosentino, for injuries sustained by Jaime Blanco Maciel due to inhaling dust from working with products containing crystalline silica.

The judge grants the plaintiffs' request for judicial notice in its entirety. The judge then analyzes the validity of service and finds that the service on Cosentino's Executive Vice-President, Eduardo Cosentino, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, was valid. The judge concludes that the service complied with California law and the Hague Convention.

Regarding personal jurisdiction, the judge finds that the court has the discretion to continue the hearing to allow the plaintiffs to conduct discovery on jurisdictional issues. The judge grants the plaintiffs' request to continue the motion to obtain jurisdictional-related discovery from Cosentino.

The motion to quash is continued to May 31, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The parties are allowed to file and serve supplemental briefs and evidence. The judge declines to rule on the parties' evidentiary objections currently and will rule on them at the next hearing.
