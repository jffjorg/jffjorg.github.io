And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and/or adjudication. The defendant argued that there is no private right of action for the plaintiff, but the court found that the plaintiff has set forth facts to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to the defendant's causation element. The court also noted that the agreement between the parties does not preclude the plaintiff from pursuing a basis for liability based on joint and several liability between the public entities.
