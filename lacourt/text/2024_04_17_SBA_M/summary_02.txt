And here is the English-text summary:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court has denied Ford Motor Company's motion to compel arbitration and stay the court action. The court found that Ford Motor Company failed to establish that it is a party to the arbitration clause or that equitable estoppel principles allow it to enforce the arbitration provision. The court also noted that the moving party failed to provide any facts or evidence to show that the causes of action against it are intimately founded and intertwined with the underlying contract obligation. The court cited several California Court of Appeal decisions in its analysis, including Ford Motor Warranty Cases, Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company, and Kielar v. Superior Court.
