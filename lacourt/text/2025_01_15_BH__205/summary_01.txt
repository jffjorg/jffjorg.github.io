And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to vacate an order of dismissal of a personal injury action. The Plaintiffs, who are Richard Valle, Mason Valle, and Cassidy Valle, allege claims for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence against the Defendants, Ivan Sergeyvich Voronin and Valentina Voronin. The Court set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re: Sanctions for failure to file proof of service on October 8, 2024, but the Plaintiffs failed to serve the Defendants and failed to file a response to the OSC. The Court ordered the complaint dismissed without prejudice on October 23, 2024. The Plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the dismissal on December 12, 2024, citing attorney mistake and neglect.

The Court analyzed the case and determined that mandatory relief was available to vacate the dismissal. The Court granted the motion, vacating the order of dismissal, and set a hearing on the Order to Show Cause for February 11, 2025. The Court also granted Plaintiffs leave to file their proposed response to the OSC, which must be filed and served by February 5, 2025.
