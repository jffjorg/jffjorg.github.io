 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
  Plaintiffs’ motion to
  vacate 
  order of dismissal
  pursuant to 
  code of civil procedure
  section 
  473(b)
 



 
Background
 
This is a personal injury action
arising out of a motor vehicle collision that occurred on February 28, 2023. On
January 9, 2024, Plaintiffs Richard Valle, Mason Valle, a minor, by and through
his Guardian ad Litem Richard Valle, and Cassidy Valle, a minor, by and through
her Guardian ad Litem Richard Valle (“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants Ivan Sergeyvich Voronin and Valentina Voronin (“Defendants”).
Plaintiffs allege claims for (1) Motor vehicle negligence and (2) General
negligence. 
 
On July 8, 2024, the Court set an
OSC re: Sanctions for failure to file proof of service for October 8, 2024. 
 
On September 9, 2024, the Court
continued the OSC re: Sanctions for failure to file proof of service from
October 8, 2024 to October 23, 2024. 
 
On October 23, 2024, the Court
ordered the complaint dismissed without prejudice as Defendants had not been
served and Plaintiffs failed to submit a response to the order to show cause. 
 
On December 12, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion to vacate dismissal. 
 
 
Motion to Vacate Dismissal Standard
 
“Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the court
shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after
entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,
vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting
default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
473 (b).)
 
The mandatory relief provisions require only a sworn
declaration from counsel attesting to his or her “mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect.” No showing that the neglect was excusable is required. (Avila
v. Chua (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 860, 868-869 (“To obtain relief under the
mandatory provisions, plaintiffs’ counsel need not show that his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect was excusable. No reason need be
given for the existence of one of these circumstances. Attestation that one of
these reasons existed is sufficient to obtain relief, unless the trial court
finds that the dismissal did not occur because of these reasons.”) 
 
An application for discretionary or mandatory relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding from which relief is sought. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b); English
v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) 
 
“[W]hen relief under section 473 is available, there is
a strong public policy in favor of granting relief and
allowing the requesting party his or her day in court[.]” (Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 975, 981-82.)
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff argues that the Court should grant mandatory
relief to vacate the order of dismissal. 
 
The Court first addresses whether this case involves a
failure to prosecute, falling outside the scope of mandatory relief. In Clark
v. O’Connor, 2020 Cal. Super. LEXIS 3302 at *1-*2 the court found that
mandatory relief was not available for failure to prosecute where counsel
failed to serve summons and complaint and did not appear for a final status
conference or trial. 
 
Here, although Plaintiffs have failed to serve Defendants
and failed to file a response to the order to show cause, Plaintiffs’ counsel
appeared at the hearing and the case was relatively new. This does not amount
to failure to prosecute. Accordingly, the Court concludes mandatory relief is
available here. 
 
The Court next addresses whether Plaintiffs have met the
requirements for mandatory relief. The Court concludes they have. Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion on December 12, 2024, within six months after dismissal
was ordered on October 23, 2024. Plaintiffs’ attorney’s declaration also avers
that the failure to timely file a case management statement and declaration was
due to attorney mistake or neglect. Counsel attests he failed to calendar
the OSC’s new hearing date correctly on Plaintiff’s attorney’s calendaring
system, which in turn caused plaintiff’s counsel to miss the deadline to file
the Declaration regarding Plaintiffs’ due diligence in serving Defendants. (Bloeser Decl., ¶ 4.)  
 
Accordingly, the Court will vacate the order of dismissal
pursuant to the mandatory relief provisions of Code Civ. Proc. §473(b).  
 
While the Court vacates the order for dismissal,
Plaintiff must still respond to the Order to Show Cause why Defendants have not
been served. (Tustin Plaza Partnership v. Wehage (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th
1557, 1565-1566 (where mandatory relief is granted, plaintiff must still
respond to the underlying motion to dismiss).) 

 
 
Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Vacate Dismissal is GRANTED. 
 
The hearing on the
Order to Show Cause why sanctions should not be imposed for failure to serve
Defendants is set for February 11, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
 
The Court grants
Plaintiffs leave to file their proposed response to the OSC. That response must
be filed and served by February 5, 2025.
