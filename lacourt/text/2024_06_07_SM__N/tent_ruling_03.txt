 Case Number:  22SMCV01528    Hearing Date:   June 7, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGPlaintiffs Sean Towns and Kesia Carter’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Costs and Expenses is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $23,960.80.Plaintiffs Sean Towns and Kesia Carter to give notice.REASONINGOn October 10, 2023, Plaintiffs Sean Towns and Kesia Carter (“Plaintiffs”) and Defendant General Motors LLC (“Defendant”) reached a settlement agreement in this action. (Mot., Hashemi Decl. ¶ 17.) The agreement was signed by Plaintiffs on December 12, 2023, and it was agreed that attorney fees would be determined by way of noticed motion to the Court. (Mot., Hashemi Decl. ¶ 18, Ex. D.) Plaintiffs seek a total of $68,368.30 in fees and costs, which represents fees in the amount of $44,965.00, a lodestar enhancement of 1.5, and costs in the amount of $920.80. Defendant does not dispute Plaintiffs’ entitlement to fees and costs but argues that Plaintiffs should not be awarded more than $25,825.00 in fees and $920.80 in costs. The Court notes that Plaintiffs’ motion papers exceed 15 pages, and Plaintiffs’ reply papers exceed 10 pages, in violation of rule 3.1113(d) of the California Rules of Court. The court has considered the arguments beyond the page limits, but the Court reminds Plaintiffs’ counsel of the obligation to follow the page limits set forth in the California Rules of Court.The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A] computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) Such an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id. at p. 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining the modification of the lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of America (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 271.)First, the Court finds no lodestar multiplier is appropriate here. This action is not particularly complicated, i.e., Plaintiffs simply alleged defects in their vehicle and a failure to repurchase the vehicle and make restitution. This does not involve novel or difficult questions or legal issues unique to this case, and there is no specialized knowledge needed for litigation of an action like this one. There is no evidence that Plaintiffs’ counsel was prevented from taking on other cases because of this case, the fact that Plaintiffs’ counsel was working on a contingent basis is alone not sufficient reason to employ a multiplier, and any failure by prior counsel to resolve this action is also not a relevant consideration. Put simply, a lodestar multiplier is proper only where the work performed involved specialized knowledge or skills, and there is no basis to conclude that any unique knowledge or skills were needed or employed in this case. Thus, the Court declines to use a lodestar multiplier here.As to the fees, the Court finds it improper to award fees and costs related to Defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike as to Plaintiffs’ initial complaint, which took issue with a fraud claim, which was removed in Plaintiffs’ amended pleading. Thus, the Court strikes the 3.8 hours of fees incurred for these motions. The Court also omits 2.6 hours spent drafting the initial complaint, as the complaint included very little information original to Plaintiffs’ case; 3.5 hours spent drafting the First Amended Complaint, for the same reason; 7.8 hours preparing discovery responses using templates (see Opp’n, Major Decl. ¶ 7); 6.4 hours spent reviewing discovery responses; and 3.8 hours spent preparing the present attorney fees motion. Thus, the Court reduces Plaintiffs’ hours by 27.9 hours. The Court also finds that $600 per hour is a high hourly rate for a case that involved no specialized knowledge or issues; thus, the Court reduces the hourly rate to $450 per hour. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ counsel is entitled to fees incurred for 51.2 hours at the rate of $450 per hour. Thus, Plaintiffs Sean Towns and Kesia Carter’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Costs and Expenses is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $23,960.80, which represents $23,040 in attorney fees and $920.80 in costs.
