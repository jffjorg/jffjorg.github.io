And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, which sought to allow guest room occupants to use building amenities. The judge found that the balance of harms weighs in favor of the defendant, the Churchill Condominium Association. The plaintiffs argued that their guests would be harmed if they could not use the amenities, but the judge found that this was not a significant harm. The judge also noted that the defendant would be harmed if it was required to provide access to the amenities to guest room occupants. The judge concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to establish harm to them due to the non-issuance of an injunction, and therefore the balance of harms weighed in favor of the defendant.
