And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion of Christopher F. Wilson and Lanak & Hanna PC to be relieved as counsel for the defendant Kambur Construction Group, Inc. The reason for the withdrawal is the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and the client's breach of the agreement with counsel. The counsel has provided the required forms and served the opposing parties and client. The judge finds good cause to grant the counsel's request to withdraw. The ruling becomes effective upon the filing of proof of service. The judge reminds the defendant that a corporation cannot represent itself in litigation and must be represented by licensed counsel, citing the case CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.
