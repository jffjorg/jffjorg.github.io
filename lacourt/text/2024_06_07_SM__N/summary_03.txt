The court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to fees and costs, but reduced the amount due to excessive hours spent on the case and a high hourly rate. The court also struck fees related to the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike, which were filed against the plaintiffs' initial complaint. The court's ruling is based on the California Rules of Court and various case law, including Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. and Serrano v. Priest.
