Morgan vs. Norms Restaurants, LLC, et. al.,
Case No. 22STCV14857
 
Tentative Ruling re: 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration
 
Defendant Norms Restaurants, LLC
(Defendant) moves to compel Plaintiff Stephen Morgan (Plaintiff) to arbitration
and stay this action pending completion of arbitration. The motion is granted.
 
“On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been
waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the
agreement.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §1281.2,
subds. (a), (b).)
A proceeding to compel arbitration is
in essence a suit in equity to compel specific performance of a contract. (Freeman v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance
Co. (1975) 14 Cal.3d 473, 479.) Such enforcement may be sought by a party
to the arbitration agreement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1280, subd. (e)(1).) 
            The petition to compel arbitration
functions as a motion and is to be heard in the manner of a motion, i.e., the
facts are to be proven by affidavit or declaration and documentary evidence
with oral testimony taken only in the court’s discretion. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§1290.2; Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin.
Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413–414.) The petition to compel
must set forth the provisions of the written agreement and the arbitration
clause verbatim, or such provisions must be attached and incorporated by
reference. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1330; see Condee v. Longwood Mgmt. Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 218 (Condee).)  
            Once petitioners allege that an
arbitration agreement exists, the burden shifts to respondents to prove the
falsity of the purported agreement, and no evidence or authentication is
required to find the arbitration agreement exists. (See Condee, supra, 88
Cal.App.4th at p. 219.) However, if the existence of the agreement is
challenged, “petitioner bears the burden of proving [the arbitration
agreement’s] existence by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities
Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413; see also Espejo v. Southern California Permanente Medical Group (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 1047, 1058–1060.) 
 
Defendant moves to compel arbitration
of Plaintiff’s claims based on the “California Employee Arbitration Agreement”
(the Agreement) signed by Plaintiff on July 25, 2018. The Agreement provides in
relevant part as follows: 
[B]oth you
[Plaintiff] and the Company agree that any claim that you may have against the
Company or its owners, directors, officers, managers, employees, agents . . .
or the Company or such Affiliated Persons may have against you shall be
submitted to and determined exclusively in the County in which you worked for
the Company by a single neutral arbitrator through to final and binding
arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, and not to any court . . .
(Durrani
Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. A.)
 
            Plaintiff does not dispute the
existence of the arbitration agreement or the application of the Agreement to
his claims in this action. Plaintiff opposes this motion solely on the basis
that the Agreement is unenforceable under the Ending Forced Arbitration of
Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA). (9 U.S.C. §§ 401-402.)

 
The EFAA, effective March 3, 2022,
amended the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to bar enforcement of predispute
arbitration agreements in “a case which is filed
under Federal, Tribal, or State law” that relates to a “sexual assault dispute”
or “sexual harassment dispute.” (9 U.S.C. § 402(a).) The term “sexual
harassment dispute” is defined as “a dispute relating to conduct
that is alleged to constitute sexual harassment under applicable Federal,
Tribal, or State law.” (9 U.S.C. § 401(4).) The application of the EFAA to a dispute “shall be
determined under Federal law” and “shall be determined by a court,
rather than an arbitrator,” regardless of any contrary provision in the
challenged agreement. (9
U.S.C. § 402(b).)
Based on the EFAA’s statutory language
and purposes, district courts have concluded that a plaintiff seeking to invoke
the EFAA must first plead a claim for sexual assault or sexual harassment “under
applicable Federal, Tribal, or State law"
sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under FRCP Rule 12(b)(6).  (See Yost v.
Everyrealm, Inc. (S.D.N.Y., Feb. 24, 2023) 2023 WL 2224450, at *16; Turner
v. Tesla, Inc. (N.D. Cal., Aug. 11, 2023) 2023 WL 6150805, at *5-6; K.T.
v. A Place for Rover (E.D. Pa., Oct. 31, 2023) 2023 WL 7167580, at *5
[citing Yost].) If a sexual harassment
dispute or sexual assault dispute is sufficiently pled, the EFAA’s “invalidation
of an arbitration agreement extends to the entirety of the case relating to the
sexual harassment dispute, not merely the discrete claims in that case that
themselves either allege such harassment or relate to a sexual harassment
dispute (for example, a claim of unlawful retaliation for a
report of sexual harassment).” (Johnson
v. Everyrealm, Inc. (S.D.N.Y., Feb. 24, 2023) 2023 WL 2216173, at *18; Turner,
supra, 2023 WL 6150805 at *5.)
 
Accordingly, here,
Plaintiff must sufficiently allege conduct “constitut[ing] sexual
harassment [or sexual assault] under applicable Federal, Tribal, or State law” before
invoking the EFAA to invalidate the parties’ arbitration agreement. (9 U.S.C. §
401(4).) If Plaintiff properly alleges a “sexual harassment dispute” or “sexual
assault dispute,” the predispute arbitration agreement is barred as to any
claim that “relates to the . . . dispute” (9 U.S.C. § 402(a)), even if the
claim is not itself for sexual harassment or sexual assault. (Johnson, supra,
2023 WL 2216173 at *18.)
 
Sexual harassment
is prohibited by the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) under California
law (Gov. Code § 12940, subd. (a)), and by title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 under federal law (42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.). Courts generally distinguish
between two categories of sexual harassment: “quid pro quo harassment, where a term of employment or employment
itself is conditioned upon submission to unwelcome sexual advances”; and hostile
work environment, “where the harassment is sufficiently pervasive so as to
alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive work environment.’ ” (Beyda
v. City of Los Angeles (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 511, 516–17.)
“In evaluating a sexual
harassment claim based upon a hostile work environment, two things must be
determined: has the employee been subjected to a hostile work environment and,
if so, is the employer liable for the harassment that caused the hostile work
environment?” (Sheffield v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Social Services
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 153, 162.) “[T]he question of whether or not there is a hostile work
environment must be determined from the totality of the circumstances. . . . In
making this determination the trier of fact should consider, ‘(1) the nature of
the unwelcome sexual acts or words (with physical touching generally considered
more offensive than mere words); (2) the frequency of the offensive acts or
encounters; (3) the total number of days over which all the offensive conduct
occurred; and (4) the context in which the sexually harassing conduct
occurred.’ ” (Ibid.) “In determining what constitutes ‘sufficiently
pervasive’ harassment, the courts have held that acts of harassment cannot be
occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial, rather the plaintiff must show a
concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated, routine or a generalized
nature.” (Fisher
v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 610.)
Here, Plaintiff was
allegedly employed by Defendant as a general manager. (Comp. ¶ 7.) On October
30, 2022, while reviewing camera footage of a prior night shift, Plaintiff
“noticed that a male cashier was looking at a video of scantily dressed women
while working in an open area within the restaurant.” (Comp. ¶ 11.) Plaintiff
also saw “a female employee near the cashier to whom the phone was visible.”
(Comp. ¶ 11.)  Earlier that year, the
female employee had complained that she was subjected to an unwanted touching
by a co-worker. (Comp. ¶ 11.) “Because he wanted to assure that his restaurant
and the employees he supervised were not subject to . . . sexual harassment of
any kind,” Plaintiff called the male cashier in and issued him a written
warning for use of his phone and sexual harassment. (Comp. ¶ 11.) Plaintiff
alleges that he was later terminated in part for reporting the cashier’s
misconduct. (Comp. ¶ 14.)
 
The Court finds
that Plaintiff has failed to allege a “sexual harassment dispute” under the
EFAA. The alleged conduct relates to
Plaintiff’s retaliation and wrongful termination claims – Plaintiff’s
report of one incident in which a male cashier viewed “a video of scantily dressed women” near a female employee (Comp. ¶ 11).  This shows only “occasional, isolated,
sporadic, or trivial” harassment, rather than any “concerted pattern of
harassment.” (Fisher, supra, 214 Cal.App.3d at 610.) This is
insufficient to “constitute sexual harassment under applicable Federal, Tribal,
or State law.” (9 U.S.C. § 401(4).)  Consequently,
the EFAA does not apply to Plaintiff’s claims, and the parties’ arbitration
agreement is enforceable.
