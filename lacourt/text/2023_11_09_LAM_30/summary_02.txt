  - "The term ‘sexual harassment dispute’ is defined as ‘a dispute relating to conduct that is alleged to constitute sexual harassment under applicable Federal, Tribal, or State law.’"
  - "Plaintiff must sufficiently allege conduct ‘constituting sexual harassment [or sexual assault] under applicable Federal, Tribal, or State law’ before invoking the EFAA to invalidate the parties’ arbitration agreement."
  - "The EFAA does not apply to Plaintiff’s claims, and the parties’ arbitration agreement is enforceable."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Norms Restaurants, LLC, moves to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims based on the California Employee Arbitration Agreement signed by the plaintiff on July 25, 2018. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the agreement is unenforceable under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA). The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to allege a "sexual harassment dispute" under the EFAA, as the alleged conduct is isolated and trivial and does not constitute a "concerted pattern of harassment." Therefore, the EFAA does not apply to the plaintiff's claims, and the parties' arbitration agreement is enforceable.
