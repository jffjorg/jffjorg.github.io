And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication on the plaintiff's second and fourth causes of action for intentional misrepresentation and deceit. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants fraudulently represented to him that he was not subject to sales quotas or goals after 2015, and that they concealed the existence of the MUA program, which ranked agents based on their sales performance and terminated those who did not meet certain metrics. The judge found that there were triable issues of material fact on these claims, including whether the MUA program imposed sales quotas, whether the defendants intended to induce the plaintiff's reliance, and whether the plaintiff justifiably relied on the defendants' representations. The judge also rejected the defendants' argument that they did not owe the plaintiff a duty to disclose the existence of the MUA program, and that the plaintiff's reliance was unreasonable as a matter of law.
