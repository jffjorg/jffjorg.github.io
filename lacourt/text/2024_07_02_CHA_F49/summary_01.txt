Here's a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting summary judgment to defendant Dr. Mesbah in a medical malpractice case. The case involves a complaint filed by plaintiff Andrey Rossius, D.M.D. against several defendants, including Dr. Mesbah and other healthcare providers. Dr. Mesbah filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that he is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because the plaintiff cannot establish the necessary elements of the cause of action for medical malpractice.

The judge found that Dr. Mesbah has met his initial burden by submitting unopposed expert declarations, which establish a prima facie showing that justifies a ruling in his favor. The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of a triable material factual issue. However, since the plaintiff has not submitted any opposition to the motion and there is no countervailing evidence, the judge concludes that the plaintiff has not met the burden of demonstrating the existence of a triable material factual issue.

The judge grants the motion for summary judgment, stating that Dr. Mesbah is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. The judge notes that expert testimony is required to establish the standard of care in medical malpractice cases, and that Dr. Mesbah's unopposed declarations serve as expert testimony. The judge also cites precedents, such as the California Supreme Court's ruling in O'Connor v. Bloomer, which holds that expert testimony is necessary to establish the standard of care in medical malpractice cases.
