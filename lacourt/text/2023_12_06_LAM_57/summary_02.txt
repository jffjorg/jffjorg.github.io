And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a partition action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant. The defendant has moved to vacate a default that was entered against her by the court clerk. The judge is denying the defendant's motion. The judge finds that the defendant's declaration does not justify the relief from default that she seeks under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b). The defendant's declaration does not adequately explain why she took over three months to file her motion to vacate default, and she has not presented sufficient justification for Section 473(b) relief. The court notes that disposition of cases on the merits, rather than through defaults, is the preferred course, but in this case, the defendant has not acted with reasonable diligence to set aside the default when the purported confusion and mistake was called to her attention.
