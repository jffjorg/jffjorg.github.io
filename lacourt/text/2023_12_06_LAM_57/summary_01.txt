And here is the English-text summary:

In the tentative ruling, Judge [Judge's Name] has decided to overrule the demurrer of Defendant Brock Real Estate to the cross-complaint of Plaintiffs Piotr Kuczynski and Emily Kuczynski. Brock Real Estate had argued that the fraud-based claims against them are barred by the three-year statute of limitations, but the Court believes that the allegations in the cross-complaint fall under the discovery rule, which means the statute of limitations does not apply. Additionally, the Judge has denied the motion to strike of Defendant Brock Harris, finding that the allegations in the cross-complaint support an award of damages for emotional distress, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. The Court will hear the case on December 6, 2023.
