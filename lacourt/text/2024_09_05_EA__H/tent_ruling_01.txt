  Case Number:  24PSCV00056    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiff Oaktree Business Park, LLC’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice. 
Background
Plaintiff Oaktree Business Park, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that it owns
the real property located at 437 South Cataract Avenue, Suite #3 in San Dimas (the
“subject property”) and that its tenants, Defendant Sanjesh Sharma (‘Sharma”)
and Defendant New Ventures, Inc. (“NVI”), breached the lease agreement.  
On January 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of
action against Sharma, NVI, and Doe 1 through Doe 50 for (1) breach of lease and
damages under Civil Code § 1951.2 et seq.; and (2) common counts.
On March 11, 2024, the Clerk entered default against Sharma and NVI.
Plaintiff has filed an application for default judgment against Sharma and NVI.
A Case Management Conference is set for September 5, 2024.
  
Discussion 
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted: 
1.       Plaintiff seeks $1,933.50
in general damages (Judicial Council Form CIV-100, ¶ 2(B)(2)), which it represents consists of $128.90 in daily damages
for the time period of February 1, 2024 through February 15, 2024. (Wright
Decl., ¶ 5). Plaintiff alleged in the complaint that Defendants vacated the
premises on October 21, 2023 (Complaint, ¶ 9), whereas Plaintiff’s property
manager, Griffin Wright, attests that Defendants vacated the premises on
February 15, 2024. (Wright Decl., ¶ 4). Plaintiff did not request daily damages
in its complaint. 
“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot
exceed that demanded in the complaint, in the statement required by Section
425.11, or in the statement provided for by Section 425.115.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 580. Subd. (a).) “[I]n all default judgments the demand sets a ceiling on
recovery.” (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824.)
2.       Plaintiff is directed to
provide the Court with a statement of account, to the extent one exists, as well as an explanation of how the $39,932.88 in
unpaid rent was calculated for the time period of July 1, 2023 through January
31, 2024.
Accordingly, the Court
denies Plaintiff’s application without prejudice and directs Plaintiff to
submit a new default judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned defects.
