And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Oaktree Business Park, LLC, has applied for default judgment against defendants Sanjesh Sharma and New Ventures, Inc. However, the judge has denied this application without prejudice due to several defects. Specifically, the plaintiff's request for $1,933.50 in general damages is inconsistent with the dates of breach alleged in the complaint and the dates of actual vacancy of the premises. Additionally, the plaintiff has not provided a statement of account or an explanation of how the $39,932.88 in unpaid rent was calculated. The judge directs the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment packet that addresses these defects. A Case Management Conference is set for September 5, 2024, to discuss the case further.
