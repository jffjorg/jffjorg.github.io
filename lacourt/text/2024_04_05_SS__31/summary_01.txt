And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion to consolidate three cases (22STCV07229, 22STCV15350, and 23CHCV02375) that arose out of the same motor vehicle accident on January 24, 2022. The cases have been deemed related and are pending in Dept. 31. The moving party, A & A West Coast Distribution Inc., has filed a motion to consolidate the cases on the grounds that they involve common questions of law or fact. The court has considered the timeliness, complexity, and potential prejudice of the motion and finds that consolidation is in the interest of justice. The trial dates for the consolidated cases are set for June 3, 2024, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
