And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Gross-Reseda Company LLC's motion for a protective order to limit Plaintiff Santos Pocasangre's discovery requests. The Plaintiff had requested additional discovery, including special interrogatories, requests for admission, and form interrogatories, claiming that the Defendant's previous responses were incomplete and that the additional requests were necessary for expediency. The Defendant argued that the requests were unduly burdensome, cumulative, and harassing, but the court found that the Defendant had not adequately shown that the requests were sufficiently burdensome or harassing. The court notes that the discovery requests include follow-up questions to the Defendant's prior responses and seek further information on specific issues, such as inspection policies and tenant responsibilities. The court concludes that the Defendant's motion is denied.
