Significant Statements:
  - "A defendant seeking summary judgment must 'conclusively negate[] a necessary element of the plaintiff's case, or . . . demonstrate[] that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of trial.'" (Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 334)
  - "The defendant may, but need not, present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action. The defendant may also present evidence that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence â€“ as through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered nothing." (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 855)
  - "If plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses." (Weber v. John Crane, Inc. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1440)
  - "The request for a continuance is denied."
  - "Because Plaintiffs did not show a disputed issue, the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED."

The Court has denied the request for a continuance of the hearing and has granted the motion for summary judgment. The defendant is to file a proposed judgment within five days.
