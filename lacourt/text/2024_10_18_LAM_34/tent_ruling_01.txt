Background    
 
Plaintiff Howard Meltzer (“Plaintiff”) alleges as
follows: 
 
In
2022, Plaintiff purchased a used 2019 Mercedes-Benz A220W from Mercedes-Benz of
Beverly Hills. The vehicle has been out of service at Mercedes-Benz of Beverly
Hills for a cumulative of more than 30 days. Plaintiff has contacted
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC regarding the defects of the vehicle, but Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC has willfully refused to repurchase the vehicle, despite the
warranties that accompanied the sale of the vehicle to Plaintiff. 
 
On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff
filed the operative complaint against Defendants Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC
(“Manufacturer”), Mercedes-Benz of Beverly Hills (“Dealer”), and Does 1 through
10, asserting causes of action for:
 
1.    
Violation
of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty
2.    
Violation
of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty
3.    
Violation
of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2
4.    
Violation
of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.22 – Tanner Consumer Protection Act.
 
On July 3, 2024, Plaintiff moved to deem the truth of all
matters specified in Plaintiff’s Request for Admission Set One, admitted
against Manufacturer. On August 5, 2024, Manufacturer opposed the motion.
Plaintiff did not reply. 
 
A Final Status Conference is set for December 20, 2024, and
a jury trial is set for January 6, 2025. 
 
 
Legal Standard
 
When a party fails to serve a timely response to a request for
admission, the party propounding the request for admission may move for an
order to deem the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response waives any objection,
including one based on privilege or work product. (Id., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to
whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on
the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
 
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff contends to have served Requests for Admissions,
Set One, on Manufacturer on November 9, 2023. (Yashar Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 1.)
Plaintiff contends to have not received any responses. (Yashar Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)
 
In opposition, Manufacturer contends the requests were not
properly served because Plaintiff’s counsel only mailed them to one junior
attorney from defense counsel’s firm, which was not received. (Hom Decl., ¶ 3.)
Manufacturer also contends the separate email sent by Plaintiff’s counsel to
the same junior attorney was an improper address because the parties had not
agreed upon it. (Hom Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) Manufacturer further indicates having
attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff to avoid this motion, but to no
avail. (Hom Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. A.) Manufacturer then argues that the motion is
moot because Manufacturer has served responses to the subject discovery
requests. (Hom Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. B.)
 
The court finds that Plaintiff’s motion is moot in light of
Manufacturer’s responses having been recently served before the hearing on this
motion. (Hom Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. B; Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Accordingly, the court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion as moot.
 
With respect to monetary sanctions, the Court notes that
they are mandatory in connection with a motion to deem requests for admissions
admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) That being said, the court
finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s methods of effecting service in this matter and
failure to meet and confer with opposing counsel problematic. The court will
therefore award Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $461.65,
comprised of one hour of work, multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate of $400.00,
plus the $61.65 filing fee. Said monetary sanctions must be paid by counsel for
Manufacturer within 20 days of the court’s order.
