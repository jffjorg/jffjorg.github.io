And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by plaintiff Howard Meltzer to deem the truth of all matters specified in his request for admission set one, admitted against defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The motion was opposed by the defendant, who argued that the requests for admission were not properly served and that the plaintiff's counsel failed to meet and confer with opposing counsel. The judge found that the motion is moot because the defendant has recently served responses to the discovery requests. Therefore, the judge denied the motion as moot. However, the judge also found that the plaintiff's counsel's methods of effecting service and failure to meet and confer with opposing counsel were problematic. As a result, the judge awarded the plaintiff monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $461.65, which must be paid by counsel for the defendant within 20 days of the court's order.
