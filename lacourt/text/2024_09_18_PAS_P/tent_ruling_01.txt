  Case Number:  22AHCV00268    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]  ORDER ON PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR AN ORDER CHARGING JUDGMENT DEBTOR’S  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN LLCINTRODUCTION           This is a commercial loan dispute. Plaintiff Cadlerock  Joint Venture, L.P. sued defendants Edith Enterprise Ltd., Helen Young, Does  I-X, and Roe Corporations XI-XX on May 9, 2022, for breach of contract, unjust  enrichment, and promissory estoppel. Plaintiff sought to recover an outstanding  balance of approximately $25,000.00 on a line of credit issued to Defendants by  CitiBank, who later assigned the contract to Plaintiff. The Court entered judgment  for Cadlerock and against Edith and Young in the amount of approximately  $50,000.00. A cross-claim against Citi remains unresolved. On  July 11, 2024, Plaintiff moved for an order charging Defendant Young’s  partnership interest in a company called “Monterey Edith LLC” (California  Entity No. 200424610025) until the approximately $50,000.00 outstanding on  the judgment is paid. No  party filed an opposition, and Plaintiff filed no reply. “If  a money judgment is rendered against a partner or member but not against the  partnership or limited liability company, the judgment debtor’s interest in the  partnership or limited liability company may be applied toward the satisfaction  of the judgment by an order charging the judgment debtor’s interest pursuant to  Section 15907.03, 16504, or 17705.03 of the Corporations Code.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 708.310.) For LLCs, “[Corporations Code] section [17705.03] provides  the exclusive remedy by which a person seeking to enforce a judgment against a  member or transferee may, in the capacity of judgment creditor, satisfy the  judgment from the judgment debtor’s transferable interest.” The  Court’s record reflects that Defendant Young is a judgment debtor. Plaintiffs’  counsel conducted a debtor’s exam of Young on April 29, 2024, during which she  confirmed “she was a member/owner and manager of [Monterey Edith LLC].” (Sayyar  Decl., ¶ 7; id., Exh. 2 (Exam Transcript), 66:15-25, 67:1-13, 68:11-25,  69:1-10, 70:1-25, and 75:5-112.) Money  judgment has been rendered against Young, one of Monterey’s partners or  members; per section 17705.03, her interest may be applied toward satisfaction  of the judgment.  The  unopposed motion is granted.  Plaintiff is to give notice.Dated: September 18, 2024        JARED D. MOSES JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT[TENTATIVE]
ORDER ON CROSS-DEFENDANT CITIBANK’S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGSThe motion is granted in
part, without leave to amend.I.        INTRODUCTION          This is a commercial loan dispute. Plaintiff Cadlerock
Joint Venture, L.P. sued defendants Edith Enterprise Ltd. (“Edith”), Helen
Young (“Young”), Does I-X, and Roe Corporations XI-XX on May 9, 2022, for
breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and promissory estoppel. Plaintiff
sought to recover an outstanding balance of approximately $25,000.00 on a line
of credit issued to Defendants by CitiBank, who later assigned the contract to
Plaintiff.          On April 3, 2023, Edith and Young (“Cross-Complainants”) cross-complained
against cross-defendant CitiBank, N.A. ( “Citi”). Cross-Complainants filed
their operative third amended cross-complaint (“TAXC”) on January 10, 2024. The
TAXC asserts causes of action for (1) breach of written and
implied-in-fact contract; (2) conversion; (3) negligence; (4) fraudulent
transfers; (5) unfair business practices; (6) breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing; (7) financial elder abuse; (8) violations of the
Electronic Funds Transfers Act; and (9) a common count.          On May 16, 2024, Citi moved for judgment on the TAXC. On
September 6, 2024, Cross-Complainants filed their opposition, and on September
11, 2024, Citi replied.           II.      LEGAL STANDARDA defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings
when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action against the defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 438(b)(1) and (c)(1)(B)(ii).)
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general
demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings
or by matters that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic
evidence is … not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999, citations
omitted.)          The
standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially
the same as that applicable to a general demurrer: that under the state of the
pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears
that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Schabarum v.
California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.) The court “must
accept as true all material facts properly pleaded, but does not
consider conclusions of law or fact, opinions, speculation,
or allegations contrary to law or facts that are judicially noticed.” (Stevenson
Real Estate Services, Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Services, Inc.
(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1219-1220, citing Shea Homes Limited
Partnership v. County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.) III.     EVIDENTIARY MATTERSCiti
requests judicial notice of the Court’s August 7, 2023 order granting Citi’s
motion for judgment on the first amended cross-complaint. The request is
granted. (See Evid. Code, § 452(a), (c), (d).)           IV.     MEETING AND
CONFERENCE          Code of Civil Procedure section 439 requires a party moving
for judgment on the pleadings to meet and confer with its opponent prior to
filing. Citi’s counsel submitted a declaration that satisfies section 439. (See
Kenney Decl., ¶¶ 3-8.) V.      ANALYSISA.
First and Sixth Causes of Action for Breach of Contract and Covenant          1. Breach of Contract (First
Cause of Action)A
plaintiff asserting breach of contract must plead (1) the existence of a
contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse, (3) breach of the
contract, and (4) causation and harm. (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 222
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) Citi
contends Cross-Complainants have not satisfied the first or third elements of their
breach of contract action, because their TAXC “vaguely refers to a written
contract and Citibank’s alleged breach of such contract without alleging any
facts relating to the specific terms which Citibank allegedly breached.” (Mot.,
3:19-21.) Citi cites this Court’s prior order, wherein the Hon. Judge Margaret
Oldendorf held “[t]he pleading does not contain facts supporting the existence
of an agreement ... including which terms Citibank is alleged to have
breached.” (08-07-2023 Order, 3:1-3.)Cross-Complainants
have cured this deficiency. “A plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the
contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction Protective
Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 199.) New
allegations in the TAXC specify the agreement Edith refers to – not only the
credit line agreement itself, but also the condition that it maintain a
checking account with Citi in order to access the line. Specifically,
Cross-Complainants’ TAXC newly alleges: “Edith and Citibank entered into a binding
and enforceable contract ..., pursuant to which Edith was required to maintain
a business checking account with Citibank for direct withdrawal of loan
payments. Also, the business checking account must be used as borrower’s
primary operating account. Pursuant to that contract, Edith was required to
agree to these requirements before the Credit Line could be formally
activated.” (TAXC, ¶ 58.)Cross-Complainants
allege Citi provided Edith with a line of credit; they also allege Edith’s
agreement to open an account at Citi was part of the consideration for that
credit line. (See TAXC, ¶ 58 [“Pursuant to the contract, Edith was required to
agree ...”].) The contract and its essential terms have been pled, as has
Citi’s breach.          The motion is denied as to the first cause of action for
breach of contract. 2.
Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
(Sixth Cause of Action)The
motion is denied on the same basis as to Cross-Complainants’ sixth cause of
action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. “ ‘The [implied]
covenant of good faith and fair dealing [is] implied by law in every contract.’
(Citation.) The covenant is read into contracts and functions ‘as a supplement to
the express contractual covenants, to prevent a contracting party from engaging
in conduct which (while not technically transgressing the express covenants)
frustrates the other party's rights to the benefits of the contract.’ (Racine
& Laramie, Ltd. v. Department of Parks & Recreation (1992) 11
Cal.App.4th 1026, 1031–1032.) The covenant also requires each party to do
everything the contract presupposes the party will do to accomplish the
agreement's purposes. (Harm v. Frasher (1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 405,
417.) A breach of the implied covenant of good faith is a breach of the
contract (Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc.
(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1393.), and ‘breach of a specific provision of the
contract is not ... necessary’ to a claim for breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing (Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon
Development California, Inc. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 342, 373 & fn. 12.).” (Thrifty
Payless, Inc. v. The Americana at Brand, LLC (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1230,
1244.) Cross-Complainants allege Citi interfered with their
performance by draining Edith’s checking account of funds while also requiring it
use only that account to pay off its line of credit. Accepted as true, this
action interfered with Edith’s performance, even though it was not expressly
contemplated in the parties’ agreement. Each of the other elements of the claim
– contract, performance, breach – is discussed above regarding the first cause
of action.The motion is denied as to the sixth cause of action
for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.          B.
Second Cause of Action for ConversionConversion
has three elements: (1) a plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of
property, (2) a defendant’s wrongful act or disposition of the property
that interferes with plaintiff's possession, and (3) damages. (McKell v.
Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1491.)Citi
contends Cross-Complainants cannot state a cause of action for conversion
because, as a matter of law, no claim for conversion lies against a bank for
its mismanagement of deposited funds. Cross-Complainants argue Citi’s legal
authority for this rule is obsolete. Cross-Complainants cite Fong v. East
West Bank (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 224 (Fong);j the Fong court
held that “there is no special rule preventing a depositor from pursuing a
conversion action against the bank that holds his or her money”, and “courts
have found an action for conversion proper when the property at issue was some
form of financial interest.” (Id., at p. 232-233.)          Citi replies that Fong is inapposite because it
“concerned a bank’s conversion of a negotiable instrument [a certificate of
deposit], ... [and a] bank can convert a negotiable instrument.” (Reply,
5:10-16.)          The Court agrees with Citi. Although the Fong court
framed its discussion broadly, it only held, as relevant, that “[f]inancial
institutions can be liable to their depositors for transferring money out of
their accounts on forged instruments” (Fong, supra, at p.
235, italics added) – which is not alleged here. All other case law, including
the law cited in Fong, suggests an intangible asset may be converted,
but only if it is represented in a tangible instrument. (See Welco
Electronics, Inc. v. Mora (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 202, 211-212 [wrongful
charges to credit card may be conversion because “there can be a conversion of
intangible rights represented by special instruments”].) Properly construed,
Cross-Complainants’ quote from Fong confirms that just because a
plaintiff deposits funds with a bank doesn’t mean he can’t sue them for
converting other assets apart from those deposited funds.          The motion is granted without leave to amend as to the
second cause of action for conversion.           C. Third Cause of Action for Negligence          The Court granted judgment on the pleadings on Cross-Complainants’
third cause of action in its August 2023 order because “Edith alleges only
economic harm and thus the claim is barred by the economic loss rule.” (08-07-2023
Order, 5:22-23.)          Cross-Complainants have not amended their TAXC to allege
non-economic harm. In the portion of their pleading related to the third cause
of action, Cross-Complainants discuss Citi’s duties at length. (See TAXC, ¶¶
88-97.) But as to harm, they still allege only that “Edith have [sic]
suffered harm as a result of Citibank’s conduct.” (TAXC, ¶ 101.)          All the pleadings in this case make clear that this is
primarily a financial dispute. Cross-Complainants have been given three
opportunities to identify non-economic injury, and they have not. The motion is
granted without leave to amend.           D. Fourth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes of Action for
Fraudulent Transfer, Financial Elder Abuse, and Violations of the Electronic
Funds Transfer Act.Cross-Complainants
did not oppose Citi’s motion as to the fourth, seventh, and eighth causes of
action. The motion is granted as to each, without leave to amend. As to the
fourth cause of action, Cross-Complainants allege in their pleading that Citi
did not transfer Edith’s funds outside of the bank, but continues to maintain
them “in a ‘special account’ ”. (See TAXC, ¶ 106.) Without a transfer, there
can be no fraudulent transfer.As
to the seventh cause of action, Cross-Complainants have not pled facts
showing Young was an elder at relevant times. And they have only pled that
Edith’s property was taken, not Young’s.As
to the eighth cause of action: the Court is persuaded that the Electronic Funds
Transfer Act applies to consumer accounts; the account in question was Edith’s
business account. More importantly, Cross-Complainants have not opposed this
portion of Citi’s motion, so the Court cannot ascertain what allegations in the
TAXC could establish liability under the Act.The
motion is granted without leave to amend as to the fourth, seventh, and eighth
causes of action. E.
Fifth and Ninth Causes of Action for Unfair Business Practices and Common CountThe
Court denied judgment on the pleadings as to the fifth cause of action in its
August 2023 Order. (See 08-07-2023 Order, 7:12 [“a claim under the UCL is
adequately alleged”].) Judgment remains denied.As
to the ninth cause of action, the Court indicated in its prior order that a
common count would be pled when a contract or agreement was established. (Id.,
7:13-20.) As discussed above, an agreement has been pled. The motion fails as
to the ninth cause of action.           VI.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDERThe motion is denied as to the first, fifth, sixth,
and ninth causes of action.The motion is granted without leave to amend as to the
second, third, fourth, seventh, and eighth causes of action.
