And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Deeson Pan's Motion to Set Aside and Vacate and Enter Another and Different Judgment. The Plaintiff had alleged that the Court's previous judgment was incorrect and that he was not given a fair opportunity to respond to the Requests for Admission. However, the Court found that the Plaintiff had failed to present sufficient evidence to support his claims and had not followed proper procedures in serving his responses to the Requests for Admission. The Court also noted that the Plaintiff had not filed a sworn declaration attesting to the facts presented in the Amended Memorandum of Points and Authorities or authenticating the exhibits filed along with the Motion. The Court denied the Plaintiff's Motion and ordered that the previous judgment stand.
