III.          
ANALYSIS
Defendant moves
for an order compelling the deposition of Plaintiff Cynthia Ricks on the ground
that she did not appear at several noticed depositions or serve any objections
prior to the depositions.
On July 21, 2023,
Defendant electronically served the first Notice of Testimony and Records
Deposition of Plaintiff Cynthia Ricks set for October 25, 2023.  (Kim Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A.)  Defense counsel requested alternative dates
to depose Plaintiff in case Plaintiff or her counsel were unavailable.  (Id. at ¶ 4, Ex. B.)  On October 20, 2023, Defendant electronically
served the second Notice of Testimony and Records Deposition set for November
28, 2023.  (Id. at ¶ 5, Ex.
C.)  On November 27, 2023, Defendant reached
out to Plaintiff’s counsel to confirm Plaintiff’s deposition set for November
28, 2023.  (Id. at ¶ 6, Ex.
D.)  She was informed that Plaintiff
would not be appearing at the deposition, thus, the parties agreed on a new
date for the deposition in January 2024. 
(Ibid.)  On November 27,
2023, Defendant electronically served the third Notice of Testimony and Records
Deposition set for January 23, 2024.  (Id.
at ¶ 7, Ex. E.)  
On January 11,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel informed defense counsel that Plaintiff was unable to
talk and only her daughter had information regarding the circumstances.  (Id. at ¶ 8, Ex. F.)  Defense counsel requested the deposition of
Plaintiff’s daughter.  (Ibid.)  On March 4, 2024, Defendant electronically
served the fourth Notice of Testimony and Records Deposition set for March 25,
2024.  (Id. at ¶ 9, Ex. G.)  On March 25, 2024, Plaintiff’s daughter was
deposed and testified that she was not aware of any physical or mental
condition preventing Plaintiff from speaking at a deposition; she was
unavailable because she was in Las Vegas, Nevada.  (Id. at ¶ 10, Ex. H.)  On April 22, 2024, Defendant electronically
served the fifth Notice of Testimony and Records Deposition set for June 6,
2024.  (Id. at ¶ 11, Ex. I.)  
On May 30, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel informed defense counsel that Plaintiff was in the hospital
for an uncertain period.  (Id. at
¶ 12, Ex. J.)  On July 2, 2024, Defendant
electronically served the sixth Notice of Testimony and Records Deposition set
for August 1, 2024.  (Id. ¶ 13,
Ex. K.)  On July 31, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel requested a link to allow for the deposition to be taken remotely and
Defendant provided the link.  (Id.
at ¶ 14, Ex. L.)  Plaintiff did not serve
an objection to the deposition set for August 1, 2024.  (Id. at ¶ 15.)  On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff failed to appear
at the deposition.  (Id. at ¶ 16,
Ex. M.)  The court reporter prepared and
certified a certificate of non-appearance. 
(Ibid.)  Following
Plaintiff’s failure to appear at the August 1, 2024, deposition, defense
counsel left multiple phone messages and sent emails to Plaintiff’s counsel,
but she did not receive a response.  (Id.
at ¶¶ 18-20, Ex. N.)  As of the date of
the Motion, Defendant has not received a response from Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s
counsel.  (Id. at ¶ 21.)
Defendant argues
that good cause exists for an order compelling Plaintiff’s attendance at a
deposition given that she has failed to appear at six properly noticed
depositions.  After Plaintiff failed to
appear at the deposition set for August 1, 2024, defense counsel attempted to
meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel but did not receive any responses.  In opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel states
that he has “had difficulties in getting [his] client's cooperation for her
deposition. She is an elderly woman with with [sic] Medical Issues.”  (Yeager Decl. ¶ 2.)
The Court finds
that Defendant has presented sufficient evidence of his efforts to schedule
Plaintiff’s deposition and Plaintiff’s continuous failure to attend the noticed
depositions without serving valid objections. 
Defendant has also demonstrated that he has attempted to resolve the
issue with Plaintiff’s counsel prior to filing the instant Motion.  Plaintiff’s opposition does not dispute
Defendant’s claims.  However, the Court notes
that Defendant has not complied with Code Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (b)(2), which
requires the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  As demonstrated by previous deposition notices,
Defendant intends to demand production of various documents.
Based on the evidence presented, the
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s attendance at a properly
noticed deposition within 30 days of notice of the Court’s order.  The Court does not make a ruling regarding any
demands for production of documents.
IV.          
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant
L.A. Downtown Medical Center, Inc.’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to appear at a properly
noticed deposition within 30 days of notice of the Court’s order.
Defendant L.A.
Downtown Medical Center, Inc. is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
