And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $5,989.50. The motion was filed in connection with the enforcement of a settlement agreement entered into by the parties. The settlement agreement provided that the non-breaching party was entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in the event of a breach. The defendant breached the agreement by failing to make payments, and the plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the settlement. The court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant. The judge found that the plaintiff is the prevailing party and that the settlement agreement authorized an award of attorney's fees. The judge also found that the billing rate and time spent by the plaintiff's counsel in enforcing the settlement were reasonable.
