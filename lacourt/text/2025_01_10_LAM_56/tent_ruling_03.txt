MOVING PARTY:  Plaintiff Paula R. Green (“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
            On March 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed
the instant legal malpractice action. On November 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
operative first amended complaint (“First Amended Complaint”) alleging causes
of action for: (1) legal malpractice; and (2) malicious prosecution. The legal
malpractice claim is asserted only against Defendants Matthew Green, Rhett
Warriner, Michael Riley, and Warriner, Green & Riley, LLP; the malicious
prosecution claim is asserted against all Defendants.  
 
            On December 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for order to lift stay of this action (the “Motion”). The
Motion is unopposed. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A court ordinarily has inherent
power, in its discretion, to stay proceedings when a stay will accommodate the
ends of justice. (OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho (2019) 8 Cal.5th 111, 141.) The
“power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court
to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and
effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” (Id.) “[I]mplicit in
a court’s issuance of a stay is the reality that when the stay has served its
purpose, the matter ‘may proceed here under the original complaint. . .’ ” (St.
Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company v. AmericourceBergen Corp. (2022) 80
Cal.App.5th 1, 19.) While St. Paul dealt with a stay issued under Code
of Civil Procedure Section 410.30, the court finds it instructive on its
authority to lift a stay it initially issued. A trial court “has jurisdiction
to modify, revoke, or set its orders aside.” (People v. Eggers, (1947)
30 Cal.2d 676.) 
 
On March 29, 2023, this Court issued a
ruling staying this action pending the resolution of the consolidated appeals
that were filed in the action entitled Robert Green v. Paula R. Green,
LASC Case No. 20STCV05251 (the “Underlying Action”). The Court of Appeal issued
a Remittitur in the Underlying Action on May 16, 2024 (Mot., Ex. 2.) Accordingly,
the Court finds that lifting the stay is now appropriate.  
 
 
The Motion is GRANTED. The stay in this
action shall be lifted effective as of January 13, 2025. Any responses to the
FAC that have not yet been submitted must be filed within 20 days of the date
of this order.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 10th day of January 2025
