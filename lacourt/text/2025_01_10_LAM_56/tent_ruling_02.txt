MOVING
PARTY:  Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Walter

RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendants/Cross-Complainants Centurion Protection Services and Richard
Ray Dudgeon (“Cross-Complainants”) 
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers.  
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of an
employment relationship.  On November 12, 2021, Plaintiff filed the
operative first amended complaint (the “FAC”) against defendants Centurion
Protection Services (“Centurion”), Richard Ray Dudgeon (“Dudgeon”), Tom Rogers,
and Does 1 through 5 (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging: (1) Private
Attorneys General Act; (2) failure to pay overtime wages in violation of Labor
Code section 510; (3) failure to reimburse and indemnify for expenditures; (4)
failure to provide meal and rest periods or compensation in lieu thereof in
violation of Labor Code section 226.7; (5) Labor Code section 203 waiting time
penalties; (6) Labor Code section 1198.5, subdivision (k) penalty; (7) Labor
Code section 226, subdivision (f) penalty; (8) intentional infliction of
emotional distress; (9) violation of Penal Code section 637.7; and (10)
negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
 
On August 8, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed
a second amended cross-complaint (the “SAXC”) against Plaintiff and Roes 1
through 5 alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) intentional interference with
contractual relations; (3) intentional interference with prospective economic
relations; (4) intentional misrepresentation; (5) defamation; and (6)
libel. 
            
On September 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a special
motion to strike (the “Anti-SLAPP Motion”) paragraphs 16, 31, 39, 50 and 63
from the SAXC. On October 10, 2023, the Court granted
the Anti-SLAPP motion and on July 24, 2024, the Court of Appeal affirmed the
ruling. 
 
            On
September 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant demurrer to the SAXC
(“Demurrer”) and a motion to strike (“Motion to Strike”). On October 4, 2023,
Cross-Complainants filed a consolidated opposition (“Opposition”) to the
Demurrer and Motion to Strike. On October 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed separate
replies to the Opposition. (“Demurrer Reply” and “MTS Reply”)
 
            On
November 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for order to rule on previously
filed motions against Cross-Complainants to compel further discovery responses
(“Motion for Order”). On the Court’s own motion, on December 17, 2024, the
Motion for Order was vacated and the Court set a hearing for the previously
filed motions to compel further discovery responses (“Motions to Compel”). 
 
            The
Demurrer, Motion to Strike and Motions to Compel are discussed in turn. 
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE
Pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d), the Court may take judicial notice
of “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the
United States or of any state of the United States”. 
 
The court,
however, may not take judicial notice of the truth of the contents of the
documents. (Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) Documents are only judicially noticeable to show their
existence and what orders were made such that the truth of the facts and
findings within the documents are not judicially noticeable. (Lockley v. Law
Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
875, 885.)     
 
            Pursuant
to Cross-Complainants’ request, the Court takes judicial notice of the
following: (1) the first amended cross-complaint filed on July 31, 2023 in this
action; (2) the notice of rejection of the July 31, 2023 first amended
cross-complaint; and (3) the first amended cross-complaint filed on August 8,
2023 in this action.
 
MEET AND CONFER
            The
parties have satisfied the meet and confer requirement. 
 
DEMURRER
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
§ 430.10, subd. (e).) 
 
To sufficiently
allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that
is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of action pleaded.
(Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983)
35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey
Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
 
In testing the
sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at
Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) A demurrer,
however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)  
A demurrer for
uncertainty lies where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible.
(CCP, § 430.10, subd. (f).)
 
“A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616, disapproved on other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business
practices need not be pled specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].)
As a result, a special demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach
failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at
uncertainty existing in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro
(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v.
J.E. French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations
question].) 
 
Where a
complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to apprise a defendant
of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a special demurrer for
uncertainty. (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A
special demurrer [for uncertainty] should be overruled where the allegations of
the complaint are sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues
which he is to meet”].) 
 
Plaintiff demurs
to the SAXC’s fifth cause of action for defamation and sixth cause of action
for libel on the grounds that they do not state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action and are uncertain. 
 
To prove
defamation or libel, a party must show “‘([1]) a publication that is ([2])
false, ([3]) defamatory, and ([4]) unprivileged, and that ([5]) has a natural
tendency to injure or that causes special damage.’” (Taus v. Loftus
(2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 720; see Civil Code, §§ 44, 45, 45a.) 
 
In the SAXC,
Cross-Complainants allege that Plaintiff made a false claim to
Cross-Complainants’ client that Cross-Complainants had put Plaintiff’s family in
danger and that this claim has a natural tendency to injure. (SAXC, ¶¶ 50, 63.)
On October 10, 2023, this Court issued a ruling striking those allegations
from the SAXC, which the Court of Appeal affirmed on July 24, 2024. (10/10/2023
Minute Order; 10/18/2024 Appeal-Remittitur-Affirmed NOA 10/13/2023 B333621)
Thus, Cross-Complainants have not alleged facts sufficient to state a cause of
action for defamation or libel. 
 
The Demurrer to
the fifth and sixth causes of action is SUSTAINED, without leave to amend. 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE 
       The court may, upon a motion or at any time in
its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (a) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (b) strike out all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436, subds. (a),
(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
 
            Cross-Complainant moves to strike
the entire SAXC because it was not timely filed, or alternatively, to strike
the claim for attorney’s fees because the SAXC does not allege a basis for
recovery of attorney’s fees. (MTS pp. 1:25-2:15.) On July 31, 2023, the Court granted
Cross-Complainant leave to file the SAXC within 5 days (7/31/2023 Order). The
SAXC was filed on August 8, 2023. As there is no apparent prejudice to the
parties caused by the late filed SAXC, the Court declines to strike the SAXC on
this ground. In the Opposition, Cross-Complainant asserts that the contract
between Cross-Complainant and Plaintiff includes a provision for attorney’s
fees. (Opp. p. 4:24-27.) Neither the alleged contract nor the language within
the contract entitling Cross-Complainant to attorney’s fees are included in the
SAXC. 
 
            Thus, the Motion to Strike is
GRANTED, with leave to amend.  
 
MOTIONS TO COMPEL
FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES 
A
motion to compel a further response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory
answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories, demands to produce,
or requests for admission. (Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”), § 2031.310, subd.
(a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
 
To
compel a further response to interrogatories, the movant can show that: (1) the
responding party’s answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete (CCP, § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1)); (2) the responding party’s exercise
of the option to produce documents in response to an interrogatory was
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents was inadequate
(CCP, § 2030.300, subd. (a)(2)); and (3) the responding party’s objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general (CCP, § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3);
see, e.g., Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 550
[defendant’s argument that plaintiff was required to establish good cause or
prove merits of underlying claim before propounding interrogatories without
merit]).
 
To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra, at p.
403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the responding
party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is incomplete CCP, §
2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding party’s representation that it is
unable to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive (CCP, § 2031.310, subd.
(a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s objection in the response is without merit
or is too general (CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club
v. Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the
responding party objected to the production of ESI on the ground that it is not
reasonably accessible the movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably
accessible or (ii) there is good cause for production of the ESI regardless of
its accessibility (CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
 
            On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a motion to compel Centurion to provide further responses to form
interrogatories, set one, nos. 8.1, 8.7-8.8, 9.1-9.2, 12.1-12.7, 13.1- 13.2,
14.1-14.2, and 50.1-50.6. 
            
            On August 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed 5
additional motions to compel Centurion to provide further responses to form
interrogatories, sets two through six, nos. 8.1, 8.7-8.8, 9.1-9.2, 12.1-12.7,
13.1- 13.2, 14.1-14.2. 
 
            On August 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a motion to compel Dudgeon to provide further responses to form
interrogatories, set one, nos. 8.1, 8.7-8.8, 9.1-9.2, 12.1-12.7, 13.1- 13.2,
14.1-14.2, and 50.1-50.6. That same day, Plaintiff filed 5 additional motions
to compel Dudgeon to provide further responses to form interrogatories, sets
two through six, nos. 6.1-6.7, 8.1, 8.7-8.8, 9.1-9.2, 12.1-12.7, 13.1-13.2,
14.1-14.2. 
 
Plaintiff additionally seeks sanctions on all
12 Motions to Compel. The Motions to Compel are all unopposed.  
 
Plaintiff argues that further responses
are warranted because Cross-Complainants served objection only responses to the
form interrogatories and agreed to provide further responses after
Cross-Complainants’ motion to file the SAXC was granted. (All Mots., p. 1:12-15.)
The Court granted the motion to file the SAXC on July 31, 2023. (7/31/2023
Order) Discovery was subsequently stayed in this action on September 12, 2023.
(9/20/2023 Notice of Stay) The Court of Appeal issued a Remittitur on July 24,
2024. (10/18/2024 Appeal-Remittitur-Affirmed NOA 10/13/2023 B333621) Thus,
because the motion to file the SAXC was granted and the discovery stay has been
lifted, further responses to the form interrogatories are now warranted. It is
not readily clear to the Court, however, why Plaintiff served Centurion and
Dudgeon with 6 identical, or nearly identical, requests for form
interrogatories. Considering the timing of the discovery stay in this action
and the duplicative requests for form interrogatories and motions to compel,
the Court finds that sanctions are not warranted. 
 
The motion to compel Centurion to provide
further responses to form interrogatories, set one, is GRANTED. Centurion is ordered
to provide further, Code-compliant, verified responses to form interrogatories,
set one, nos. 8.1, 8.7-8.8, 9.1-9.2, 12.1-12.7, 13.1- 13.2, 14.1-14.2, and 50.1-50.6
within 30 days of this order. 
 
The motion to compel Dudgeon to provide
further responses to form interrogatories, set one, is GRANTED. Dudgeon is
ordered to provide further, Code-compliant, verified responses to form
interrogatories, set one, nos. 6.1-6.7, 8.1, 8.7-8.8, 9.1-9.2, 12.1-12.7, 13.1-
13.2, 14.1-14.2, and 50.1-50.6 within 30 days of this order.
 
The remaining motions to compel further
are DENIED. The requests for sanctions are DENIED. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
