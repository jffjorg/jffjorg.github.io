And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to lift the stay of action in this legal malpractice case. The stay was issued on March 29, 2023, pending the resolution of a consolidated appeal in a related case. However, the appeal is now resolved, and the judge has found that lifting the stay is appropriate. The stay will be lifted effective January 13, 2025, and any responses to the first amended complaint that have not yet been submitted must be filed within 20 days of the date of this order.
