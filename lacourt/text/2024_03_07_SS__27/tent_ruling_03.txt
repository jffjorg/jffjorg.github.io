Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Southwark Metal Manufacturing, Damian's employer, was aware of Damian's habitual DUI incidents yet allowed him to drive the company vehicle.   MOTION TO DEEM RFAs ADMITTED  On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff's counsel served Request for Admissions, Set 2, on Defendant Southwark Metal Manufacturing, consisting of 480 requests. (Goldstein Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.) An extension was granted by Plaintiff's counsel, making the responses due on January 29, 2024. (Goldstein Decl. ¶ 4) On January 29, 2024, Defendant requested an additional two-week extension to provide responses, but Plaintiff did not respond. (Goldstein Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed the present motion to deem the Requests for Admission as admitted. On February 22, 2024, Defendant Southwark Metal Manufacturing served verified responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set Two. (Goldstein Decl. ¶ 10, Exhibit A.)¿  Legal Standard ¿ “Any party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ CCP § 2033.010.¿ “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared . . . .”¿ CCP § 2033.250(a).¿ ¿ If a party to whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the work product doctrine. CCP § 2033.280(a). The requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. CCP § 2033.280(b). The court shall issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. CCP § 2033.280(c).¿  Analysis ¿ The parties do not dispute that Defendant failed to provide discovery responses to Plaintiff's Request for Admissions, Set 2 by the deadline of January 29, 2024. Therefore, it is undisputed that the initial responses were not served within the timeframe required by CCP § 2033.250(a), thereby failing to meet the deadline for a timely response. ¿Given this failure to provide timely responses, the Movant is entitled to file a motion for an order deeming the RFAs admitted and to request monetary sanctions in accordance with CCP § 2033.280(b). Such an order is mandated unless the party to whom the request was directed serves a response in substantial compliance with CCP § 2033.220 prior to the motion's hearing. CCP § 2033.280(c). On February 22, 2024, Defendant filed verified responses to Plaintiff's Request for Admissions, Set Two, in substantial compliance with CCP § 2033.220. (Goldstein Decl. ¶ 10, Exhibit A.) Thus, the current motion is moot. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem RFA, set two, admitted is DENIED.  Sanctions  The sequence of events does not indicate that it was necessary for Plaintiff to file the current motion to obtain the discovery responses or to be awarded sanctions. This is not a situation where Defendant was unresponsive or failed to provide responses after numerous extensions. Particularly given the large volume of requests for admission (RFAs), Plaintiff's request for an extension is understandable. Plaintiff communicated that a response was forthcoming, and indeed, the response was served on February 22, 2024.¿Thus, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.   MOTION TO COMPEL  The current discovery dispute revolves around Plaintiff's fifth set of requests for production, numbers 47-525. Neither the motion nor any declarations or exhibits attached thereto specify when Plaintiff’s RFP, set five, was served or when Defendant’s discovery response was served. Nonetheless, on January 9, 2024, and January 19, 2024, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer email to defense counsel. (Exhibit A, B.) Plaintiff’s counsel declares that no responses were received to these emails. Subsequently, on January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the present motion to compel further responses and requested sanctions in the amount of $10,560.00.  Legal Standard  A motion to compel a further response to a request for production must be noticed within 45 days of the service of the response, or any supplemental response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.¿ Otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel further response to the inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)¿ The motion must also be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of any issue presented by it. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).) Finally, a motion to compel further responses to inspection demands must be accompanied by a separate document that sets forth each item to which further response is requested and the factual and legal reasons for compelling it. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).)¿ ¿ Plaintiff's motion, declaration, and exhibits attached to the motion do not show when Plaintiff's fifth set of requests for production was served, nor does it show when the discovery responses at issue were received. Thus, no evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses was filed within 45 days of receiving Defendant's responses, or before any specific later date agreed upon in writing by both parties, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure, § 2031.310(c). Consequently, Plaintiff has not established that the current motion is timely and that it did not waive its right to compel further responses. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s present motion is DENIED without prejudice.1  Meet and Confer  “The Discovery Act requires that, prior to the initiation of a motion to compel, the moving party declare that he or she has made a¿serious attempt¿to obtain an informal resolution of each issue.”¿¿(Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc.¿(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016.) This rule is designed “to encourage the parties to work out their differences informally so as to avoid the necessity for a formal order....”¿¿(McElhaney v. Cessna Aircraft Co.¿(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 285, 289.) “This, in turn, will lessen the burden on the court and reduce the unnecessary expenditure of resources by litigants through promotion of informal, extrajudicial resolution of discovery disputes.”¿(Townsend v. Superior Court¿(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1435.)¿ “A determination of whether an attempt at informal resolution is adequate . . . involves the exercise of discretion.”¿(Stewart (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th at 1016.)¿ “The history of the litigation, the nature of the interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope of discovery requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors can be relevant.”¿(Id.)¿¿  "Meet and confer" or "confer" means to communicate directly and discuss in good faith the issue(s) required under the particular Rule or order… such communication may take place by telephone. The mere sending of a written, electronic, or voice-mail communication, however, does not satisfy a requirement to "meet and confer" or to "confer." Rather, this requirement can be satisfied only through direct dialogue and discussion — either in a face-to-face meeting or in a telephone conversation. Phleger v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., No. C 07-1686 SBA, 5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 24, 2007) The meet and confer efforts by Plaintiff consisted solely of two sets of emails sent to Defendant on January 9, 2024, and January 19, 2024. No phone calls or face-to-face meetings took place. Given the contentious nature of the discovery process between the parties and Plaintiff’s current request for over 500 discovery requests (which, on its face, sounds excessive, though it appears that no request for a protective order was made), a resolution might have been more effectively sought through a phone conversation than through impersonal emails. Additionally, although email offers convenience, it is susceptible to issues such as being overlooked, or being filtered into a spam folder. Thus, Parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer on this matter by March 14, 2024.  Sanctions Since the present motion to compel further is denied, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is now moot.
