And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer with motion to strike filed by Defendant Always Private Security Services, Inc. (APSS) in a case involving a shooting incident at PC Palaces.

The judge sustains APSS's demurrer to Plaintiff Chu's sixth cause of action for false imprisonment, citing that the statute of limitations has expired. The judge also sustains APSS's demurrer to Plaintiff Chu's fifth cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, citing that the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action.

However, the judge overrules APSS's demurrer to Plaintiff Chu's fourth cause of action for general negligence, finding that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action.

The judge grants APSS's motion to strike Plaintiff Chu's prayer for relief, citing that the allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The parties are advised to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear at the hearing to argue.
