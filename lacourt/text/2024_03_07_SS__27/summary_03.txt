And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to deem a request for admissions as admitted and a motion to compel further discovery responses. The judge finds that the defendant failed to provide timely responses to the plaintiff's request for admissions and that the plaintiff is entitled to file a motion for an order deeming the requests as admitted and to request monetary sanctions. However, the judge denies the motion because the defendant has since provided verified responses to the requests. The judge also denies the motion to compel further discovery responses because the plaintiff did not file the motion within the required timeframe and failed to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the issue informally. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer on the matter by March 14, 2024.
