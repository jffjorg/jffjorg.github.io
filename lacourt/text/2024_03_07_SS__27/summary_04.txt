And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ronald Hillman et al. v. City of Los Angeles et al. (Case No. BC709971). The case involves a motion by the plaintiff to set aside a dismissal entered on May 15, 2023, due to alleged mistake or negligence by the plaintiff's counsel, Yoon Kim. The counsel claims that he instructed his paralegal to calendar the new trial date and FSC date, but the paralegal failed to do so, leading to the counsel's failure to attend the FSC and trial. The defendant, the City of Los Angeles, argues that the counsel was fully informed of the FSC and trial dates and that the failure to attend was not due to mistake or negligence.

The Court finds that the counsel was aware of the FSC and trial date and that his failure to attend was not simply due to the mistake raised as the basis for a set aside. The Court denies the motion to set aside the dismissal, finding that the counsel's failure to attend was not caused by mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 473.
