 Case Number:  20STCV27063    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 4/11/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 20STCV27063 KIANA REEVES, et al. vs SAMANTHA BELLE SIMONDS, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR TEAVE REEVES, Age 11 RIVER CUMING, Age 8 RECOMMENDATION: CONDITIONAL GRANT  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claims against Defendants for the total amount of $28,500, with $1,750 being apportioned to Teave Reeves (“Reeves”) and $1,750 being apportioned to River Cuming (“Cuming”) (collectively, “Claimants”).   If the settlement is approved for Reeves, $510 will be used for medical expenses. The net balance of $1,240 will be deposited into a blocked account.   If the settlement is approved for Cuming, $330 will be used for medical expenses. The net balance of $1,420 will be deposited into a blocked account.   The Court reviews the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable. However, because the net settlement is to be deposited into a blocked account, Petitioner must also file an Order to Deposit Funds Into Blocked Account (MC-355) for each minor claimant. Based on the foregoing, the petitions are CONDITIONALLY GRANTED upon Petitioner filing MC-355 for Claimants.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
