And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action involving the wrongful death of a minor. The parties have agreed to settle their claims against the defendants for a total of $1 million, with $300,000 allocated to each of the minor claimants, Carlos and Eduardo. The court has previously denied a similar petition due to concerns about the proposed use of a portion of the settlement proceeds to purchase a home abroad. However, the parties have revised their proposal and now intend to invest the settlement proceeds in single-premium deferred annuities. The court finds that the parties have justified the high attorney fees requested and grants the petition. The court will set an order to show cause re: compliance to ensure that the annuities are purchased as intended.
