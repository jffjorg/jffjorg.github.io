And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted American's unopposed motion to compel SJI to respond to its special interrogatories. SJI failed to serve responses to American's discovery requests, despite being properly served and having the time to respond. As a result, any objections SJI may have had to the discovery requests are waived. The court orders SJI to serve verified responses to American's special interrogatories, without objections, within 15 days. Additionally, the court imposes sanctions on SJI and SJI's counsel in the amount of $480.
