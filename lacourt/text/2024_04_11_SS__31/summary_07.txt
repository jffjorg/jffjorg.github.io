And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting a motion to strike paragraphs 34 and 43 of the complaint filed by plaintiff Armando Avalos. The complaint alleges that Allied Universal Security Services Universal Protection Services LPP and White Memorial Medical Center (WMMC) are liable for damages arising from security removing plaintiff from the premises. The judge finds that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support the imposition of punitive damages against Allied Universal Security Services Universal Protection Services LPP. The judge also finds that the complaint does not show how Allied Universal Security Services Universal Protection Services LPP's officers, directors, or managing agents had advance knowledge of the malicious conduct of security personnel and failed to intervene. The judge grants the motion to strike and denies leave to amend the complaint. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
