The Judge has denied the defendants' ex parte application to shorten time and specially set their motions for summary judgment within 30 days of trial. The defendants have failed to establish "good cause" for this relief, and exigency has not been established to warrant the extraordinary relief sought. The parties are not foreclosed from seeking a continuance of the trial date if necessary, and the opposing party is required to give notice.
