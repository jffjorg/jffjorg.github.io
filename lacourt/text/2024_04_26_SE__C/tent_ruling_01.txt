judgment and their supporting papers must be served at least 75 days before the
hearing. (CCP 437c.) The subject Motions for Summary Judgment were filed on the
evening of April 23, 2024. 75 days from April 23, 2024 falls on or about July

judgment "shall be heard no later than 30 days before the date of trial,
unless the court for good cause orders otherwise." (CCP 437c(a)(3).)
Defendants have failed to establish "good cause" for specially
setting their Motions for Summary Judgment within less than 30 days of trial

ex parte relief.  The parties are not foreclosed from seeking a
continuance of the trial date in Dept. SE-F, if necessary. Opposing Party to
give notice.
