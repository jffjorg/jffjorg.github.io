 Case Number:  22STCV34394    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  T 22STCV3433394
Juan De Los Santos Villaba v T&R Painting
Tentative
ruling: Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint (SAC) – Sustained with 20 days
leave to amend.  Plaintiff has again
submitted a complaint with at least 20 allegations of “class” members.  This is not a class action.  The SAC is vague and confusing.  The court will grant one last opportunity to
fix the complaint to make it clear it is a PAGA action and NOT a Class Action.
