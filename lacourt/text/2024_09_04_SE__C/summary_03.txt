The court has granted the plaintiff's ex parte application in part. The unlawful detainer action (LASC Case No. 24NWUD01301) is stayed pending the resolution of the instant lawsuit. The request for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue is denied as moot. The court finds that the plaintiff has made a prima facie case for breach of contract and a stay of the unlawful detainer action is necessary to protect the plaintiff's rights. The case is set for further hearing on September 4, 2024.
