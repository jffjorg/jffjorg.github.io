And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lopez v. Rivera et al. The plaintiff, Laura Karina Lopez, had filed motions to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production from the defendants, Kulpati Chodha, Jacqueline Rivera, and Eduardo Rivera. The motions were filed on February 28, 2024, and the defendants had served further responses on June 11, 2024. The parties had met and conferred and filed a joint statement on July 29, 2024, indicating that the defendants had provided further responses and would amend their responses to certain requests. The judge finds that the parties have adequately narrowed the issues and that the motions are now moot, as discovery responses were served after the motions were filed. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
