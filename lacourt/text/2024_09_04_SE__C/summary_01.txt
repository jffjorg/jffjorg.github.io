And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant defendant Skin First Spa, Inc.'s counsel, Sanjay Sabarwal, his motion to be relieved as counsel. This decision comes after Sabarwal failed to file proper paperwork, including a notice of motion and a proposed order, despite previously demonstrating good cause for withdrawal due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Although Sabarwal filed a motion and declaration in support of his request, he only filed and served a proposed order on August 28, 2024. The judge is granting the motion, effective September 4, 2024.
