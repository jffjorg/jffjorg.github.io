 Case Number:  24NWCV02746    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  C Jamie Reyes, et al. vs Gary Reyes, as
Trustee of the I. Reyes Living Trust, et al., Case No. 24NWCV02746
This is a breach of contract action.
Plaintiffs Jamie Reyes and JR Machine Company filed this ex parte application
for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause why a preliminary
injunction should not issue, restraining and enjoining Defendants from pursuing
their unlawful detainer action against Plaintiffs for possession of the real
property located at 13245 East Florence Ave., Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670
(“Subject Property”), and for an order staying the UD action pending resolution
of the instant lawsuit.  
Plaintiff Jamie Reyes alleges he
entered into an agreement with Defendants whereby Defendants would sell their
shares in JR Machine Co., Inc. to Plaintiff in exchange for Plaintiff’s 1/6th
interest in the Subject Property.  JR Machine has operated from the
Subject Property since 2015.  As part of the agreement, Defendants agreed
to execute a new written lease agreement with Plaintiff for the Subject
Property.  Plaintiff alleges he executed a grant deed which transferred
his interest in the Subject Property to Defendants, but Defendants did not
execute a new written lease agreement, in breach of the agreement. 
Instead, on June 28, 2024, Defendant Gary Reyes filed the underlying UD action
(LASC Case No. 24NWUD01301).  On August 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the
instant lawsuit alleging breach of contract and fraud, among other causes of
action.  Trial in the UD action is scheduled for September 10, 2024. 

The ex parte application is GRANTED in
part.  The UD action (LASC Case No. 24NWUD01301) is STAYED pending
resolution of the instant lawsuit. (Asuncion v. Superior Court of San Diego
County (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 141.) The request for a temporary restraining
order and an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue
is DENIED as MOOT.  Moving party to give notice.
