TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Laura Karina
Lopez’s Motions to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) are
MOOT.
 
Moving party to give
notice. 
 
 
This lawsuit is about a car accident that
occurred on December 11, 2021. Defendant Jacqueline Rivera was driving an ice
cream truck that belonged to Defendant Kulpati Chodha.  Defendant Chodha had entered into a business
asset sales agreement with Defendant Eduardo Rivera for the purchase and sale
of the truck. Defendant Jacqueline Rivera and Plaintiff Laura Karina Lopez
collided. 
 
Plaintiff Laura Karina Lopez moves to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production
of Documents, Set One, from Defendant Kulpati Chodha.  
 
On June 26, 2024, the Court continued the
hearing on Plaintiff’s motions because
the parties had not adequately met and conferred.  The Court ordered the parties to further meet
and confer and file a joint statement.  
 
On July 29, 2024, the parties filed a joint
statement indicating that Defendants served further responses on June 11,
2024.  Defendants assert that the instant
motion, filed on February 28, 2024, is now moot.  The Parties met and conferred on July 19,
2024 and Defendant Kulpati Chodha has agreed to provide a further response to
Form Interrogatory 2.6 and will be amending his response to Request for
Production No. 16.  Plaintiff believes the
parties have narrowed the issues to those most pertinent, and Plaintiff awaits
Defendants’ further and/or amended responses.
 
The Court acknowledges the efforts by the
parties to informally resolve their discovery disputes.  Because discovery responses were served after
the instant motions were filed, the motions are now MOOT.
