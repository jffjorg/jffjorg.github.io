This is a continuation. Defendant’s
counsel, Sanjay Sabarwal, moves to be relieved as counsel for Skin First Spa,
Inc. 
On August 13, 2024, the
Court found the attorney declaration demonstrated good cause for withdrawal
based on a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.  However, Counsel did not file a Notice of
Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC051), an Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC-053), and a Declaration in
Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC-052) on the
appropriate forms, as outlined within California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
subdivisions (a), (c), and (e). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (a),
(c), (e).)
On August 14, 2024, Counsel
filed a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel and a Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, but Counsel had not filed or
served a Proposed Order. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d), (e).)
On August 28, 2024, Counsel
filed and served a proposed order. 
Thus, the motion is
GRANTED.
