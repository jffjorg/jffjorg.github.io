And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Defendants' motion to strike Plaintiff Juan Centeno's requests for punitive damages. The Plaintiff has not alleged any facts supporting the claims of malice, oppression, or fraud, and has only made general and conclusory allegations. The Court has found that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support the requests for punitive damages. The motion to strike is therefore granted, and the Plaintiff's requests for punitive damages are stricken from the complaint.
