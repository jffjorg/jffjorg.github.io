```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motions to compel Defendant Jong Suk Choi's responses to form interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admission as moot, since Defendant provided the requested verifications after the motions were filed. The judge also denies the motion for a deemed-admitted order, since Defendant provided a response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.

The judge grants Plaintiff Kelli Lee Miller's request for sanctions in part, awarding $736.65 in sanctions for the motion to compel responses. The sanctions are awarded for Defendant's failure to provide timely responses to the discovery requests and for the unnecessary expense of preparing multiple discovery motions.

The judge orders Defendant and counsel to pay the awarded sanctions within 30 days of notice of this ruling.
