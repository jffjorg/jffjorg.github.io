And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge granted the motion filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Houman Sayaghi and Antonia Holguin, to be relieved as counsel for Diana Ofunwa. The counsel had filed the motion on January 22, 2023, stating that there had been a breakdown in communication between the Plaintiff and counsel, making it impossible for counsel to effectively represent the Plaintiff. The Judge found that the counsel had established good cause to be relieved and granted the motion, subject to correction of the list of hearing dates on the proposed order. The order will be effective upon filing of proof of service with the Court showing service of the signed order on the client.
