And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The plaintiff filed the motion on December 29, 2023, seeking an order compelling Defendant to provide further responses to its Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two. The judge finds that the motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 45 days after the verified response was served in April 2023. The judge also notes that the plaintiff did not comply with the requirement of filing a separate statement or a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. The judge concludes that the motion is denied, and Defendant is ordered to give notice.
