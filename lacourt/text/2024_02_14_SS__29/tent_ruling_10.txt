 Case Number:  22STCV32123    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Hasina Saleh.
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied without prejudice. 
 
Background 
 
This action arises out of a vehicle accident that allegedly
occurred on November 4, 2020, near the intersection of Las Virgenes Road and
Agoura Road in Calabasas, California. On September 30, 2022, Plaintiffs Cesar
Prado, Marcos D. Velasquez, Juan E. Ambrosio, and Daniel Morales, and Marvin
Amilcar (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendants
Hasina Saleh (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 25 asserting causes of action for
general negligence and motor vehicle negligence. Defendant filed an answer on
March 1, 2023.
 
On May 17, 2023, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiffs’
attorney to be relieved as counsel. As set forth in the minute order, the order
granting the motion was to be “effective upon filing proof of the signed orders
on the clients.” That proof was filed on July 27, 2023 (and shows service on
the clients by mail sent on July 27.)
 
On October
9 & 10, 2023, Defendant’s motions to deem the truth of the matters asserted
in the Requests for Admissions propounded on Plaintiffs were GRANTED.
 
Defendant
filed this motion for summary judgment on January 10, 2024 for hearing on
February 14, 2024. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to
enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)
25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to
grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”  (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67.)
As to each claim as framed by
the complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the
initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or
to establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2); Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.”  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) Once
the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show
that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of
action or a defense thereto. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra,
25 Cal.4th 826, 849.)  In ruling on a
motion for summary judgment, “the court must consider all of the evidence and
all of the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, and must view such evidence
and such inferences in the light most favorable to the opposing party.” (LPP
Mortgage, Ltd. v. Bizar (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 773, 776.) 
To establish a triable issue
of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) In the context of a motion for summary
judgment, a cause of action has no merit if: (1) one or more of the elements of
the cause of action cannot be separately established, even if that element is
separately pleaded; or (2) a defendant establishes an affirmative defense to
that cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
437c(o)(1)-(2).)  With respect to a
motion for summary judgment “if it is not set forth in the separate statement,
it does not exist.”  (San Diego
Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308,
313.)  
“Section 437c, subdivision
(h) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a motion for summary judgment
or adjudication shall be denied, or a continuance shall be granted, “[i]f it
appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition ... that facts essential to
justify opposition may exist but cannot, for reasons stated, then be
presented....” The nonmoving party seeking a continuance “must show: (1) the
facts to be obtained are essential to opposing the motion; (2) there is reason
to believe such facts may exist; and (3) the reasons why additional time is
needed to obtain these facts. [Citations.]” (Frazee v. Seely (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 627, 633.)
 
Discussion
Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is untimely. 
“Notice
of the motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the
action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing. If the notice is
served by mail, the required 75-day period of notice shall be increased by 5
days if the place of address is within the State of California, 10 days if the
place of address is outside the State of California but within the United
States, and 20 days if the place of address is outside the United States.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 437c(a)(2).)
Here,
notice was served by mail to Plaintiffs, requiring notice to be served 80 days
before the hearing. Defendant served notice only 35 days before the hearing on January
10, 2024. That is not timely.  Therefore,
the Court must deny Defendant’s motion for summary judgment without prejudice.
Conclusion
Moving Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
