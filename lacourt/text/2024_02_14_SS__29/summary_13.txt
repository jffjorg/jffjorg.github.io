And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Carolyn M. Afari, Esq. of Culver Legal LLP on behalf of plaintiff Elver Ramirez. The motion is denied without prejudice because the required forms were not complete. The judge notes that the breakdown in communication between the plaintiff and counsel makes it unreasonable to continue the representation, but the forms must be filled out correctly before the motion can be granted. The judge orders the moving counsel to give notice and requires a completed order.
