ANALYSIS:
 
On May 16, 2023, Defendants Maya Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and
Jee Kuriel (“Defendants”) served Special Interrogatories, Set One, Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on
Plaintiff Toby Lee Jones (“Plaintiff”). (Motions,
Rickett Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a
meet-and-confer effort extending the deadline to serve verified responses
without objections, Plaintiff has not served responses. (Id. at Exh. B.)
Defendants filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (3) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on July 31, 2023 and August 1,
2023. 
 
The Motion was set
for hearing on October 30, 2023, at which time the case was transferred from
Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse to Department 26 of the Spring
Street Courthouse. (Minute Order, 10/30/23.) The hearing was continued to
January 9, 2024 and then again to February 20, 2024. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on January 25, 2024 and Defendants replied on February 9, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Contrary to
Plaintiff’s contention, the Motion demonstrates a meet and confer effort by
defense counsel, as noted above. In any event, there is no requirement for a
prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses can be
filed or granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 20230.290, 2031.300.) Further, the
motion can be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide
the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Based on Plaintiff’s
failure to respond to the propounded discovery, Defendants are entitled to an
order compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests
without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Plaintiff’s
contention in opposition that the discovery was propounded in purported bad
faith is not supported by any authority demonstrating that this is grounds to
deny the request to compel initial responses. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure
to timely respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed.
However, the amount of sanctions sought is excessive under a lodestar
calculation. Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $918.00
based on six hours of attorney time billed at $133.00 per hour and costs of
$40.00 per motion. (Motions, Rickett Decl., ¶4.) 
 
Conclusion
 

Defendants Maya Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel’s (1) Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions;
(2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request
for Sanctions; and (3) Motion to
Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request
for Sanctions are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF
TOBY LEE JONES IS TO SERVE VERIFIED
RESPONSES TO THE REQUESTS WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF IS FURTHER

COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
