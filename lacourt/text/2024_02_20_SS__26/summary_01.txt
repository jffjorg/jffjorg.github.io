And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel responses to discovery requests and request for sanctions. The motion was filed by the defendants, Maya Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel, against the plaintiff, Toby Lee Jones. The defendants' motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days. The plaintiff is also ordered to pay sanctions of $918.00 to defense counsel within 20 days.

The Judge found that the plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, despite a meet-and-confer effort, and that this constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. The Judge also found that the plaintiff's contention that the discovery requests were propounded in bad faith is not supported by any authority. The Judge granted the defendants' motion to compel responses and request for sanctions, as the plaintiff's failure to respond is a violation of the discovery rules.
