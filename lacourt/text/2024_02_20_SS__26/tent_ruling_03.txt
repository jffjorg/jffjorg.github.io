ANALYSIS:
 
On June 12, 2023, Plaintiff Omaran Abdeen, Co-Trustee of the
Omaran and Eman Abdeen Family Trust Dated August 31, 2017 (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants
Valencia Fairways Homeowners’ Association and Gary Choppe. (“Defendants”). The
First Amended Complaint, filed on November 6, 2023, seeks mandatory injunctive
relief against Defendants. (FAC, ¶37 and Prayer, ¶1.) Defendants filed the
instant Motion to Strike Portions of the First Amended Complaint on December 8,
2023. However, the Limited Jurisdiction Court lacks jurisdiction to
issue the injunctive relief sought in the First Amended Complaint. (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 85, 86.) 
 
Therefore,
the case is reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the
Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of fees and reassignment of the
case to an Independent Calendar Court. Plaintiff is ordered to pay the
reclassification fee within ten (10) days.
