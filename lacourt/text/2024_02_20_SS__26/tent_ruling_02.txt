Default is DENIED.
 
                                                                                                                                
ANALYSIS:
 
On April 9, 2021, Plaintiff Pius Joseph, a professional law
corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant interpleader action against
Defendant Jessica Wood (“Defendant Wood”) and others. Plaintiff filed proof of
personal service of the Summons and Complaint on Defendant Wood on June 14,
2021. When Defendant Wood failed to file a responsive pleading, Plaintiff
obtained their default on August 25, 2022. An order to show cause regarding the
request for default judgment is set for February 28, 2024.
 
On November 2, 2023, Defendant Wood filed a Motion to Vacate
Entry of Default. Plaintiff filed an opposition on December 11, 2023. The
Motion came for hearing on December 20, 2023, at which time Court took the
matter under submission. (Minute Order, 12/20/23.) On December 27, 2023, the
Court denied the Motion. (Minute Order, 12/27/23.) 
 
Defendant filed another Motion to Vacate Entry of Default (“the
Renewed Motion”) on January 25, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on February
9, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant’s Renewed Motion to
Vacate Default is deficient in a number of ways. First, the Motion is not
accompanied by a proof of service demonstrating that Plaintiff was served with
the moving papers or notice of hearing. Failure to give notice of a motion is
not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) It
appears, however, that Plaintiff has waived the defective notice by filing and
serving an opposition without objecting to any lack of notice. 
 
Second, the Renewed Motion does not include a memorandum of
points and authorities. “The memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a
concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a
discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the
position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed, Defendant’s
failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that
the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Finally, when a party seeks the same relief that was previously
denied, it must bring a renewed motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1008, subdivision (b). (California Correctional Peace Officers Ass’n v.
Virga (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30, 43, fn. 11; see also Tate v. Wilburn
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 150, 156-157.) When a motion has been denied in whole or
in part, the moving party may apply again for the same relief at a later time
only upon “new or different facts, circumstances or law.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1008, subd. (b); see Graham v. Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965,
969-970.) The Motion does not point to any “new or different facts,
circumstances or law” that would warrant the renewed request for relief. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant Jessica Wood’s Renewed Motion to Vacate
Entry of Default is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
