And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Jessica Wood's Renewed Motion to Vacate Entry of Default. The motion was deficient in several ways, including failure to provide proof of service demonstrating that the plaintiff was served with the moving papers or notice of hearing, and failure to include a memorandum of points and authorities. Additionally, the motion did not point to any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that would warrant the renewed request for relief. The judge noted that the defendant's failure to provide a memorandum as required by the rule is an admission that the request is without merit, and that the defendant must bring a renewed motion if seeking the same relief that was previously denied.
