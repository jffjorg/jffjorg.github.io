ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiffs Marwan Abu Hassan and Maliheh Shajari (“Plaintiffs”)
filed the instant action against Defendants John Michael Nolan and J.M. Nolan
Architects, Inc. (“Defendants”) on October 12, 2023. A First Amended Complaint
for (1) breach of contract; (2) fraudulent misrepresentation; (3) professional
negligence; (4) unjust enrichment; and (5) unfair business practice was filed
on November 22, 2023. Defendant Becky Nolan was added to the action as a doe
defendant on November 30, 2023. 
 
Defendants filed the instant Motion to Transfer Action and
for Sanctions on December 14, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Defendants bring the
instant Motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 396b, subdivision
(a) and 397, subdivision (a), on the grounds that they are entitled to have the
action tried in the county where they reside unless the action comes within an
exception to the general venue rule. Code of Civil Procedure section 395
states in relevant part: “the superior court in the county where the defendants
or some of them reside at the commencement of the action is the proper court
for the trial of the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 395, subd. (a).) If an action
is commenced in a court other than the proper court for trial, the defendant
may move for an order transferring the action to the proper court. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 396b, subd. (a).) 
 
“Venue is determined based on the complaint on file at the time
the motion to change venue is made.” (Brown v. Superior Court of Alameda
County (1984) 37 Cal.3d 477, 482.) Plaintiff’s choice of venue is
presumptively correct, and Defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that
venue is not proper there. (Battaglia Enterprises, Inc. v. Superior Court of
San Diego County (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 309, 313-14.) Both Defendants are residents of Ventura
County. Defendant Nolan resides at 116 Stagecoach Rd., Bell Canyon, California;
Defendant Nolan Company operates out of Defendant Nolan’s residence. (Motion,
Nolan Decl., ¶¶2, 6 and Exhs. B, E.) The parties entered into the subject
contract while in Ventura County with respect to architectural services for a
property located in Ventura County. (Id. at ¶¶3, 5 and Exh. C.) Plaintiffs
cannot establish that Defendants’ alleged liability under the contract or tort
causes of action arose in Los Angeles County. Indeed, Plaintiffs have not filed
an opposition to the instant Motion. The entire action, therefore, may
be transferred to Ventura County. 
 
Defendants also request an award of attorney’s fees and
costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 396b, subdivision (b), which
states in relevant part: “In its discretion, the court may order the payment to
the prevailing party of reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees incurred in
making or resisting the motion to transfer whether or not that party is
otherwise entitled to recover his or her costs of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
396b, subd. (b).) However, the amount sought is excessive. Defense counsel
states their hourly billing rate is $700.00 but does not explain why that is
reasonable. A reasonable attorney’s fee rate for a limited jurisdiction breach
of contract and fraud action is $400.00 per hour. Nor was any opposition filed so
Defendants are not entitled to recover time spent filing a reply. Based on a
lodestar calculation, Defendants are entitled to attorney’s fees in the amount
of $3,520.00 for 8.8 hours of attorney time, plus costs of $60.00. (Motion, Lavaee
Decl., ¶10.)
