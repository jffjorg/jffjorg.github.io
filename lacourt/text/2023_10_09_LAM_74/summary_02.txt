And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents (set two) from Defendant Robyn Emus and request for sanctions. The motion is moot because Defendant served Plaintiff with her own verified supplemental responses on September 14, 2023. However, the issue of sanctions remains. The court finds that Defendant's initial joint response to the RFPs was improper because it did not clearly indicate whether she or Co-Defendant was responding to each request, and it did not sign the initial responses under oath as required. The court orders sanctions against Defendant in the sum of $2,581.65 payable to Plaintiff by November 9, 2023.
