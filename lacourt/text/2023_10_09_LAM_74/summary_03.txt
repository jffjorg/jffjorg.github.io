And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to compel responses to requests for production and request for sanctions filed by SoCal Diesel Inc. against Ira Emus and has found the motion to be moot as Ira Emus has already served SoCal Diesel Inc. with his own verified supplemental responses. However, the judge has ordered sanctions against Ira Emus in the sum of $511.65 payable to SoCal Diesel Inc. by November 9, 2023. The judge has also adjusted the award to Plaintiff's counsel accordingly. The judge has concluded that Ira Emus's initial responses to the requests for production were improper and that sanctions are warranted due to his failure to sign the initial responses under oath and his failure to clearly indicate whether he or Co-Defendant was responding to each request.
