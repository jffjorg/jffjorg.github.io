the supplemental responses, it may file a motion to compel further discovery.

Plaintiff SoCal Diesel Inc.’s Motion
to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set Two) from
Defendant Ira Emus and Request for Sanctions.
 
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a business dispute.
            In
October 2015, Plaintiff SoCal Diesel, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant Ira Emus (Defendant) and Co-Defendant Robyn Emus
(Co-Defendant) and others.
            On
June 15, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with requests for production (set
two) (RFPs). That day, Plaintiff also served Co-Defendant with RFPs.
            On
July 28, 2023, Defendant and Co-Defendant served Plaintiff with unverified,
joint responses to the RFPs in a single document. 
            On
September 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel responses from
Defendant to the RFPs and request for sanctions.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
            If
the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed such a motion,
the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)¿
DISCUSSION
            This motion is moot because
Defendant served Plaintiff with his own verified supplemental responses on
September 14, 2023. (Opposition, at pp. 1, 3-4.)[1]
But the issue of sanctions remains. Plaintiff contends that Defendant and
Co-Defendant’s initial joint response to the RFPs was improper. In support,
Plaintiff cites Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210, which provides that a
party to whom RFPs are directed must respond to each item or category. Here,
Defendant received his own set of RFPs. But the initial responses do not
clearly indicate whether he or Co-Defendant is responding to each request.
Moreover, Defendant did not sign the initial responses under oath, as required
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.250. True, verifications are not necessary
if the responses only consist of objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.250,
subd. (a).) The initial responses do not merely consist in objections, though.
They also include representations of inability to comply with the RFPs. Thus,
sanctions are warranted. The court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate
reasonable but notes that this motion duplicates her other motion to compel.
The court will adjust her award accordingly ($511.65 = $300 x (0.5 hours
(motion) + 1 hour (review of opposition and reply) + $61.65 (filing fees)).
(Green Decl., ¶ 6.) 
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court finds this motion moot. The court orders sanctions
against Defendant in the sum of $511.65 payable to Plaintiff by November 9,
2023.
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice.
