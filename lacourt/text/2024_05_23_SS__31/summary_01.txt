And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of John Newman vs. Jose Alvarado, et al. Nissin International Transport U.S.A., Inc. has filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it cannot be held liable for the conduct of Alvarado because he was an independent contractor. Plaintiff John Newman opposes the motion, arguing that there is an issue of material fact as to whether Alvarado was an independent contractor.

The court has granted Nissin's request for judicial notice of the complaint. The court has continued the hearing to a later date, and ordered Plaintiff to submit a proper and responsive separate statement, including any and all evidence relied upon. The court has also ordered the moving party to give notice of the continued hearing.

The court has noted several procedural defects in Plaintiff's opposition, including the failure to comply with CCP ยง437c(b)(3) and the failure to file any evidence with the court. The court has given Plaintiff the opportunity to cure these defects in a subsequent filing.
