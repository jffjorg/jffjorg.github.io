BACKGROUND Defendant VEJ Pomona 3 (“Defendant”) propounded on plaintiff Anthony Osegueda (“Plaintiff”) (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) demand for production of documents, set one, on October 5, 2023. (Cook Decl. ¶ 2; Exhs. A-C.) After granting Plaintiff extensions due to Plaintiff’s prior counsel seeking to be relieved as counsel, no responses have been served to date. On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved was granted. Plaintiff has not responded to defense counsel’s inquiries regarding his current representation status and to the outstanding discovery. Defendant therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  The instant motion was served on Plaintiff in pro per. (Proof of Service, April 16, 2024.) Any opposition was due on or before May 10, 2024; none has been filed.    II. MOTIONS TO COMPEL Legal Standard For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)    Discussion The Court notes that both defendants VEJ Pomona 3 and VCT Management brought the instant motion. However, the evidence demonstrates that only VEJ Pomona 3 propounded the subject discovery. The Court will therefore limit its order to the party which had propounded the discovery at issue. Conclusion & Order Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery by VEJ Pomona 3 and failed to timely respond, any objections have been waived, and the unopposed motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to VEJ Pomona 3’s (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) demand for production of documents, set one, without objections, within thirty (30) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b), 2031.300(a),(b).)  III. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Defendants seek sanctions in the amount of $1,577.95 for the motion to compel.    A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)         VEJ Pomona 3 is awarded one hour for the motion to compel, and one hour to appear at the hearing (awarded only once), at the requested rate of $185 per hour for a total of $370 in attorney’s fees. Motion filing fees are ordinarily in the range of $60, and there is no explanation as to how this came out to $97.95 in filing fees. Thus, the Court declines to award VEJ Pomona 3 the request for filing fees as costs.        Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff. Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions to VEJ Pomona 3, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $370, within thirty (30) days.  IV.  ADDITIONAL FILING FEES¿ The Court notes that defendants VEJ Pomona 3 and VCT Management filed a single motion for what should have been three separate motions as to the motions to compel form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents. Combining discovery motions allows the moving party to avoid paying the requisite filing fees. Filing fees are jurisdictional and it is mandatory for court clerks to demand and receive them. (See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457, 460.) Thus, VEJ Pomona 3 and/or VCT Management are ordered to pay two additional filing fees. This ruling will be final only upon proof of payment of the filing fees.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 22nd day of May 2024      Hon. Michelle C. Kim Judge of the Superior Court
