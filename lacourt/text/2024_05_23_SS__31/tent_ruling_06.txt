BACKGROUND On February 16, 2024, defendant City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) propounded supplemental demand for production of documents, on plaintiffs Luis Ramirez (“Plaintiff Ramirez”) and Cole Hershon (“Plaintiff Hershon”). (Mot. McGuire Decls. ¶ 2; Exh. A.) To date, Plaintiff Ramirez and Plaintiff Hershon have not served responses. (Id. at ¶ 4.) Defendant therefore moves the Court for an order compelling them to provide responses to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions. As of May 10, 2024, no opposition has been filed.   II.  MOTION TO COMPEL SUPPLEMENTAL DISCOVERY A party may propound a supplemental interrogatory or supplemental demand for production of documents to elicit any later acquired information bearing on all answers previously made by any party.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.070, subd. (a), 2031.050, subd. (a).) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff Ramirez and Plaintiff Hershon were properly served with discovery and failed to respond, Defendant’s unopposed motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff Ramirez and Plaintiff Hershon are ordered to serve verified responses to defendant Los City of Los Angeles’ demand for production of documents, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (CCP § 2031.300(a),(b).)  III. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿(Code Civ. Proc. §2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Defendant seeks $1,050 in monetary sanctions for each motion. A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.) Defendant is awarded $250 per motion as attorney fees.  Sanctions are sought and imposed against Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ attorney of record, jointly and severally, as follows: Plaintiff Ramirez and/or his counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to defendant the City of Los Angeles, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $250, within fifteen (15) days.  Plaintiff Hershon and/or his counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to defendant the City of Los Angeles, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $250, within fifteen (15) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 22nd day of May 2024      Hon. Michelle C. Kim Judge of the Superior Court
