II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1048 states, in pertinent part: “When actions involving a common question of
law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial
of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).) 

 
California Rules of Court, Rule
3.350 provides, “[a] notice of motion to consolidate must: (A) [l]ist all named
parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of
their respective attorneys of record; (B) [c]ontain the captions of all the
cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first; and
(C) [b]e filed in each case sought to be consolidated.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1).)  Rule 3.350 further provides, “[t]he motion to
consolidate: (A) [i]s deemed a single motion for the purposes of determining
the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums, declarations, and other supporting
papers must be filed only in the lowest numbered case; (B) [m]ust be served on
all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated; and (C) [m]ust have a proof of service filed as part
of the motion.”  (Id., rule
3.350(a)(2).)  
 
Further, Los Angeles County Court
Rules, Rule 3.3(g) states, “[c]ases may not be consolidated unless they are in
the same department.  A motion to
consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases,
initially filed in different departments, have been related into a single
department, or if the cases were already assigned to that department.”  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule
3.3(g).)
