[1] “Executive” is defined as “James R. Boothe.” [2] “Company” is defined as “SBAM.”[3] This is to say, Defendants selectively cite the evidentiary record to omit Plaintiff’s testimony on whether he made a request to hire at the March 14 meeting with Huffman.  At bottom, Defendants take issue with a lack of documentary evidence of a request to hire.  But Defendants do not provide any authority that testimony (and a supporting declaration) of an evidentiary fact cannot raise a triable issue.  This case will turn on the credibility of Huffman’s testimony and Plaintiff’s testimony which, as the court has explained, is not a determination that can be made on summary judgment.[4] Defendants also take issue with Plaintiff’s “self-serving” declaration which states that he made a request to hire at the March 14 meeting with Huffman.  However, this is not the only evidence in the record.  As stated above,  Plaintiff testified to the same when arbitrating his claims with Defendants before Judge Friedman.  (Plaintiff’s Depo., pp. 362-363.)
