And here is a brief English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling denies the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment in the case of James R. Boothe v. Santa Barbara Asset Management, LLC, et al. The Plaintiff, James R. Boothe, alleges that he was terminated from his position as Portfolio Manager and Chief Investment Officer due to "Good Reason" under the Employment Agreement. The Defendant argues that Boothe did not timely provide notice of the "Good Reason" and that the events leading to the resignation did not trigger the "Good Reason" clause in the employment agreement. The Court disagrees with the Defendant's interpretation of the "Good Reason" clause and finds that the Plaintiff timely provided notice of the "Good Reason" on June 7, 2019. The Court also finds that there exists a triable issue of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff made an oral request to fill vacant positions at the March 14, 2019 meeting, and therefore denies the Motion for Summary Judgment.
