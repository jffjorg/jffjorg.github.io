Background
On March 1, 2022, Jose Guevara (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Alireza Shapoury (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100 for
negligence and premises liability arising out of injuried that Plaintiff
alleged sustained while performing yardwork for Defendant on June 30, 2020.
 
On May 15, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
 
On October 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Settlement of Entire Case.  The next day,
the Court vacated the trial date and set an OSC re Dismissal.  The OSC was continued on several occasions.  The case has not been dismissed, and it appears
that the settlement was never finalized.
 
On May 30, 2024, the Court set a Trial Setting Conference
for July 31.  The Trial Setting
Conference was continued on several occasions.
 
On July 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved as
attorney of record. 
 
On July 31, 2024, the Court continued the OSC re
Dismissal and Trial Setting Conference to October 22, 2024.  On October 22, 2024, the Court continued the
OSC re Dismissal and Trial Setting Conference to November 21, 2024. 
 
On October 16, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters
specified in Requests for Admissions (Set One). 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On July 30, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Requests for Admissions (Set One) by mail. (Jones Decl., ¶ 5.) No
responses have been served. (Id., ¶ 10.)
 
Defendant need show nothing more.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion and deems Plaintiff to admitted the truth of the matters
specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One).
 
Monetary sanctions are
mandatory.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)  Given the relatively
straightforward nature of this unopposed motion, the Court sets sanctions in
the amount of $472.50, based on 1.5 hours of attorney time, multiplied by
counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $275 per hour, plus $60 filing fee.  (See Jones Dec., ¶ 11.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion
for a Deemed-Admitted Order. 
 
The Court DEEMS Plaintiff Jose
Guevara to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Defendant’s Requests
for Admissions (Set One).
 
The Court GRANTS in part Defendant’s
request for sanctions.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Jose
Guevara to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount
of $472.50 to Defendant (through counsel) within 30 days of notice.
 
The Court DISCHARGES the Order to
Show re Dismissal (Settlement).
 
The Court SETS trial in approximately
90 days.  The Final Status Conference and
discovery deadlines are set based on the new trial date.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
