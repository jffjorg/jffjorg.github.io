22STCV32115
Defendants’ Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff
Tentative
The motion to compel is granted.  
The request for sanctions is granted in part.
Background
On September 30, 2022, Ventura Cruz Dominguez
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Ryan Andrew Alamrio Orquiza, Arline J.
Almario Orquiza, Rogelio R. Orquiza (collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1
through 20 for motor vehicle negligence and negligence per se arising from an
automobile accident occurring on October 7, 2020.
On February 7, 2024, Defendants filed an
answer.
On November 8, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel was
relieved as attorney of record. 
On October 15, 2024, Defendants filed this motion to
compel the deposition of Plaintiff. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action … to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendants
seek an order compelling Plaintiff to appear for deposition under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.450.
 
On August
14, 2024, Defendants noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for October 4, 2024. (Gluski
Decl., ¶ 5.) Defense counsel followed up with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the
deposition on October 1.  (Id., ¶¶
8-9.) Plaintiff failed to attend the October 4. (Id., ¶ 10.) 
 
Defendants
have satisfied all procedural and substantive requirements.  The motion to compel is granted.
 
The
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of this unopposed motion,
the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $852.25, based on 1.5 hours of
attorney time (multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $220 per hour), plus
1 hour of paralegal time (multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $85 per
hour), plus costs of $437.25.  (See
Gluski Decl., ¶¶ 12-20.)

GRANTS Defendants’ motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Ventura Cruz
Dominguez.

hours before the deposition.
 
The
Court GRANTS in part Defendants’ request for sanctions.
