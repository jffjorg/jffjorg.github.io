And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for an order deeming the plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in the defendant's requests for admissions. The plaintiff failed to respond to the requests for admissions, and the defendant is entitled to the deemed-admitted order under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280. The court has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $472.50, which is the reasonable expenses incurred by the defendant as a result of the plaintiff's failure to respond to the requests for admissions. The court has discharged the order to show cause re dismissal and has set the trial in approximately 90 days.
