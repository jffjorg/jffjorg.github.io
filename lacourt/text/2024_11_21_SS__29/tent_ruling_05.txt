 Case Number:  22STCV36026    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  29 Dominguez v. Los Angeles Unified School
District
22STCV36026
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, for Summary
Adjudication
Tentative
The Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.
The Motion for Summary Adjudication, in the alternative,
is denied in part and granted in part.
Background
On November 15, 2022, Destiny Dominguez, a minor (“Plaintiff”),
by and through her Guardian Ad Litem filed a complaint against Los Angeles
Unified School District (“LAUSD”), Jose Arevalo (“Arevalo”), and Does 1 through
100. Plaintiff asserts causes of action for (1) assault and battery, (2)
violation of Government Code section 815.2 (vicarious liability), (3) breach of
mandatory duty under Government Code section 815.6 (negligent supervision), (4)
dangerous condition of public property (Government Code section 835), and (5)
negligence. Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that on or about April 28,
2022, while Plaintiff was a 15 year old student attending school at Robert F.
Kennedy Los Angeles High School of the Arts, she was the victim of unlawful
physical and sexual assault and battery by Defendant Arevalo (who was at the
time an 18-year old student) and/or some of the Doe defendants. (See Complaint,
¶¶ 3, 7, 11.)
On January 5, 2023, LAUSD filed its answer. 
On May 26, 2023, Arevalo filed an answer. 
On January 16, 2024, LAUSD filed this motion
for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication of each
of the causes of action asserted against it in Plaintiff’s complaint. 
On October 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition
and objections to some of LAUSD’s evidence. 
On November 6, 2024, LAUSD filed a reply and
objections to some of Plaintiff’s evidence.
The hearing was initially scheduled for
November 12 and was continued so that certain evidence that Plaintiff had
served but not filed could be placed in the court file.
Legal Standard
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Objections to Evidence
Each party objects to some of the
evidence submitted by the other. Evidence presented in support of, or in
opposition to, a motion for summary judgment must be admissible. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry v.
Bakewell Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2
Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court must “consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers, except the
evidence to which objections have been made and sustained.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff asserts nine objections to exhibits
attached to the declaration of LAUSD’s counsel Gil Abed. The Court SUSTAINS all
nine objections as to lack of foundation. In addition, and independently, the
Court SUSTAINS the objections to Exhibits 6, 10, and 12 on the ground that they
are not in English and no certified translation has been provided.
LAUSD raises numerous objections to the
declaration of Joseph Schwartzberg and Plaintiff’s evidence. The Court notes
LAUSD’s objections are not in accordance with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1354(b) as the objections are not numbered. The Court OVERRULES LAUSD’s objections.
The Court
finds that Mr. Schwartzberg has appropriate credentials and his testimony relates to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience
that the opinion of an expert witness would assist the trier of act; is based
on information of the type on which an expert may reasonably rely; is based on
reasons supported by the information on which the expert relies; and is not
speculative. (Evid. Code, §§ 801-802; Sargon Enterprises v. USC (2012)
55 Cal.4th 747, 771-21.) 
The Court
recognizes that Mr. Schwartzberg opines that there was a dangerous condition
present at the scene of the incident. This testimony is not binding on the
Court and does not in itself create a disputed issue of material fact on a
motion for summary judgment. “The fact that a witness can be found
to opine that … a condition constitutes a significant risk and a dangerous
condition does not eliminate this court’s statutory task pursuant to Government
Code section 830.2, of independently evaluating the circumstances.” (Thimon
v. City of Newark (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 745, 755; accord Sun v. City of
Oakland (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1189; Davis v. City of Pasadena
(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 701, 705.) But expert opinion may be admissible,
relevant, and helpful to the Court, even if it is not determinative. The Court will consider all of the admissible evidence (including
the expert opinion evidence as to which no objection is sustained) in
conducting its independent obligation (in which expert opinion evidence is not
determinative) to evaluate whether the existence of a dangerous condition may
be resolved on this record as a matter of law.
As to the LAUSD’s objections on the ground
that the declaration of Mr. Schwartzberg or misstates
the evidence, the Court will make its decision based on the admissible evidence
itself, not anyone’s summary, characterization, or description of the evidence.
Discussion
Plaintiff alleges that she was physically and
sexually assaulted and battered by another student, Defendant Arevalo, on
LAUSD’s Robert F. Kennedy campus on April 28, 2022. (Complaint, ¶ 11.) 
In the complaint, Plaintiff asserts the
following causes of action against LAUSD: vicarious liability for negligence
under Government Code section 815.2 (Second Cause of Action); breach of
mandatory duty of supervision under Government Code section 815.6 (Third Cause
of Action); and dangerous condition of public property under Government Code
section 835 (Fourth Cause of Action). LAUSD moves for summary judgment or, in
the alternative, summary adjudication as to each of these causes of action.
As a threshold matter, Plaintiff argues that
the Court should deny LAUSD’s motion because of its Separate Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts includes both material and non-material facts in
violation of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(d)(2). Although the Court
has discretion to deny a motion for summary judgment when the moving party
fails to submit a Separate Statement that complies with Rule 3.1350, the Court
declines to exercise that discretion here.
The Court now turns to the facts in the record,
only some of which are summarized here.
The Robert F. Kennedy campus is comprised of
six K-12 schools. (Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts
[“DSUMF”], No. 1.) At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was a freshman
enrolled in the Los Angeles High School of the Arts (“LAHSA”). (DSUMF, No. 2.)
LAUSD contends that it had no prior knowledge
of any inappropriate behavior by Arevalo toward Plaintiff or any other student.
The Court has sustained the objection, however, to the only evidence cited in
the DSUMF in support of this purported fact (DSUMF, No. 4).
Plaintiff first met Arevalo three days before
the incident, on Monday, April 25, 2022. (DSUMF, No. 6.) They had an in-person
conversation and connected with each other on Instagram. (DSUMF, No. 7.) After
school that day, they met each other on the campus, and Plaintiff gave Arevalo
a side hug. (DSUMF, No. 9.) They messaged each other over Instagram later that
day. (DSUMF, No. 10.) 
The next day, on Tuesday, April 26, 2022, Plaintiff
and Arevalo met each other after school on the campus for approximately five
minutes. (DSUMF, Nos. 12-13.) Arevalo tried to kiss and hug Plaintiff, which
she did not like. (DSUMF, No. 13.) But Plaintiff did continue to message
Arevalo on Instagram. (DSUMF, No. 15.)
After school on Wednesday, April 27, 2022,
Plaintiff and Arevalo communicated by phone and text. (DSUMF, Nos. 21-22.)
Plaintiff told Arevalo by text that she was not interested in him. (DSUMF, No.
22.)
On the day of the incident, Thursday, April 28,
2022, Plaintiff and Arevalo encountered each other on what is described as the
blacktop area of the campus. (DSUMF, No. 27.) Arevalo asked Plaintiff to leave
the area with him, but Plaintiff stated that she did not want to do so. (DSUMF,
No. 28.) Arevalo grabbed Plaintiff’s arm and told her that he wanted her to
come with him. (DSUMF, No. 29.) 
At this point, Plaintiff was frightened of
Arevalo. (DSUMF, No. 30.) Plaintiff walked some distance away from Arevalo and
approached one of her friends, but Arevalo came over to Plaintiff and told her
again that he wanted her to come with him. (DSUMF, No. 35.) Plaintiff then
began to walk with Arevalo, after telling her friend that she did not want to
go with him. (DSUMF, No. 36-37.) 
Arevalo aggressively grabbed Plaintiff’s arm
very hard and pulled her to leave with him. (Plaintiff’s Statement of
Additional Material Facts [“PSAMF”], No. 7.) Plaintiff was scared and tried to
get away from Arevalo but could not. (PSAMF, No. 10.)
They walked past the school library. (DSUMF,
No. 39.) When they approached a water fountain, Plaintiff stopped. (DSUMF, No.
40.) Arevalo tried to hug Plaintiff. (DSUMF, No. 42.) Plaintiff hit Arevalo and
pushed him away, which made Arevalo mad. (DSUMF, No. 42; PSAMF, No. 12.)
Arevalo forced Plaintiff to continue walking with him, and she complied.
(DSUMF, No. 43; PSAMF, No. 12.)
Plaintiff and Arevalo entered Building C, the
main building for the LAHSA academy, walked downstairs, and went underneath a
stairwell (Stairwell 9). (DSUMF, No. 45; PSAMF, No. 27.) Arevalo took
Plaintiff’s cell phone and threw it far away from her. (PSAMF, No. 15.)
Underneath Stairwell 9, Arevalo sexually
assaulted Plaintiff. (DSUMF, No. 53; PSAMF, No. 17.) 
(LAUSD points out that Defendant Arevalo
contends that the sexual activity with Plaintiff was consensual, but this is
disputed by Plaintiff, and on summary judgment the Court resolves all disputes
in favor of the nonmoving party.)
Two staff members approached; this was either
after the sexual assault was already complete, or Arevalo stopped the assault
when the two staff members approached. (DSUMF, Nos. 56, 58; PSAMF, Nos. 17-18.)
The staff members told Arevalo and Plaintiff to come out from under the
stairwell. (DSUMF, No. 60.) One staff member lectured Plaintiff about being
more responsible. (PSAMF, No. 20.) Plaintiff did not at that time report the
sexual assault to the staff members. (DSUMF, No. 62.)
Plaintiff did not go to school the next day, on
Friday, April 29, 2022. (Plaintiff’s Depo., at 87:23-88:2.) (Excerpts from the
transcript of the deposition of Plaintiff appear as Exhibits 2 and 3 to the
Declaration of Gil Abed and as Plaintiff’s Exhibits F and G.) One of
Plaintiff’s friends was at school, and while her friend was speaking to
Plaintiff, the friend passed her phone to an LAUSD staff member that Plaintiff
referred to as “Mr. Flex.” (Id., at 88:22-89:3.) Plaintiff told Mr. Flex
about the sexual assault. (Id., at 88:22-90:9.) Plaintiff identified the
attacker as “Jose”; at the time, Plaintiff did not know his last name. (Id.,
at 90:14-20.) Mr. Flex told Plaintiff that he had to report the attack to the
principal. (Id., at 91:10-23.)
Plaintiff testified that although she did not
tell Mr. Flex what Jose’s last name was, Mr. Flex knew which student she was
referring to. (Id., at 92:9-93:3.) Plaintiff testified that Mr. Flex
told her that “Jose was aggressive with people” and “they have had problems
with him before.” (Id., at 92:3-8, 93:4-7.)
On Saturday, April 30, Plaintiff reported the
sexual assault to the police. (DSUMF, No. 63.) 
Plaintiff and her mother reported the assault
to the principal on Monday, May 2, 2022. (DSUMF, No. 64.)
LAHSA Principal Cathy Kwan testified that it
was against school policy for students to have sex on campus. (Kwan Depo., at
85:2-5.) (Excerpts from the transcript of the deposition of Principal Kwan
appear as Exhibit 4 to the Declaration of Gil Abed and as Plaintiff’s Exhibit D.)
It was also against school policy for students to use Stairwell 9, except in
case of emergency. (Id., at 93:14-94:1.) Nonetheless, Principal Kwan was
aware that sometimes students used the stairs when they should not. (Id.,
at 99:10-23.) She testified that she did not recall any other incident of
students engaging in sexual activity in the stairwell. (Id., at
102:17-22.)
Principal Kwan testified that at the time of
the assault, there were more than “30 campus aides, slash, supervision aides”
on the Robert F. Kennedy school campuses. (Id. at 152:8-23.) She also
testified that she was made aware of certain “hotspots” on the campuses but did
not recall Stairwell 9 being a hotspot for “inappropriate activity.” (Id.,
at 161:19-162:15.)
Defendant Arevalo testified that he and other
students frequently used Stairwell 9. (Arevalo Depo. [Plaintiff’s Exh. A], at
65:24-67:12, 79:16-80:10.) He never saw teachers, staff, or other adults in
Stairwell 9. (Id., at 74:5-13, 80:11-16.)
Defendant Arevalo testified that he sometimes
saw trash in Stairwell 9. (Id., at 67:23-25.) “There was also a lot of
papers, like condoms, or trash like bottles and stuff like that.” (Id.,
at 68:1-7.) He saw condoms there on only one occasion, on April 28, 2022, the
date of the attack. (Id., at 68:13-24.) He saw “three or four” condoms
there at that time. (Id., at 69:2-4.) His testimony was not clear, but
at one point he stated that what he saw was the packaging “wrappers” for condoms.
(Id., at 69:9-70:15.) They were “thrown away there.” (Id., at
71:16-18.)
Defendant Arevalo also testified that he heard
from friends that sometimes students would have sex on campus. (Id., at
72:4-13.) He also personally observed couples “making out or kissing” in
Stairwell 9 approximately “five or six times.” (Id., at 73:10-12,
73:22-74:4.) 
Supervision Aide Adela Chavez, one of the two
staff members who approached Plaintiff and Defendant Arevalo shortly after the assault,
testified that at the time of the attack, she was responsible for monitoring
all of the stairwells, including Stairwell 9, and she was the only supervision
aide with that responsibility. (Chavez Depo. [Plaintiff’s Exh. B], at 34:3-22,
47:24-48:10, 58:3-59:2.) “I was the only one checking, walking around.” (Id.,
at 34:12-13.) She had other responsibilities as well, and would “check on” the
stairwells “if I had nowhere else to be, nothing else to do.” (Id., at 48:11-18.)
When asked how many times each day she would check on the stairwells, Ms.
Chavez responded, “Not too often,” and later stated that she monitored Stairwell
9 approximately four to five times each day. (Id., at 48:11-14, 54:3-6.)
Supervision Aide Chavez testified that the
areas below the staircases was one of the places that students sometimes would
go to when they were engaged in activities that they “should not be doing.” (Id.,
at 62:1-15.) “[A]lmost every day when I was checking, I would find both boys or
girls, like couples, you know.” (Id., at 63:2-7.)
Ms. Chavez testified that, prior to the attack,
she had seen trash but not condoms in Stairwell 9. (Id., at 94:2-23,
97:2-25.) She had seen condoms in other stairwells. (Id., at 98:4-9.)
Second and Third Causes of Action
The Court begins by noting that in the briefing
on this motion, both LAUSD and Plaintiff combine their arguments relating to
the Second and Third Causes of Action in the complaint (for vicarious liability
for negligence and for violation of a mandatory duty of supervision). The Court
takes the same approach.
Schools have a legal duty to exercise reasonable
care in protecting students against known or reasonably foreseeable risks. (Dailey
v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 741, 747; Thompson
v. Sacramento City Unified School Dist. (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1372; Brownwell
v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 787, 798.) This
includes a duty to use ordinary care in the supervision of students. (Hoyem v.
Manhattan Beach City School Dist. (1978) 22 Cal.3d 508, 513; Dailey,
supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 747; J.H. v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist.
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 123, 139.) But schools are not guarantors of the physical
safety of students and are not strictly liable for any injury suffered by
students on school grounds. (Hoyem, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 513; Dailey,
supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 747; Thompson, supra, 107 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1371-72.)
A plaintiff need not “prove that the very
injury which occurred must have been foreseeable by the school authorities.” (J.H.,
supra, 183 Cal.App.4th at p. 146.) The negligence of school authorities “is
established if a reasonably prudent person would foresee that injuries of the
same general type would be likely to happen in the absence of [additional]
safeguards.” (Ibid.; see also M.W. v. Panama Buena Vista Union School
(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 508, 516-517.) Foreseeability must be “determined in
light of all the circumstances.” (J.H., supra, 183 Cal.App.4th at p. 146;
M.W., supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p. 519. Whether “an unreasonable risk of
harm was foreseeable under the particular facts of a given case” is a question
of fact for the jury; it becomes an issue of law that can be resolved in favor
of the school district only if no reasonable finder of fact, after drawing all
reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, could find that the risk of
harm was foreseeable. (M.W., supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p. 516; see also J.H.,
supra, 183 Cal.App.4th at p. 146.)
The evidence in the record on whether LAUSD met
its mandatory duty to supervise students and on whether school employees were
negligent is mixed. LAUSD argues that there is no documented evidence of prior aggressive
or other inappropriate behavior by Defendant Arevalo, and that students were
not permitted in the area in which the assault took place. (DSUMF, Nos. 4, 5, 46,
47.) 
But there is evidence in the record that there
were “hotspots” on the school campuses at which students engaged in
inappropriate activity. (Kwon Depo., at 161:19-162:15.) Stairwells, and the
areas below the stairwells, were known to be one of those locations. (Chavez Depo.,
at 62:1-15.) And one type of inappropriate activity that occurred in and around
the stairwells was romantic or sexual activity. (Id., at 63:2-7; Arevalo
Depo., at 73:10-12, 73:22-74:4.) This activity was not limited to kissing, as
both Supervision Aide Chavez and Defendant Arevalo testified to seeing condoms
or condom wrappers in or near the stairwells. (Chavez Depo., at 98:4-9; Arevalo
Depo., at 68:1-71:18.)
Supervision Aide Chavez testified that she was
the only one with responsibility to monitor Stairwell 9, that she checked on
the stairwell “not too often,” when she “had nowhere else to be, nothing else
to do.” (Chavez Depo., at at 34:3-22, 34:12-13, 47:24-48:18, 54:3-6, 58:3-59:2.)

On this record, viewing the evidence in the
light most favor able to nonmoving party, and drawing all reasonable inferences
in her favor, the Court concludes that the trier of fact could reasonably find
that LAUSD personnel were negligent and failed to meet their mandatory duty to
supervise students adequately. The trier of fact could find that LAUSD and its
personnel knew or should have known that students used the areas in and below
the stairwells for improper activity, including sexual activity, and that LAUSD
and its personnel did not adequately monitor these known hotspots, including on
the date and at the time that Defendant Arevalo attacked Plaintiff. Of course,
the trier of fact could also reasonably find the opposite, but there are
triable issues of fact on both the Second and Third Causes of Action in the complaint.
The Court cannot conclude that LAUSD is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
on these causes of action.
Accordingly, LAUSD’s motion for summary
judgment is denied, and LAUSD’s motion for summary adjudication on the Second
and Third Causes of Action in the complaint is denied.
Fourth Cause of Action
In her Fourth Cause of Action, Plaintiff alleges that she was injured
as a result of a dangerous condition of public property under Government Code
section 835. As set forth in
the statute, there are four elements for such a claim: 
“[A] public entity is
liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the
plaintiff establishes [1] that the property was in a dangerous condition at the
time of the injury, [2] that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous
condition, [3] that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable
risk of the kind of injury which was incurred, and [4] either: (a) A
negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity
within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition; or¿(b) The
public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition
under Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken
measures to protect against the dangerous condition.”
(Gov.
Code, § 835; see also, e.g., Tansavatdi v. City of
Rancho Palos Verdes (2023) 14 Cal.5th 639, 653; Thimon v. City of Newark (2020) 44
Cal.App.5th 745, 753.)  
The
term “dangerous condition” means a “condition of property that creates a
substantial (as distinguished from a minor,¿trivial¿or insignificant) risk of
injury when such property or adjacent property is used with due care in a
manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable that it¿will be used.”¿ (Gov.
Code, § 830, subd. (a); see also Thimon, supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at p.
754.)¿ “The existence of a dangerous condition ordinarily is a question of
fact, but the issue may be resolved as a matter of law if reasonable minds can
come to only one conclusion.” (Peterson v. San Francisco Comm. College
Dist.¿(1984) 36 Cal.3d 799, 810; accord Stack v. City of Lemoore (2023)
91 Cal.App.5th 102, 110.)  
Plaintiff has the burden of pleading, and
ultimately proving, the existence of a dangerous condition and each element of
a cause of action under Government Code 835. A court may not presume that there
was a dangerous condition merely because the plaintiff was injured. (Sambrano
v. City of San Diego (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 225, 241 [describing such an
argument as “reason[ing] backwards”].)
“A condition is not
dangerous within the meaning of the statute unless it creates a hazard to those
who foreseeably will use the property ... with due care. Thus, even though
it is foreseeable that persons may use public property without due care, a
public entity may not be held liable for failing to take precautions to protect
such persons.”¿¿(Matthews v. City of Cerritos¿(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1380,
1384.) “The condition of the property involved should create a
‘substantial risk’ of injury, for an undue burden would be placed upon public
entities if they were responsible for the repair of all conditions creating any
possibility of injury however remote that possibility might be.”¿¿(Fredette¿v.
City of Long Beach¿(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 122, 130, fn.5.)
To prevail on a claim under
section 835, a plaintiff must prove that “there is some defect in the property
itself.” (Zelig v. City of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1135;
accord Cordova v. City of Los Angeles (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1099, 1105.) That defect may be dangerous in and of
itself, or it may be dangerous because it increases the risk of injury caused
by third parties, but in either event it must be a defect in the physical
characteristics of the property. (E.g., Zelig, supra, 27 Cal.4th at pp.
1134-1137; Peterson, supra, 36 Cal.3d at pp. 812-813; Zuniga v.
Housing Authority (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 82.) Mere ownership of a public
facility in which other parties injure a plaintiff is not, however, without
more, a dangerous condition giving rise to liability under section 835. (Zelig,
supra, 27 Cal.4th at pp. 1135-1137.)
On these facts, the Court concludes
that LAUSD has shown that there are no triable issues of fact and that LAUSD is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Fourth Cause of Action. Plaintiff
has other viable causes of action, but there are no facts in the record that would
support a finding that there was “some defect in the property itself.” (Zelig,
supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 1135.) The existence of staircases and stairwells
is not a dangerous condition. Plaintiff has not presented evidence of any
physical characteristic in the property that was either dangerous in and of
itself or increased the risk of injury from others.
Accordingly, LAUSD’s motion for summary
adjudication as to the Fourth Cause of Action is granted.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES LAUSD’s motion for summary
judgment. 
The Court DENIES LAUSD’s motion for summary
adjudication as to the Second Cause of Action and the Third Cause of Action.
The Court GRANTS LAUSD’s motion for summary
adjudication as to the Fourth Cause of Action.
Moving Party is to give notice.
