And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a case involving Facebook, Inc. and DOE 1, where DOE 1 has made a statement that is being disputed. The court notes that federal precedents are not binding, but should be given significant weight. The court also references the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which immunizes interactive computer service providers that "passively display content that is created entirely by third parties." The court concludes that DOE 1's statement is an opinion, rather than a fact, and that Facebook's display of content is protected by the CDA.
