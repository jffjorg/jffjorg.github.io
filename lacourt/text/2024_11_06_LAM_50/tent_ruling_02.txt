  ORDER RE:
 
DEMURRER TO
  PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT



 
Background
On July 3, 2024, Plaintiff P.V.B.B. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Odilia N. Smith and Inti Immigration Services, Inc.
(jointly, “Defendants”). The Complaint alleges one cause of action for violation
of the Immigration Consultant Act. 
Defendants now demur to the Complaint. Plaintiff opposes. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter, the
Court notes that Defendants’ counsel’s declaration in support of the demurrer
provides, inter alia, that “[o]n July 16, 2024, I emailed Plaintiff’s
counsel to meet and confer regarding the deficiencies in Plaintiff’s complaint,
in an attempt to avoid motion practice…On July 16, 2024, I received an email
from Plaintiff’s counsel indicating that Plaintiff would not amend their
complaint or dismiss the case with prejudice.” (Brown Decl., ¶¶ 1-2.) The Court
notes that the Defendants’ counsel’s declaration does not demonstrate that the
parties met and conferred by telephone or in person, or that Defendants’
counsel attempted to do so.
 Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis
added.) Such meeting and conferring must be done in good faith with an
effort to try to resolve the issues subject to the demurrer. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Defendants’ demurrer
is continued to _______________,
2024 at 2:00 p.m. in Dept. 50.  
Defendants are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiff within 10 days
of the date of this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading
issues¿or if the parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith,
Defendants are to¿thereafter¿file and serve¿a declaration setting forth
the efforts to meet and confer in compliance with¿Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
Defendants ordered to give notice of this order.
