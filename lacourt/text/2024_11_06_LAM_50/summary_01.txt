And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion by Counsel (Samer Habbas and Samar Hellar of Law Offices of Samer Habbas & Associates, P.C.) to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Richard Bower without prejudice. This decision was made because Counsel did not demonstrate that Plaintiff's electronic service address was confirmed within 30 days before filing the motion, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. The judge notes that while Counsel has provided sufficient reason for withdrawal, Item 5 of the proposed order is blank. The judge also points out that the proof of service filed by Counsel indicates that Plaintiff was served with the moving papers via email on October 14, 2024, but does not demonstrate that Plaintiff's electronic service address was confirmed within the required timeframe.
