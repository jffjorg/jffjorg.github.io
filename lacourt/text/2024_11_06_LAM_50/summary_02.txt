And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing on the demurrer filed by the Defendants (Odilia N. Smith and Inti Immigration Services, Inc.) to the Plaintiff's (P.V.B.B.) complaint alleging a violation of the Immigration Consultant Act. The Defendants' counsel declared that they attempted to meet and confer with the Plaintiff's counsel on July 16, 2024, but the declaration does not demonstrate that the parties met and conferred in person, by telephone, or by video conference as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. The Judge orders the Defendants to meet and confer with the Plaintiff within 10 days of the date of this order, and if the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues, the Defendants must file and serve a declaration setting forth their efforts to meet and confer within 15 days of this order. The hearing is continued to a date to be determined.
