[TENTATIVE] ORDER MOTION TO
 BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFFS  
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING
PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT AGAINST DEFENDANT, MARK HICKMAN 
 
I.      
BACKGROUND
      The
first amended complaint alleges a claim for wrongful death of Plaintiffs’
decedent, who died in a car accident involving Defendant, Felipe Gonzalez, Jr.
(“Gonzalez”), who was driving a vehicle allegedly owned by Defendant, Mark
Hickman (“Hickman”). Plaintiffs allege Hickman also negligently entrusted the
vehicle to Gonzalez.  Gonzalez filed his
answer on June 7, 2024. The clerk entered default against Hickman on June 17,
2024. 
      Plaintiffs’
counsel, Bruce M. Brusavich/Kevin P. Culpepper, ACTS Law, moves for an order to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs. A conflict has arisen requiring
Counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel has confirmed the electronic mail address of Plaintiff,
Keyon Goldorazena, and the Guardian ad Litem. 
Counsel has not been able to confirm the mailing address of Plaintiffs
despite due diligence.
      As
all requirements for relief are met, the motion is GRANTED. (California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. ) The order is effective upon
the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. Moving
party is ordered to give notice.  

 

 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING
OFF CALENDAR PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT AGAINST DEFENDANT, MARK
HICKMAN, FOR LACK OF NOTICE TO THE NON-DEFAULTING DEFENDANT
      
      Plaintiffs
allege Defendant Hickman is liable for Plaintiffs’ injuries based on Hickman’s
ownership of the vehicle and due to Hickman’s alleged negligent entrustment of
the vehicle to Defendant Gonzalez. Plaintiffs request a judgment by default
against Hickman, whose default has been previously entered. Defendant Gonzalez
remains in the case and has recently substituted in new counsel. (Substitution,
7/16/24.) 
      The
request is defective as Plaintiffs did not serve the request on all interested
parties, which includes Defendant Gonzalez. 
      Additionally,
Plaintiffs have not explained why a separate judgment is proper. The court has discretion
to render judgment against one defendant, leaving the action to proceed against
the others “whenever a several judgment is proper.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 579.) A separate judgment against Hickman is improper if co-Defendant
Gonzalez raises defenses, which if proven, would also establish Hickman’s
non-liability. (Adams
Mfg. & Engineering Co. v. Coast Centerless Grinding Co. (1960) 184
Cal.App.2d 649, 655.) Gonzalez’s answer states an affirmative defense
asserting that Plaintiffs’ decedent’s negligence caused the incident. If
successful, this defense inures to the defaulting defendant’s benefit. (Id.
at 656.) 
      Based
on the foregoing, the request for a separate judgment by default against
Defendant Hickman is TAKEN OFF CALENDAR.
