And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Tentative Ruling Summary**

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Goldorazena, et al v. Gonzalez, et al. The case involves a wrongful death claim stemming from a car accident involving Defendant Gonzalez, who was driving a vehicle allegedly owned by Defendant Hickman. The Plaintiffs' counsel, Bruce M. Brusavich and Kevin P. Culpepper, have moved to be relieved as counsel due to a conflict and their motion has been GRANTED.

The court has also denied the Plaintiffs' request for entry of default against Defendant Hickman, citing lack of notice to the non-defaulting defendant, Defendant Gonzalez. The request was defective as it did not serve all interested parties, including Defendant Gonzalez, and did not provide a sufficient explanation for why a separate judgment by default is proper.
