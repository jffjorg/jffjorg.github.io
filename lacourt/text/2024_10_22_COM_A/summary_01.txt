And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion by Defendant RRM Properties, Ltd. for leave to file a cross-complaint against the Plaintiff, Canteen SJC Properties, LLC. The cross-complaint seeks partition of the real property, which RRM no longer wishes to co-own with the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff does not oppose the motion, but requests the opportunity to amend the complaint. The judge grants the motion, finding that the Plaintiff does not have a valid basis to oppose the motion and that RRM has acted in good faith. The judge orders RRM to file its proposed cross-complaint within 15 days.
