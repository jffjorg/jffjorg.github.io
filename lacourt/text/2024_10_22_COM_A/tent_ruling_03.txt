[TENTATIVE] ORDER 
GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT
 
      This
action arises from claims for breach of contract and fraud  arising from the purchase of real property. Plaintiff
filed a Notice of Settlement on July 24, 2024. (Notc.)

      Plaintiff
moves for an order to enforce the July 24, 2024, settlement agreement, wherein Defendants
agreed to pay Plaintiff $5,000, release escrow funds of $108,865.37, and cancel
escrow instructions. (Mot.
Ex. 1.) Defendants failed to comply with the terms of settlement despite
Plaintiff’s attempts to contact Defendants. 
      Plaintiff
timely filed the motion my mail and electronic service. Defendants did not file
an opposition to the motion. 
      A party
can move for entry of judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6. The court’s power is limited to determining the
existence of the agreement and to enforce its settlement. (Corkland
v. Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.) The court may receive
oral testimony or may determine the motion upon declarations alone. (Id.) 
      The
court applies general contract principles when interpreting a settlement
agreement. 
(Leeman
v. Adams Extract & Spice, LLC (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1374.)The
mutual intent of the parties and interpretation of the contract are based on
the language of the agreement alone. (Id.)
In construing a contract, "it is not a court's prerogative to alter it, to
rewrite its clear terms, or to make a new contract for the parties."(Moss
Dev. Co. v. Geary (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 1, 9.) 
      The
court finds that the parties entered into a settlement agreement that was
signed by all interested parties. (Mot., Ex. 1.) The proposed judgment requests
findings that Defendants breached the agreement. However, as stated above, the
court’s power is limited to determining the existence of a valid agreement and
enter a judgment pursuant to those terms. (Greisman
v. FCA US, LLC (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 1310 [“If the court determines
that the parties entered into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the
motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”].)  Accordingly, the proposed order shall include
only those findings. 
      Plaintiff
requests an award of costs which is permitted absent a specific agreement
permitting such recovery in the event of a default. (Berti
v. Santa Barbara Beach Properties (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 70, 75 [Costs
are incident to judgment and “may be awarded absent an express agreement of the
parties."].)
      Plaintiff
has established that it is entitled to judgment according to the terms of the
parties’ settlement agreement. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
