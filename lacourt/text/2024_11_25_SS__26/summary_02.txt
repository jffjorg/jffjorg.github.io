And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant's responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff filed the motion on October 29, 2024, seeking to compel the defendant's initial responses to discovery requests. However, the court found that the plaintiff's discovery requests are in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 94, which limits the number of interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission that a party may propound in a limited jurisdiction court. The court declined to compel responses to discovery requests that were propounded in violation of the code.
