Defendant Aglo Management, LLC’S
Motion to Release Mechanic’s Lien is DENIED.  
ANALYSIS: Plaintiff Shmuel Cohen (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant Complaint for Foreclosure of Mechanic’s Lien against Defendant
Aglo Management, LLC (“Defendant”) on July 12, 2024. On September 17, 2024,
Defendant filed an answer to the Complaint and a cross-complaint for
violation of the Business & Professions Code, breach of contract,
negligence, and declaratory relief. On the same date, Defendant filed the instant
Motion to Release Mechanic’s Lien. 
Discussion
Defendant moves for an order to
release the mechanic's lien filed by Plaintiff pursuant to Civil Code section
8480, which states “[t]he owner of property or the owner of any interest in
property subject to a claim of lien may petition the court for an order to
release the property from the claim of lien if the claimant has not
commenced an action to enforce the lien within the time provided in Section
8460.” (Civ. Code, § 8480, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) Defendant,
however, does not address this necessary precondition to bringing the instant
Motion, or even cite the language of the moving statute in its papers. The time
for a claimant to commence an action to enforce the lien is under section 8460
is “within 90 days after recordation of the claim of lien.” (Civ. Code, § 8460,
subd. (a).) The lien that is the subject of this action was recorded on April
15, 2024. (Compl., ¶9 and Exh. A.) The instant action was commenced within the
time set forth in Civil Code section 8460, on July 12, 2024.
Therefore, Defendant, may not petition
the court for an order to release the property from the claim of lien and the
action will proceed to trial.
Conclusion
Defendant Aglo Management, LLC’S
Motion to Release Mechanic’s Lien is DENIED.
Court clerk to give notice.
