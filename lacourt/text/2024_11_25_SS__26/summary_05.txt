And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Aglo Management, LLC's motion to release a mechanic's lien filed by Plaintiff Shmuel Cohen. The motion was filed on September 17, 2024, but the judge notes that the defendant did not address the necessary precondition to bringing the motion, which is to commence an action to enforce the lien within the time provided in Civil Code section 8460. The lien was recorded on April 15, 2024, and the action was commenced on July 12, 2024, which falls within the 90-day time frame. Therefore, the judge determined that the defendant may not petition the court for an order to release the property from the claim of lien and the action will proceed to trial.
