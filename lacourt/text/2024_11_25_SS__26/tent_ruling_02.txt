 Case Number:  23STLC01716    Hearing Date:   November 25, 2024    Dept:  26 TENTATIVE RULING:
            
Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc.’s (1) Motion to
Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, and Request for Sanctions; and (2)
Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, and Request

ANALYSIS:
On March 14, 2023, Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc.
filed the instant action for breach of contract against Defendant Royal
Personal Training (“Defendant”). On February 21, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions. (Minute Order, 02/21/24.) Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel
Discovery Responses and Request for Sanctions, which came for hearing on
October 22, 2024. The Court noted a number of defects with the Motion to Compel,
including improperly filing a single discovery motion to compel responses with
respect to four separate sets of discovery and failing to attach copies of the
discovery requests served on Defendant. (Minute Order, 10/22/24.)
Plaintiff filed a supplemental declaration on October 22,
2024 and additional notices of motion demonstrating that these defects have
been corrected.
Discussion 
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s initial responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and Requests for Production, Set Two,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. (Notices of
Motion, filed 10/29/24, p. 1:24-26.)
However, the discovery requests propounded by Plaintiff are
in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 94, subdivision (4), which
limits the combined number of interrogatories, requests for production, and
requests for admission that a party may propound in the limited jurisdiction
court to 35, unless allowed by court order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 94, subd. (a),
§ 95.) No court order for additional discovery has been issued in this action
yet Plaintiff propounded a total of 49 special interrogatories and requests for
production of documents on Defendant. (Motion, Supp. Hurt Decl., Exh. A.) The
Court declines to compel responses to discovery propounded in violation of the
Code of Civil Procedure. 
Conclusion
Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc.’s (1) Motion to
Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, and Request for Sanctions; and (2)
Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, and Request
for Sanctions, are DENIED.
Court clerk to give notice.
