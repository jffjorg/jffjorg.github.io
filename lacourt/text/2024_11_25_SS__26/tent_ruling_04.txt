ANALYSIS:

Union (“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendant Veronica Arce
(“Defendant”). (Motion, Elder, Jr. Decl.,
Exh. A.) To date, Defendant has not served verified responses to the Requests
for Admission. (Id. at ¶3.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deem Matters
Admitted (“the Motion”) on October 10, 2024. No opposition has been filed to
date. 
Plaintiff moves for an order deeming the requests for
admission served on Defendant admitted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280, subdivision (b). There is no requirement for a prior meet and
confer effort before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time
after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280.) Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve verified responses and
resultant waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the requests
for admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
