Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Yoel Iribe's Motion to Dismiss is denied. The Defendant is required to file an answer within 20 days of this ruling. The Judge's analysis is as follows: The Defendant's Motion is not accompanied by proof of service showing notice of the motion and hearing date on the Plaintiff, which is a violation of statutory requirements and due process. Additionally, the Motion does not include a memorandum of points and authorities as required, and instead offers a one-page argument without any citation to law. The Judge concludes that the Defendant's Motion is denied due to these failures, and requires the Defendant to file an answer within 20 days.
