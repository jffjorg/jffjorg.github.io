And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a lemon law action brought by Hannah Dominick against General Motors LLC. The plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to her requests for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The court grants the motion as to certain requests, including those seeking recall documents, statements taken, repair directives, repairs, repair procedures, diagnostic procedures, and investigation documents. The court denies the motion as to other requests, finding them overbroad and overburdensome. The court also grants the motion as to certain special interrogatories and form interrogatories, finding that the objections lack merit and that the responses are insufficient. The court orders the defendant to provide further responses and documents within 30 days.
