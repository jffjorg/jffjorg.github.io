 Hearing Date:  October 23, 2024



 
Petitioner Jesse Rios’ motion for expenses
under C.C.P. §2033.420 against Respondent Liberty Mutual Insurance Company is
denied.  
 
Petitioner
Jesse Rios (“Rios”) (“Petitioner”)[1]
moves for expenses under C.C.P. §2033.420 against Respondent Liberty Mutual
Insurance Company (“Liberty”) (“Respondent”) on the grounds of the responding
party’s unwarranted refusal to admit, in the amount of $24,000 for the
contingency attorneys’ fees (40% of the $60,000 award) and allowable all or
most of the costs of $53,281.66 (or such other amount the trial court finds
just and reasonable in its exercise of discretion under C.C.P. §2033.420 against
Defendant.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Procedural
History
Petitioner
filed the instant motion on August 12, 2024. 
Respondent filed its opposition on October 10, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
C.C.P.
§2033.420 provides:
(a)   If a party fails to admit the genuineness
of any document or the truth of any matter when requested to do so under this
chapter, and if the party requesting that admission thereafter proves the
genuineness of that document or the truth of that matter, the party
requesting the admission may move the court for an order requiring the party to
whom the request was directed to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making
that proof, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
 
(b)   The court shall make this order unless it
finds any of the following:
(1)  An objection to the request was sustained
or a response to it was waived under Section 2033.290.
(2)  The admission sought was of no substantial
importance.
(3)  The party failing to make the admission had
reasonable ground to believe that that party would prevail on the matter.
(4)  There was other good reason for the failure
to admit.
 
(C.C.P.
§2033.420, emphasis added.)
          An expense award under C.C.P.
§2033.420 is designed to reimburse the reasonable expenses a party incurred in
proving the truth of a requested admission, when the admission sought was of
substantial importance, such that the trial would have been expedited or
shortened if the request had been admitted.  (City of Glendale v. Marcus Cable Assocs.,
LLC (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 344, 353, 359.) 
On a
motion for expenses for failure to admit, the movant must show that the matters
in the Request for Admissions (“RFAs”) were (1) proved, and (2) the specific
expenses incurred in proving those matters.  (See C.C.P. §2033.420(a); In re
Tobacco Cases II (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 779, 807-808; Grace v.
Mansourian (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 523, 529.)  If movant meets his burden, the award is
limited to “reasonable expenses incurred . . . including reasonable attorney’s
fees” in proving matters unreasonably denied.  (C.C.P. §2033.420(a).)
Only
if the moving party meets his burden proving the facts that were denied, and
the amount of attorney’s fees reasonably necessary to prove those facts, does
the burden shift to the nonmovant to demonstrate that a statutory exception to
expenses on failure to admit bars recovery.  (C.C.P. §§2033.420(a), (b); Spahn v
Richards (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 208, 216.)
 
Discussion
Petitioner’s
motion for expenses is denied. 
Petitioner failed to meet his burden to prove the facts that were denied
in the RFAs and to provide evidence of  the fees and costs Petitioner incurred to
prove the specific facts Respondent failed to admit.
“Proof”
is the establishment by evidence of a requisite degree of belief
concerning a fact in the mind of the trier of fact or the court.”  (Wagy v. Brown (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1,
6, citing to Evid. Code §190.)  Petitioner must point to specific evidence that
proves the facts that are the subject of each request for admission for which
expenses are sought.  (See Garcia
v. Hyster Co. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 724, 736-737 [“The statute
authorizes only those expenses ‘incurred in making that proof,’ i.e.,
proving the matters denied by the opposing party.”], emphasis added.)
Here,
Petitioner did not attach to his moving papers any arbitration transcripts,
exhibits, or refer to testimony or documents demonstrating what evidence he
presented at arbitration that proves the genuineness of the facts denied in
the RFAs or the truth of that matter. 
(See generally Decl. of Kar.)
Petitioner
also failed to meet his burden to prove the amount of fees and costs he seeks
to recover as expenses for a failure to admit. 
(In Re Tobacco Cases II, 240 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 807-808; Grace,
240 Cal.App.4th at pg. 529; see also C.C.P. §2033.420(a).)  Here, Petitioner asks for all his fees and
costs based on a contingency agreement. 
(Motion, pg. 11; Decl. of Kar ¶¶8-9.) 
Petitioner fails to provide this Court with an affidavit detailing the
hours, fees, and costs incurred to prove each denied fact.  (Garcia, 28 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 736-737.)
 
Furthermore,
upon considering an award for attorneys’ fees, this Court is within its
discretion to consider whether the attorney seeking the fee has become
personally embroiled and has, therefore, over-litigated the case, and whether
the attorney’s incivility in litigation has affected the litigation costs.  (Karton v. Ari Design & Construction,
Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 738, as modified on denial of reh’g (Mar.
29, 2021).) 
In Karton,
the trial court reduced the requested fee award by 73% where moving party’s
counsel submitted 400 pages of supplemental briefing and exhibits, replete with
attacks on defense counsel accusing him of making “knowingly false claims of
witness tampering,” and “frivolous” comments “typical of the improper tactics
employed by defendants and their counsel.”  (Id. at pg. 741.)  The Karton Court noted “it was really
offensive to me, the attacks made in this case.”  (Id. at pg. 742).
Here,
like in Karton, Petitioner’s counsel submits as exhibits to his motion
30 pages of emails between the parties’ counsel that contain no pertinent
information demonstrating proof at the arbitration of the facts set forth in
the subject RFAs or the fees and costs associated with making that proof.  The attachments are replete with
unprofessional personal attacks upon defense counsel including, but not limited
to, references to: “you and your thugs” (Decl. of Kar ¶14, Exh. 8 at pg. 143 of
194), “[t]he racist ABOTA antiquities Terry Rowland and Bob Armstrong” (Decl.
of Kar ¶14, Exh. 8 at pg. 147 of 194), and “Another racist, callous individual
(such as yourself)” (Decl. of Kar ¶14, Exh. 8 at pg. 147 of 194), and “you are
a pathetic representative of a human being and it is understandable why you
continue to get the same crap cards dealt to you. To your good health, bud.” (Decl.
of Kar ¶14, Exh. 8 at pg. 147 of 194).
These
emails suggest Petitioner’s counsel’s personal embroilment in this litigation and
create the appearance of over-litigation of the case, which should ave
concluded with a simple motion to confirm the arbitration award.
Accordingly,
Petitioner’s motion for expenses is denied.
 
Conclusion
Petitioner’s
motion for expenses is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
