Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge denied Petitioner Jesse Rios' motion for expenses under C.C.P. §2033.420 against Respondent Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. The motion was denied because Petitioner failed to meet his burden to prove the facts that were denied in the Request for Admissions (RFAs) and failed to provide evidence of the fees and costs incurred to prove those facts. Additionally, Petitioner's counsel made unprofessional personal attacks on defense counsel, which suggests over-litigation and personal embroilment in the case. The Judge noted that the Petitioner's motion did not attach evidence of arbitration transcripts, exhibits, or testimony demonstrating what evidence was presented at arbitration to prove the genuineness of the facts denied in the RFAs or the truth of that matter. The Judge also denied the motion because Petitioner failed to provide an affidavit detailing the hours, fees, and costs incurred to prove each denied fact.
