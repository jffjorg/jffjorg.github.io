And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to consolidate the arbitration proceedings with another arbitration proceeding. The defendant argued that the two proceedings share common issues of law and fact, but the judge was not convinced. The judge cited the law that a court "may" order consolidation when certain requirements are met, but noted that a court does not have to order consolidation. The judge also pointed out that the arbitration agreements required that the arbitrations proceed on an "individual basis," which meant that consolidation was not appropriate. Finally, the judge noted that the presence of a statutory stay required by law would disrupt the arbitration proceedings and render them ineffective.
