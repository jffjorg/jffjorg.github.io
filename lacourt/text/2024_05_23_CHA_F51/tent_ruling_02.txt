ANALYSIS
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant moves
pursuant to CCP § 664.6 for an order and judgment enforcing the terms of
the Settlement Agreement entered into by and between
Defendant/Cross-Complainant and Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant. 
 
Here, it is not disputed (a) that the parties entered into the
Settlement Agreement; and that (b) Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant has failed to
comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement including by failing to
provide a proper accounting of his rental account and failing to split the
proceeds of the rental account with Defendant/Cross-Complainant. (Delaplane
Decl. ¶¶ 5, 19, 22; Ex. “A.”) The Court retained jurisdiction in this case to
enforce settlement pursuant to section 664.6 based on paragraph 5.5 of the Settlement
Agreement. Lastly, the Settlement Agreement at paragraph 5.13 provides for the
recovery of attorney fees and costs when any claim, dispute and or litigation
arises out of the Settlement Agreement. 
 
The unopposed motion is granted. Attorney fees and costs
are awarded in the reduced amount of $1,640.00, representing 4 hours at the
reasonable hourly rate of $395, plus $60 filing fee. The reduction is due to
the simplicity of the motion and because no opposition was filed thus no reply.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed motion to enforce
settlement agreement filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant is GRANTED.
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant is ordered to pay Defendant/Cross-Complainant
attorney fees and costs in the amount of $1,640.00 for
enforcing the agreement.
