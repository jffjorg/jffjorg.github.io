(“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: None NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order granting summary adjudication on the fourth cause of action for breach of  contract in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants.   TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is granted.   This is a  collections action in which Plaintiff, a non-profit school, alleges that  Defendant failed to pay $35,070.00 of tuition for his child’s enrollment during  the 2015-2016 school year. On 3/16/20, Plaintiff filed its complaint, alleging  against Defendant and his wife the following causes of action: (1) Goods Sold  & Delivered; (2) Account Stated; (3) Open Book Account; (4) Breach of  Contract; and (5) Unjust Enrichment.    On 1/3/24, Plaintiff  filed the instant motion for summary judgment. No opposition has been filed to  date.    For the reasons stated in Plaintiff’s moving papers,  the Court finds that Plaintiff has met its initial burden of proving each  element of its causes of action against Defendants. As Defendants have failed  to oppose the instant motion, they have equally failed to meet their responsive  burden to show that a triable issue of material fact exists. Accordingly, the  Court grants Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for summary judgment.   CONCLUSION   The unopposed motion is granted. Plaintiff to file proposed  judgment, consistent with this ruling, within 10 days in the amount of  62,977.44, consisting of the principal sum due and prejudgment interest accrued  to date.
