And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion for summary adjudication on the fourth cause of action for breach of contract. The plaintiff, a non-profit school, alleges that the defendant failed to pay $35,070.00 of tuition for his child's enrollment during the 2015-2016 school year. The defendant has failed to oppose the motion, and the court finds that the plaintiff has met its initial burden of proving each element of its causes of action against the defendants. As a result, the court grants the plaintiff's motion and orders the plaintiff to file a proposed judgment in the amount of $62,977.44 within 10 days.
