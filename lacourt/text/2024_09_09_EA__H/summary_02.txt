The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiff, Hua Xia Bank Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou Branch, is seeking recognition and enforcement of a foreign-country money judgment against the Defendant, Wenchen Zhu. The Judge has noted several defects in the Plaintiff's application, including the failure to submit a brief summary of the case, the inconsistency between the demand in the complaint and the prayer for relief, the lack of documentary evidence reflecting the currency conversion rate, and the insufficient declaration of Zhao Xiang. The Judge has also emphasized that the party seeking recognition of a foreign-country judgment has the burden of establishing that the judgment is entitled to recognition under the Uniform Foreign-County Money Judgments Recognition Act. The Plaintiff is directed to submit a new default judgment packet that addresses these defects.
