  Case Number:  23PSCV00653    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiff James
Rutherford’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background
In this lawsuit brought under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Plaintiff James
Rutherford (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff is
disabled and uses a wheelchair for mobility. When he visited Five Guys located
at 1552 S Azusa Ave., City of Industry, CA 91748 (the “Property”), there were
no designated parking spaces available for persons with disabilities that
complied with the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design and/or the 2010 ADA
Standards for Accessible Design. The Property is owned by Defendant 1600 Azusa
SB One, LLC (“Defendant”). 
On March 7,
2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting a cause of action against
Defendant and Does 1-10 for a violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.
On May 4, 2023,
Defendant’s default was entered. An Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is
set for September 9, 2024.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Paragraph 8 of
Plaintiff’s proposed judgment seeks “[i]njunctive relief enjoining Defendant
1600 AZUSA SB ONE LLC, a California limited liability company, from further
violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code section 51 et. Seq., at
the real property which includes the address 1552 S Azusa Ave, City of
Industry, CA 91748, APN 8265-004-045.”
This request is
impermissibly vague and overbroad. Paragraph 8 must be amended to state what
specific “future violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act” Defendant is
enjoined from committing.
Accordingly,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s application without prejudice and directs
Plaintiff to submit a new default judgment packet that addresses the
aforementioned defect.
