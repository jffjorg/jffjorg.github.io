And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on James Rutherford's application for default judgment against 1600 Azusa SB One, LLC. The application is denied without prejudice because the proposed judgment includes language that is impermissibly vague and overbroad. Specifically, paragraph 8 of the proposed judgment seeks to enjoin the defendant from future violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, but does not specify what those violations would be. The court directs the plaintiff to submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses this defect.
