 Case Number:  24PSCV01353    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiff Hua  Xia Bank Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou Branch’s Application for Default Judgment is  DENIED without prejudice.  Background Plaintiff Hua  Xia Bank Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou Branch (“Plaintiff”) previously obtained a foreign  judgment against Defendant Wenchen Zhu (“Zhu”) in the Higher People’s Court of  Henan Province in connection with two separate loans that were guaranteed by  Zhu.    On April 26,  2024, Plaintiff filed a “Complaint for Recognition and Enforcement of  Foreign-County Money Judgment Under Uniform Foreign County Money Judgments  Recognition Act [CCP §§ 1713-1724]” against Zhu. On June 26,  2024, Zhu’s default was entered. Plaintiff now seeks a default judgment against  Zhu. A Case Management Conference is set for September 9, 2024.    Discussion  Plaintiff’s  Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The  following defects are noted:1.  Plaintiff has failed to submit a brief summary of the case  “identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff’s claim,” as per  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(1). 2. Paragraph 2a of the Request for Court Judgment (Judicial  Council Form CIV-100) lists the “[d]emand of complaint” as “$10,904,912.1” The  prayer for relief in Plaintiff’s complaint, however, seeks “a judgment  recognizing the foreign-country judgment” and “enforc[ing]. . . the recognized  Judgment” “in the amount of $10,775,494.63 USD.” (See Complaint, 6:1-3). “The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is  no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint, in the statement  required by Section 425.11, or in the statement provided for by Section  425.115.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 580. Subd. (a).) “[I]n all default judgments the  demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d  822, 824.)3. Plaintiff has failed to provide the Court with any documentary  evidence reflecting the currency conversion rate of Chinese yuan to United  States dollars.4. The declaration of Zhao Xiang does not state that it was made  on personal knowledge. 5. The party seeking recognition of the foreign country judgment  has the burden of establishing that the judgment is entitled to recognition  under the Uniform Foreign-County Money Judgments Recognition Act. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 1715, subd. (c).) Plaintiff has not met this burden. Accordingly,  Plaintiff’s motion for default judgment is denied without prejudice.  Plaintiff is directed to submit a new default  judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned defects.
