The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Summary Adjudication and Summary Judgment filed by the Defendant, PSIP SN Vermont, LLC. The Judge has ruled that the motion will likely be continued to a later date to allow the Plaintiff, Drakk Holdings, LLC, to provide the missing exhibits (Exhibits HH, II, and JJ) that were referenced in the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion. The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiff failed to provide evidence to support its claims and that the Court cannot decide whether the Plaintiff is able to carry its burden of proof without access to the alleged evidence.
