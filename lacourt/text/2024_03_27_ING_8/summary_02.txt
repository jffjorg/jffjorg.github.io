And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between O.R. Barkhordar D.D.S., Inc., Omid Rabi Barkhordar D.D.S., Inc., and O.H. Barkhordar Dental Group, Inc. (collectively, "Plaintiffs") and Cristina Ricalday ("Defendant"). The Plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging causes of action for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, and other claims. The Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike, arguing that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The judge notes that the Plaintiffs' opposition brief exceeded the 15-page maximum allowed by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(d). The judge has given the Plaintiffs an opportunity to re-submit a compliant brief within seven calendar days. If the Plaintiffs decline to do so, the judge will consider the non-compliant brief.

The judge has tentatively continued the hearing to enable the Plaintiffs to file a Code-compliant opposition brief. The Defendant's demurrer and motion to strike are also continued for the same reason.
