And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The Plaintiff, Scarlet Sheppard, has brought claims against the Defendants, Gen Z Studios, LLC and Joseph Lackey, for malicious prosecution and abuse of process. The Defendants have argued that they had probable cause to sue the Plaintiff for breach of contract, but the Judge has found that this argument fails because the evidence relied upon by the Defendants is incompetent and inadmissible. The Judge has also found that the Plaintiff has established triable issues of material fact with regards to the probable cause element of her malicious prosecution claim.

The Judge has denied the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication as to the claims of malicious prosecution and abuse of process. The Judge has also denied the motion as to the remedy of punitive damages. The case will proceed to a hearing on March 29, 2024, where the Judge will issue a final ruling.
