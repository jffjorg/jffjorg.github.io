 Case Number:  23STCV18639    Hearing Date:   March 29, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Defendant Norton Associates, LLC’S Motion To
Compel La Duchesse, LTD’S Person Most Qualified To Appear For And Answer
Questions At Deposition; Defendant Norton Associates, LLC’S Motion To Compel
Plaintiff Stephanie Jarin To Appear For And Answer Questions At Deposition.
In this case, LA DUCHESSE, LTD and STEPHANIE JARIN (“Plaintiffs”)
seek damages against NORTON ASSOCIATES, LLC (“Defendant”) related to alleged
substandard conditions at the commercial property Plaintiffs leased from
Defendant.
Defendant has filed a motion to compel Plaintiffs’
deposition attendance and document production, and requests monetary sanctions,
contending that Defendant met and conferred with Plaintiffs about deposition dates,
but Plaintiffs failed to attend. Plaintiffs oppose the motion and request
monetary sanctions, arguing that informal discovery efforts and meeting and
conferring were insufficient towards arriving at a mutually agreeable
deposition time, given Plaintiff STEPHANIE JARIN’s need to care for an ill
spouse.
A motion lies to compel deposition attendance or
document production, after service of a deposition notice, where a deponent
fails to appear at, or proceed with, a deposition, without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410. Code Civ. Proc., §2025.450, subd. (a). 
No meet and confer is required to compel initial
deposition attendance, but instead there must be a declaration showing that
moving party inquired about the nonappearance. Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (b)(2). “Implicit in the requirement that counsel contact the deponent to
inquire about the nonappearance is a requirement that counsel listen to the
reasons offered and make a good faith attempt to resolve the issue,” including
by rescheduling. Leko v. Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection Serv. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1109, 1124. See also
Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.26 (“guidelines adopted by the Los
Angeles County Bar Association are adopted as civility in litigation
recommendations….”).
The requests to compel documents described in
deposition notices are premature, as the prescribed remedy to move to compel
documents after they were not provided at depositions. “‘If the court
determines that the answer or production sought is subject to discovery, it
shall order that the answer be given or the production be made on the
resumption of the deposition.’" Maldonado v. Sup. Ct. (2002) 94
Cal.App.4th 1390, 1398.
The Court’s independent research turned up no citable
authority regarding deposition scheduling and caring for ill family members. In
an unpublished portion of a published opinion, Serri v. Santa Clara
University (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 830, facts relating to a deponent’s
limited availability due to her husband’s illness were relevant to the question
whether a summary judgment motion should be continued for time to obtain the
deposition. See Labor & Empl. L. P 202169 (C.C.H.) [2014 WL 10910139] (“The
parties thereafter attempted to schedule her deposition for different dates…,
but some of the dates did not work because … her husband had surgery on one of
the dates….”), available at Westlaw.com. However, there are analogous cases
holding that party illness is a strong justification for delays. Serious illnesses of parties generally are
good cause for granting continuances or extensions of dates. Hernandez v.
Sup. Ct. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1247-48. Denying a request for a
continuance after a showing of illness of counsel may be an abuse of
discretion, where it is simply a case of human frailty. Lerma v. County of
Orange (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 709, 718. Denying a continuance request has
been allowed if the evidence has failed to show that illness really was the
need for a continuance. Mahoney v. Southland Mental Health Assocs. Med. Grp.
(1990) 223Cal.App.3d 167, 172.
Here, because the parties have been unable to agree
upon deposition times, the Court will now order the times to resolve the issue,
while taking into consideration care for the ill spouse. 
As for sanctions, because inquiries about deposition
dates are required by law, and illness is involved, the Court finds substantial
justification for positions of both sides, and denies both requests for
sanctions.
Both motions are granted in part (as to compelling
deposition attendance) and denied in part (as to compelling document production
and imposing sanctions).
Commencing at 10:00 a.m. on May 31, 2024, Plaintiff STEPHANIE
JARIN, an individual and the person most qualified for Plaintiff LA DUCHESSE,
LTD, shall attend a deposition at Norton Rose Fulbright, 555 South Flower
Street, Forty-First Floor, Los Angeles, California 90071.
