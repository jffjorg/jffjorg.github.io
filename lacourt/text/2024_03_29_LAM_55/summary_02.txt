And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiffs' deposition attendance and document production. The Defendant claims that the Plaintiffs failed to attend the deposition and requests monetary sanctions. The Plaintiffs argue that they were unable to agree on deposition dates due to the illness of one of the Plaintiff's spouses and requests monetary sanctions. The Court finds that the Defendant made a good faith attempt to resolve the issue by inquiring about the nonappearance and considering the Plaintiff's circumstances. The Court orders the deposition attendance of Plaintiff Stephanie Jarin and grants the Defendant's motion to compel deposition attendance, but denies the motion to compel document production and imposes sanctions.
