 Case Number:  22LBCV01046    Hearing Date:   July 25, 2024    Dept:  S27 On 6/20/24, the parties appeared
for a status conference re: settlement. 
The parties represented that the settlement was contested, and the Court
specially set a hearing for a motion to enforce settlement for 7/25/24.  The Court’s minute order indicated, “Papers
are to be filed per code.”  
 
No party has filed a timely motion
to enforce the settlement.  The Court
will not consider a late-filed motion. 
The Court therefore takes the motion to enforce settlement off calendar.    
 
The Court sets a status conference
re: settlement for August 20, 2024.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.

the party submitting on the tentative.  If
