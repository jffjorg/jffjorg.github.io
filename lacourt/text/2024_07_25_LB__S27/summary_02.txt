And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a settlement dispute between the plaintiff and defendant. Since no party has filed a timely motion to enforce the settlement, the judge will not consider a late-filed motion and has taken the motion off the calendar. Instead, the judge has scheduled a new status conference regarding the settlement for August 20, 2024. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this hearing. Parties who wish to submit on the tentative ruling must email the court by the deadline and include the case number and name of the party submitting. If no party submits on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
