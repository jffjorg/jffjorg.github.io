 Case Number:  22LBUD00487    Hearing Date:   July 25, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, U.S. Bank NA, etc.,
filed this action against Defendant, Yuri I. Lee on 4/22/22.  The complaint is for unlawful detainer.  On 6/13/22, Defendant, using the name Yuri-Imuta:
Lee filed a motion to quash service of the summons and complaint.  On 6/29/22, the Court, Honorable Michael P.
Vicencia presiding, denied the motion. 
On 8/03/22, Defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint.  On 9/07/22, the Court overruled the
demurrer.  On 9/12/22, Defendant filed an
answer to the complaint.  
 
On 11/01/22, Plaintiff filed a
motion for summary judgment on the complaint. 
On 11/18/22, Defendant filed opposition to the motion.  On 11/22/22, the Court, Judge Vicencia presiding,
granted the motion.  
 
The same day, Defendant filed an
appeal.  The appeal was heard by the
appellate division of the Superior Court, which denied the appeal on 11/17/23
and affirmed the original order granting summary judgment.  On 2/08/24, the appellate division issued a
remittitur, indicating the judgment was now final and Plaintiff was to recover
its costs on appeal.
 
2.     Motion
to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment
a.    
Relief Sought
Defendant moves to set aside and
vacate the judgment pursuant to CCP §§473(b), 473.5, and 473(d).  The crux of Defendant’s motion is that she
was erroneously sued and served in this action as Yuri I. Lee, when her name is
Yuri Imuta.  
 
b.     Opposition
Defendant filed proof of service of
the moving papers on Plaintiff’s attorney, Kayo Manson-Tompkins at the correct
address.  Tompkins filed a substitution
of attorney on 6/08/23, and is Plaintiff’s attorney of record in this
case.  Despite being served with the
moving papers, Plaintiff has not filed timely opposition to the motion.  
 
c.     CCP
§473(b) and §473.5
To the extent the motion is filed
per CCP §473(b) or §473.5, it is not procedurally improper.  These sections can be used to attack a
default or default judgment, but Plaintiff obtained judgment after hearing on a
summary judgment motion, not via default or default judgment.  See Las Vegas Land & Development Co., LLC
v. Wilkie Way, LLC (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1086, 1091, holding that
this type of relief is not available after hearing on a contested
judgment.  
 
d.     CCP
§473(d)
Defendant also argues the judgment
against her is void because she was never served with the summons and
complaint.  Her contention is that the
summons and complaint were served on Yuri I. Lee, but she is Yuri Imuta.  
 
The complaint in this action was
filed against Yuri I. Lee.  The judgment,
entered on 11/22/22, is against Yuri I. Lee aka Yuri-Imuta Lee.  Defendant fully adjudicated this issue during
the course of the proceedings, including the appeal, and has made no showing
that she lacked notice of the proceedings against her.  
 
e.     Conclusion
Despite the lack of opposition,
Defendant failed to show she is entitled to the relief sought, and the motion
to vacate the judgment entered against her is denied.
 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice.
