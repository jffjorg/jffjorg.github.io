And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has been holding hearings to settle the case, with the most recent one scheduled for July 2, 2024. However, despite the court's prior tentative ruling, neither the petitioner nor the minor children appeared at the hearing. The court has continued the hearing to July 25, 2024, and ordered the parties to appear. The court is concerned about the petitions filed by the petitioner, which contain incorrect information and do not adequately explain the allocation of settlement proceeds. The court wishes to hear from the petitioner and counsel about the allocation of settlement proceeds at the hearing. The court will grant the applications and issue the proposed orders on the applications if it is satisfied with the testimony received.
