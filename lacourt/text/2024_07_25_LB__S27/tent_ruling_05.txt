 Case Number:  23LBCV00678    Hearing Date:   July 25, 2024    Dept:  S27 The Court has held hearings related
to the settlement of this case on 3/29/24, 5/09/24, 6/04/24, and 7/02/24.  Each time, Petitioner was ordered to file
papers relating to approval of the minors’ settlements.  Petitioner finally did so on 6/20/24.  Prior to the 7/02/24 hearing, the Court
issued a tentative ruling noting several deficiencies in the petitions.  The tentative ruling also noted that
Petitioner and the minor children must appear at the hearing if the Court is to
grant the petitions.  
 
Despite the tentative ruling,
neither Petitioner, the minor plaintiffs, nor their attorney appeared on
7/02/24.  The Court continued the hearing
to 7/25/24 and ordered Plaintiffs, their attorney, and their GAL to appear on
7/25/24.  The Court also scheduled an OSC
re: failure to appear, prosecute, sanctions, and dismissal for 7/25/24.  
 
The Court’s 7/02/24 tentative
ruling was as follows:
Plaintiffs filed this action
against Defendants for damages arising out of an automobile accident.  The parties have agreed to a global
settlement of the entire lawsuit for the total amount of $30,000.  If the settlement is approved, $7500 will be
allocated to each of the two minor plaintiffs, and the remaining $15,000 will
be allocated to their father and GAL.  
 
With respect to Mason’s proposed
settlement, $393.65 would be used for medical expenses, $1766.11 for attorneys’
fees, and $435.53 for costs of suit, leaving $4904.71 to be placed in a blocked
account.  Mason suffered from headaches,
chest pain, nausea, back pain, and shoulder pain as a result of the accident,
but he has completely recovered from all injuries.
 
With respect to Broden’s proposed
settlement, $356.56 would be used for medical expenses, $1762.70 for attorneys’
fees, and $449.18 for costs of suit, leaving $4931.56 to be placed in a blocked
account.  Broden suffered from headaches,
dizziness, tinnitus, nausea, knee pain, and chest pain as a result of the
accident, but he has completely recovered from all injuries.
 
Two Court has two minor concerns
with the petitions, each of which must be addressed at the hearing before the
Court will grant the petitions.  First, ¶11
in each petition appears to include erroneous information.  It indicates Petitioner is not a plaintiff in
the action and would not receive money under the settlement.  Petitioner/GAL, Brian Bundies, however, IS a
plaintiff in the action and would receive $15,000 as a result of the
settlement.  Related, and more
importantly, Attachment 11b(6) requires Petitioner to state the reasons for the
allocation of the settlement proceeds. 
Attachment 11b(6) does not meaningfully do so.  It does not explain why Petitioner, the adult
who will receive immediate access to his funds, is receiving more of the
proceeds of the settlement than the two minors. 
There is no indication that his injuries were more severe or that the
settlement is proportionate to medical expenses, injuries, etc.  The Court wishes to hear from Petitioner and
Counsel about the allocation of settlement proceeds at the hearing.
 
CRC 7.952 requires Petitioner and
the minors to appear at the hearing before the Court grants the petitions.  The minors are 13 and 15, so the Court will
require their appearance at the hearing. 
If the Court is satisfied with the testimony received, it will grant the
applications and issue the proposed orders on the applications.  
 
The Court’s prior tentative ruling
remains its tentative ruling for the scheduled 7/25/24 hearing date.  The Court will hear from Plaintiffs, their
attorney, and their GAL at the time of the hearing.
