And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses in a case involving allegations of sexual abuse at a school. The plaintiff, Jane KR Doe, is seeking production of documents related to the abuse, including prior discipline records and communication between authorities, despite a FERPA objection from the defendant, LBUSD. The judge finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause and compelling need for the documents, but notes that additional meet and confer efforts may not have resolved the parties' issues. The judge orders the defendant to ask the third-party student for permission to produce the requested documents, and if the student refuses, the plaintiff may re-file the motion with proper notice to the student. The judge also notes that the parties must meet and confer to resolve any disputes related to prior settlements or confidential information.
