And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the discovery motions filed by the defendant, Joan M. Attwell. The motions were filed on April 30, 2024, seeking to compel the plaintiffs, Angelica Arreguin-Aguilar and Jose A. Arechiga-Perez, to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiffs had served their responses on April 19, 2024, but the defendant claims that they were not received.

The judge has sustained the objections to the defendant's reply papers, which were filed in support of the motions to compel. The judge has also deemed the responses to be served on June 10, 2024, the same day the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motions.

The judge has ordered the defendant to give notice and has advised the plaintiffs that boilerplate objections are rarely sufficient responses to discovery. The judge has also warned the defendant that if it believes the responses are deficient, it must initiate the meet and confer process and file any motions to compel further responses within 45 days from June 10, 2024.

The judge has not imposed sanctions at this time, finding that the discovery dispute was caused by an unknown breakdown in email communication. The judge has ordered the parties to give notice and has advised them to submit their written opposition to the tentative ruling. If the parties do not submit on the tentative, they are required to appear remotely at the hearing.
