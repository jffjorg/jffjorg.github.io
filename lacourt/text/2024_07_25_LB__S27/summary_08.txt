And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery and depositions. The plaintiff, Eric Cleveland, filed the motion alleging that the defendants, Cancun Properties LLC, Anjai Savire LLC, and Sirenitas Restaurant, Inc., failed to comply with discovery requests. The defendants filed opposition to the motion, but the plaintiff filed a reply and the court heard the motion.

The court granted the motion to compel the depositions of David Yashar and Fernaz Esther Fard, but denied the motion to compel further responses to discovery, stating that each motion needed to be separately filed and filed fees paid. The court continued the hearing and ordered the plaintiff to file three separate motions and pay three separate filing fees.

The court also granted the motions to compel further responses to RFAs, RPDs, and interrogatories, and ordered the defendants to serve further responses without objections within ten days. The court awarded sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $2155, to be paid by the defendants and their attorney of record within twenty days.

The judge noted that the parties have another discovery motion on calendar on 7/25/24 and ordered them to meet and confer in good faith and to file timely substantive opposition to the motion. The court also warned that it will not consider late-filed opposition papers and that the defendants have failed to meet their burden to justify objections to discovery requests.
