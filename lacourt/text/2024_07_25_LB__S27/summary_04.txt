Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, U.S. Bank NA, filed an unlawful detainer action against the defendant, Yuri I. Lee, who is also known as Yuri Imuta Lee. The plaintiff obtained summary judgment against the defendant, which was affirmed on appeal. The defendant now moves to set aside and vacate the judgment, arguing that she was never served with the summons and complaint. However, the court finds that the defendant was served with the summons and complaint, and she fully adjudicated this issue during the course of the proceedings. The court denies the defendant's motion and orders her to give notice. The parties are directed to send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative, and if they do not, they should arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
