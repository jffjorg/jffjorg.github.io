And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories is denied. The defendant failed to submit a separate statement with the motion, as required by California Rules of Court 3.1345(a)(2). The judge notes that the separate statement would have been helpful in this case, and warns both parties that failure to follow the rules can lead to serious consequences, including referral to the Bar. The judge also briefly addresses the issue of the Curry property, which is not at issue in this case, but notes that the defendant's counsel, Mr. Shiri, may have been involved in the Curry matter and warns that any use of confidential information in this case could be an ethical violation. The judge defers the plaintiff's request for sanctions until the Curry matter is clarified.
