 Case Number:  23SMCV04383    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  The court set the FSC on November 27, 2023 at
plaintiff’s request, but noted that this was not very much time and
specifically warned plaintiff about the need to follow the court’s FSC
guidelines.  Later that same day,
plaintiff filed FSC materials including: (1) Special Verdict; (2) Jury
Instructions; (3) Short Statement of the Case; (4) Exhibit List; (5) Witness
List; and (6) Plaintiff’s Trial Brief. 
All documents are compliant, but the court notes that they are all
unilateral, which is not compliant.  The
court will inquire as to what efforts plaintiff made to file timely joint
documents.  If proper efforts were made,
the case would appear to be ready for trial and will go forward only on the FSC
materials plaintiff filed.  But if not,
the trial will need to be vacated.  While
UD cases do move fast, that does not relieve plaintiff from working together
with the defense to file appropriate joint materials.  If plaintiff needed more time to meet and
confer with the defense, counsel should have requested it; it would have been
readily granted. 
It appears that defendant has recently retained
counsel.  If defendant is going to seek a
trial continuance, the court will inquire as to the details and discuss the
matter with all parties.
