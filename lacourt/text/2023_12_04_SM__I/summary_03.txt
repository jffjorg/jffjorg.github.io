And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling discusses the upcoming trial setting conference in Case Number 22SMCV00383. The plaintiff is suing the defendant for unpaid rent, but the defendant claims there were habitability issues and illegal rent increases. The deposition of the plaintiff's witness, Akhtarzad, was problematic, with the plaintiff's counsel acting improperly and the witness's competence being questioned. The defendant's counsel has withdrawn from the case, and the defendant is seeking a continuance due to the need for new counsel and the plaintiff's improper behavior. The court has reviewed the deposition transcript and believes that both sides have acted badly. The court will consider a motion to strike the two newly added DOE defendants and will discuss potential trial dates with the parties. The court also notes that the parties have not properly demanded a jury in the case. Overall, the court has no confidence that the case will be ready for trial in 30-60 days and suggests that the parties reconsider settlement.
