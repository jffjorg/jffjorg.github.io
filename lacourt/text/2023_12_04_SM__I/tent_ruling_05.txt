 Case Number:  23SMCV01496    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  I The matter is here for an early evaluation conference.  Normally, this would go to another department
for the conference.  But the court has
apparently ended that program, and thus it is in this department.  That is odd because the point of the
conference is such that much information might be revealed that one or both
parties might not want the trier of fact to know.  The court will discuss that with
counsel.  If both parties want to go
forward with this court, the court will ask the parties to agree to a stipulation
similar to that used when the trial judge acts as a settlement judge.  If any party is uncomfortable with having
this court act in such a capacity (and the court could certainly understand why
that would be), then the court will see about transferring the conference to
another department at a (hopefully) near date.
The court also notes that plaintiff filed a statement of the
case, but the court has not seen any filing from the defense.  The court notes that plaintiff’s filing does
not reveal anything not gleanable from the complaint and a review of the
law. In light of defendant's filing, the OSC is DISCHARGED.
