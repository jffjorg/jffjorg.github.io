And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering the case for a final status conference. The plaintiff requested the conference and was warned about the need to follow the court's guidelines. The plaintiff filed the required materials, but they are all unilateral, which is not compliant. The court will investigate the plaintiff's efforts to file joint documents. If the plaintiff made proper efforts, the case appears ready for trial and will proceed with the filed materials. However, if not, the trial will need to be vacated. The court also notes that the plaintiff was given sufficient time to work with the defense to file joint materials and should have requested more time if needed. The defendant has recently retained counsel and may seek a trial continuance, which the court will consider.
