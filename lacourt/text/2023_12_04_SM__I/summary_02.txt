And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is concerned about the state of the case, which has reached a final status conference. The parties allegedly agreed to a settlement, but the defendant pulled out at the last minute. The plaintiff filed FSC documents unilaterally, and the defendant has not filed anything. The judge is concerned that the case may not be ready for trial on December 11, 2023, and is considering sanctions if the parties are not prepared. The judge suggests that the parties reconsider the settlement, as it would "cure all." If the case does go to trial, the judge will rule on in limine motions today.
