And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a future court hearing for an early evaluation conference. Due to the court's decision to discontinue the early evaluation conference program, the hearing will take place in this department. The judge intends to discuss the possibility of acting as a settlement judge with counsel and will ask the parties to agree to a stipulation if they wish to proceed. If any party is uncomfortable with the judge acting in this capacity, the judge will consider transferring the conference to another department. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff has filed a statement of the case, but the defendant has not filed a response. As a result, the OSC (order to show cause) is discharged.
