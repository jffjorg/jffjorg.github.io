Summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants in the case of Joelle Samsel vs. Marina Pacifica Homeowners Association, et al.

The court agreed with the defendants and sustained the demurrer, finding that the claim does not meet the elements of trespass set forth in Ralphs Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. The court also denied leave to amend, and reminded the parties of a pending Case Management Conference and OSC re: failure to file proof of service.
