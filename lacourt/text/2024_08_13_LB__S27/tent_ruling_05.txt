 Case Number:  23LBCV01880    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.    
Background Facts
Plaintiffs, David Cain and Red Ball Fun Zone, Inc. filed this action
against Defendants, City of Long Beach, State of California, and Department of
Public Health for damages arising out of Covid-19 closure of Plaintiffs’
business.  Plaintiffs allege Defendants
misclassified their business as a family entertainment center instead of a
fitness center, which resulted in the business remaining closed long after it
should have been reopened.
 
Plaintiffs filed their complaint on 10/03/23.  Plaintiffs filed proof of service of the
summons and complaint on the City on 12/18/23. 
Plaintiffs dismissed the State and the Department of Public Health on
2/05/24.  
 
2.    
Demurrer
a.    
Procedural History of Demurrer
Defendant scheduled a hearing on a
demurrer for 9/26/24.  At a CMC on
3/01/24, the Court advanced the hearing on the demurrer to 5/02/24.  Defendant filed and served its demurrer
papers on 4/18/24; additionally, Defendant served the papers on Plaintiff, in
pro per, but Plaintiff was represented by an attorney at the time of
service.  
 
Prior to the 5/02/24 hearing, the
Court posted a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on the demurrer to
6/04/24.  For reasons that are not clear,
Defendant took its demurrer off calendar prior to the hearing, and then
re-filed it on 4/30/24, setting it for hearing on 7/11/24.  
 
Prior to the 7/11/24 hearing,
Plaintiff filed opposition to the demurrer. 
The opposition consisted solely of the procedural argument that the
demurrer was not timely filed and should be overruled.  The Court, in its tentative ruling, indicated
it wished to rule on the demurrer on its merits, and therefore continued the
hearing on the demurrer to 8/13/24 to permit Plaintiff to file substantive
opposition.  The Court adopted its
tentative ruling as its final order, and the hearing date was continued.  
 
b.     Parties’
Positions
The City demurs to the complaint,
contending it is barred by Plaintiffs’ failure to file a timely government tort
claim.  
 
Plaintiffs, in opposition to the
demurrer, contend the demurrer was filed well past the statutory deadline and
should be summarily overruled. 
Additionally, they contend the request for judicial notice upon which
the demurrer is based is improper. 
Plaintiffs argue that, in the event the Court considers the demurrer on
its merits, the Court should permit them leave to amend to allege facts
excusing compliance with the act.    
 
c.     Analysis

Plaintiffs, in their supplemental
opposition, renew their procedural arguments made in connection with their
original opposition.  As the Court
indicated previously, the Court will rule on the demurrer on its merits.  If the Court were to decline to rule on the
issue on demurrer, Defendant would simply file a motion for judgment on the
pleadings or summary judgment, which would serve only to prolong the litigation
unnecessarily.  The Court will rule on
the demurrer on its merits.
 
d.     Leave
to Amend
Plaintiffs, in their supplemental
opposition, appear to concede they did not file a timely government tort claim,
and seek leave to file an amended complaint alleging justification for their
failure to do so.  Thus, the sole issue
before the Court is whether leave to amend should be granted.  
 
Notably, it is not up to the Court
to figure out how the complaint can be amended to state a cause of action.  Rather, the burden is on the plaintiff to
show in what manner he or she can amend the complaint, and how that amendment
will change the legal effect of the pleading. 
Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349; Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54
Cal.3d 723, 742.
 
Plaintiffs rely on Wood v.
Riverside General Hosp. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1119 and State
v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1232, 1239 footnote 8 to support
their request.
 
In State v. Superior Court, the
issue before the Supreme Court was whether failure to allege either compliance
with the claims presentation requirement or excuse for failure to do so could
be raised by way of demurrer.  The
Supreme Court held that it is an issue properly reached on demurrer.  At footnote 8, the Supreme Court held that
the plaintiff, in the complaint, must allege facts showing compliance or
circumstances excusing compliance.  The
Supreme Court did not, in the opinion, ever discuss what constitutes
circumstances excusing compliance.  The
Court, instead, cited to Wood, supra.
 
The Court, therefore, will turn to
Wood to determine what must be alleged to establish circumstances excusing
compliance with the government tort claims act. 
In Wood, the plaintiff’s complaint was dismissed on summary judgment due
to failure to establish compliance with the tort claim filing requirement.  The plaintiff appealed, arguing he had
submitted a form to the hospital defendant’s quality assurance department, and
had also submitted a supplemental note; he argued these documents were
sufficient.  The trial court disagreed,
and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 
Notably, the Court of Appeals never considered the possibility that
compliance could be “excused,” but instead considered situations where an
attempt to comply with the statute would be construed as “substantial
compliance,” and set forth the test for whether and when substantial compliance
should be found.  Specifically, the test
set forth is as follows:
City of San Jose v. Superior Court
(Lands Unlimited) (1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 456–457, 115 Cal.Rptr. 797, 525 P.2d
701 notes a twofold test for substantial compliance: “to gauge the sufficiency
of a particular claim, two tests shall be applied: Is there some compliance
with all of the statutory requirements; and, if so, is this compliance
sufficient to constitute substantial compliance?”
Wood at 1118.
 
Plaintiffs argue they should be
permitted leave to amend to allege facts showing compliance with the act was
excused in light of the ongoing problems with Covid, the closure of their
business, etc.  Plaintiffs fail to cite
any authority excusing compliance with the Act entirely when there are
circumstances that make compliance difficult. 
Because the burden was on Plaintiffs to show how they would amend if
given leave to do so, and because they failed to meet that burden, leave to
amend is denied.  
 
Defendant is
ordered to give notice.
