And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by the court in the case of David Cain and Red Ball Fun Zone, Inc. (Plaintiffs) against the City of Long Beach, State of California, and Department of Public Health (Defendants) regarding a demurrer filed by the Defendants. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants misclassified their business as a family entertainment center instead of a fitness center, which resulted in the business remaining closed long after it should have been reopened. The Plaintiffs filed their complaint on October 3, 2023, and the Defendants filed a demurrer on April 18, 2024. The court previously continued the hearing on the demurrer to August 13, 2024, to permit the Plaintiffs to file substantive opposition. The court has reviewed the opposition and has concluded that the burden is on the plaintiff to show in what manner he or she can amend the complaint. The court has also noted that the Plaintiffs failed to cite any authority excusing compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act entirely when there are circumstances that make compliance difficult. Therefore, the court has denied the Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend. The hearing on the demurrer will proceed as scheduled on August 13, 2024.
