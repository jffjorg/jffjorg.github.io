And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in a legal case (Case Number: 24LBCV00145) regarding a complaint filed by Joelle Samsel against several defendants, including Marina Pacifica Homeowners Association, Summit Consultants, Inc., and others, alleging nuisance, trespass, and negligence arising from water intrusion into her condominium unit.

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by the defendants, which challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint. Specifically, the judge agrees with the defendants that the claim of trespass fails to meet the elements of trespass set forth in Ralphs Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245, 262. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not opposed the demurrer and therefore denies leave to amend.

The parties are reminded of a Case Management Conference and OSC re: failure to file proof of service on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the demurrer.
