And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Charles G. Gomez, attorney for SEJ Properties, L.P., to be relieved as counsel due to an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Despite the lack of opposition to the motion, the court is concerned about potential prejudice to SEJ Properties, L.P. if the motion is granted, particularly given the proximity to a summary judgment hearing and trial scheduled for August 15, 2024, and September 16, 2024, respectively. The court reminds counsel that attorneys do not have an absolute right to withdraw from representation and must comply with California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3-700 and are subject to discipline for failure to do so. The court denies the motion and orders counsel to appear at the hearing to articulate any grounds for mandatory withdrawal.
