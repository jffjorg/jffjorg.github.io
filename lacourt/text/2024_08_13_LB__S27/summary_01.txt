```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for sanctions against Defense Counsel, who has been sending threatening emails to Plaintiff's attorney. The judge is not inclined to issue the order sought by Plaintiff, as Defense Counsel's threats are protected by the First Amendment. The judge notes that Plaintiff and its attorney have sufficient recourse if Defendants continue to act inappropriately, such as filing a lawsuit, filing an anti-SLAPP motion, demurring to the lawsuit, and suing for abuse of process and/or malicious prosecution. Therefore, the motion for sanctions is denied. The judge orders Plaintiff to give notice.
