 Case Number:  22LBCV00049    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  S27 Charles G. Gomez, attorney for SEJ
Properties, L.P., seeks to be relieved as counsel, contending an irreconcilable
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship has occurred such that further
representation is not possible.  Counsel
confirmed his client’s address by telephone, and filed proof of service of the
moving papers on his client and all parties who have appeared in the
action.  
 
No party has filed opposition to
the motion.  Despite the lack of
opposition, the Court is concerned about prejudice to SEJ in the event the
motion is granted.  There is a summary
judgment motion on calendar on 8/15/24, and trial is scheduled for 9/16/24.  
 
Unlike their clients, attorneys do
not have an absolute right to withdraw from representation at any time with or
without cause. Even where grounds for termination exist, attorneys seeking to
withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in California Rule of
Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3-700 and are subject to discipline for failure to
do so.  Where withdrawal is not
mandatory, an attorney normally must continue representation on the matter
undertaken. The fact the client or matter proves unpleasant or unprofitable
does not excuse attorney performance. The rules have been liberally construed
to protect clients.  See Vann v. Shilleh
(1975) 54 Cal.App.3d 192, 197; Chaleff v. Superior Court (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d
721; Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915. 
 
 An attorney, either with the client's consent
or the court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to the client's interests.  A lawyer violates his or her ethical mandate
by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d 753, 758 759), or
by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing the client’s case. CRPC
3 700(A)(2); Vann, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d at p. 197.  
 
In light of the proximity to the
summary judgment hearing and trial, the motion is denied.  if Counsel believes grounds exist for
mandatory withdrawal, Counsel must appear at the hearing and articulate those
grounds; the Court will permit Counsel to do so in camera if necessary.  
 
Counsel is ordered to give notice.
