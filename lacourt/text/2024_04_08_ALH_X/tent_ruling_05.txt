REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order

BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Christel G.
Franco’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc. breached
an agreement to repurchase a 2023 Kia Sportage, Vehicle Identification Number 5XYK6CAF8PG024689
(“Subject Vehicle”). Plaintiff filed this complaint on May 23, 2023. 
             
TENTATIVE RULING
            
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s person most qualified is
GRANTED.
            
            Plaintiff’s
requests for sanctions are GRANTED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (a), provides: “If, after service
of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to
produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2025.450 subdivision (b) requires that any motion under
subdivision (a) set forth specific facts showing good cause and a meet and
confer declaration or, when a deponent fails to attend the deposition, a
declaration stating the moving party contacted the deponent to inquire about
the nonappearance. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff moves for an order
compelling Defendant to produce its person most qualified for deposition.
Plaintiff provides that she served a notice of deposition on June 22, 2024, for
a deposition date of July 24, 2023. (Sanjur-Van Brande Decl. ¶ 6, Exhibit A.) Plaintiff provides that on
July 31, 2023, her counsel inquired about Defendant’s nonappearance. (Id. ¶
7.) Plaintiff provides that on August 16, 2023, she served an amended notice of
deposition for a deposition date set for September 6, 2023. (Id. ¶ 9,
Exhibit C.) Plaintiff provides that Defendant objected on August 30, 2023. (Id. ¶ 10.)
 
Plaintiff has demonstrates she
served a notice of deposition for Defendant’s person most qualified, but
Defendant failed to produce a witness or appear for the deposition. Plaintiff’s
motion to compel deposition is granted.
 
Plaintiff
also moves for an order compelling Defendant’s person most qualified to testify
as to specific categories of inquiry and produce additional documents. If a
deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
under the deponent's control that is specified in the deposition notice or a
deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an
order compelling that answer or production.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.480, subd.
(a).) However, because no deposition has occurred yet, the court declines to
order specific categories of examination or the production of specific
documents. Additionally, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions are granted
due to Defendants lack of communication with the Plaintiffs that may have helped
resolved these issues. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s person most qualified is
GRANTED.  Defendant is to produce PMQ
within 60 days’ notice of this order or any other date stipulated by the
parties. 
            
            Plaintiff’s
requests for sanctions are GRANTED in the amount of $750. 
 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
