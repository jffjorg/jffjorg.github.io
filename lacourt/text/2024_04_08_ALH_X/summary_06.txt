And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling by Judge Joel L. Lofton concerns a case between Stephanie Johnson and William Pollock (Plaintiffs) and Nancy N. Dala and Elizabeth Munoz (Defendants) regarding an unlawful eviction from a property in Monrovia, CA. The Plaintiffs filed a complaint on November 7, 2023, alleging eight causes of action, including unlawful eviction, discrimination, fraud, and breach of implied warranty of habitability.

The Defendants moved to strike the Plaintiffs' first and eighth causes of action under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, which is an anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) statute. The statute provides a special motion to strike a cause of action against a person arising from any act taken in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech.

The Judge found that the Defendants have met their burden of demonstrating that the Plaintiffs' first and eighth causes of action arise from protected activity, namely the filing of an unlawful detainer action and service of notices. Therefore, the Judge tentatively granted the Defendants' motion to strike the Plaintiffs' first and eighth causes of action.

The Judge also granted the Defendants' request for attorney's fees in the amount of $1,800.
