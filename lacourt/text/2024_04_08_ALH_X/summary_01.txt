And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Judge Joel L. Lofton has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike or tax costs filed by Plaintiff Florence M. Sanchez. The Plaintiff seeks to strike or tax the defendants' memorandum of costs, which totals $12,838.36 for deposition costs. The Plaintiff argues that the costs should be taxed because the defendants failed to provide documentary support for the recovery of the costs and because the costs were not reasonable or necessary.

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's motion to strike or tax costs. The Court found that the defendants' memorandum of costs appear to be proper charges and that the Plaintiff failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that the costs were not reasonably incurred. The Court also noted that the defendants met their initial burden by submitting a memorandum of costs that appear to be proper charges, and that the Plaintiff relied solely on argument contained in her memorandum and failed to submit any evidence to support her claim that the costs are unnecessary or unreasonable.

The Court's decision is based on California law, including Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b), and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700, subdivision (a)(1). The Court cited several cases, including Doe v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019), Foothill-De Anza Community College Dist. v. Emerich (2007), Nelson v. Anderson (1999), and Jones v. Dumrichob (1998).
