The Judge, Joel L. Lofton, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to conduct discovery filed by Plaintiff Jackie Chen. The motion seeks permission to discover the financial condition of Defendants Sunny Hoa and Van Hoan Wong related to Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The Judge grants the motion, finding that Plaintiff has established a substantial probability of prevailing on his claim for punitive damages based on malice. The Judge also denies the motion to all other persons. The case arises from an assault on Plaintiff by the Defendants on August 26, 2020, and Plaintiff is seeking damages, including punitive damages. The Judge's ruling allows Plaintiff to discover the financial condition of the Defendants, but does not address the issue of a protective order.
