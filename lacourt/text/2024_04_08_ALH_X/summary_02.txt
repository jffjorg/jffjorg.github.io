And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion for order of discharge, deposit, and dismissal filed by American Contractors Indemnity Company (ACIC). The court will delay the ruling until ACIC submits the deposit as discussed at the hearing. After ACIC has submitted the deposit, the court will grant ACIC's motion to be discharged from liability, dismissed from the present suit, and restrained from any action related to the bond. The court has ordered ACIC to explain why the deposit total should be $7,500 rather than $15,000 to account for any claims applicable under Business and Professions Code section 7071.5. The court has also noted that ACIC is a mere stakeholder in the action and should be subject to dismissal once it deposits the bond amount.
