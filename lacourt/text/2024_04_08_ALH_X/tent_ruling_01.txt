RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order
striking or taxing Defendants’ memorandum of costs. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Florence M.
Sanchez’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendants Emma Blandina Trejo, M.D. (“Dr.
Trejo”), Sanda Chu Damiani (“Dr. Damiani”), M.D., and the Northeast Community
Clinic (“the Clinic” or “Defendant”) failed to properly evaluate and treat
Plaintiff, resulting in her kidney failure going undetected. 
 
            Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint (“FAC”) on November 7, 2022, alleging three causes of action for (1)
medical negligence, (2) negligent misrepresentation, and (3) risks of
nontreatment. 
             
TENTATIVE RULING
             
Plaintiff’s motion to strike or tax
costs is DENIED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section 1032,
subdivision (b), provides: “Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute,
a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” “A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a
memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment . . .
.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700, subd. (a)(1).) “Any notice of motion to
strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the
cost memorandum.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).)
 
               “If items on a
memorandum of costs appear to be proper charges on their face, those items are
prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services are proper and
necessarily incurred. [citations.] The burden then shifts to the objecting
party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Doe v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 675, 693.) “In
ruling upon a motion to tax costs, the trial court's first determination is
whether the statute expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears
proper on its face. ‘If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show [the
costs] to be unnecessary or unreasonable.’ [citation.] (Foothill-De Anza
Community College Dist. v. Emerich (2007 ) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29.) 
 
            “[T]he mere
filing of a motion to tax costs may be a ‘proper objection’ to an item, the
necessity of which appears doubtful, or which does not appear to be proper on
its face. [citation.] However, ‘[i]f the items appear to be proper charges, the
verified memorandum is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and
services therein listed were necessarily incurred by the defendant [citations],
and the burden of showing that an item is not properly chargeable or is
unreasonable is upon the [objecting party].’ ” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff moves for an order striking, or in the alternative taxing,
Defendants’ memorandum of costs. Plaintiff, however, only addresses Defendants’
sought deposition costs. In their memorandum of costs, Defendants seek
$12,838.36 for deposition costs. In her motion, Plaintiff argues that those
costs should be taxed because Defendants failed to provide documentary support
for recovery of the costs and because the costs were not reasonable or
necessary.
 
“If items on a memorandum of costs
appear to be proper charges on their face, those items are prima facie evidence
that the costs, expenses, and services are proper and necessarily incurred. [Citations.]”
(Doe v. Los Angeles County Dept. of
Children & Family Services, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 693.) 
 
“Initial verification will suffice to establish the reasonable necessity
of the costs claimed. There is no requirement that copies of bills, invoices,
statements, or any other such documents be attached to the memorandum.” (Jones
v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) Further, the Court in Jones
stated that “ ‘mere statements in the points and authorities accompanying its
notice of motion to strike cost bill and the declaration of its counsel are
insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing [that the costs were necessarily
incurred].’ ” (Id. at p. 1266.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to
provide any evidence to demonstrate that Defendant’s memorandum of costs were
not reasonably incurred. Defendants have met their initial burden by submitting
a memorandum of costs that appear to be have proper charges. Plaintiff,
however, relies solely on argument contained in her memorandum and has failed
to submit any evidence to support her claim that the costs are unnecessary or
unreasonable. Thus, Plaintiff’s motion to strike or tax costs is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s motion to strike or tax
costs is DENIED. 
 
            Defendant
to provide notice.
