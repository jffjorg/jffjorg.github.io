And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for leave to file a second amended complaint without prejudice. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Mengdan Sun, who claims to be the victim of fraud related to an EB5 investment scheme and the sale of her real property. The plaintiff's first amended complaint was filed on August 31, 2023, and alleged six causes of action. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324, which governs motions to amend pleadings, by not including a declaration that provides the effect of the amendment, why it is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's motion did not provide a red-lined copy showing all of the proposed changes, as required by the rule.
