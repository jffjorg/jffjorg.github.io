  Case Number:  22PSCV01577    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Velocity Investments, LLC’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant: Julio Regil  TENTATIVE RULING GRANTED. The Court will sign the proposed Judgment.                   BACKGROUND             This  is a collections case. Plaintiff Velocity Investments, LLC (Plaintiff) is a  debt buyer and purchased the underlying debt from the original creditor  WEBBANK. On October 31, 2022, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant  Julio Regil (Defendant) and Does 1 through 10, alleging causes of action for  breach of contract and open book account.  Default  was entered against Defendant on June 13, 2023, and again on October 19, 2023. Doe  Defendants 1 through 10 were dismissed on June 13, 2023. Plaintiff had  previously submitted a default judgment package on June 13, 2023, but it was  denied without prejudice. Plaintiff filed the instant default judgment package  on October 19, 2023.            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)  exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800.)   ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $32,056.19,  including $31,522.69 in damages, $0.00 in interest, $0.00 in attorney fees, and  $533.50 in costs. Because the Court finds Plaintiff has submitted sufficient  evidence, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for entry of default  judgment.  CONCLUSION                   Based on the  foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED. The  Court will sign the proposed Judgment. If Judgment is entered, no appearance is required at hearing.
