And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Defendant Alan Dlugash for judgment on the pleadings of the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Abby Weisman. The defendant argued that the FAC is too ambiguous and uncertain to support the claims against him, but the court disagrees. Although the two "Abby Trusts" on which the claims rest were not attached to the FAC and their precise terms were not set forth, the court has concluded that the FAC is sufficiently certain and clear to support the claims. Since the time of the filing of the motion, the two Abby Trusts have been located, and the plaintiff intends to seek leave to amend the FAC. Absent objection from the defendant or co-defendant John Wolfe, the court intends to grant the plaintiff leave to file a Second Amended Complaint to take into account the discovery of the Abby Trusts.
