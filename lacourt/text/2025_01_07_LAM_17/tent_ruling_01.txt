  vs.
 
MYTH DIVISION,
  LLC, et al.  
 


 Case
  No.:  23STCP02715 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 7, 2025



 
 
            Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
On 7/28/2023, Plaintiff Nicole Rio (Plaintiff) filed suit
against Myth Division, LLC and Ramon Govea (collectively, Defendants). 
 
On 7/25/2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint
(FAC), alleging: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) demand for accounting; (3)
unfair business practices; (4) declaratory relief; and (5) fraud. 
 
            On 8/23/2024, Defendant Ramon Govea
(Defendant) demurred to the FAC’s fifth cause of action for fraud.
 
Discussion  
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff has
not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for fraud. More specifically,
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has added new allegations not contained in her
original Complaint, and that this renders the fifth cause of action defective. 
 
            After review, the Court disagrees. 
 
            “Under the sham pleading doctrine, plaintiffs are
precluded from amending complaints to omit harmful allegations, without
explanation, from previous complaints to avoid attacks raised in demurrers or
motions for summary judgment.” (Deveny v. Entropin, Inc. (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 408, 425.)  Moreover, any inconsistencies with prior pleadings
must be explained; if the pleader fails to do so, the court may disregard the
inconsistent allegations. [Citation.] Accordingly, a court is ‘not bound to
accept as true allegations contrary to factual allegations in former pleading
in the same case.’ [Citation.]” (Larson v. UHS of Rancho Springs, Inc.
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 336, 343; quoting Vallejo Development Co. v. Beck
Development Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 929, 946.)  
 
            Here, Plaintiff’s FAC
alleges that in or around May 2021, in order to
induce Plaintiff to work exclusively for Myth Division, LLC, Govea represented
to Plaintiff that he would pay Plaintiff $10,000.00 per month for her work,
give her an ownership stake in the LLC, and accurately account for royalties.
(FAC ¶ 54.) Plaintiff further alleges that Govea told Plaintiff she should
transfer her film projects to Myth Division, LLC and he would use his resources
and experience to market her films and media projects. Plaintiff also alleges
that Govea made false statements to Plaintiff that Govea, through Myth
Division, would produce, promote, market and release Plaintiff’s films when, in
fact, Govea had no intention of doing so. (Id. at ¶ 55)
 
            While these allegations
were not included in the original Complaint, these allegations are not
inconsistent with, or in contradiction to, any previous allegations. As such,
the Court finds an insufficent basis for applying the sham pleading doctrine. 
 
            “Fraud must be pleaded with specificity rather than with “general
and conclusory allegations.” (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30
Cal.4th 167, 184.) The specificity requirement means a plaintiff must allege
facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations
were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege
the names of the persons who made the representations, their authority to speak
on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and
when the representation was made. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 645.)” (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214
Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff’s allegations set forth the “how, when,
where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made” and thus are
sufficient at the pleadings stage to state a claim.
 
            Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer is
overruled. 
 
It is
so ordered.
