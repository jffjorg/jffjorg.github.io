And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to quash service of summons on Dominguez Marble, LLC. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, Caesarstone, filed a cross-complaint against Dominguez Marble, LLC, which is barred by California Labor Code ยง 3602(b), which prohibits civil actions regarding workplace injuries against employers who secure and maintain workers' compensation insurance coverage. However, the defendant Caesarstone argued that the motion should be denied because it violates CCP section 418.10(b), there was no meet and confer, and workers' compensation exclusivity does not apply. The judge agreed with the defendant's arguments and found that the motion was untimely and that there are triable issues as to whether or not workers' compensation exclusivity applies.
