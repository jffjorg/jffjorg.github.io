And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Ramon Govea to the fifth cause of action for fraud in the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Nicole Rio. The court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations in the FAC are sufficient to state a claim for fraud. The court notes that the allegations must be pleaded with specificity, showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made. The court finds that the allegations in the FAC meet this standard, and therefore the demurrer is overruled.
