And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendants' motion to strike portions of the Plaintiff's Complaint. The Plaintiff, Sasoun Mahgerefte, filed a lawsuit against Refined Home Construction, Inc. and Dan Azran (collectively, the Defendants) alleging negligence, breach of contract, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Defendants moved to strike portions of the Plaintiff's Complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support his prayer for punitive damages. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff has an operative claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which could show that the Defendants engaged in despicable conduct. As a result, the Judge denied the Defendants' motion to strike. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing date.
