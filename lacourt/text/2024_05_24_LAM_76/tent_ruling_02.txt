ANALYSIS
Motion To Compel
Mental Exam 
            Defendant
County of Los Angeles moves to compel a mental examination of Plaintiff.
 
            Civ.
Proc. Code, § 2032.020(a) provides in relevant part:
 
(a) Any party may
obtain discovery, subject to the restrictions set forth in Chapter 5 (commencing
with Section 2019.010), by means of a . . . mental examination of (1) a
party to the action, . . . in any action in which the mental . . . condition .
. . of that party . . .  is in
controversy in the action.

     (Civ.
Proc. Code § 2032.020(a).)
 
            Civ. Proc. Code, §
2032.310 provides:
 
(a) If any
party desires to obtain discovery by . . . a mental examination, the party
shall obtain leave of court.
 
(b) A
motion for an examination under subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner,
conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and
the specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform the
examination. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.
 
(c) Notice
of the motion shall be served on the person to be examined and on all parties
who have appeared in the action.
 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2032.310.)
 
            Civ. Proc. Code, § 2032.320 provides
in pertinent part:
(a)  The court shall grant a motion for a physical or
mental examination under Section 2032.310 only for good cause shown.
. . .
(d)  An order granting a physical or mental examination
shall specify the person or persons who may perform the examination, as well as
the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination.
. . .
(Civ. Proc.
Code, § 2032.320(a) & (d).)
 
Civ. Proc. Code, § 2032.020(c)(1) provides: 
 
“A mental examination conducted under this chapter shall be
performed only by a licensed physician, or by a licensed clinical
psychologist who holds a doctoral degree in psychology and has had at least
five years of postgraduate experience in the diagnosis of emotional and mental
disorders.”  
 
(Code Civ.
Proc, § 2032.020(c)(1)[bold emphasis added].) 
 
            The
motion does not set forth the information required by Civ. Proc. Code, §
2032.310(b). Moreover, the qualifications of Dr. Thames are not set forth such
that the Court can determine that he meets the requirements of Civ. Proc. Code,
§ 2023.020(c)(1).) 
 
            As such,
the motion to compel Plaintiff’s mental examination is DENIED without
prejudice.
