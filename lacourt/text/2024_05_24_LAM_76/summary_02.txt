And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel a mental examination of the plaintiff without prejudice. The defendant had moved to compel a mental examination of the plaintiff, citing the plaintiff's allegations of harassment, retaliation, and termination from employment. However, the court found that the motion did not set forth the required information and did not provide sufficient qualifications to determine if the proposed examiner met the requirements of the Civil Procedure Code.
