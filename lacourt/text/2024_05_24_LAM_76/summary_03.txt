And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Defendants. The Court has also considered the Second Amended Complaint and the pleadings.

**Ruling**

The Court overrules the demurrer to the first cause of action (Unfair Trade Practices) and sustains the demurrer to the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action (Fraud, Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and Unjust Enrichment).

Specifically, the Court finds that:

* The first cause of action (Unfair Trade Practices) is not subject to the economic loss doctrine and may proceed.
* The third cause of action (Fraud) is sustained with leave to amend, as the pleading does not adequately plead the elements of fraud.
* The fourth cause of action (Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing) is sustained with leave to amend, as the pleading does not adequately plead the elements of this cause of action.
* The fifth cause of action (Unjust Enrichment) is sustained with leave to amend, as the pleading does not articulate a reason why the express contract between the parties is void or was rescinded.

The Court denies the motion to strike paragraphs 1-21 of the Second Amended Complaint, as the notice of motion does not quote in full the portions sought to be stricken, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(a).

The Court grants the motion to strike paragraph 4 (prayer for punitive damages) as manifestly contrary to California law, as punitive damages are not available for breach of contract or violation of Business and Professions Code, section 17200. Plaintiff is given 30 days' leave to amend.

**Conclusion**

The Court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on the parties' written objections and the Court's further review.
