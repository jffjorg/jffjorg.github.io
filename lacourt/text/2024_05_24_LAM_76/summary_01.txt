And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel deposition of non-party Richard Marcus. The plaintiff, Abbie Gougerchian, had requested the deposition, which was originally scheduled for April 24, 2023, but Marcus did not appear. The defendant, Patrick Gogerchin, filed an opposition to the deposition and requested sanctions. The court held a hearing and continued the case to permit the plaintiff to submit a separate statement making a fact-specific showing of good cause for each of the 13 categories of documents sought in the deposition subpoena. The court denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions and the defendant's objection on the ground of relevance/discoverability. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The court will address the separate statement submitted by the plaintiff on March 22, 2024.
