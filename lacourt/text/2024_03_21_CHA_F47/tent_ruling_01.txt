SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle collision that
occurred on 1/5/21 involving a vehicle (the Vehicle) driven by Petitioner
Kevork Antablian (Petitioner) and owned by Richard Patterson.  At the time of the incident, the Vehicle was
insured through Respondent State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(State Farm).  The case against the
driver of the other vehicle involved in the collision has settled for the
$15,000 policy limit.  Petitioner seeks
underinsured coverage from State Farm. 
Petitioner has made a demand for the remainder of the underinsured
motorist policy of $250,000.
 
On 2/1/24, Petitioner’s petition to compel arbitration
and appoint a neutral arbitrator was 
granted.  (See 2/1/24
Minute Order).  On 2/6/24, the parties

Kauffman as arbitrator.  (See

pursuant to the stipulation, the Court ordered Andrew Kauffman of Alternative
Resolution Centers as arbitrator.  (See

discovery on Respondent.  Despite
