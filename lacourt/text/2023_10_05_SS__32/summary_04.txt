The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Savanna Stranger's Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendant City of Los Angeles' "Person Most Qualified" without prejudice. The motion is procedurally defective because Plaintiff cannot move the court to compel a deposition until the deponent fails to appear. The Court encourages the parties to meet and confer to avoid further motions or requests for sanctions on this issue.
