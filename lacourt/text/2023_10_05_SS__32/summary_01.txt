And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentatively ruling denies the defendants' motion for a protective order that would prevent third-party recording of the testing portion of the plaintiff's defense mental health examination. The court concludes that the plaintiff has the right to record the entire examination under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.530, and that the defendants' concerns about maintaining testing confidentiality are not sufficient to outweigh the plaintiff's right to discovery. The court orders that the defendants provide notice of its order and file a proof of service, but indicates that it would consider a different protective order that designates certain materials as confidential and limits their use and disclosure.
