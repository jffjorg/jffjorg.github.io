And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Intercommunity Anesthesiology Services, Inc. and Aidan O'Brien M.D. vs. PIH Health Whittier Hospital. The court has sustained IAS's demurrer to PIH's second amended cross-complaint without leave to amend. The court found that PIH's allegations do not state a claim for unjust enrichment or mistaken receipt of funds. The court held that PIH's allegations do not show how IAS was induced into believing there was an implied agreement, and that PIH's allegations do not show that IAS received payment from PIH but PIH did not receive payment from IAS's patients. The court also found that PIH's allegations do not show that IAS was enriched by PIH's payment but PIH was not able to recover payment. The court held that further leave to amend would be futile and that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
