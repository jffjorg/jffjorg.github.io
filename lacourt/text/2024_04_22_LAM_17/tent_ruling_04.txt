 Case Number:  BC696133    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  17 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT 17   TENTATIVE  RULING      GOVIND VAGHASHIA                                       vs.   PRASHANT VAGHASHIA, et al.         Case No.:     BC696133 Related Case Nos.: BC696798 and    BS172969        Hearing Date:  April 22, 2024     The Govind  Parties’ motion to quash is GRANTED.     On 7/3/2018,  Plaintiffs Govind Vaghashia (Govind) as an individual and on behalf of Graphic  Research, Inc. dba Gtek/Bycan Systems filed a second amended complaint (SAC)  against Prashant Vaghashia (Prashant), Graphic Research, Inc. dba Gtek/Bycan  Systems (GRI), alleging: (1) involuntary dissolution; (2) breach of fiduciary  duty; (3) accounting; and (4) violation of Corporations Code sections 1601 and  1602.                On  2/1/2024, Prashant and Mita moved for an order enforcing the compliance of the  Govind Parties with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.               On  3/28/2024, the Govind Parties moved for an order: (1) recalling, quashing, and  vacating the Writ of Execution and Notices of Levy against Govind Vaghashia,  Sonal Vaghashia, Atmaswaroop Investments LLC; Bellflower First Plaza, LLC; Five  Stars Hospitality, LLC; Oak First Plaza, LLC; Sherman Oaks First Plaza, LLC;  and Vaghashia Family Limited Partnership and releasing all liens created as a  result of these writ and levy notices; and/or (2) staying enforcement and  performance of the Writ of Execution and Notices of Levy. The Govind Parties  respectfully requests that the Court at a minimum orders a stay on the  enforcement of the Prashant Parties’ Writ of Execution and Notices of Levy.   Discussion                The  Govind Parties argue the Prashant Parties’ Writ of Execution and Notices of  Levy should be recalled, quashed, and vacated in their entirety with any  execution liens released, on the grounds that they are procedurally and  substantively defective. (See Jones v. World Life Rsch. Inst. (1976) 60  Cal. App. 3d 836, 840) (stating trial courts have the power and duty to vacate  or recall a writ of execution that “has been improvidently issued”)               After  review, the Court agrees.               In  support of their contention that the Writs of Execution and Notices of Levy are  procedurally improper, the Govind Parties argue that “[t]he Prashant Parties’  Writ of Execution states it is based on the Court’s May 8, 2023 order which has  been stayed pending the Govind Parties’ appeal. Therefore, the Prashant  Parties’ Writ of Execution is procedurally defective.” (Motion: 8: 9-11.) In  other words, the Govind Parties contend that Writs are defective because they  state they are based on the Court’s 5/8/2023 Order, and it is undisputed that  enforcement of that Order is stayed pending appeal.   The Prashant  Parties are required under the judgment enforcement statute to specify the  underlying court order by date for its Writ of Execution. “The writ of  execution . . . shall include . . . [t]he date of the entry of the judgment and  of any subsequent renewals and where entered in the records of the court.” (See  CCP Code § 699.520(e).)               In  support, the Govind Parties note that the: (1) The Govind Parties filed a  notice of appeal and sufficient appeal bond for the 5/8/2023 order; and (2) the  May 8, 2023 order did not enter a total judgment of over $10.1 million as the  Prashant Parties claim in the writ.               Indeed,  the May 8, 2023 order only relates to a $5.5 million purported payment; and the  Govind Parties appealed the Court’s May 8, 2023 ruling on June 20, 2023, and  posted a $12.39 million appeal bond by July 17, 2023. See June 20, 2023 Notice  of Appeal; July 17, 2023 Amended Notice of Filing of Bond. The Court also  already ruled that enforcement of the May 8, 2023 order is stayed. (See  December 1, 2023 Minute Order Regarding Motion to Stay at 2.)   In opposition,  the Prashant Parties do not argue that the 5/8/2023 order is stayed, but rather  argue that the Writ of Execution is clearly directed at the order on the $10  million default, issue on 12/1/2023, and for which the Govind Parties have not  provided an undertaking:   The Writ of  Execution is clearly directed to the order on the $10 million default, for  which the Govind Parties have not provided an undertaking. The Writ of  Execution itself points to the December 1 Order twice and sets for the amount  of monies set forth specifically in the December 1 Order. The Writ does  identify the first of the Court’s many payment orders (May 8, 2023) as a  roadmap to the Clerk, given the numerous orders involved, but makes clear  repeatedly that the monies for which the Writ of Execution were sought flow  from the December 1, 2023 Order. Section 699.520(c) contains specific  requirements for the application for a Writ of Execution, all of which were met  with precision. And, the Govind Parties have not provided any undertaking to  stay the enforcement of the December 1 Order.   (Opp to Ex  Parte, 2: 17-25.)   In addition,  Prashant Parties’ counsel submitted detailed accounts of the painstaking  process to get the Writs of Execution, which required review of the different  Orders themselves.    However,  Prashant Parties notably do not dispute that the Writ identifies the May 8,  2023 order as the order being enforced, and while the judgment type is listed  as “other,” this does not indicate that the May 8, 2023 order is not, in fact,  the order being implicated. Moreover, the statements submitted by Ms. Armenta  as to the assertions of the Clerk are not admissible.    Accordingly,  while the Court understands the efforts that went into obtaining the Writs of  Execution, the Prashant Parties have not submitted any legal authority or  admissible evidence to show that its listing of the 5/8/2023 order as the  subject order is legally sufficient.     Accordingly,  the Court agrees the Writs of Execution and Notices of Levy implicated here  should be quashed.   Based on the  foregoing, the Govind Parties’ motion to quash is granted.         It is so ordered.    Dated:  April     , 2024                                                                                                                                                                Hon.
