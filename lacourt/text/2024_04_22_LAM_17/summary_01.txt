And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court denies the plaintiff's motion to modify the umbrella protective order to include her husband, Michael Palmer, in the disclosure of confidential materials. The court finds that good cause does not exist to grant the requested relief. The plaintiff voluntarily agreed to the terms of the protective order, which knowingly precluded Michael Palmer from reviewing confidential materials. The court also notes that Remet Corporation has consistently refused to allow Michael Palmer to review confidential materials, including financial records. The court concludes that the plaintiff's arguments for modifying the protective order are insufficiently supported and that the plaintiff has not persuasively shown that it would be "virtually impossible" for the expert forensic accounting firm to understand and explain Defendants' audited financial statements or Plaintiff's monthly reports without Michael Palmer's assistance.
