And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted the Govind parties' motion to quash the writ of execution and notices of levy. The writ is procedurally defective because it is based on a stayed order, and the Prashant parties have not provided an undertaking to stay the enforcement of the December 1, 2023 order. The court agrees with the Govind parties that the writ is procedurally and substantively defective. The court finds that the Prashant parties have not submitted any legal authority or admissible evidence to show that the listing of the May 8, 2023 order as the subject order is legally sufficient.
