 The initial Complaint in this matter was filed on July 11, 2023.On August 22, 2024, Plaintiffs Steven Souza, Steven A. Souza Insurance Agency, Inc., and SA USA, Inc. filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of contract, and (3)-(5) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.Defendants Farmers Insurance Exchange, Truck Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange, Mid-Century Insurance Co., and Farmers New World Life Insurance Co. now demur to the SAC’s  interference claims for failure to state sufficient facts.  When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.¿(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)The elements of a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage are “(1) an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third party, with the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant's knowledge of the relationship; (3) intentional acts on the part of the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship; (4) actual disruption of the relationship; and (5) economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.”  (Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1153 (internal quotation marks omitted).)  “To establish a claim for interference with prospective economic advantage . . . a plaintiff must plead that the defendant engaged in an independently wrongful act.”  (Id. at p. 1158.)  An “act is independently wrongful if it is unlawful, that is, if it is proscribed by some constitutional, statutory, regulatory, common law, or other determinable standard.”   (Id. at p. 1159.)For the subject causes of action, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants interfered with the prospective economic business between Plaintiff SA USA dba Machine Shop and Manufacturing Safety Association, dba B.A.K.E.R.S Safety Association, and dba Hotel and Motel Safety Association and its members by telling members to withhold membership fees and preventing Plaintiff from terminating memberships. Defendants argue that the subject claims are time-barred.The statute of limitations for the subject claims is two years.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 339(1); Tu-Vu Drive-In Corp. v. Davies (1967) 66 Cal.2d 435, 437.)The SAC indicates that Plaintiff suffered damages for these claims starting sometime in 2019 and continuing for the membership fees for 2020, 2021, and 2022.  As mentioned, the initial Complaint was filed in July 2023. Previously, the Court discussed delayed discovery.  “The discovery rule only delays accrual until the plaintiff has, or should have, inquiry notice of the cause of action. . . . In other words, plaintiffs are required to conduct a reasonable investigation after becoming aware of an injury, and are charged with knowledge of the information that would have been revealed by such an investigation.”  (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 807-808.)  A “plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.”  (Id. at p. 808, internal quotation marks omitted.)  The Court previously stated that it “is alleged that sometime in 2021 is the earliest date it could be discovered that Defendants’ conduct was behind the drop in membership fees.  Plaintiff alleges that in 2021 it sought to end the membership of Kurk Miller and was then informed of Defendants’ conduct.  [ ] This is nearly sufficient; however, Plaintiff cannot merely plead that 2021 was the discovery date; Plaintiff is required to plead a specific month as well.”At the very least, Plaintiff failed to allege additional facts warranting application of the delayed discovery rule. Previously, the Court also stated that “[w]hile delayed discovery has not been pleaded, to the extent that Plaintiff seeks fees for 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, it might be argued that the membership fees for the different years relate to different causes of action.  This issue was not properly briefed or discussed by the parties.”Plaintiff now seeks fees for 2021 and 2022 and argues that “When money is payable in installment or periodic payments, the limitation period begins to run on the cause of action for the recovery of an unpaid installment at the time the installment is payable, if the duty to make a payment is divisible from the duty to pay the full amount of the obligation (Piedmont Capital Management, LLC v. McElfish (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 961, 964-965, 312 Cal. Rptr. 3d 664; see Bank of America v. McLaughlin (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d Supp. 911, 915 [ ].)”  The cited cases relate to the theory of continuous accrual, which does not apparently apply to claims for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.  (See Wolf v. Travolta (C.D. Cal. 2016) 167 F.Supp.3d 1077, 1106 [“To the extent plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the continuous accrual theory applies to this claim, the Court is unaware of any authority applying this equitable doctrine (under California law) to tortious interference claims; indeed, some courts in this circuit have noted the dearth of any such authority. See DC Comics v. Pac. Pictures Corp., 938 F.Supp.2d 941, 949 (C.D.Cal.2013) [ ] (noting that the court was unaware of any cases ‘directly applying either of California's continuing-wrong principles to tortious-interference claims’); Nano–Second Tech. Co. v. Dynaflex Int'l, No. CV 10–9176 RSWL MANX, 2013 WL 1855828, at *3 (C.D.Cal. May 1, 2013) (finding that ‘the theory of continuous accrual does not toll the statute of limitations for tortious interference claims, and should not be invoked in this Action’); Boon Rawd Trading Int'l v. Paleewong Trading Co., Inc., 688 F.Supp.2d 940, 952 (N.D.Cal.2010) (noting that ‘based upon an examination of California decisions that have applied the ‘continuing tort’ doctrine, none have extended the doctrine to the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage’).”].)The Court finds that the statute of limitations bars the subject claims.  The Demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend.  The RJN is granted.Moving party to give notice.
