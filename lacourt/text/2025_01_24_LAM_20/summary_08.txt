And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants in a case alleging breach of contract and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. The defendants argue that the subject claims are time-barred, and the judge agrees, finding that the statute of limitations bars the claims. The judge notes that the plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts to support their claims and did not demonstrate a reasonable possibility of curing the defects through amendment. The judge also rejects the plaintiffs' argument that the delayed discovery rule applies, finding that the plaintiffs failed to plead a specific month for discovery. The judge grants the demurrer and sustains it without leave to amend.
