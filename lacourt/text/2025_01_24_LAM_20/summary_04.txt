And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Default Judgment Application without prejudice, citing the lack of specific damages claimed by the Plaintiff. The Complaint does not mention damages, and a statement of damages was not filed. The Judge cites several cases to support the conclusion that a demand for "damages according to proof" is insufficient and does not provide adequate notice to sustain a default judgment. The Judge gives the Plaintiff two options: either accept the jurisdictional minimum of $25,000 (at the time the case was filed) or amend the Complaint's allegations as to damages, which would be a material change opening the Defendant's default. The Judge requires the Plaintiff to give notice.
