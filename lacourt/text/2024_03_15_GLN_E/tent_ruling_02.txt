RULING MOTION TO COMPEL DEPO
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff,
Maria Galvan, filed a Complaint on 12/19/2022 alleging two causes of action –
(1) Negligence and (2) Premises Liability – against Defendant International
Coffee & Tea Holdings, LLC. 
 
Plaintiff alleges that on
or about April 27, 2021, Plaintiff was a patron at Defendant’s The Coffee Bean
& Tea Leaf store. (Compl. ¶7.) Plaintiff alleges that when she was walking
inside of the store, she slipped and fell in a large puddle of soapy water on
the floor. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that an employee of Defendant
witnessed the incident and took down an incident report. (Id.)
 
On 5/15/2023, Plaintiff
filed an amendment to the Complaint naming Defendant Doe 1 as Abby Membreno.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
“Defendant,
International Coffee & Tea LLC [erroneously sued as “International Coffee
& Tea Holdings LLC”] (“Defendant”), moves for an order compelling the
attendance of Plaintiff, Maria Galvan, at deposition, and for an order granting
the moving party sanctions against Plaintiff, Maria Galvan, and her attorneys,
Glotzer & Leib, LLP. The motion will be made on the grounds that the
Defendant is entitled to take Plaintiff’s deposition pursuant to California
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.010, and pursuant to C.C.P § 2025.450 insofar as

LEGAL STANDARD – MOTION TO COMPEL
DEPOSITION
Under CCP § 2025.450:
(a) If, after
service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director,
managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an
organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.
 
(b) A motion
under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:
(1) The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
(2) The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.
 
(CCP
§2025.450(a)-(b).)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant
and Plaintiff agreed that Plaintiff’s deposition would occur on August 16, 2023.
On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff did not show up to the deposition, and Plaintiff
had not submitted objections to the deposition notice. 
 
Defendant then decided to notice
Plaintiff’s deposition to take place on September 12, 2023. Again, Plaintiff
did not show up to the deposition and Plaintiff did not object to the
deposition notice.
 
The problem with analyzing this motion is
that both parties fail to fully back their arguments with legal authority and
citations to the relevant portions of 2025.450.
 
As to 2025.450, it is apparent that
Defendant satisfied 2025.450(a) because of Plaintiff’s failure to object to and
attend two noticed depositions.
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff does not argue
that this did not occur. In Opposition, Plaintiff simply submitted the
declaration of its counsel. Plaintiff did not submit a formal Opposition. 
 
The Opposition simply argues that this
motion should not be granted, Opposition does not explain how its arguments are
rooted in legal authority. 
 
Plaintiff’s Opposition argues that although
the depositions were noticed, Defendant did not remind Plaintiff’s counsel that
the depositions would proceed. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that it is
standard practice to confirm that the noticed deposition would proceed. 
 
Plaintiff’s Opposition provides no legal
authority to support its argument that Defendant is to provide a reminder
before a noticed deposition proceeds. 
The Court is unaware of any rule requiring such a reminder. 
 
The Court does not find Plaintiff’s
argument availing that Defendant was supposed to provide Plaintiff with a
reminder.
 
As to § 2025.450(b), it is not entirely
clear if both (b)(1) and (b)(2) of § 2025.450 were satisfied. 
 
As to § 2025.450(b)(2), Defendant argues
that it satisfied this requirement because it sent Plaintiff a meet-and-confer
request about Plaintiff failing to attend both depositions. 
 
Further, Defendant’s counsel submitted a
declaration stating that a meet-and-confer request was sent. In Opposition, Plaintiff
does not argue that this element was not met.
 
In Opposition, without citing legal
authority, Plaintiff argues that this motion should not be granted because in
early March of 2024 it reached out to Defendant on two occasions and did not
receive a response as to Plaintiff’s suggestions of dates for Plaintiff’s
deposition. 
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff’s attempt
to contact Defense counsel in March 2024 about scheduling the deposition did
not occur until several months after both Defendant’s meet-and-confer letter of
October 23, 2023 and Defendant’s filing of this motion on 11/2/2023.
 
Therefore, it appears as if § 2025.450(b)(2)
was satisfied. 
 
However, as to § 2025.450(b)(1), this
requires that the motion “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” Here, both
of Defendant’s deposition notices request the appearance of Plaintiff and the
production of several records. Defendant’s motion does not address the good-cause
requirement with respect to the document requests in each deposition notice. However,
although Movant did not address the good cause requirement, Opposition also did
not argue that the good cause requirement was not met, as the Opposition was
not rooted in legal authority. The Court will hear argument as to § 2025.450(b)(1).
 
SANCTIONS
 “If a motion
under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who
noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2025.450(g)(1).)
Defendant argues for sanctions in the amount of $1,250.00.
The notice of this motion does not indicate what amount  sanctions are being requested by Defendant; the
notice simply states that Defendant is moving for sanctions to be imposed
against Plaintiff and her attorneys of record.
Further, Defendant’s counsel’s declaration does not
attest to the amount requested. Instead, it is Defendant’s motion that explains
the sanctions request as follows: 
As a result of this
failure by Plaintiff to appear for deposition, Defendant has incurred expenses
as follows: $150.00 for in person appearance by court reporter on August 16,
2023, $400.00 for Certificate of Non-Appearance by court reporter on August 16,
2023, $300.00 for in person appearance by court reporter on September 12, 2023,
and $400.00 for Certificate of Non-Appearance by court reporter on September
12, 2023, for a total of $1,250.00.
(Def.
Mot. p. 4.)
In
Opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel argues:
I have been practicing
Plaintiff’s personal injury litigation for over 25 years and this Defense firm
is the first firm I have encountered who failed to confirm a deposition the
week or days prior to the deposition to make sure Plaintiff would be appearing.
Without confirming the deposition, the over inflated court reporter fees which
Defense is seeking as sanctions could have easily been avoided with an email or
phone call from Defense and Plaintiff requests that no sanctions be awarded. I
have requested that Defense take the instant motion off-calendar given
Plaintiff’s amenability to appear for deposition. As of the date of this
deposition, Defense still has at this time failed to provide any available
dates to take Plaintiff’s deposition in March or April nor has Defense provide
any available dates to take their employees PMK depo as of the time of this
declaration.
(Decl.
Glotzer, ¶8.)
Given the nature of this contretemps about deposition
scheduling, the Court’s inclination is not to award sanctions, but the Court
will hear argument.
