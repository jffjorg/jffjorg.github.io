Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication as to the entire FAC and all causes of action. The defendant failed to meet its initial burden to show that the plaintiff's FAC has no merit. The judge notes that the defendant's separate statement does not comply with the requirements of the California Rules of Court, and therefore, the motion must be denied. The judge also grants the defendant's request for judicial notice.
