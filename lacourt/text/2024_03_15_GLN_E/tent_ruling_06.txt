LEGAL
STANDARD - COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is
itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.”  The
Section specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,”
and that discovery “may be obtained of the identity and location of persons
having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence,
description, nature, custody, condition and location of any document,
electronically stored information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”
On receipt of a
response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply:
(1)   An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete.
(2)   An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3)   An objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.
(CCP § 2030.300(a).
If a timely motion to compel has been filed,
the¿burden is on the responding party¿to justify any objection or failure fully
to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58
Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22
Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
“While the party propounding interrogatories may have
the burden of filing a motion to compel if it finds the answers it receives
unsatisfactory, the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond
remains at all times with the party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Furthermore, to the extent there is any doubt in
whether these records should be discoverable, California’s liberal approach to
discovery provides that doubt should be resolved in favor of permitting
discovery. (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2
Cal.3d 161, 173.)
The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of
the following:
(1) An answer
containing the information sought to be discovered.
(2) An exercise of
the party’s option to produce writings.
(3) An objection to
the particular interrogatory.
 
(CCP § 2030.210(a).)
PROCEDURAL
ANALYSIS
45-Day
Requirement
“Unless notice of this motion is given within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.” (CCP
§2030.300(c).)
Plaintiffs argue that this motion had to be filed on
January 22, 2024 and that since it was filed by January 22, 2024, it is thus
timely. Defendant does not argue that the instant motion is untimely.
Therefore, the Court finds this motion timely.
Meet and Confer
“A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP § 2030.300(b)(1).)
Here, Plaintiffs’ counsel alleged he met and
conferred. (Powell Decl. ¶5, Ex. C.) Opposition argues that Plaintiffs’ counsel
prematurely abandoned the meet and confer process, but the Court does not find
this argument availing.
TENTATIVE RULING
The
instant motion was filed by Plaintiffs on 1/22/2024. Defendant provided
supplemental responses to the instant SROGs, 45-48, on February 20, 2024,
and  verifications to its supplemental
responses on February 23, 2024. Since Defendant provided supplemental responses
to the instant requests, Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further responses to Plaintiffs’
First Set of Special Interrogatories, numbers 45-48, is DENIED as moot with
respect to compelling further responses. However, this motion is not denied as
moot as to the issue of sanctions since Defendant provided the supplemental
responses after the filing of the instant motion.
Sanctions
Plaintiffs request an award of monetary sanctions
against FCA and its counsel of record, Ongaro PC in the amount of $2,610.00. 
Plaintiffs’ notice page cited to 2030.300(e) as a
basis for sanctions; however, this is not the proper section to request
sections as subsection (e) pertains to when a party fails to obey an order
compelling further responses. Here, there has yet to be an order compelling
further responses. 
Plaintiffs’ memorandum requests sanctions under
2031.310(h); however, this is also not the correct section because it pertains
to inspection demands and not interrogatories.
Plaintiffs’ notice page also cited to § 2023.030(g) as
a basis for requesting sanctions; however, the Court does not see a subsection
(g) in § 2023.030.
The code section that Plaintiffs should have requested
sanctions under is § 2030.300(d).
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2030.300(d).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).)
Plaintiffs’
counsel requests sanctions as follows:
 
9. As a result of
Defendant’s failure to provide Code-compliant responses and the time and effort
it took Plaintiffs to meet and confer, Plaintiffs respectfully request that
this Court award monetary sanctions for the costs associated with Plaintiffs’
preparation of this motion. The total legal fees incurred of preparing the
motion and supportive papers will be as follows: 
a. I spent two
(2.0) hours drafting the instant motion, separate statement, proposed order,
notice of motion, and declaration, at my normal billing rate of $425.00 per
hour, for a total of $850.00. 
b. It is also
reasonably anticipated that I will spend an additional two hours reviewing
Defendant’s opposition and drafting a reply at my normal billing rate of
$425.00 per hour, for a total of $850.00. 
c. Finally, it is
reasonably anticipated I will spend an additional two hours preparing for and
attending the scheduled hearing on this matter at my normal billing rate of
$425.00, for a total of $850.00 
d. In all, legal
fees will total $2,550.00. 
 
10. Our office
will be forced to spend $60.00 in filing the instant motion.
 
(Powell Decl.
¶¶9-10.)
 
In Opposition, Defendant argues against sanctions on
the basis that the court has discretion to not impose sanctions. Defendant
argues that sanctions are inappropriate because Defendant provided supplemental
responses rendering this motion moot.
In Reply, Plaintiffs continue to cite to the incorrect
code section of § 2031.310(h) as a basis for sanctions. Plaintiffs argue that
sanctions are warranted because Defendant’s objections lacked merit.
The Court will hear argument as to sanctions. The
Court is likely to grant sanctions based on Defendant sending supplemental
responses after the filing of this motion.
