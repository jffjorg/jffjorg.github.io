Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant to compel the plaintiff's deposition and impose sanctions. The plaintiff failed to attend two noticed depositions, and the defendant is seeking to compel the deposition and impose sanctions in the amount of $1,250.00. The judge notes that the defendant satisfied the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(a), but the plaintiff's opposition lacks legal authority to support its arguments. The judge is inclined not to award sanctions, but will hear argument on the issue. The judge also notes that the good-cause requirement under § 2025.450(b)(1) is not entirely clear and will hear argument on this issue.
