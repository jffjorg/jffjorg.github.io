English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by JBBBS, a defendant, to the fifth cause of action in the Plaintiff's FAC, which alleges Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention. JBBBS argues that the amended allegations in the FAC do not cure the defects from the previous ruling on the demurrer to the original Complaint. The judge disagrees, finding that the Plaintiff failed to allege that JBBBS knew or should have known that hiring John Doe created a particular risk or hazard, and that particular harm materialized. The judge sustains JBBBS's demurrer with leave to amend granted, giving the Plaintiff 20 days to file and serve a second amended complaint.
