And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of HAIRUN INVESTMENT, INC. and YUKE HOU versus YI WANG, LEI ZHANG, and HEDI WANG. The defendant, YI WANG, has moved the court to compel responses to interrogatories served on the plaintiff, HAIRUN INVESTMENT, INC. and YUKE HOU, on November 13, 2023. The interrogatories were served with a request to waive objections, and the plaintiff did not serve timely responses.

The Judge notes that the plaintiff has not provided timely responses in accordance with CCP § 2030.260(a), and typically the Court would be inclined to grant the defendant's motion to compel responses without objection. However, the Judge notes that there are potential notice problems with the motion, including issues with the caption and the declaration of Bruce Fields, which requests sanctions against HAIRUN INVESTMENT, INC. rather than YUKE HOU.

The Judge will hear argument as to the potential notice problems and will also hear argument about service since there is no opposition. Additionally, the Judge will consider the request for sanctions against HAIRUN INVESTMENT, INC. in the sum of $1,285.00.
