Case Name: ALEJANDRO REYES, an individual, v. LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN
TRANSPORATION AUTHORITY; Bus Driver Henry C. Alvarez an individual; and INTEGON
NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY, a corporation
[TENTATIVE
RULING– MOTION TO SET ASIDE/VACATE DISMISSAL]
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff
filed an initial complaint on 4/4/2023 naming three Defendants – Los Angeles
Country Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Henry C. Alvarez, and Integon
National Insurance Company, a corporation.
 
On 8/15/2023, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to
File Proof of Service was called for hearing and no appearances were made by,
or for, either party. Proof of service had not been filed, so the Court
indicated the following:
 
On the Court's own motion, the Order to
Show Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service scheduled for 08/15/2023 is
continued to 10/16/2023 at 08:30 AM in Department E at Glendale Courthouse.
 
Order to Show Cause Re: Sanctions of up to
$250.00 Against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's Attorney and/or Dismissal of the
Entire Action for Plaintiff's Failure to Appear on 8/15/2023 is scheduled for
10/16/2023 at 08:30 AM in Department E at Glendale Courthouse.
 
(Min. Order 8/15/2023, p.1.)
 
On 10/10/2023, before the Order to Show
Cause scheduled for 10/16/2023, Plaintiff filed an FAC. The FAC listed Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Bus Driver Henry C.
Alvarez; and Integon National Insurance Company, a corporation as the three
defendants.
 
On 10/16/2023, the Case Management
Conference, Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service, and the
Order to Show Cause Re: Sanctions of up to $250.00 Against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s Attorney and/or Dismissal of the Entire Action for Plaintiff’s
Failure to Appear on 8/15/2023, were not called for hearing. 
 
Further, on 10/16/2023, the Court ordered
the FAC filed by Alejandro Reyes on 10/10/2023 dismissed without prejudice.
Further, on 10/16/2023, the Court filed a Notice of Entry of Dismissal of the
matter.

 
The
instant motion pertains to Plaintiff seeking to vacate the dismissal entered in
this case.
RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
Plaintiff,
Alejandro Reyes, moves this Court for an order to set aside/vacate the
dismissal of this matter entered on October 16, 2023.
 
This
motion is made on the following grounds:
 
1.      On October 16, 2023,
Plaintiff’s counsel Mr. Petale failed to appear at the Case Management
Conference, due to the fact that he was engaged in a Trial, in the matter of Polk
v. City of Long Beach, LASC Case No. BC717702.


2.      On October 16,
2023, Plaintiff’s counsel Mr. Petale failed to appear at the Case Management
Conference, due to his erroneous belief that this matter had been scheduled for
a Status Conference in this Department on October 26, 2023.


3.      Plaintiff’s counsel
timely seeks relief, pursuant to the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure
§473(b) and seeks discretionary and mandatory relief, based on his Declaration
of Fault, attached hereto. 
 
This
Motion shall be based upon this Notice of Motion, on the Memorandum of Points
and Authorities attached herewith, on the Declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel,
Alexander J. Petale, Esq., on the pleadings, records and files of this matter
and on such oral and documentary evidence as may be presented at the hearing on
this Motion.

16/21 Day Lapse (CCP §12c and §1005(b):
Ok
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, Rule 3.1300): Ok
Correct Address (CCP §1013, §1013a): No– Plaintiff filed an initial
complaint on 4/4/2023 and an amended complaint (FAC) on 10/10/2023. Both the
initial complaint and the FAC listed three defendants. The initial complaint
listed Los Angeles Country Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Henry C.
Alvarez, and Integon National Insurance Company, a corporation as the three
defendants. The FAC listed Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, Bus Driver Henry C. Alvarez; and Integon National Insurance Company,
a corporation as the three defendants. The instant motion to vacate the dismissal
of Plaintiff’s action was served by mail to two mailing addresses. One mailing
address is allegedly the mailing address for Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (Metro), the other mailing address is allegedly for
Integon National Insurance Company (Integon). The Court notes the following two
issues as to why it cannot tell if this motion was properly served. First, none
of the three Defendants have addresses listed on eCourt for their counsel, nor
do they have addresses listed for themselves, for the Court to cross reference
the proof of service and the addresses on file with eCourt. Second, if the
Court assumes the two addresses listed on the proof of service for this motion are
the proper mailing addresses for Metro and Integon, this motion still was not
served on Defendant Henry C. Alvarez (as named in the original complaint) nor Bus
Driver Henry C. Alvarez (as named in the FAC). 
At the hearing, Plaintiff is to address how the Court
would be able to know if this motion was served to the proper mailing addresses
of the two Defendants listed in the proof of service. Presumably, this motion
was served to Defendant Metro since Metro submitted an Opposition. However,
Defendant Integon did not submit an Opposition, so it is possible that the
address for Integon on Plaintiff’s proof of service is incorrect and that Integon
did not receive this motion. Further, Plaintiff is to address why Defendant
Henry C. Alvarez was not served this motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD – MOTION TO VACATE/SET
ASIDE DEFAULT/DISMISSAL
CCP
§473(b) states as follows:
The court may,
upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken. However, in the case of a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding determining the ownership or right to possession of real or
personal property, without extending the six-month period, when a notice in
writing is personally served within the State of California both upon the party
against whom the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding has been
taken, and upon his or her attorney of record, if any, notifying that party and
his or her attorney of record, if any, that the order, judgment, dismissal, or
other proceeding was taken against him or her and that any rights the party has
to apply for relief under the provisions of Section 473 of the Code of Civil
Procedure shall expire 90 days after service of the notice, then the
application shall be made within 90 days after service of the notice upon the
defaulting party or his or her attorney of record, if any, whichever service
shall be later. No affidavit or declaration of merits shall be required of the
moving party. Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the court
shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after
entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,
vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting
default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The court shall,
whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing
counsel or parties. However, this section shall not lengthen the time within
which an action shall be brought to trial pursuant to Section 583.310.
 
(CCP §473(b).)
 
Carmel, LTD. v. Tavoussi sheds further
light on CCP §473(b):
 
Section 473,
subdivision (b), authorizes the trial court to relieve a party from a default
judgment entered because of the party's or his or her attorney's mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The section provides for both mandatory and
discretionary relief. Mandatory relief is available “whenever an application
for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in
proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to
his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect ....” (§ 473, subd.
(b).) “[I]f the prerequisites for the application of the mandatory provision
of section 473, subdivision (b) exist, the trial court does not have
discretion to refuse relief.” (Leader v. Health Industries of America,
Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 612, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d
489 (Leader ).) Thus, to the extent that the applicability of
the mandatory relief provision does not turn on disputed facts, but rather,
presents a pure question of law, it is subject to de novo review. (Ibid.) Where
the facts are in dispute as to whether or not the prerequisites of the
mandatory relief provision of section 473, subdivision (b), have been met,
we review the record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the
trial court's findings. (See Howard v. Owens Corning (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 621, 631, 85 Cal.Rptr.2d 386 [findings of fact
reviewed for sufficiency].) Evidence is substantial when it is of “ ‘
“ponderable legal significance,” ’ ” reasonable, credible, and of solid value. (Ibid.)
 
“The ‘attorney
fault’ language was added to section 473 in 1988. Prior to that time,
a litigant who suffered a default or default judgment due to inexcusable
attorney error could only obtain relief if he or she could persuade the
court that counsel's behavior amounted to ‘total abandonment’ of the client;
otherwise attorney conduct that was ‘simply inexcusable’ fell between the two
poles and provided no basis for relief. [Citation.] The amendments were clearly
designed to fill this gap. The purpose was threefold: to relieve the innocent
client of the consequences of the attorney's fault; to place the burden on
counsel; and to discourage additional litigation in the form of malpractice
actions by the defaulted client against the errant attorney.” (Solv–All
v. Superior Court (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1003, 1009, 32
Cal.Rptr.3d 202 (Solv–All ).) But the mandatory provision
of section 473, subdivision (b), “protects only the innocent client [and]
provides no relief for the culpable client who participates in conduct which
led to the default....” (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1251–1252, 92 Cal.Rptr.2d 322 (Lang ).) If the trial court
finds that the moving party's misconduct was a contributing cause of the
default, that party “cannot rely on the mandatory relief provision
of section 473.” (Lang, at p. 1252, 92 Cal.Rptr.2d 322.)
 
(Carmel, Ltd.
v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 399-400.)
 
ANALYSIS
Mandatory Relief
Plaintiff
moves for relief both under the discretionary and mandatory relief portions of §
473(b).). The Court will first analyze this motion under the mandatory relief
portion.
“[T]he superior court is only required to grant a
motion for relief under the mandatory relief provision of section 473(b) if the
three conditions are met: (1) the motion is timely filed, (2) is in ‘in proper
form,’ and (3) is accompanied by an attorney affidavit attesting to, and
showing that the challenged order was taken due to, attorney fault. (Jiminez
v. Chavez (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 50, 63 citing Dollase v. Wanu Water,
Inc. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1315, 1322-1323.)
“The range of attorney conduct for which relief can be
granted in the mandatory provision is broader than that in the discretionary
provision, and includes inexcusable neglect. But the range of adverse
litigation results from which relief can be granted is narrower. Mandatory
relief only extends to vacating a default which will result in
the entry of a default judgment, a default judgment, or an entered dismissal.”
(Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603,
616.)
Here, the Court entered dismissal against Plaintiff on
10/16/2023. Therefore, mandatory relief can be granted if Plaintiff met the
three conditions under the mandatory relief provision of § 473(b).
(1) The Motion is Timely Filed
“Notwithstanding
any other requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an
application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment…”
(CCP § 473(b).) “We conclude that the six-month limitations periods of the
mandatory and the discretionary relief provisions of section
473(b) mean the longer of six calendar months or 182 days.” (Jiminez v.
Chavez (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 50, 58 citing Gonzales v. County of
Los Angeles (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 601.)
The Opposition does not argue that this motion is
untimely. 
The Court finds this motion timely. Dismissal was
entered on 10/16/2023, and Plaintiff filed the instant motion on 11/06/2023.
Further, setting aside the service issues that the Court previously mentioned
as to whether this motion was properly served on all Defendants, the instant
motion’s proof of service indicates service on 11/04/2023.
(3) Accompanied By an Attorney Affidavit
of Fault 
“[A]nd
is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default
entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry
of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered
against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal
was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect.” (CCP §473(b).)
Attached to Plaintiff’s motion is the declaration of
Alexander J. Petale, counsel for Plaintiff.
In relevant part, Petale explains that he missed the
first Order to Show Cause re: Failure to File Proof of Service scheduled for
8/15/2023 because he negligently failed to properly note the O.S.C. in his
calendar. (Decl. Petale ¶2.) 
Petale then explains that after the 8/15/2023 O.S.C.
was re-set for 10/16/2023, he reviewed the pleadings and filed the FAC on
10/10/2023 before the O.S.C. was scheduled to be heard on 10/16/2023. (Decl.
Petale ¶3.) As to why Petale was not present at the 10/16/2023 O.S.C., Petale
explains that during the week of October 9, 2023 he was in trial in Long Beach
and failed to note that this Court had set the hearing date for 10/16/2023.
(Decl. Petale ¶3.) 
Further, Petale states that on the morning of
10/16/2023 he was at the courthouse in Long Beach for the jury’s deliberations
and was erroneously under the belief that the O.S.C. was set for 10/26/2023
instead of 10/16/2023. (Decl. Petale ¶4.)
In Opposition, Metro argues that Plaintiff’s motion
failed to establish excusable mistake/neglect. Metro argues that Plaintiff does
not explain why Metro was not served with the original summons and complaint. 
Metro also points out that Plaintiff attempted to
serve Metro with the summons and complaint on November 15, 2023 [presumably
Metro meant the FAC since the FAC had already been filed by 11/15/2023], but
since the matter was dismissed on 10/16/2023 service was not effectuated. 
Metro also cites CCP § 583.210(b) and states that in
this case no proof of service was filed by 
Plaintiff. Lastly, Metro argues that Plaintiff’s
motion does not explain why Plaintiff’s counsel did not attempt to litigate
this case at all before the dismissal was entered on 10/16/2023.
No Reply was submitted as of 3/12/2024.
The Court does not find Opposition’s arguments
availing for several reasons.
First, Metro argues that Plaintiff’s motion failed to
establish excusable mistake/neglect. This argument is not availing because
Plaintiff does not have to establish that the mistake/neglect was excusable. “By
its terms, the mandatory provision applies when dismissal is caused by an
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect – whether or not
excusable.” (Hernandez v. FCA US LLC (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 329, 336
citing Jackson v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Inc. (2019) 32
Cal.App.5th 166, 174.)
Second, Metro’s argument that Plaintiff does not
explain why Metro was not served with the original summons and complaint and
that Plaintiff’s counsel did not attempt to litigate the case at all before the
dismissal was entered on 10/16/2023 is unavailing. 
Under § 473(b), the application for relief must be “accompanied
by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect…” Both Petale’s motion and declaration admits his own negligence
in failing to properly calendar the 8/15/2023 O.S.C and erroneously believing the
10/16/2023 O.S.C. was on calendar for 10/26/2023. While Metro notes that Plaintiff
does not explain why Metro was not served with the original summons and
complaint, this can presumably be explained by the fact that Plaintiff
determined that an FAC needed to be filed, as indicated in the filing of the
FAC on 10/10/2023, which was before the O.S.C. scheduled for 10/16/2023.  
“But the mandatory
provision of section 473, subdivision (b), “protects only the innocent
client [and] provides no relief for the culpable client who participates in
conduct which led to the default....” (Lang v. Hochman (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1251–1252, 92 Cal.Rptr.2d 322 (Lang ).)
If the trial court finds that the moving party's misconduct was a contributing
cause of the default, that party “cannot rely on the mandatory relief provision
of section 473.” (Lang, at p. 1252, 92 Cal.Rptr.2d 322.)”
(Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 399-400.)
 
Here, Opposition
does not argue that Petale’s client was culpable in any fashion, and as
indicated in the Petale declaration, Petale admits his own negligence in
failing to properly calendar the two O.S.C.s on both occasions. Nothing in
Petale’s declaration, nor the Opposition, indicates that the client was
culpable.
 
Thus, Plaintiff
satisfied the element that requires an attorney affidavit of fault.
 
Third, Metro’s
argument with respect to CCP § 583.210(b) is equally unavailing. CCP § 583.210(b)
states, “Proof of service of the summons shall be filed within 60 days after
the time the summons and complaint must be served upon a defendant.” (CCP § 583.210(b).)
After Metro cites 583.210(b), Metro argues that no proof of service of the
summons and complaint was filed by Plaintiff.
 
This argument is
unavailing because Metro cites § 583.210(b) out of context by failing to first
cite to § 583.210(a). CCP § 583.210(a) states, “The summons and complaint shall
be served upon a defendant within three years after the action is commenced
against the defendant. For the purpose of this subdivision, an action is
commenced at the time the complaint is filed.”
 
Therefore,
although Plaintiff did not file a proof of service of the summons and
complaint, Plaintiff had within 60 days after the time the summons and
complaint must be served upon a defendant. As indicated by § 583.210(a), which
Metro failed to cite, the summons and complaint must be served within three
years after the action is commenced. Here, nowhere close to three years has
commenced since the commencement of this action began on 4/4/2023.
 
(2) Application is
in Proper Form
“The
Legislature intended the phrase ‘in proper form’ to encompass the mandate that
the application for relief under section 473, subdivision (b) be accompanied by
the pleading proposed to be filed therein.” (Hernandez v. FCA US LLC (2020)
50 Cal.App.5th 329, 336-37 citing Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 393, 401.)
 
“[S]ubstantial compliance with that requirement is
sufficient.” (Dollase v. Wanu Water, Inc. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1315,
1324 citing Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.)
Whether or not this application is in proper form is
the element that gives the Court the most concern. The application must be
accompanied by the pleading proposed to be filed therein; however, Plaintiff
did not attach a copy of the proposed complaint with the motion/application.
For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that
this element at the very least can be cured before the hearing, and even
potentially at the hearing.
First, the Court notes that Metro did not oppose the
motion as to whether or not the application was in proper form.
Second, even if this application is not in proper form
at the time it was filed, it appears that under the existing case law, the
current defect could be cured at the hearing.
In Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 393, the Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed the trial court’s
decision denying defendants’ motion to vacate the default judgment for defendants
failing to include both an affidavit of fault and a proposed answer attached to
the motion. 
With respect to defendants in Carmel failing to
include a proposed answer attached to their motion to vacate default, the
Fourth District addressed what was considered to be “substantial compliance”
with respect to the application being in “proper form.” The Fourth District
concluded that “defendants’ proffer of their proposed answer at the hearing on
their motion in the present case substantially complied with the requirements
of the mandatory relief provision of section 473, subdivision (b).” (Carmel,
Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.)
When the Fourth District explained its reasoning and
reviewed the record of the trial court, it stated in relevant part:
Here, the record does not
reflect that defendants included a copy of their proposed answer with their
motion. But there is evidence defendants prepared a proposed answer when
they filed their motion, and made it available at the hearing on the motion.
Indeed, some evidence suggests defendants did accompany their motion with a
proposed answer.
 
One of the defendants,
Moshen Tavoussi, submitted a declaration in support of the motion, in which he
represents: “I have a good and meritorious defense to the complaint as
shown by the proposed Answer which is filed herewith.” (Italics
added.) Although the record is silent on whether defendants served the proposed
answer on Carmel, we note that Carmel did not allege
defendants had failed to include a proposed answer in their opposition to the
motion. At the hearing on the motion, defendants' counsel protested the court's
tentative ruling, representing, “I did attach an answer, your Honor, that was
filed.” When the trial court reviewed the file and did not find the proposed
answer, defendants' counsel told the court he had a copy of the proposed answer
that he had filed with the motion. The trial court did not ask to review the
copy, but simply replied, “Okay. The ruling stands.” At our request, defendants
have lodged a copy of their proposed answer, reflecting an execution date of
October 18, 2007, the same day defendants' counsel executed the motion.
 
We do not know whether
defendants' counsel inadvertently failed to accompany the motion with their
proposed answer, or whether the proposed answer simply did not find its way
into the court's file. But we perceive no reason why the court could not have reviewed
the proposed answer proffered at the hearing and ordered it filed. Carmel
did not assert the absence of a proposed answer as a basis for opposing the
motion and would have suffered no prejudice if the court allowed defendants to
file the answer at the hearing.
 
(Carmel, Ltd. v.
Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 402-403.)
 
Here, Plaintiff does not
submit with its application the pleading proposed to be filed therein.
Presumably, this would need to be the FAC. 
 
In Petale’s declaration
to this motion, Petale states:
 
I have served this Notice
of Motion and Motion for Relief from the Court's Order of Dismissal by U.S.
Mail on all defendants in this action. Included in the envelope, serving this
notice of Motion, I have placed true and correct copies of the Summons, the
First Amended Complaint, the Notice of Case Assignment and the Mandatory ADR
Notice so that all Defendants are made aware of the Summons and Complaint
pending against them, in the event the Court grant's this Motion and the
Defendants are required to answer or otherwise appear herein.
 
(Decl. Petale ¶6.)
 
Notably missing from
Petale’s application is the proposed FAC to be filed with the application. Although
the FAC was not attached to the application, it appears that under Carmel,
Plaintiff can cure this defect by lodging the proposed FAC before the scheduled
hearing. It also appears that it may be possible under Carmel for
Plaintiff to be able to cure the defect by proffering the proposed FAC at the
hearing and the Court ordering it filed. 
 
Therefore, if Plaintiff
cures the aforementioned defect, it appears that Plaintiff can satisfy the
“proper form” requirement under the mandatory relief provision of § 473(b). 
 
Further, the Court notes that
Metro did not oppose this motion on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to attach
the proposed pleading.
 
Further, although
Petale’s declaration at ¶6 explains that he served the FAC, summons, and other
forms, Petale does not provide any proof of service of the FAC and these
documents on the Defendants. Further, to the Court’s understanding, this is not
an order to show cause re: failure to file proof of service. Therefore, the
Court notes that it is not commenting on whether or not Plaintiff has properly
executed service with respect to the FAC and accompanying documents.
 
Discretionary
The Court will not analyze whether or not relief is
appropriate under the discretionary relief provision of § 473(b). Under both
the mandatory and discretionary relief portions of § 473(b), the application must
be accompanied by the proposed pleading. Therefore, the main issue as to this
motion is whether or not the application is accompanied by the proposed
pleading. 
“The range of attorney conduct for which relief can be
granted in the mandatory provision is broader than that in the discretionary
provision, and includes inexcusable neglect. But the range of adverse
litigation results from which relief can be granted is narrower. Mandatory
relief only extends to vacating a default which will result in
the entry of a default judgment, a default judgment, or an entered dismissal.”
(Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603,
616.)
Ultimately, the Court will not examine whether
discretionary relief can be granted because it does not appear as if it would
be any easier for Plaintiff’s motion to be granted under the discretionary
provision of § 473(b). If anything, it appears as if Plaintiff’s motion is more
likely to be granted by complying with the mandatory provision of § 473(b);
therefore, the Court will not analyze whether granting relief under the
discretionary provision has been satisfied.
TENTATIVE RULING
The
Court will hear argument. 
If the Court is to grant this motion, it appears as if
Plaintiff would have to cure the defect of Plaintiff’s application currently
not being in proper form. Further, Plaintiff should be prepared to address
whether or not under Carmel and existing case law if Plaintiff also has
to have served the proposed FAC on all Defendants before or at the hearing in
order to cure the defect as to the application being in “proper form.”
Further, Plaintiff is to address the issues of service
raised above. 
 Sanctions
“The court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s
affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal
fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties. However, this section shall not
lengthen the time within which an action shall be brought to trial pursuant to
Section 583.310.” (CCP § 473(b).)
Further, under § 473(c):
(1) Whenever the
court grants relief from a default, default judgment, or dismissal based on any
of the provisions of this section, the court may do any of the following:
(A) Impose
a penalty of no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon an offending
attorney or party.
(B) Direct
that an offending attorney pay an amount no greater than one thousand dollars
($1,000) to the State Bar Client Security Fund.
(C) Grant
other relief as is appropriate.
 
(2) However, where
the court grants relief from a default or default judgment pursuant to this
section based upon the affidavit of the defaulting party’s attorney attesting
to the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, the relief shall
not be made conditional upon the attorney’s payment of compensatory legal fees
or costs or monetary penalties imposed by the court or upon compliance with
other sanctions ordered by the court.
 
(CCP §473(c)(1)-(2).)
 
The Court will also hear
argument as to the issue of sanctions.
