And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court will hear argument on Defendant's motion for summary judgment, which argues that Plaintiff's Complaint has no merit. Defendant claims that Plaintiff admitted that Defendant was not negligent towards her, that no act or omission by Defendant contributed to the injury, and that Defendant did not allow a dangerous condition to exist on the premises. The Court notes that Defendant's motion lacks clarity and does not properly cite evidence to support its claims. The Court also points out that Defendant failed to serve Plaintiff's counsel at the email address listed on eCourt and that Defendant did not address service issues. The Court will require Defendant to address these issues and provide clear explanations of which elements of Plaintiff's causes of action cannot be established.
