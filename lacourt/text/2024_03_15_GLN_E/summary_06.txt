And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to interrogatories. The motion was filed by Plaintiffs Danitza Maravilla Torres and Andres Morales Rios against Defendant FCA US LLC, Glendale Dodge LLC, and DOES 1-10. The Plaintiffs sought to compel further responses to their Special Interrogatories and requested sanctions in the amount of $2,610.00 against Defendant FCA US LLC and its attorneys of record, Ongaro P.C.

The Court finds that the motion is timely and that Defendant provided supplemental responses to the instant SROGs, numbers 45-48, on February 20, 2024, and verifications to its supplemental responses on February 23, 2024. As a result, the Court denies the motion to compel further responses as moot with respect to compelling further responses.

However, the Court notes that Defendant provided the supplemental responses after the filing of the instant motion, and therefore, the Court will hear argument as to sanctions. The Court is likely to grant sanctions based on Defendant sending supplemental responses after the filing of this motion.
