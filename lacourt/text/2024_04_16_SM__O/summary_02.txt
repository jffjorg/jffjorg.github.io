```

And here is a summary in English:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant, Tesla Motors, Inc., has moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff, Sam Navid, when he clicked the "Place Order" button on Tesla's website. The agreement states that any disputes will be resolved through arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association. The judge finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and that Navid has failed to prove a defense to enforcement. The judge also finds that the agreement is not procedurally or substantively unconscionable. The judge grants Tesla's motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending resolution of the arbitration.
