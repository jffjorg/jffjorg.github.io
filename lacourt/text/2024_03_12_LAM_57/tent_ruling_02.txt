 Case Number:  20STCV49119    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs.  In the main, the Court is granting the motion.  The Court finds that the hourly billing rates of Plaintiff's attorneys are reasonable and that, for the most part, the time that the attorneys spent on the tasks identified in the motion was reasonable too.  The Court is inclined to make modest reductions to the fees sought in five categories of tasks identified in the motion   The Court will review those tentative reductions at the hearing and recalculate the fees to be awarded following the reductions.  The Court also is inclined to make one reduction in the allowable costs, which will be discussed at the hearing.  The Court is not inclined to award Plaintiff's a multiplier.  In the Court's view, the circumstances of this case do not warrant a multiplier.
