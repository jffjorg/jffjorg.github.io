And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs. The court is granting the motion, but with some modifications. The court finds that the hourly billing rates of the plaintiff's attorneys are reasonable, as well as the time spent on the tasks identified in the motion. However, the court is inclined to make modest reductions to the fees sought in five categories of tasks. These reductions will be reviewed at the upcoming hearing and the fees will be recalculated accordingly. Additionally, the court is inclined to make a reduction in the allowable costs, which will also be discussed at the hearing. The court is not inclined to award the plaintiff a multiplier, as it does not believe the circumstances of the case warrant it.
