And here is the English-text summary:

A tentative ruling has been issued by the court regarding a motion for summary adjudication. The court has not yet made a decision, but the hearing will focus on two key questions. First, whether the facts in the stipulated judgment in the Lazar action deem Reichnitz as an imposter, which would render the entrustment exclusion inapplicable under Freedman. Second, whether the plaintiff is entitled to payment from the defendants for the Rovinsky losses, despite the plaintiff having admitted to recovering those losses prior to and during the hearing. The court will consider whether the plaintiff is materialy misrepresenting the amount of their loss attributable to the Rovinsky losses.
