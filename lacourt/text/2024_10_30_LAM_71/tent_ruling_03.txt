1.    Motion to
Compel Further- Tham
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses from Tham
to Plaintiff’s RFP, the Court rules as follows:
           On March 14, 2024, Plaintiff
served the RFP on Defendant’s counsel (at the time), and responses were due by
April 16, 2024.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶2,
Exh. 1.)  In response to Defendant’s
counsel’s requests, Plaintiff’s counsel gave Defendant an extension to respond
to April 30, and then to May 10, and then to May 15, 2024.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶¶3-4, Exhs. 2-3.)  On May 15, 2024, Defendant served responses
to the RFP and produced documents, and responses and production were not
Code-compliant.  (See Decl. of
Weinberg ¶5, Exh. 4.)  
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to
Defendant’s counsel.  (Decl. of Weinberg
¶6, Exh. 5.)  The letter requested a
response by May 30, 2024. (Decl. of Weinberg ¶6, Exh. 5.)  On May 30, the parties agreed to extend the
deadline for Defendant to respond until June 14, and the parties extended the deadline
for Plaintiff to file Motions(s) to Compel until July 19, 2024.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶7, Exh. 13.)
On June 18, and then on June 24, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel asked
Defendant’s counsel when he would be available for an IDC regarding his
client’s discovery responses / document production.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶7, Exh. 13.) On June 25,
2024, Defendant’s counsel advised he was “no longer the attorney for the
defendants in this case” and forwarded substitution of attorney forms.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶8, Ex. 14.)  On June 27, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a
letter to Defendant to contact him so an IDC could be scheduled.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶9, Ex. 15.)  Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to schedule an
IDC with this Court, but Defendant did not cooperate in Plaintiff’s counsel’s
efforts, necessitating the filing of the instant motion, and no supplemental
discovery responses have been provided to date. 
(See Decl. of Weinberg ¶12.)  
Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses.  
           Plaintiff’s motion is granted.  Many of Defendant’s responses are evasive and
incomplete because they are not actually Code-compliant and not all documents
have been produced.  (C.C.P.
§§2031.210-2031.220.)
Defendant’s responses to RFP Request Nos. 3, 4, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, and 30
that “Responding Party provides no documents at present time but will
supplement his responses with additional documents” are evasive and incomplete.
 Defendant is obligated to produce all
responsive documents, and Defendant does not advise when the production will
take place.
           Defendant’s responses to
RFP Request Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 31, 32, and 33 are evasive
and incomplete because Defendant is obligated to produce all responsive documents,
and Defendant does not advise when all responsive documents will be produced.
           Defendant’s “Preliminary
Statement” to the RFP include a series of purported objections including “all
objections as to competence, relevance, materiality, admissibility, privilege,
privacy, proprietary information, trade secrets and the like, and any and all
other objections . . ..” (Decl. of Weinberg ¶4, Exh. 5.)  Most of the other objections are asserted “to
the extent” a particular ground for objection might apply.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶4, Exh. 5.)  Defendant’s boilerplate objections are
without merit and are too general.  Defendant
is ordered to provide further responses without objections (except for
attorney-client communications and attorney work-product if applicable).
           Defendant is also
compelled to produce all responsive documents wherein Defendant agreed to
produce documents.  If Defendant is unable
to comply with a particular request, Defendant must provide a verified
statement of inability to
comply that conforms in all respects to C.C.P. §2031.230.  Responses are due within 20 days of this
ruling.
Defendant requests monetary sanctions totaling $1,065.00 against Defendant.

           The Court awards
sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2023.030(a) in the amount of $460.00, calculated
as follows:
(6.9 hours to prepare instant motion x $400.00) + $60.00 filing fee =
$2,760.00/6 Plaintiffs= $460.00
The sanctions are payable by Tham within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.

Defendant’s counsel.  (Decl. of Weinberg
¶6, Exh. 5.)  The letter requested a
response by May 30, 2024. (Decl. of Weinberg ¶6, Exh. 5.)  On May 30, the parties agreed to extend the
deadline for Defendant to respond until June 14, and the parties extended the deadline
for Plaintiff to file Motions(s) to Compel until July 19, 2024.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶7, Exh. 13.)
On June 18, and then on June 24, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel asked
Defendant’s counsel when he would be available for an IDC regarding his
client’s discovery responses / document production.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶7, Exh. 13.) On June 25,
2024, Defendant’s counsel advised he was “no longer the attorney for the
defendants in this case” and forwarded substitution of attorney forms.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶8, Ex. 14.)  On June 27, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a
letter to Defendant to contact him so an IDC could be scheduled.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶9, Ex. 15.)  Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to schedule an
IDC with this Court, but Defendant did not cooperate in Plaintiff’s counsel’s
efforts, necessitating the filing of the instant motion, and no supplemental
discovery responses have been provided to date. 
(See Decl. of Weinberg ¶12.)  
Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses.  
           Plaintiff’s motion is
granted.  Many of Defendant’s responses
are evasive and incomplete because they are not actually Code-compliant and not
all documents have been produced.  (C.C.P.
§§2031.210-2031.220.)
Defendant’s responses to RFP Request Nos. 3, 4, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, and 30
that “Responding Party provides no documents at present time but will
supplement his responses with additional documents” are evasive and incomplete.
 Defendant is obligated to produce all
responsive documents, and Defendant does not advise when the production will
take place.
           Defendant’s responses to
RFP Request Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 31, 32, and 33 are evasive
and incomplete because Defendant is obligated to produce all responsive documents,
and Defendant does not advise when all responsive documents will be produced.
           Defendant’s “Preliminary
Statement” to the RFP include a series of purported objections including “all
objections as to competence, relevance, materiality, admissibility, privilege,
privacy, proprietary information, trade secrets and the like, and any and all
other objections . . ..” (Decl. of Weinberg ¶4, Exh. 5.)  Most of the other objections are asserted “to
the extent” a particular ground for objection might apply.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶4, Exh. 5.)  Defendant’s boilerplate objections are
without merit and are too general.  Defendant
is ordered to provide further responses without objections (except for
attorney-client communications and attorney work-product if applicable).
           Defendant is also
compelled to produce all responsive documents wherein Defendant agreed to
produce documents.  If Defendant is unable
to comply with a particular request, Defendant must provide a verified
statement of inability to
comply that conforms in all respects to C.C.P. §2031.230.  Responses are due within 20 days of this
ruling.
Defendant requests monetary sanctions totaling $1,065.00 against
Defendant. 
           The Court awards
sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2023.030(a) in the amount of $460.00, calculated
as follows:
(6.9 hours to prepare instant motion x $400.00) + $60.00 filing fee =
$2,760.00/6 Plaintiffs= $460.00
The sanctions are payable by Remi within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.

Investored to Plaintiff’s RFP, the Court rules as follows:
           On March 14, 2024,
Plaintiff served the RFP on Defendant’s counsel (at the time), and responses
were due by April 16, 2024.  (Decl. of
Weinberg ¶2, Exh. 1.)  In response to
Defendant’s counsel’s requests, Plaintiff’s counsel gave Defendant an extension
to respond to April 30, and then to May 10, and then to May 15, 2024.  (Decl. of Weinberg ¶¶3-4, Exhs. 2-3.)  On May 15, 2024, Defendant served responses
to the RFP and produced documents, and responses and production were not
Code-compliant.  (See Decl. of
Weinberg ¶5, Exh. 4.)  
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to
Defendant’s counsel.  (Decl. of Weinberg
