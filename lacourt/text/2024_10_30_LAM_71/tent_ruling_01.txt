(Decl. of Foti ¶2, Exh. 1 at pgs. 7-8.)
Plaintiff’s subpoena is not limited by any
dates or subject matter.  However,
Plaintiff’s third amended complaint (“TAC”) alleges multiple causes of action
that pertain to Carbon 38, namely the 3rd cause of action for intentional
interference with prospective economic advantage.  Plaintiff alleges that Carbon 38 was ONA’s
largest customer and client.  (TAC ¶90.)  Plaintiff alleges that on September 12, 2023,
Chung met with Carbon 38’s CEO in order to negotiate a new contract between
Carbon 38 and Chung, and that a month later, YCD entered into a contract with
Carbon 38 to manufacture and women’s activewear and athleisure. (TAC ¶¶91-94.)  Plaintiff alleges that this conduct disrupted
ONA’s relationship with Carbon 38 that Carbon 38 ceased all business with ONA
in October 2023. (TAC ¶95.)
Further, Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of action for
breach of contract pertains to Carbon 38 on the basis that Plaintiff alleges Moving
Defendants had a duty to Plaintiff to not engage in any other business interest
or activity that may directly or indirectly compete with the business and
affairs of the company.  (See TAC ¶81, Exh. A at §3.3(b).) 
The instant deposition requests records that are relevant to Moving
Defendants’ business relationship with Carbon 38, and the records sought are
relevant because they directly concern Plaintiff’s claims that, under the LLC Agreement
and Moving Defendants’ capacity as the president and manager of the company
ONA, Moving Defendants were contractually required and owed a duty to Plaintiff
and ONA to not engage in separate business outside the sphere of ONA, and to
not divert or misappropriate ONA’s customers.  (TAC ¶¶22-23, 25).
Therefore, Moving Defendants’ motion is
granted in part with respect to the overbreadth of the dates Plaintiff seeks
for the requested documents.  Plaintiff’s
request is limited to documents on or before October 2023.  (See TAC ¶44.) 
However, Moving Defendant’s motion is otherwise denied on the basis that
on October 10, 2023, a stipulated protective order was filed and entered. In
light of said stipulated protective order, Moving Defendants’ concerns for
their and the deponents’ financial privacy are wholly addressed.
Accordingly, Moving Defendants’ motion is
granted in part, with the documents sought limited to dates on or before
October 2023, and otherwise denied.
 
Sanctions
Moving Defendants’ request for
sanctions is denied.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
is denied.

 
Conclusion
Moving
Defendants’ motion to quash is granted in part, with the documents sought limited to dates on or before October 2023,
and otherwise denied.
Moving Defendants’ request for
sanctions is denied.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
is denied.

(Decl. of Foti ¶2, Exh. 1 at pgs. 7-8.)
Plaintiff’s subpoena is not limited by any
dates or subject matter.  However,
Plaintiff’s third amended complaint (“TAC”) alleges the 2nd cause of action for
breach of contract, which pertains to Peloton.  Plaintiff alleges Moving Defendants had a duty
to Plaintiff to not engage in any other business interest or activity that may
directly or indirectly compete with the business and affairs of the
company.  (See TAC ¶81, Exh. A at
§3.3(b).)  The instant deposition
requests records that are relevant to Moving Defendants’ business relationship
with Peloton, and the records sought are relevant because they directly concern
Plaintiff’s claims that, under the LLC Agreement and Moving Defendants’
capacity as the president and manager of the company ONA, Moving Defendants were
contractually required and owed a duty to Plaintiff and ONA to not engage in
separate business outside the sphere of ONA, and to not divert or
misappropriate ONA’s customers.  (TAC
¶¶22-23, 25).
Further, Plaintiff’s 5th cause of action
alleges on or about December 2020, Chung developed an account with Peloton, and
that Chung concealed from Plaintiff that the account was developed between
Peloton and YCD only, and not ONA.  (See TAC ¶110.)  Plaintiff alleges in
or about February 2021, Chung proposed an amendment to the LLC Agreement for
Plaintiff to loan YCD $300,000.00 to assist with fulfilling YCD’s order from
Peloton and that all future business, including business with Peloton and all
of YCD’s clients, would be performed through an “umbrella company.”  (See TAC ¶112.) 
Plaintiff alleges that based on Chung’s representations, Plaintiff
provided YCD with the $300,000.00 loan in or about March 2021.  (See TAC ¶115.) 

Therefore, Moving Defendants’ motion is
granted in part with respect to the overbreadth of the dates Plaintiff seeks
for the requested documents.  Plaintiff’s
request is limited to documents on or before November 2021.  (See TAC ¶57.) 
However, Moving Defendant’s motion is otherwise denied on the basis that
on October 10, 2023, a stipulated protective order was filed and entered. In
light of said stipulated protective order, Moving Defendants’ concerns for
their and the deponents’ financial privacy are wholly addressed.
Accordingly, Moving Defendants’ motion is
granted in part, with the documents sought limited to dates on or before November
2021, and otherwise denied.
