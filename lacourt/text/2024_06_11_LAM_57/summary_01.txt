```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is to continue the hearing on the Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication. The reason for the continuance is that the Defendants failed to file the compendium of evidence in support of their opposition. Although the Defendants submitted an index of the exhibits in the compendium, the actual compendium was not received by the Court. The Court will set a due date for the Defendants to file the compendium and will discuss with the parties an appropriate date to return for the continued hearing.
