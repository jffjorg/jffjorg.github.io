  Case Number:  22STCV01760    Hearing Date:   June 11, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is continuing the hearing on Plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication.  The reason for the continuance is that the Defendants did not file along with their opposition papers the compendium of evidence in support of the opposition.  The Defendants' response to the Plaintiffs'' separate statement of material facts refers to exhibits in the compendium and the Defendants submitted an index of the exhibits in the compendium.  But the Court never received the actual compendium itself.    The Court first noticed this problem on the morning of June 10, 2024 when the Court began to review the parties' papers and prepare its tentative decision on the motion.  At the hearing on June 11, 2024, the Court will set a due date for the Defendants to file the compendium of evidence and discuss with the parties an appropriate date in the very near future to return for the continued hearing.
