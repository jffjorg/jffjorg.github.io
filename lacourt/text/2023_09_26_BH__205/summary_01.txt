And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. on a motion to strike and/or tax costs filed by Defendant Focus Line LLC. The case involves a dispute over construction on a residential lot in the Holmby Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, which is subject to deed restrictions. The plaintiff, Holmby Westwood Property Owners Association (HWPOA), sued Focus Line for building a residence that did not comply with the deed restrictions. The trial took place in January and February 2023, and the court ruled in favor of HWPOA. HWPOA then filed a memorandum of costs seeking $21,529.15, which includes court reporter fees and trial transcripts. Focus Line argues that the parties agreed to share these costs equally, and therefore HWPOA cannot recover them as costs. The judge grants the motion to strike and/or tax costs, finding that the burden shifts to HWPOA as the party claiming costs, and that the evidence is in equipoise.
