And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. on a motion to strike and/or tax costs filed by Defendant Focus Line LLC. The case involves a dispute over construction on a residential lot in the Holmby Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, which is subject to deed restrictions. The plaintiff, Holmby Westwood Property Owners Association (HWPOA), sued Focus Line for building a residence that did not comply with the deed restrictions. The trial took place in January and February 2023, and the court ruled in favor of HWPOA. HWPOA then filed a memorandum of costs seeking $21,529.15, which includes court reporter fees and trial transcripts. Focus Line argues that the parties agreed to share these costs equally, and therefore HWPOA cannot recover them as costs. The judge grants the motion to strike and/or tax costs, finding that the burden shifts to HWPOA as the party claiming costs, and that the evidence is in equipoise.

## English Text Summary:

The judge is considering Focus Line LLC's motion to strike certain costs from the Holmby Westwood Property Owners Association's (HWPOA) memorandum of costs.  

The core dispute is whether the parties' prior agreement to share the costs of court reporter fees and trial transcripts meant that the prevailing party could later seek full reimbursement for these expenses.  Focus Line argues that the agreement was for equal sharing and does not allow for later recovery, citing contemporaneous emails. HWPOA counters that the agreement was only for initial sharing, but allows for the prevailing party to recover costs. However, HWPOA does not have any written evidence to support this.

Since Focus Line has properly objected to the costs, the burden is on HWPOA to prove they are entitled to recover them. Given the lack of clear evidence supporting HWPOA's claim, the judge grants Focus Line's motion to strike the disputed costs.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Focus Line LLC's motion to strike and/or tax costs. The dispute arose from the parties' agreement to share costs relating to court reporter fees and trial transcripts. While it is acknowledged that the parties agreed to share these costs, it is unclear whether they also agreed that each party would then be precluded from recovering these expenses as costs. The judge finds that the evidence is in equipoise, and since the burden of proof is on the party claiming costs (HWPOA), the judge grants the motion to strike. The court orders that the costs of court reporter fees and trial transcripts be struck from the memorandum of costs filed by HWPOA.
