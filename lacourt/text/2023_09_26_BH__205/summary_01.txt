And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. on a motion to strike and/or tax costs filed by Defendant Focus Line LLC. The case involves a dispute over construction on a residential lot in the Holmby Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, which is subject to deed restrictions. The plaintiff, Holmby Westwood Property Owners Association (HWPOA), sued Focus Line for building a residence that did not comply with the deed restrictions. The trial took place in January and February 2023, and the court ruled in favor of HWPOA. HWPOA then filed a memorandum of costs seeking $21,529.15, which includes court reporter fees and trial transcripts. Focus Line argues that the parties agreed to share these costs equally, and therefore HWPOA cannot recover them as costs. The judge grants the motion to strike and/or tax costs, finding that the burden shifts to HWPOA as the party claiming costs, and that the evidence is in equipoise.

## English Text Summary:

The judge is considering Focus Line LLC's motion to strike certain costs from the Holmby Westwood Property Owners Association's (HWPOA) memorandum of costs.  

The core dispute is whether the parties' prior agreement to share the costs of court reporter fees and trial transcripts meant that the prevailing party could later seek full reimbursement for these expenses.  Focus Line argues that the agreement was for equal sharing and does not allow for later recovery, citing contemporaneous emails. HWPOA counters that the agreement was only for initial sharing, but allows for the prevailing party to recover costs. However, HWPOA does not have any written evidence to support this.

Since Focus Line has properly objected to the costs, the burden is on HWPOA to prove they are entitled to recover them. Given the lack of clear evidence supporting HWPOA's claim, the judge grants Focus Line's motion to strike the disputed costs.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Focus Line LLC's motion to strike and/or tax costs. The dispute arose from the parties' agreement to share costs relating to court reporter fees and trial transcripts. While it is acknowledged that the parties agreed to share these costs, it is unclear whether they also agreed that each party would then be precluded from recovering these expenses as costs. The judge finds that the evidence is in equipoise, and since the burden of proof is on the party claiming costs (HWPOA), the judge grants the motion to strike. The court orders that the costs of court reporter fees and trial transcripts be struck from the memorandum of costs filed by HWPOA.

## Case Summary: 

**Case Number:** 20SMCV01575

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles – West District, Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205

**Plaintiff:** Holmby Westwood Property Owners Association (HWPOA)

**Defendant:** Focus Line LLC

**Location:** 10433 Lindbrook Drive, Holmby Westwood, Los Angeles

**Background:**

* HWPOA is a neighborhood association enforcing deed restrictions on properties in Holmby Westwood.
* Focus Line LLC built a residence on their property at 10433 Lindbrook Drive with a setback less than the required 35 feet.
* HWPOA sued Focus Line for violating the deed restrictions.
* Trial took place from January 23, 2023 to February 1, 2023, resulting in a win for HWPOA.
* HWPOA filed a memorandum of costs seeking $21,529.15.

**Disputes:**

* Focus Line LLC challenged HWPOA's request to recover $14,336.08 in court reporter fees and trial transcripts, arguing the parties agreed to share these costs equally.
* HWPOA claims the agreement was for initial cost-sharing, but the prevailing party could recover them later.

**Evidence:**

* HWPOA relies on a declaration from Bryn.
* Focus Line provides contemporaneous emails as evidence of the equal sharing agreement.

**Judge's Ruling:**

* The judge granted Focus Line LLC's motion to strike the contested costs.
* The burden of proof lies with HWPOA, and the evidence is inconclusive.
* The judge found that HWPOA did not sufficiently prove that the agreement allowed for cost recovery.

**Legal Basis:**

* Code of Civil Procedure § 1032(b) and Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606 (prevailing party entitled to costs)
* Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5 (recoverable costs)
* Law precedent regarding burden of proof in cost disputes (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74 and Adams v. Ford Motor Co., (2011) 199 Cal. App. 4th 1475, 1486)

## English Summary:

The judge ruled in favor of Focus Line LLC, striking the costs related to court reporter fees ($6,500) and trial transcripts ($7,836.08) from HWPOA's memorandum of costs. 

While both parties initially agreed to share these costs, Focus Line LLC argued that the agreement meant they wouldn't be recoverable as part of the prevailing party's costs. HWPOA claimed the agreement allowed for cost recovery by the prevailing party. 

The judge found the evidence to be inconclusive and placed the burden of proof on HWPOA. Since HWPOA couldn't sufficiently prove their claim, the judge granted Focus Line LLC's motion to strike the contested costs.

### English Text Summary
The tentative ruling is for the case of Holmby Westwood Property Owners Association (HWPOA) vs. Focus Line LLC. The case involves a dispute over the construction of a residential lot in the Holmby Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. The lot is subject to deed restrictions that require a residence to front on Lindbrook Drive and be set back at least 35 feet. HWPOA sued Focus Line for building a residence with less than 35 feet set back. The court ruled in favor of HWPOA, and HWPOA filed a memorandum of costs seeking $21,529.15. Focus Line filed a motion to strike or tax certain costs, including court reporter fees and trial transcripts. The court grants Focus Line's motion, as the evidence is in equipoise and HWPOA bears the burden of proof. The court rules that the agreement between the parties to share costs does not preclude the prevailing party from seeking recovery of those costs in a memorandum of costs. However, since the burden of proof is on HWPOA and the evidence is in equipoise, the court grants the motion to strike.

**Roles:**

- Defendant: Focus Line LLC
- Judge: Edward B. Moreton, Jr.

**Significant Statements:**

- "While it is clear the parties agreed to share costs relating to the reporter fees and trial transcripts, it is not clear whether they agreed that they would then be precluded to recover these expenses as costs."
- "Because Focus Line has properly objected to the costs, the burden shifts to HWPOA as the party claiming costs."
- "Because HWPOA bears the burden of proof and the evidence is in equipoise, the Court grants the motion to strike."
