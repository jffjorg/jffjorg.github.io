**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23SMCV01740
* Hearing Date: September 26, 2023
* Department: 205
* Court: Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles â€“ West District, Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Sedigheh Hadian Ghahderijani
* Defendants: Omid ADHC Corporation, Jilbert Sedighpour

**Facts**

* The plaintiff, an elderly woman with chronic poor health, slipped and fell on June 28, 2022, while being transported to her adult day care facility by Jilbert Sedighpour, an employee of Omid ADHC Corporation.
* Sedighpour parked her vehicle on a slope near a curb in a no-parking area, and the plaintiff had to navigate across uneven and slippery ground to exit the vehicle, resulting in her fall.

**Legal Issues**

* The defendants demurred to the elder abuse claim, arguing that it fails to allege recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice.
* The plaintiffs argued that the defendants' failure to meet and confer before filing the demurrer and motion to strike was improper.

**Tentative Ruling**

* The court sustains the demurrer to the elder abuse claim with 20 days' leave to amend.
* The court denies the motion to strike as moot.
* The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations amount to negligence, not recklessness, and do not state a claim for elder abuse.

**Significant Statements**

* "A claim for elder abuse requires more than simple or gross negligence." (Worsham v. O'Connor Hosp. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 331, 337)
* "Neglect is not the same as negligence." (Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 781)
* "Recklessness" requires "a subjective state of culpability greater than simple negligence, which has been described as a 'deliberate disregard' of the 'high degree of probability that an injury will occur." (Sababin v. Superior Court (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 81, 88-89)

**Notes**

* The court will provide an opportunity for the plaintiff to amend the complaint within 20 days.
* The defendants' failure to meet and confer before filing the demurrer and motion to strike was improper, but the court will not deny the motions based on this ground.
