```

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground that the Elder Abuse Act requires a showing beyond mere negligence, and the facts alleged in the complaint only give rise to a finding of negligence. The Court agrees with the defendants and sustains their demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend.

The Court also denied the defendants' motion to strike as moot. The Judge found that the plaintiff's claims, which include allegations of negligence and elder abuse, amount to mere negligence, not recklessness. The Judge noted that the plaintiff has made no allegations that would support a finding that the defendants engaged in a "conscious choice of a course of action with knowledge" of the serious danger to the plaintiff.

The Court also cited several cases, including Worsham v. O'Connor Hosp., Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court, and Sababin v. Superior Court, to support its ruling. The Judge concluded that the plaintiff's claims are insufficient to state a cause of action for elder abuse and that the defendants' demurrer should be sustained with leave to amend.

To constitute abuse and neglect within the meaning of the Elder Abuse Act, thereby triggering the enhanced remedies available under the Act, Plaintiff ‘must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence … reckless, oppressive, fraudulent or malicious conduct.’ ‘Recklessness’ requires ‘a subjective state of culpability greater than simple negligence, which has been described as a ‘deliberate disregard’ of the ‘high degree of probability that an injury will occur.’ There is a heightened standard of pleading for an elder abuse claim. ‘Facts, not conclusions, must be pleaded.’ Here, Plaintiff’s claims amount to negligence, not recklessness. Plaintiff has made no allegations that would support a finding that Sedighpour or OMID engaged in a ‘conscious choice of a course of action … with knowledge’ of the serious danger to Plaintiff."

Summary:
This is a tentative ruling for a case regarding a slip and fall incident involving an elderly woman, Sedigheh Hadian Ghahderijani, at an adult day care facility owned by Omid ADHC Corporation. The defendant, Jilbert Sedighpour, who is an officer, director, agent and/or employee of the facility, is alleged to have parked the vehicle on a slope near a curb in a no parking area, where the ground was uneven and slippery, and failed to assist the plaintiff, causing her to slip and fall. The plaintiff brought a complaint alleging five causes of action, including elder abuse, general negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligent misrepresentation, and respondeat superior liability. The defendants demurred to the first cause of action for elder abuse, asserting that it fails to allege with the requisite specificity that the defendants are guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice. The court sustained the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend, as the Elder Abuse Act requires a showing beyond mere negligence, and the facts alleged in the complaint only give rise to a finding of negligence. The court found that the plaintiff's claims amount to negligence, not recklessness, and the plaintiff has made no allegations that would support a finding that the defendants engaged in a conscious choice of a course of action with knowledge of the serious danger to the plaintiff. The court denied the defendants' motion to strike as moot.
