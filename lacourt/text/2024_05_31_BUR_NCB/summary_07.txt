  * "Tort damages have been permitted in contract cases where a breach of duty directly causes physical injury [citation]; for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in insurance contracts [citation]; for wrongful discharge in violation of fundamental public policy [citation]; or where the contract was fraudulently induced. [Citation.] In each of these cases, the duty that gives rise to tort liability is either completely independent of the contract or arises from conduct which is both intentional and intended to harm. [Citation.]" (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551–552)

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the 6th cause of action (fraudulent concealment) without leave to amend and sustains the demurrer to the 5th cause of action (negligent repair) with 20 days leave to amend. The ruling holds that the fraud claim is barred by the economic loss rule and that the negligent repair claim does not allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action.
