motion for award of attorney’s fees and
  costs 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations of the Operative Complaint 
            Plaintiff Michael Lawrence Kline (“Plaintiff”)
and Defendant Michael Dibacco (“Defendant”) each own 50% ownership of Two
Michaels LLC and MRRS Co. LLC.  Two
Michaels LLC owns and operates 2 businesses located at 10057 Riverside Drive in
Toluca Lake, consisting of a lounge and restaurant in the back of the property
called “The Red Door”, and a full restaurant in the front called
“Riverside.”  Plaintiff is the head chef
and kitchen manager of the businesses, while Defendant is the bar manager,
maintains the corporate records, and manages finances.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant mishandled
and misappropriated company funds, misrepresented and concealed banking and
credit card records, and filed fraudulent tax returns.  
            Plaintiff filed
the verified complaint on September 7, 2018. 
That same day, Plaintiff filed the verified amended complaint.  Thereafter, on December 28, 2018, Plaintiff
filed a Second Amended Verified Complaint. 
On June 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed the Third Amended Verified Complaint
(“TAC”), which alleges causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach
of fiduciary duty; (3) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing; (4) fraud/intentional misrepresentation and concealment; and (5) injunctive
relief.  
B.    
Motion on Calendar  
On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff Michael
Lawrence Kline filed a motion for an award of attorney’s fees and costs. 
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief.  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees
and costs in the amount of $106,563.00 against Defendant Michael DiBacco
following entry of the Court’s Order re: Contempt Hearing re: Michael
DiBacco.  
            On February 20, 2024, the Court held
a Contempt Hearing re: Michael DiBacco. 
The Court found that DiBacco was guilty of defying the injunction by
selling the Asian Screen (Count 1) and placing items in storage (Count 2).  The Court found that DiBacco had notice of
the September 6, 2022 Preliminary Injunction Order, that he had the ability to
comply with the order, and he failed to comply with the order, and that his
failure to comply was willful.  The Court
ordered DiBacco to pay $1,000 for each count of contempt he was found guilty
of.  The Court also allowed Plaintiff to
request attorney’s fees by a formal motion. 

A.   
Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
Plaintiff moves
for attorney’s fees pursuant to CCP § 1218. 

CCP § 1218(a)
states: 
(a) Upon the answer and evidence taken,
the court or judge shall determine whether the person proceeded against is
guilty of the contempt charged, and if it be adjudged that the person is guilty of the contempt, a fine may be
imposed on the
person not exceeding one thousand dollars
($1,000), payable to the court, or the person may be imprisoned
not exceeding five days, or both. In addition, a person who is subject to a
court order as a party to the action, or any agent of this person, who is
adjudged guilty of contempt for violating that court order may be ordered to
pay to the party initiating the contempt proceeding the reasonable attorney's
fees and costs incurred by this party in connection with the contempt proceeding.
(CCP § 1218(a) [emphasis added].)
Section 1218
provides a basis for attorney’s fees in this action.  As discussed above, at the contempt proceeding,
the Court found DiBacco guilty of two counts of contempt and gave leave for
Plaintiff to file a motion for attorney’s fees in connection with the contempt proceeding.  As such, Plaintiff is entitled to fees
pursuant to CCP § 1218(a).  
B.    
Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees 
Plaintiff seeks $106,563.00 in attorney’s fees and costs against DiBacco.  
In support of the motion, Plaintiff provides the relevant timeline of
events that led up to and include the contempt hearing: 

On July 11, 2022, the Court issued its first
     Preliminary Injunction Order. 
On September 6, 2022, the Court issued its
     modified Preliminary Injunction Order. 
On October 14, 2022, the Court issued its Order
     to Enforce the Preliminary Injunction. 
On December 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed an ex
     parte application for an order shortening time to hear his ex parte
     application for issuance of an OSC re Civil Contempt and Request for
     Attorney’s Fees and Costs of the three aforementioned court orders. 
On January 23, 2023, the Court granted
     Plaintiff’s ex parte application for issuance of an OSC re Civil Contempt
     and Request for Attorney’s Fees and Costs. 
     The Court scheduled the OSC for March 17, 2023.  
On December 1, 2023, the Court held its first
     hearing on the OSC re: Contempt. 
On February 15, 2024, the Court held day one of
     the hearing on DiBacco’s contempt. 
On February 20, 2024, the Court held day two of
     the contempt hearing, which is summarized above. 
On March 4, 2024, the Court entered the Order
     re; Contempt Hearing re: Michael DiBacco finding DiBacco guilty of two
     counts of contempt and authorizing Plaintiff to file a motion for
     attorney’s fees.  

In support of
the motion for attorney’s fees, Plaintiff provides the declarations of counsel
Joseph P. Hougnan and A. Raymond Hamrick, III. 
 Mr. Hougnan states that he has been one of the
attorneys providing legal services to Plaintiff in connection with the contempt
proceeding and has been Plaintiff’s counsel since the inception of the case in
2018.  (Hougnan Decl., ¶3.)  Mr. Hougnan was admitted to the California
State Bar in 1996 and his customary fee in litigation matters is
$500/hour.  (Id., ¶¶4-5.)  He states that prior to the contempt hearing,
he agreed to accept a reduced rate[1]
from Plaintiff, but his typical rate is well within or below the range of rates
typically charged for legal services, such that he believes an award of his
full typical $500/hour rate is appropriate. 
(Id., ¶5.)  Mr. Hougnan
provides a copy of the time records, and he states that the time billed was
reasonably and necessarily incurred.  (Id.,
¶¶6, 8, Ex. A.)  He states that the time
sought is accurate and reduced to include only the hours spent in connection
with DiBacco’s contempt of the Court Orders. 
(Id., ¶7.)  He states that
he billed 79.5 hours from December 2022 when he began drafting Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application for Issuance of OSC for
Civil Contempt and Request for Attorney’s Fees and Costs, through the hearing
held on February 15, 2022 where he appeared as a witness.  (Id.) 
Total, Mr. Hougnan seeks $41,250.00, which includes $39,750 in
attorney’s fees for his services (79.5 hours x $500), plus $1,500 for the
approximate amount of time he will spend in connection with the hearing on this
matter.  (Id., ¶¶9-11.)  
Mr.
Hamrick states that he served as lead counsel in the contempt proceedings after
associating in as counsel for Plaintiff. 
(Hamrick Decl., ¶1.)  He provides
a copy of the invoices for his services. 
(Id., ¶3, Ex. A.)  He
states that he was involved in three hearings on DiBacco’s OSC re contempt and
supervised work for all personnel whose work reimbursement is sought by this
motion.  (Id., ¶4.)  He states that Plaintiff was billed $600/hour
for partner time and $500/hour for associate time.  (Id., ¶5.)  Mr. Hamrick has over 40 years of experience
and believes his rate is reasonable and customary.  (Id., ¶6.)  Mr. Hamrick describes the work performed
associated with the contempt proceeding. 
(Id., ¶¶7-13.)  He states
that he incurred $13,920.00 in attorney’s fees (23.2 hours x $600/hour).  (Id., ¶14.)  He states that associate Shian V. Brisbois (admitted
2011) incurred $39,450 in fees (78.9 hours x $500/hour) and senior associate
Kenneth Kotarski (admitted 1981) incurred $350 (0.7 hour x $500/hour).  (Id., ¶¶15-18.)  His firm billed $53,720 for the work in
connection with the contempt matters and he estimates an additional $5,400 in
connection with the motion (opposition and reply) and hearing.  (Id., ¶¶19-20.)  He states that his firm also advanced costs
on behalf of Plaintiff in the amount of $473.56 for filing, court costs, and/or
service fees, as well as $5,700 in court report fees related to the contempt
hearings.  (Id., ¶¶21-22, Ex. B
[court reporter invoices].)  Total, Mr.
Hamrick seeks $65,313.00 ($53,720 in attorney’s fees + $5,400 in anticipated
fees, plus $6,173 in costs).  (Id.,
¶23.) 
The Court has reviewed the billing records of counsel and will make the
following adjustments to the time billed. 


Joseph P. Hougnan: The Court will not allow Mr. Hougnan’s time.
     Mr. Hougnan was lead counsel, but also a witness. His decision to
     subcontract the work may have been a wise one given his personal
     involvement in the underlying facts, but it necessitated a complete
     duplication of effort by not one, but two experienced attorneys, thus
     inflating the amount due for attorneys’ fees.
A. Raymond Hamrick, III: The Court will not allow Mr. Hamrick’s time.
     Mr. Hamrick is an excellent attorney and did a good job of handling the
     matter. Nevertheless, his involvement in the matter was not reasonable or
     necessary given the amount at issue in the case and the small value of the
     two items of personal property at issue. The matter was already being
     handled by one experienced attorney with more than 10 years of experience
     who presumably was capable of handling this simple trial and the hearings
     leading up to it. 
Shian V. Brisbois: The Court will allow Ms. Brisbois time. If she is billing clients at
     the rate of $500/hour she is presumptively able to handle a simple trial
     like this one by herself. She seemed completely familiar with the issues
     and documentation such that involving an experienced attorney like Mr.
     Hamrick was wholly unnecessary overkill.  The Court will award the requested amount
     of $39,450 for Ms. Brisbois’ fees. 
     
Kenneth Kotarski: The only time billed by Mr. Kotarski is
     0.7 hour on December 12, 2023 to review and evaluate the scope of work for
     Two Michaels LLC on The Red Door – Conditional Use Permit matter in
     support of the opposition to DiBacco’s motion to disqualify.  The Court will disallow the time billed
     by Mr. Kotarski as it does not appear necessary to have involved him in a
     matter already being handled by Ms. Brisbois. 
Hamrick & Evans, LLP’s anticipated fees: The Court will reduce the anticipated
     fees for the motion (as there is no opposition brief) and the hearing to 1
     hour, or $500.  
Costs: The Court will allow the recovery of costs in the amount of
     $473.56 for filing, court costs, and/or service fees, as well as the
     $5,700 court reporter fees incurred by Hamrick & Evans, LLP. This
     totals $6,173 in costs.  
Total: Total, the Court will award $39,950.00 in attorney’s fees ($0 for
     Mr. Hougnan’s fees + $0 for Mr. Hamrick’s fees + $39,950 for Ms.
     Brisbois’s fees + $0 for Mr. Kotarski’s fees + $500 in anticipated fees
     for Hamrick & Evans, LLP) and $6,173.00 in costs.  

Accordingly, the
motion for attorney’s fees and costs is granted in the amounts of $39,950.00 in
attorney’s fees and $6,173.00 in costs.
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff
Michael Lawrence Kline’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs is granted in the amounts of $39,950.00 in
attorney’s fees and $6,173.00 in costs.
