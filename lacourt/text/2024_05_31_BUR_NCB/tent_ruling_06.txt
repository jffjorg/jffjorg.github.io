[TENTATIVE] order RE:
petition for relief from government tort
  claim timeliness requirements   



            
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
On February 7, 2024, Petitioner Ana
Calderon (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for relief from Government Tort Claim
timeliness requirements against Respondent City of Los Angeles
(“Respondent”).  
Petitioner alleges that on May 31, 2023 at
approximately 8:30 p.m., she sustained injuries as a result of a defective
condition of public property, which consisted of a sidewalk in front of 12229
Chandler Blvd., Valley Village, CA 91607. 
Petitioner alleges that she timely filed an application to Respondent to
present a late claim on December 28, 2023 and that Respondent denied her
application for leave to file a late claim on January 29, 2024, advising her to
file a petition with the court.  
B.    
Petition Hearing on Calendar 
On February 7,
2024, Petitioner filed the petition for relief from the Government Tort Claims
Timeliness Requirement.  On February 15,
2024, Petitioner filed a Notice of Lodging Complaint for Damages for
Consideration on Petition for Relief from Government Tort Claim Timeliness
Requirements.  A copy of the proposed civil
case cover sheet, summons, and complaint are attached.  
On May 16, 2024, Respondent filed an
opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION 
Government Code §
911.2 provides that a claim relating to a cause of action for injury to a
person, such as this, shall be presented not later than six months after the
accrual of the cause of action.  Here,
Petitioner’s causes of action accrued on May 31, 2023.  Accordingly, Petitioner was required to
present a government claim by November 30, 2023.  Petitioner did not present
the claim by this date against Respondent. 
Petitioner states that she retained counsel on July 28, 2023, but her
counsel had set the deadline to file a claim for January 28, 2024 instead of
November 30, 2023.  (Henry John Matusek
II Decl., ¶¶3-4.)  Petitioner’s counsel
discovered the calendaring error in December 2023 and served an application for
leave to file a late claim on December 28, 2023.  (Id., ¶¶5-6.)  
However,
Government Code § 911.4 provides that “[w]hen a claim that is required by
Section 911.2 to be presented not later than six months after accrual is not
presented within that time, a written application may be made to the public
entity for leave to present that claim.” 
(Gov. Code, § 911.4(a).)  Such
application must be presented “within a reasonable time not to exceed one year
from accrual and shall state the reason for the delay in presenting the
claim.”  (Gov. Code, § 911.4(b).)  On December 28, 2023 (within 7 months of the
subject incident), Petitioner served an Application for Leave to Present a Late
Claim on Respondent.  (Pet., Ex. 1.)  On January 19, 2024, Respondent sent letters
denying the application and advising Petitioner to file a petition with the
court.  (Pet., Ex. 2.)  Upon receipt of the denial letter, Petitioner
filed this petition with the Court on February 7, 2024.  Thus, Petitioner’s Application for Late Claim
was timely.  
Petitioner must
then meet the requirements of Government Code § 946.6.  Specifically, Government Code § 946.6(c)
provides that: “The court shall relieve the
petitioner from the requirements of Section 945.4 if the
court finds that the application to the board under Section 911.4 was
made within a reasonable time not to exceed that specified in subdivision
(b) of Section 911.4 and was denied or deemed denied pursuant
to Section 911.6 and that one or more of the following is applicable:

(1)  
The failure to present the claim was
through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect unless the public entity establishes that it would be
prejudiced in the defense of the claim if the court relieves the petitioner
from the
requirements of Section 945.4.
(Gov’t Code, § 946.6(c)(1).)  “[A] petitioner must show more than his or
her failure to discover a fact until too late; the petitioner must establish
that in the use of reasonable diligence he or she failed to discover it.”  (Munoz
v. State of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1784.)
            Petitioner argues that the
miscalendaring of the date of the accrual is a mistake and the result of
excusable neglect requiring relief.  In
support of the motion, Petitioner provides the declaration of counsel Henry
John Matusek II.  Mr. Matusek states that
on July 28, 2023, Petitioner retained his office and she had informed him about
the March 31, 2023 slip-and-fall incident. 
(Matusek Decl., ¶3.)  He states
that he understood that a claim had to be filed with the governmental entity,
but that his firm made a calendaring error where the file noted the date of
retention (July 28, 2023) as the date of accrual (which should have been May
31, 2023), causing the 5- and 6-month calendar memos to be 60 days too
late.  (Id., ¶4.)  He states that he became of this error on
December 28, 2023 and caused an Application for Late Claim to be prepared and
served the same day.  (Id.,
¶¶5-6.)  
            Pursuant to Government Code, §
946.6(c)(1), the Court must evaluate first whether the failure to present the
claim in a timely fashion was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect, and then whether the public entity would be prejudiced in
the defenses of the claim.   Here, the
Court finds that the requirements of the code section have been met and that
Petitioner timely complied with the requirements.  The Court finds that Petitioner’s counsel’s
firm’s failure to properly calendar the date to submit a government claim
amounts to mistake and/or excusable neglect. 

            In opposition, Respondent argues that
it need not establish prejudice because Petitioner has not satisfied her
initial burden.  Respondent also argues
that if Petitioner’s lack of diligence is found to be excusable, then
Respondent would be prejudiced if this motion was granted because it was
deprived of an opportunity to engage in an early investigation, including identification
of potential witnesses and the potential to settle earlier.  However, the prejudice claimed by Respondent
is slight, and lacks specificity. 
Petitioner applied with Respondent to submit a late claim on December
28, 2023, which was less than one month after the final day to submit her claim
timely (November 30, 2023).  Thus,
Respondent was on notice of her claim in December 2023.  The delay in bringing this action was
minimal, such that the Court does not find that this short delay amounts to
prejudice against Respondent in preparing its defense against Petitioner. 
            The Court finds there is substantive
merit to granting this petition.  As
such, the petition is granted.
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
The petition for
relief from Government Tort Claim timeliness requirements is granted.  
Petitioner is ordered
to give notice of this order.
