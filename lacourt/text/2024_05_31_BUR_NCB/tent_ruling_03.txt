 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to compel depositions
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiffs Ladizlao Rivera De La Paz and
Lucila Rivera Munoz aka Lucila Rivera (“Plaintiffs”) allege that on July 7,
2019, they entered into a warranty contract with Defendant Toyota Motor Sales,
U.S.A., Inc. (“Defendant”) regarding a 2019 Toyota Tacoma.  Plaintiffs allege that defects and
nonconformities to the warranty manifested themselves within the applicable
express warranty period, including but not limited to exterior, structural,
transmission, and engine issues.  Plaintiffs
allege they delivered the subject vehicle to an authorized Toyota repair
facility for repair of the nonconformities, but Defendant was unable to conform
the vehicle to the applicable express warranty after a reasonable number of
attempts. 
The complaint, filed March 2, 2023,
alleges causes of action for: (1) violation of the Song Beverly Act – breach of
express warranty; and (2) violation of the Song Beverly Act § 1793.2.     
B.    
Motions on Calendar 
On May 2, 2024,
Defendant filed 2 motions to compel the depositions of: (1) Ladizlao Rivera De
La Paz; and (2) Lucila Rivera Munoz aka Lucila Rivera.  
On May 17, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
opposition briefs. 
On May 23, 2024, Defendant filed reply
briefs. 
DISCUSSION

            Defendant
moves to compel each of Plaintiffs’ depositions so that they are set within 20
days of the Court’s order on the motions.  
            Defendant
argues that it served notices of depositions of Ladizlao
Rivera
De La Paz and Lucila Rivera on June 5, 2023, scheduling the
depositions for July 19, 2023 and July 20, 2023, respectively.  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs did not
properly object to the deposition notices nor notify Defendant that they would
not be attending the depositions. 
Defendant states that Plaintiff and counsel did not attend the
depositions and certificates of non-appearance were taken.  Defendant argues that after the depositions,
defense counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel correspondence in an attempt to
reschedule the depositions.  On December
22, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel proposed dates for Plaintiffs’ depositions in
February 2024, such that Defendant re-noticed Plaintiffs’ depositions for one
of Plaintiffs’ suggested dates, but Plaintiffs objected to the notices of
deposition on the basis that the depositions were unilaterally set.  
In opposition,
Plaintiffs argue that they do not oppose Defendant’s right to depose
Plaintiffs, but they argue that the motions were untimely filed, Defendant did
not meet and confer, and the motions are moot. 
Plaintiffs argue that they offered February 16 and 23, 2024 as agreeable
future deposition dates on December 22, 2023, but that Defendant never
responded to Plaintiffs’ email and instead served notices of deposition on
January 2, 2024, scheduling Ladizlao Rivera De La Paz’s deposition for February 23,
2024 and Lucila Rivera’s deposition for February 24, 2024.  Plaintiffs argue on February 16, 2024, they
objected to the notices on the ground that Plaintiffs were unavailable for the
noticed deposition dates and offered to reschedule the depositions.  Plaintiffs state that on May 14, 2024, they
offered July 19 and 26, 2024 as alternative deposition dates.  They argue that Defendant has not yet
responded to their proposed deposition dates, but that the motion is moot in
light of the offered dates. 
Plaintiffs
offered alternate dates a few days before the opposition brief was filed.  Based on Defendant’s arguments in the reply
briefs, it does not appear that the parties have set a deposition date as of
yet, Defendant seeks to keep the motions on calendar, and still asks for relief
that the depositions be set for within 20 days of the Court’s order. 
As the
depositions of Plaintiffs have not yet gone forward and dates for the
depositions have not yet been set, the Court grants the motions to compel
Plaintiffs’ depositions.  The parties are
ordered to meet and confer regarding the July 19 and 26, 2024 proposed
dates.  If neither of these dates
mutually work for the parties, then the parties are ordered to meet and confer
to find deposition dates within 60 days of this order.  The parties are ordered to meet in person. 
            No
sanctions were requested.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Defendant Toyota Motor Sales,
U.S.A., Inc.’s motions to compel the depositions of
Plaintiffs
Ladizlao Rivera De La Paz and Lucila Rivera Munoz aka Lucila Rivera are
granted.  The
parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding the July 19 and 26, 2024
proposed dates.  If neither of these
dates mutually work for the parties, then the parties are ordered to meet and
confer to find mutually agreeable deposition dates.  If the parties are unable to agree upon a
date, Defendant may notice Plaintiffs’ depositions on a date within 60 days of
this order. 
Defendant shall give notice of
this order.
