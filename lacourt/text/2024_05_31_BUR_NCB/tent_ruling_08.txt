[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion for preliminary injunction 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
            Plaintiffs Michelle Hu (“Hu”), Los
Angeles City Plaza, LP (“LACP”), and LA Valley Garden Plaza LP (“LAVGP”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) allege that they are the current or prior owners of the
properties located at 1598 Long Beach Boulevard, Long Beach, CA 90813 (“Long
Beach Property”), 9933 Valley Boulevard, El Monte, California 91731 (“El Monte
Property”), and 1125 S. 1st Avenue, Arcadia, California 91006
(“Arcadia Property”).  Plaintiffs allege
that the Arcadia Property is Hu’s principal residence.  
Plaintiffs allege that on November 11,
2021, Plaintiffs and Defendant The Evergreen Advantage, LLC (“Evergreen”)
entered into a secured mortgage transaction (construction loan) for
$17,500,000, which carried a 9% per annum interest rate and contained a
maturity date of December 1, 2022, secured by the 3 properties.  Plaintiffs allege that Evergreen is the
lender under the Promissory Note Secured by Deed of Trust dated November 11,
2021 (“Note”), secured by the certain Deed of Trust, Assignment of Rents, Security
Agreement and Fixture Filing dated November 11, 2021 and recorded on November
29, 2021; and that Evergreen is the beneficiary under the DOT.  On November 8, 2022, Plaintiffs and Evergreen
entered into a Modification and Extension Agreement (“Extension Agreement”),
which had a principal balance of $11,080,000, 10.5% per annum interest rate,
required interest payments of $96,950 per month beginning January 1, 2023, and
extended the maturity date to June 1, 2023. 

Plaintiffs allege they were ultimately unable
to make the payment beginning June 2023. 
On July 3, 2023, Evergreen caused a Notice of Default (“NOD”) to be
recorded against each property, for an estimated default of
$11,359,476.46.  On March 1, 2024,
Evergreen caused a Notice of Trustee’s Sale (“NOTS”) to be recorded for the
properties, pursuant to which it sought $13,949,223.81 (estimated) through the
foreclosure of the properties.  Plaintiffs
allege that Evergreen caused the properties to be sold at foreclosure
sale.  
             The complaint, filed April 24, 2024, alleges
causes of action for: (1) violation of California Usury Law; (2) recovery of
usury interest; (3) declaratory relief; (4) violation of Civil Code, §
2924(c)-(d); and (5) unfair business practices – violation of Business &
Professions Code, § 17200 et seq. 

B.    
Motion on Calendar
On May 7, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an ex
parte application for temporary restraining order (“TRO”) to restrain the
recording of a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale for the property located at 1125 S. 1st
Avenue, Arcadia, CA 91006.  
On May 7, 2024, Defendant Evergreen filed
an opposition to the application for TRO. 

On May 8, 2024, the ex parte application
came for hearing.  The Court granted the
ex parte application, and entered the following TRO: “Pending hearing on the below Order to Show
Cause, Defendants, their employees, agents and/or any other person or entity
acting with them or on their behalf are restrained and enjoined from recording
of a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale for the property located at 1125 S. 1st Avenue,
Arcadia, California 91006.”  (5/8/24
Order at p.1.)  The Court set an OSC re
why a preliminary injunction should not be issued for May 31, 2024 and ordered
Plaintiffs to serve the ex parte papers as the moving papers by May 10, 2024, Defendants
to serve the opposition papers by May 24, 2024, and ordered Plaintiffs to file
the reply papers by May 29, 2024.  
On May 23, 2024, Evergreen filed an opposition brief.  The Court will consider the May 23, 2024 as
Evergreen’s operative opposition papers. 

REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            With the ex parte papers, Plaintiffs request judicial notice of Exhibits:
(A) a copy of the Note; (B) copy of the ed of Trust, Assignment of Rents, Security
Agreement and Fixture Filing securing the Note; (C) a copy of the Extension Agreement which
modified the Note; (D) a copy of the NOD recorded on July 3, 2023; (E) a copy
of the NOTS recorded on March 1, 2024.  Plaintiffs
also seek judicial notice of Fact 1: “On October 25, 2022, the primary discount
rate established by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco on Reserve
Balances was 3.25%,” which is based on the Federal Reserve’s official
website.  The request is granted as to Exhibits
A-E.  (Fontenot
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264-267, disapproved on other grounds.)  The
request is granted as to Fact 1.  (Evid.
Code, § 452(h).) 
With the
opposition papers, Evergreen requests judicial notice of Exhibit A, the license
information of Secured Capital Lending, Inc. taken from records of the
Department of Real estate.  The request
is granted.  (Evid. Code §
452(c); Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87
Cal.App.4th 513, 518.)  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiffs move for
a preliminary injunction against Evergreen, arguing that Evergreen wrongfully
foreclose on Plaintiffs’ property pursuant to a usurious loan.  Plaintiffs move to invalidate the foreclosure
sale and seek to restrain Evergreen from completing the foreclosure sale of
Hu’s home, the Arcadia Property.    
A.   
Probability of Success on the Merits 
Plaintiffs argue that they are able to
establish the probability of success on the merits of each of their causes of
action in the complaint.  
“The essential elements of
usury are: (1) The transaction must be a loan or forbearance; (2) the interest
to be paid must exceed the statutory maximum; (3) the loan and interest must be
absolutely repayable by the borrower; and (4) the lender must have a willful
intent to enter into a usurious transaction.” 
(Korchemny
v. Piterman
(2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1043.)  “The element of intent is
narrow. ‘[T]he intent sufficient to support the judgment [of usury] does not
require a conscious attempt, with knowledge of the law, to evade it. The
conscious and voluntary taking of more than the legal rate of interest
constitutes usury and the only intent necessary on the part of the lender is to
take the amount of interest which he receives; if that amount is more than the
law allows, the offense is complete.’”  (Id.)   
“California Constitution, article XV,
section 1 limits the interest rate for a ‘loan or forbearance’ of money not
primarily for personal, family or household purposes, to the higher of: (1) 10
percent per annum or (2) 5 percent plus the rate of interest prevailing on the
25th day of the month preceding the earlier of the date of the extension of the
contract to make the loan or forbearance or the date of making the loan or
forbearance, established by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco on
advances to member banks under sections 13 and 13(1) of the Federal Reserve
Act. [Citation.]”  (Id. at 1042.)  Civil Code, § 1916.1 states:
The restrictions
upon rates of interest contained in Section 1 of Article XV of the California
Constitution shall not apply to any loan or forbearance made or arranged by any
person licensed as a real estate broker by the State of California, and secured,
directly or collaterally, in whole or in part by liens on real property. For purposes of this section, a loan or
forbearance is arranged by a person licensed as a real estate broker when the
broker (1) acts for compensation or in expectation of compensation for
soliciting, negotiating, or arranging the loan for another, (2) acts for
compensation or in expectation of compensation for selling, buying, leasing,
exchanging, or negotiating the sale, purchase, lease, or exchange of real
property or a business for another and (A) arranges a loan to pay all or any
portion of the purchase price of, or of an improvement to, that property or
business or (B) arranges a forbearance, extension, or refinancing of any loan
in connection with that sale, purchase, lease, exchange of, or an improvement
to, real property or a business, or (3) arranges or negotiates for another a
forbearance, extension, or refinancing of any loan secured by real property in
connection with a past transaction in which the broker had acted for compensation
or in expectation of compensation for selling, buying, leasing, exchanging, or
negotiating the sale, purchase, lease, or exchange of real property or a
business. The term “made or arranged” includes any loan made
by a person licensed as a real estate broker as a principal or as an agent for
others, and whether or not the person is acting within the course and scope of
such license.
(Civ. Code, §
1916.1.)  “A forbearance is an agreement not
to insist upon payment at the date of maturity of a debt, or the giving of
further time to pay.” (Buck v. Dahlgren (1972) 23
Cal.App.3d 779, 785.)  
            Plaintiffs argue that the parties
entered into a loan extension that, unbeknownst to Plaintiffs, contained a
usurious interest rate.  They argue that
the maximum interest rate that could be applied was 10%, but the Extension
Agreement adjusted the interest rate to 10.5%. 
(See Pl.’s RJN, Ex. C [Extension Agreement, § 4.2].)  Plaintiffs argue that no broker was involved
in the negotiation, procurement, or drafting of the Extension Agreement and
that all negotiations were between Plaintiffs and Evergreen, such that no
broker exemption applies.  (Mot. at
p.5.)  Ms. Hu states in her declaration
that the Extension Agreement was not arranged through a broker.  (Hu Decl., ¶7.)  Plaintiffs argue that due to the usurious
rate, Evergreen had no right to foreclose on the three properties.  
In opposition,
Evergreen argues that the Extension Agreement amounted to a forbearance and
that this forbearance was arranged by Plaintiffs and Evergreen through Secured
Capital Lending, Inc. (“SCL”), who was and is still licensed by the Department
of Real Estate.  (Def.’s RJN, Ex. A.) 
Evergreen provides
the declaration of Dan Zuckerman, President for Evergreen and The Evergreen Advantage
Management, Inc. (“TEAM”).  Mr. Zuckerman
states that Evergreen’s business records reflect that on November 11, 2021, Evergreen
originated a $17,500,000 loan (“Subject Loan Transaction”) in favor of
Plaintiffs as evidenced by the Note.  (Zuckerman
Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1 [Note].)  He states that
licensed broker, SCL (Department of Real Estate License No. 0215649) arranged
the Subject Loan Transaction for Plaintiffs and Evergreen in exchange for a
commission.  (Id., ¶5, Ex. 2
[Borrower Statement].)[1]  He states that Evergreen’s documents reflect
that Plaintiffs executed a DOT recorded against each of the properties.  (Id., ¶6, Ex. 3 [DOT].)  He states that in November 2022, the parties
entered the Extension Agreement, which modified the terms of the loan; his
records reflect that the Extension Agreement was arranged by both TEAM and the
broker of the original Subject Loan Transaction, SCL.  (Id., ¶¶7-8, Ex. 4 [Extension
Agreement].)  His TEAM records reflect
that SCL received additional compensation for arranging the Extension
Agreement.  (Id., ¶9, Ex. 5 [November
2022 emails], Ex. 6 [check].)  Mr.
Zuckerman states that TEAM and Evergreen each held a California Finance Lender
license no. 60DBO-45545.  (Id.,
¶¶10-11.)   
Evergreen also
provides the declaration of Sarkis “Sam” Chivitchian, who is the CEO and Fund
Manager for SCL.  He states that in
November 2022, SCL arranged the Extension Agreement.  (Chivitchian Decl., ¶12.)  He states that in the course of arranging the
Extension Agreement, SCL communicated directly with Ms. Hu, her referring
broker, and her assistant/employee.  (Id.,
¶¶13-14.)  He states that in
consideration for SCL’s role in arranging the Extension Agreement, SCL received
compensation in the amount of $27,700.  (Id.,
¶15.)  
In November 2022, Jesse
Brunner of TEAM and Mr. Chivitchian exchanged emails regarding the extension
agreement and Mr. Brunner stated that he would send out Mr. Chivitchian’s money
soon.  (Zuckerman Decl., Ex. 5.)  Exhibit 6 of Mr. Zuckerman’s declaration
includes a check for the amount of $27,700 with a posted date of December 1,
2022 made out by TEAM to SCL.  (Zuckerman
Decl., Ex. 6.)  
Here, based on the
parties’ arguments presented in their respective papers, the probability of
success on the merits of the usury causes of action depend on whether the
broker exemption applies.  Plaintiffs
argue that the 10.5% interest rate in the Extension Agreement was usurious and
no broker was involved in the Extension Agreement’s creation, whereas Evergreen
argues that a broker was used such that the broker exemption applies.  At most, the only evidence Plaintiffs have
provided is Ms. Hu’s declaration that no broker was used for the Extension
Agreement.  However, in opposition,
Evergreen has presented Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Chivitchian’s declarations that
show that SCL was used as a broker not only in the underlying initial loan
agreement, but in the Extension Agreement as well.  According to the judicially noticeable
documents, SCL is licensed by the Department of Real Estate in the State of
California.  (Def.’s RJN, Ex. A.)  Mr. Chivitchian states that he communicated
directly with Ms. Hu and that SCL was paid for its work on the Extension
Agreement.  (Chivitchian Decl., ¶15; Zuckerman
Decl., Ex. 6.)  Plaintiff has not
provided contrary evidence showing that SCL was not involved in the Extension
Agreement transaction as the Court is not in receipt of a reply brief. 
With respect to
the other causes of action in the complaint, the remaining causes of action do
not provide sufficient grounds to enter a preliminary injunction.  In addition, as the remaining causes of
action rely on the same argument regarding the purported usurious interest rate
in the Extension Agreement, Plaintiffs have not established the probability of
success on the merits of these causes of action.  For example, the 3rd cause of
action declaratory relief seeks a judicial determination regarding whether the
payments made by Plaintiffs should be properly credited as principal in the
event the Extension Agreement’s terms are usurious.  (Compl., ¶¶36-38.)  In the 4th cause of action for
violation of Civil Code, § 2924(c)-(d), Plaintiffs allege that the loan should
be reinstated because Evergreen violated the statute by demanding a total of
$11,359,476 based on a usurious interest rate. 
(Id., ¶¶42-46.)  The 5th
cause of action for unfair competition is reliant on the prior causes of action
and usury laws.  (Id.,
¶¶50-52.)  
Based on the
papers presented, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not established the
probability of success on the merits of their claims at this stage of the
proceedings.  As such, the motion for
preliminary injunction is denied.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiffs’ motion
for preliminary injunction is denied.  
Plaintiffs shall
provide notice of this order.
