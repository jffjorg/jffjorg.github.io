And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses two main issues. First, the Defendant challenges the timeliness of the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion to compel arbitration, citing the title of the motion as a "petition" and relying on Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.6. However, the Judge finds that this is not a petition governed by that section, as California Rules of Court section 3.1103 governs law and motion proceedings, and the proceeding was commenced by the filing of a complaint. The Judge rules that the opposition is timely.

Second, the parties dispute whether the Federal Arbitration Act applies, but the Judge finds that this determination is not dispositive in this case. Even if California law applies, the Judge would grant the motion to compel arbitration.
