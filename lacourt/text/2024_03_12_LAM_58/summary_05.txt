And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this medical malpractice case. The plaintiff, Ed Michaels, alleges that he was injured by the defendants, California Rehabilitation Institute, LLC and Alexandra Strouss, M.S., on March 29, 2022, while receiving treatment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The defendants argue that they did not provide any care to the plaintiff on the day of the alleged injury and therefore cannot be held liable.

The judge has concluded that the defendants have met their burden of showing that there is no triable issue of material fact and that the plaintiff cannot establish the essential element of a breach of duty of care. The plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact in dispute, and therefore the motion for summary judgment is granted.

The defendants are ordered to prepare, serve, and lodge a proposed judgment on or before March 27, 2024.
