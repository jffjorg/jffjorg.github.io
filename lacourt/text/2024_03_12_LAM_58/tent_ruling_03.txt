[1]           Defendant
challenges the timeliness of Plaintiff’s opposition based on its titling its motion
a “petition to compel arbitration.” However, simply titling the document does
not convert it into a petition governed by Code of Civil Procedure section
1290.6. Rather, California Rules of Court section 3.1103 states that a petition
to compel arbitration is a law and motion proceeding. (Cal. Rule of Court, Rule
3.1103(a)(2); See Brookwood v. Bank of America (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th
1667, 1670, [petition to compel arbitration is determined in manner of motion
where factual issues are submitted on affidavits or declarations, or on oral
testimony in court's discretion].) Further, Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b), provides special filing and service timing requirements
for other law and motion issues identified in California Rules of Court section
3.1103 – such as a writ of attachment — but provides no special timing
requirements for a “petition to compel arbitration.” While Defendant places emphasis
of on the timing of a response required to the filing of petition pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.6, Defendant ignores Code of Civil
Procedure section 1290, which states that proceedings under this title are governed
when a proceeding is “commenced by filing a petition.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.) Here, the
proceeding was commenced by the filing of a complaint. Thus, Defendant’s reliance
on the fact that it titled its motion a “petition” is not well taken. The
opposition is timely. 


[2]             While
the parties dispute whether the Federal Arbitration Act applies, they do not
explain how that determination is dispositive here. Even if California law
applies the motion to compel arbitration would be granted.
