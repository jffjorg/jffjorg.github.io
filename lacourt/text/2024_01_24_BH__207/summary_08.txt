Significant Statements:
- "It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint." (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.)
- "The rule is that if one consideration of all the facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged." (Gressley v. Williams)
- "Equitable tolling and equitable estoppel are distinct doctrines. Tolling, strictly speaking, is concerned with the point at which the limitations period begins to run and with the circumstances in which the running of the limitations period may be suspended. Equitable estoppel, however, comes into play only after the limitations period has run and addresses the circumstances in which a party will be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense to an admittedly untimely action because his conduct has induced another into forbearing suit within the applicable limitations period." (Lantzy v. Centex Homes)
- "Whenever a party has, by his own statement or conduct, intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief, he is not, in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct, permitted to contradict it." (Evidence Code section 623)

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, 11649 Mayfield, LLC, to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC). The defendant demurred to both causes of action alleged in the FAC, alleging that they failed to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e). The plaintiff opposes the demurrer.

The judge found that the defendant's demurrer is based on the argument that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred, as the incident occurred on June 16, 2021, and the original Complaint was not filed until July 27, 2023. The judge noted that the statute of limitations for negligence and premises liability actions is two years, and therefore, the claims appear to be time-barred on their face.

However, the judge also found that the plaintiff argues that the defendant should be equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense, citing communications between the parties indicating that the defendant was willing to work informally to accommodate the plaintiff's concerns. The judge noted that the issue of equitable estoppel is a factual question that must be determined by the trier of fact.

Ultimately, the judge overruled the defendant's demurrer and ordered the defendant to file an answer to the FAC on or before February 7, 2024. The judge also ordered the defendant to provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
