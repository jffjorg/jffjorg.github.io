And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Case Summary**

The case involves a dispute between plaintiff Ben L. Gary Jr. and defendant Piaggio Group Americas, Inc. over alleged engine oil leak defects in an Aprilia motorcycle. The plaintiff alleges damages of $22,100.16 and seeks to settle the case for $2,194.00. The defendant moves for a determination of good faith settlement, which is unopposed.

**Analysis**

The judge applies the Tech-Bilt factors to determine whether the settlement was made in good faith. The factors include: (1) a rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settling defendant's proportionate liability; (2) the amount paid in settlement; (3) the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs; (4) a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than they would if they were found liable after trial; (5) the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants; and (6) the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of the non-settling defendants.

**Conclusion**

The judge grants the defendant's motion for a determination of good faith settlement, finding that the settlement amount is "within the ballpark" of potential liability. The judge notes that there is no evidence of bad faith or collusion, and that the settlement resolves the entire case.
