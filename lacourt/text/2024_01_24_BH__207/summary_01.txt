```

The judge's tentative ruling grants Rapid Duct Testing and Air Balancing, Inc.'s unopposed motion for a determination of good faith settlement, finding that the proposed settlement amount of $50,000 is within the ballpark of Rapid's fair share of liability. The court concludes that Rapid's settlement is reasonable in light of its limited role in the construction project, its strong defenses, and the fact that the parties are settling their claims instead of litigating them through trial.
