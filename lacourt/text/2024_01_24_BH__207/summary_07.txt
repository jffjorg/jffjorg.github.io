And here is the English text summary:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge is considering a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Defendant. The Judge notes that a party has the burden of showing how the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the legal effect of the complaint. The Judge also emphasizes that a party must not only state the legal basis for the amendment, but also provide factual allegations sufficient to state a cause of action or claim. The Judge points out that simply stating that the plaintiff would like to amend the complaint is insufficient to meet this burden. In this case, the Plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, and therefore the Judge finds that the Defendant has not met his burden. The Judge is citing several court cases to support this ruling, including The Inland Oversight Committee v City of San Bernardino, PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v Hulven Int'l, Inc., Major Clients Agency v Diemer, and Graham v Bank of America.
