[1] A party has
the burden of showing in what manner the complaint could be amended and how the
amendment would change the legal effect of the complaint, i.e., state a cause
of action.  (See The Inland Oversight
Committee v City of San Bernardino (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 771, 779; PGA
West Residential Assn., Inc. v Hulven Int'l, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th
156, 189.)  A party must not only state
the legal basis for the amendment, but also the factual allegations sufficient
to state a cause of action or claim. 
(See PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v Hulven Int'l, Inc.,
supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 189.) 
Moreover, a party does not meet his or her burden by merely stating in
the opposition to a demurrer or motion to strike that “if the Court finds the
operative complaint deficient, plaintiff respectfully requests leave to
amend.”  (See Major Clients Agency v
Diemer (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133; Graham v Bank of America
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 618 [asserting an abstract right to amend does not
satisfy the burden].)  Here, by failing to oppose the motion, the
Court finds that Defendant has not met his burden.
