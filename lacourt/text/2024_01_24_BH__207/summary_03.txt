And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Adam D. H. Grant, counsel for plaintiff Veera Mahajan, to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown of attorney-client communication. The motion is substantively proper as it is filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) instead of a consent brought under section 284(1). The proof of service indicates that all parties and client were served electronically, in compliance with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The judge orders counsel to serve the signed order on all parties who have appeared in the action, within 10 days of the date of the order, and file a proof of service of such. Counsel will remain the attorney of record for plaintiff until counsel files the requisite proof of service.
