Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer of the defendants is sustained as to the Government Claims Act compliance and exhaustion of administrative remedies. The government claim form is defective, but the plaintiff has a right to bring the claim. The discovery rule tolled the statute of limitations, but the plaintiff did not plead that a reasonable investigation would not have revealed a factual basis to support the cause of action within the applicable statute of limitations period. The plaintiff's punitive damages claim is not assignable, and the motion to strike is granted.
