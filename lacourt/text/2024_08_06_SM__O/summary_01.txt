And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for attorney's fees filed by Defendants Sean Besser and Samantha Besser. The Defendants are the prevailing party in the case and are entitled to attorney's fees and costs pursuant to the lease agreement between the parties. The Judge reduces the requested hourly rate from $889 to $475 per hour, finding that this is a reasonable rate based on the experience of the defense counsel and the nature of the work performed. The Judge calculates the reasonable attorney's fees and costs to be $37,810, which is the result of multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by the reasonable hourly rate. The Judge orders Plaintiff Debbie Paperman to pay $37,810 in attorney's fees and costs to the Defendants.
