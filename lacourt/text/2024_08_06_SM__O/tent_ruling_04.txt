24SMCV01697 Naeem Motion for Leave to File SAC
 
Plaintiff Tohid Naeem's Motion for Leave to Second Amended
Complaint pursuant to CCP § 473(a)(1) is GRANTED. Plaintiff filed the motion on
6-10-24, and as of 8-3-24 no opposition has been filed. Plaintiff declares the
amendment is necessary to correct errors and "provide a more detailed and
accurate statement" of Plaintiff's claims. (Naeem Decl., ¶¶ 3,
4.) Plaintiff attached a copy of the proposed SAC to the motion pursuant to
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. No trial date is set so the SAC filing will
not prejudice the Defendant. The Court orders Plaintiff to file the proposed
SAC with the Court immediately after the hearing.

be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or
striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a
party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the
time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after
notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment
to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms
allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this code."
