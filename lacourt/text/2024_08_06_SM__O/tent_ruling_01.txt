TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants
Sean Besser and Samantha Besser’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED.
Defendants are the prevailing party and are entitled to attorney’s fees and
costs pursuant to the parties lease agreement. The Court has reduced the
Defendants requested rate of $889/hr. to the reasonable rate of $475/hr. Thus,
the Court orders Plaintiff Debbie Paperman to pay $37,810 (79.6 hrs @ $475/hr.)
in attorney’s fees and costs to Defendants Sean Besser and Samantha Besser
pursuant to CCP § 1717.  Defendants are
to submit the proposed amended judgment.
 
REASONING
            “Except as
attorney's fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode
of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,
express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are
entitled to their costs, as hereinafter provided.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1021.) “In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides
that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract,
shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then
the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether
he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code, § 1717.)
 
            Courts can use
the Lodestar Method to calculate fee awards, and the Laffey Matrix to show the reasonable
market rate for attorneys. (See Chacon v. Litke (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th
1234, 1259 [“The court determined the lodestar method was appropriate for
calculating fees and it was correct in doing so”]; Syers Properties III,
Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 703 [“the trial court did not
abuse its discretion in its award of attorney fees [based on the Laffey Matrix]
to defendants in this case”.) However, Courts do not have to “follow the Laffey
Matrix nor to adopt the rate defense counsel opined was the “market rate” for
services of this type,” and can determine “that the actual rate
charged was the reasonable rate for the type of services rendered. (Syers
Properties III, Inc, supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at p. 702.) 


            “Under the
lodestar method, attorney fees are calculated by first multiplying the number
of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate of compensation.”
(Ibid.) “The reasonable market value of the attorney's services is the
measure of a reasonable hourly rate. [Citations.] This standard applies
regardless of whether the attorneys claiming fees charge nothing for their
services, charge at below-market or discounted rates, represent the client on a
straight contingent fee basis, or are in-house counsel.” (Id., at p. 1260.)
 
            It is
undisputed that Defendants Sean Besser and Samantha Besser (“Defendants”) are
the prevailing party on a claim filed by Plaintiff Debbie Paperman (“Paperman”)
arising out of the parties lease agreement. (See 2-26-24 Judgement of Dismissal;
see also Motion, Ex. A “Lease Agreement”.)  Pursuant to the parties lease agreement, the “landlord
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs” when the Landlord “finds
it necessary to enforce the provisions of this agreement against the tenant.”
(Lease Agreement, ¶ 9.) Paperman does not argue this language within the lease
agreement does not entitle Defendants to attorney’s fees, and the language in
the contract is broad, thus the Court finds this clause entitles Defendants to
attorney’s fees as the prevailing party. 
 
            Defendants Counsel,
Brian Condon (“Condon”), declares he over 36 years of “experience in complex business
litigation, real estate, landlord-tenant, torts, false claims, collections, and
anti-fraud litigation,” and generally charges between “$375 and $475 per hour
but can be as much as $650,” on complicated matters. (Condon Decl., ¶ 12.)
Condon requests a reasonable rate of $889/hr. pursuant to the Lodestar Rate and
Laffey Matrix due to Condon experience and the nature of the litigation. (Id.,
¶ 14.) Condon requests a total of $70,764.40 based on 79.6 hours of work at
$889.00 per hour. (Id., ¶¶ 11, 14.) Condon provides itemized bills
detailing the exact nature of the work plus the hours associated with that work,
and whether Condon or a paralegal conducted the work. (Id., ¶ 9; Ex. B.)
The itemized bills show that Condon billed for 75.4 hours of work at hourly
rates between $225/hr. and $425/hr. (Ibid.) Condon argues that reviewing the
opposition and writing the reply will likely add 4.5 hours, creating a total of
79.6 [which should total 79.9 hours] but the Court will honor the requested
amount of 79.6 hours. (See id., ¶ 10.)
 
            The Court
finds the itemized hours and billing statements to be reasonable, and thus the
total of 79.6 hours is a reasonable hourly figure. Paperman argues the fees are
unreasonable in light of the Condon’s billed hourly rate provided in the
motion, and the Court agrees. (See generally Oppo.) Courts have lowered the
requested fee when the requested fee is more than double the actual hourly
billed rate. (See El Escorial Owners' Ass'n. v. DLC Plastering,
Inc. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1365–1367, 65 Cal.Rptr.3d
524 [affirming the trial court's reduction of a fee request where, among
other things, the trial court found the rates sought were twice the rates
billed to the insurance company].)  The Court finds a reasonable rate to
be the $475/hr. rate as declared by Condon to be a general hourly charge when
not involved in complex anti-fraud litigation or appeals, and adjusts the
reasonable rate as such. The merits of this case were not complex.  Nor was the case resolved on the merits of
Plaintiffs’ claims.   Indeed, the Defendants prevailed because of Plaintiff’s
failure to timely effect service of the summons and complaint on the defendant.
(See Judgement of Dismissal filed 2-26-2024.) 
The only complicating aspect of the case was the Plaintiff’s counsel’s machinations
to obtain the clerks entry of default the default of defendant based on
defective proofs of service of the summons and complaint, and thereafter obtain
an improper default judgment after the entry of default had already been set aside.
(See Minute orders of 10-26-2024, 1-19-2023 and 12/6/2021)  It took the efforts of three judges to unravel
Plaintiff errors in obtaining the entry of default and ultimately a default
judgment. Only after that judgment was vacated, were the defendants then able
to pursue the relatively straight forward motion to quash  that ultimately led to defendants successful motion
to quash service and ultimate dismissal because of Plaintiff’s failure to serve
the summons and complaint within three years of the filing of the complaint. (CCP§583.210,
583.250.)  After considering the experience
of defendants’ counsel, and the nature and extent of the work completed in this
case, together with this Court’s knowledge of the reasonable market rates charged
in the community for comparable work, the finds the reasonable hourly rate for
the work performed by defendant’s attorney is $475 per hour.  The Court finds the adjusted loadstar attorney’s
fee of $37,810 is reasonable (79.6 hrs @ $475/hr.).  Thus, the Court orders Paperman to pay $37,810
in attorney’s fees and costs to Defendants pursuant to CCP § 1717.
