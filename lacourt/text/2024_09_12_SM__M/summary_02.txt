And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Plaintiff Daniela Cohen's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories set one, filed by Defendant Richard Frye and Responding Party Natalie Keshishian. The court has also struck the Abstracts of Judgment filed on May 8, 2024, and the memorandum of costs filed May 15, 2024, as a sanction for discovery abuse. The court has imposed sanctions against Mr. Moghadam, counsel for Responding Parties, in the amount of $9,975.00.

The court has found that the Responding Parties made reasonable attempts to pay the sanctions, despite the mistakes made by their insurer, Allstate. The court has also found that the Plaintiff's post-judgment discovery was unwarranted, oppressive, and unduly burdensome, and was intended to harass Defendant and counsel of record.

The court has granted a protective order, allowing Responding Parties to not respond to Plaintiff's May 8, 2024, discovery or any further discovery regarding collection of the March 2024 discovery sanctions. The court has also vacated the hearing dates on the following future motions.

The court's tentative ruling is based on the following facts and laws:

* The Responding Parties failed to pay sanctions on time, but made reasonable attempts to pay sanctions.
* The Plaintiff issued post-judgment discovery despite forthcoming payment.
* The Plaintiff refused to withdraw discovery or accept checks.
* The CCP and California Rules of Court were cited in the ruling.

The court's ruling is intended to punish the Plaintiff's abuse of the discovery process and to protect against future abuse.
