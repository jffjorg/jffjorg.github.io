ANALYSIS
 
Defendant Allstar Financial
Services, Inc. moves for an order bifurcating and/or severing the trial of this
action so that the Court determines Plaintiff Sunrise Projects, LLC’s standing
to sue prior to any issues as to liability, specifically whether Plaintiff
qualifies as an eligible bidder under Civil Code section 2924m(c)(3). 
 
The 2021 version of Civil Code
section 2924m(c)(2) states: “A trustee’s sale of property under a power of sale
contained in a deed of trust or mortgage on real property containing one to
four residential units… shall not be deemed final until… Fifteen days after the
trustee’s sale unless at least one eligible tenant buyer or eligible bidder
submits to the trustee either a bid… or a nonbinding written notice of intent
to place such a bid. The bid or written notice of intent to place a bid shall
be sent to the trustee by certified mail, overnight delivery, or other method
that allows for confirmation of the delivery date and shall be received by the
trustee no later than 15 days after the trustee’s sale.” (Emphasis added.)
Relevant here, an “eligible bidder” includes a “limited liability company in
which the managing member is an eligible nonprofit corporation based in
California whose primary activity is the development and preservation of
affordable rental housing”. (§2924m(c)(3)(F).) 
 
The Court sees no purpose in
bifurcating this issue. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s “primary activity” is
not developing or preserving affordable housing. First, Defendant presents no
evidence of this fact in support of this motion. (See Liu Decl., Ex. 1.)  In any event, there is little function in
presenting evidence of Plaintiff’s eligibility first as part of a bifurcated
proceeding. 
 
Plaintiff seeks to quiet title to real
property commonly known as 2478 Glyndon Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90291
(the Property). According to the complaint, on December 28, 2020, Allstar
executed a Notice of Trustee's Sale pursuant to a default under a deed of trust
concerning the Property, which was recorded on December 31, 2020. (¶ 15.) The
Trustee's Sale date was noticed for January 21, 2021. (Id.) The trustee’s sale
actually occurred on March 4, 2021. (¶ 16.) Plaintiff alleges that Allstar
executed a Trustee's Deed Upon Sale on March 5, and recorded the same on March
9, 2021. (¶ 17.) On March 17,2021 Plaintiff delivered to Allstar a notice of
its intent to bid pursuant to section 2924m(c)(2). (¶ 18.) On March 22, 2021,
Allstar executed a Notice of Rescission of Trustee's Deed Upon Sale. (¶ 19, Ex.
5.) On the same day, Allstar substituted Defendant Geraci Law Firm as the new
Trustee of the DOT, which was recorded on April 2. (¶20.) On March 31, 2021,
Geraci sent a new Notice of Trustee’s Sale, with a trustee’s sale set for April
28, 2021. (¶ 21, Ex. 7.) On April 15, 2021, Plaintiff tendered a certified
check for $365,000.00, along with bidding instructions and an affidavit of
Eligible Bidder (Civ. Code § 2924m). (¶ 22, Ex. 8.) Plaintiff reasons that
since it validly bid on the Property as an eligible bidder under section 2924m,
the Trustee’s March 5, 2021, deed upon sale is invalid, any further sale would
be invalid, and Plaintiff owns the Property.
 
            Given these
allegations, Plaintiff will have to prove all of the components of section 2924
as part of their quiet title cause of action, including its status as an
eligible bidder. Requiring Plaintiff to prove its “eligible bidder” status before
other factors concerning liability risks calling witnesses multiple times and
presenting duplicative evidence. On the other hand, Defendant presents little
practical reason to specially try this issue first. Defendant had the
opportunity to adjudicate this issue prior to trial. (See Huff v. Securitas
Security Services USA, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal. App. 5th 746, 761 [“Procedural
mechanisms such as summary adjudication remain available to weed out meritless claims
before trial.”].) Furthermore, if Plaintiff fails to prove its eligibility by
the close of its case, then Defendant may make an appropriate motion at the
time.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
