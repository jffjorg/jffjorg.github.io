And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to bifurcate the trial in the case of Sunrise Projects LLC v. Allstar Financial Services Inc., et al. The motion was made by Allstar Financial Services Inc. to bifurcate the trial and determine whether Sunrise Projects LLC is an eligible bidder under Civil Code section 2924m(c)(3) before proceeding with other issues. The judge has denied the motion, finding that there is no purpose in bifurcating this issue and that requiring Plaintiff to prove its eligibility as an eligible bidder before other factors concerning liability would only lead to duplicative evidence and unnecessary repeated testimony. The judge has also noted that Defendant had the opportunity to adjudicate this issue prior to trial and that if Plaintiff fails to prove its eligibility, Defendant may make an appropriate motion at the time.
