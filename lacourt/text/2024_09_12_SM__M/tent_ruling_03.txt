A petition to confirm an award shall be served and filed
not later than four years after the date of service of a signed copy of the
award on the petitioner. (CCP §1288.)  No
petition may be served and filed until at least 10 days after service of the
signed copy of the award upon petitioner. (CCP §1288.4.)  If the agreement sets forth a method of
service for the petition, that method holds. (CCP §1290.4(a).) If the
arbitration agreement does not set forth a method, service shall be made in the
manner provided by law for service of summons in an action if the party has not
appeared. (CCP § 1290.4(b).) If the party upon whom the petition is to be made
has appeared, service can be made by noticed motion. (CCP § 1290.4(c).) Service
shall be made in the manner provided in section 1010 et seq. if the person on
whom service is to be made has previously been served in accordance with
section 1290.4(b). (Id.)
 
Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been
made may petition the court for confirmation of the award. (CCP, § 1285.) Upon
service and filing of a petition to confirm arbitration award, the court shall
confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or
dismisses the proceeding. (Id., § 1286.) The contents of a petition to confirm
an arbitration award shall set forth the substance of or have attached a copy
of the agreement to arbitrate, the names of the arbitrators, and shall set
forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1285.4.) Where the petition is served but no response is served and filed, the
allegations in the petition are deemed admitted.  (CCP § 1290; Taheri Law Group, A.P.C. v.
Sorokurs (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 956, 962.)
