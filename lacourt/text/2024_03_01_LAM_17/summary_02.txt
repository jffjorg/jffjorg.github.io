And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion by Chabad of Ojai Valley (COV) to vacate the judgment and dismiss the case. COV argues that the judgment is void because it failed to join an indispensable party, namely COV, as a beneficiary of the Paris Family Trust. The Court finds that COV's motion must be denied. COV was a beneficiary of the trust and received notice of the trust becoming irrevocable, but failed to respond to the Probate Petition. The Court also finds that Plaintiff's claims for damages are time-barred due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. Therefore, the judgment will not be vacated or set aside.
