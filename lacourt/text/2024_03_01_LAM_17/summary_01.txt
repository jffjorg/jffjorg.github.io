And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v. The Kroger Co., The Kroger Co. of Michigan, Foods Co. (Case No. 19STCV25041). The case involves a dispute over whether Plaintiff's Notice of Violation is defective and whether Plaintiff substantially complied with pre-suit notice requirements under Proposition 65.

The Judge grants Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that Plaintiff's Notice is defective because it does not identify a responsive individual "within" the noticing entity, as required by California Code of Regulations, Title 27, Section 25903. The Judge also concludes that Plaintiff did not substantially comply with pre-suit notice requirements, citing the case of Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v. Kintetsu Enters. Am. (2007).

The Judge disagrees with Plaintiff's contention that outside counsel is a responsible individual within the noticing entity and finds that Plaintiff failed to provide any legal basis for concluding that outside counsel falls within the meaning of the statute. The Judge also concludes that Plaintiff's listing of outside counsel as the responsible individual within the noticing entity does not substantially comply with the statute.
