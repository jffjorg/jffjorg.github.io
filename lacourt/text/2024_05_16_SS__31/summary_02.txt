And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel responses to special interrogatories and demand for production of documents. The court grants the motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, ordering Defendant Mark to serve verified responses to Plaintiff Carrasco's special interrogatories, set one, without objections, within thirty days. The court also denies without prejudice the motion to compel responses to demand for production of documents, as Defendant Mark was not properly served with the motion.

The court imposes sanctions against Defendant Mark, ordering him to pay $260 in sanctions to Plaintiff Carrasco. The court also awards Plaintiff Carrasco attorney's fees of $200 for the motion to compel special interrogatories and a filing fee of $60. The court notes that Defendant Mark did not file an opposition to the motion and did not provide a timely response to the discovery requests.
