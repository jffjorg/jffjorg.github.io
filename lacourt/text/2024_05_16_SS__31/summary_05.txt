And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is a response to a motion filed by Plaintiff Rolando Lemus to compel further discovery responses from Defendant Roberto Izarraras. The judge finds that the motion is premature because the parties have not yet participated in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) as required by the Court's Standing Order. The judge orders the parties to participate in an IDC before the motion can be heard. The judge also orders the parties to continue the hearing on motions to compel further discovery responses using the online reservation management system. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement before the hearing.
