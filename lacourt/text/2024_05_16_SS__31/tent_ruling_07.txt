 Case Number:  22STCV39533    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  JUSTIN BIGGERS, Plaintiff(s), vs.  RALPHS GROCERY COMPANY, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 22STCV39533  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: AGS’ MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m. May 16, 2024  Plaintiff Justin Biggers (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Ralphs Grocery Company (“Ralphs”), The Kroger Co., John Doe, and Does 1-100 for damages arising from allegations of assault and battery.   Ralphs filed a cross-complaint against American Guard Services (“AGS”). AGS now moves for terminating sanctions to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court’s March 15, 2024 order to serve verified responses to AGS’ discovery.   However, at issue here is that AGS is not a party to Plaintiff’s action. AGS’ involvement here is as a cross-defendant to Ralph’s cross-complaint. A cross-complaint is an independent action that is not dependent on Plaintiff’s action. (Ohio Cas. Ins. Grp. v. Superior Ct., 30 Cal. App. 4th 444, 449.) Thus, AGS appears to have no standing to bring a motion for terminating sanctions against a complaint in which it is not a party, and in which dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint would provide no relief to AGS.  Based on the foregoing, AGS’ motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff’s complaint is DENIED.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 15th day of May 2024      Hon.
