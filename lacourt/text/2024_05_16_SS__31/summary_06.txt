And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing the plaintiff's action. The plaintiff, a self-represented litigant, failed to comply with discovery orders, and despite the court's orders, no responses were served. The defendant moved for terminating sanctions, citing the plaintiff's willful violation of the court's orders. The court found that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery obligations was willful and that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. The court therefore granted the defendant's motion and dismissed the plaintiff's action.
