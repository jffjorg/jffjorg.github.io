And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on AGS' motion for terminating sanctions to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint. The court has denied AGS' motion, as AGS lacks standing to bring the motion since it is not a party to the original action and the dismissal of Plaintiff's complaint would provide no relief to AGS. The court notes that a cross-complaint is an independent action that is not dependent on the original action, and AGS' involvement is as a cross-defendant to Ralph's cross-complaint. The court encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
