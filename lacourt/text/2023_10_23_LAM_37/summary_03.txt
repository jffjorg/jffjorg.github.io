And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Angel Gallego-Botello, et al v. Architectural Surfaces, Inc., et al, Parsoda U.S.A., Inc. dba Pacifica Wholesale Tile and Stone. The case is about a toxic tort action brought by the Plaintiffs against the Defendants, alleging that the Defendants' products caused the Plaintiffs to develop silicosis and other injuries.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which is the claim for fraudulent concealment, due to the lack of specificity in the Complaint. The Court has also granted the motion to strike the Complaint's allegations regarding punitive damages, as the facts do not support a claim for punitive damages.

The Judge has given the Plaintiffs 20 days to amend their Complaint and has set an OSC Re Amended Complaint for December 4, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. The Defendant has been ordered to give notice of the tentative ruling.
