Background
 
This
action arises out of the alleged exposure to chemicals of Shawn Michael Dolmage
(“Decedent”) during his employment as a synthetic turf installer for Beyond the
Turf, Inc. (“Beyond”). According to the Complaint, Decedent worked installing
synthetic turf fields throughout Los Angeles County, including at the
University of California. 
 
The
Complaint alleges that throughout his employment with Beyond, Decedent worked
with and was exposed to chemicals that were manufactured and distributed by Doe
Defendants 1-100, including silica sand, crumb rubber, butadiene rubber and
other chemicals. As a result of this exposure, Plaintiff allegedly sustained
injuries, from which he died on July 8, 2022. 

 
On
March 1, 2023, Robin Dolmage, as Guardian ad litem of Dash Dolmage, and
Successor-in-Interest of Decedent (“Dolmage GAL” or “Plaintiff”) filed the
operative Fourth Amended Complaint (“4AC”). The 4AC alleges eight causes of
action for: 
1)     Negligence—against
all Defendants;
2)     Strict
Liability – Failure to Warn against all Defendants;
3)     Strict
Liability – Design Defect against all Defendants; 
4)     Fraudulent
Concealment against Defendant Tarkett, Fieldturf USA,
Inc.; 
5)     Fraudulent
Concealment against Defendant Tarkett Sports Canada Inc. (formerly known as
FieldTurf Inc.)
6)     Fraudulent
Concealment against P.W. Gillibrand Co., Pioneer Sands LLC, RW Sidley, Romall
Industries, Target Technologies, The Quikcrete
Companies LLC, and Thompson Building Materials;
7)     Fraudulent
Concealment against Defendants BAS, Recycling, Inc.; CRM Co. LLC; CRM of
America, LLC; Genan Sales & Logistics, Inc.; Liberty Tire Recycling LLC;
and West Coast Rubber Recycling; and
8)     Breach
of Implied warranties against all Defendants.
 
On July 12, 2023, Defendant P.W.
Gillibrand Co. Inc. (“PWG”) filed a demurrer with a motion to strike the
4AC. On August 29, 2023, the demurrer to the sixth cause of action was
overruled. PWG’s motion to strike is now before the court. Plaintiff opposes. 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
The Court may take judicial notice of
records of any court of record of the United States. (Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).)
However, the court may only judicially notice the existence of the record, not
that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th
1548, 1565.) 
 
Defendant PWG requests judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
A true and correct copy of Plaintiffs’ FOURTH
AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR TOXIC INJURIES attached hereto as Exhibit 1.
 
Defendant PWG’s request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard 
¿ 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a
motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading;
or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(CCP, § 436, subds. (a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿ 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿
 
II.        Motion to Strike[1]
 
Defendant PWG requests to strike
Plaintiff’s claims for punitive damages and any references to Pain, Suffering,
and Disfigurement.
 
            A.        Request
to Strike Punitive Damages
 
To state a claim for
punitive damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a plaintiff must allege specific facts
showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud. (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)  The basis for
punitive damages must be pled with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid
of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Id.)  When the
defendant is a¿corporation, “the oppression, fraud, or malice must be
perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by an officer, director, or
managing agent of the¿corporation.” (Wilson v. Southern California Edison
Company (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164; see Civ. Code § 3294(b).) 
 
“Malice” is defined
in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with
a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” “Oppression”
is defined as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust
hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code §
3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions
that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative
Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud
means “an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”
(Civ. Code § 3294(c) (3).)
 
The court has overruled PWG’s
demurrer to the sixth cause of action and Plaintiff’s negligence and strict
liability claims remain viable. 
 
The 4AC sufficiently alleges
that the failure of Defendants, including PWG, to warn about the hazardous
chemical in their sand and to provide adequate instructions for its safe
handling caused the Decedent to suffer “hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pulmonary
fibrosis, silicosis, and interstitial lung disease, as well as other related
and consequential injuries, from which he died on July 8, 2022.” (4AC ¶¶ 66,
94.) Defendant PWG’s concealment was “despicable, malicious, oppressive, and
perpetrated in conscious disregard of the rights and safety of Decedent” and
was ratified by PWG’s corporate office and managers. (4AC ¶¶ 344, 345.) 
 
A claim for punitive damages
may be supported by allegations that the conduct “constitutes conscious disregard of
the rights or safety of others” or is malicious because “a
party intentionally performs an act from which he knows, or should know, it is
highly probable harm will result.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 907.) The 4AC sufficiently alleges that the Hazard
Communication Standard and Labor Code § 6390.5 imposed a duty on all
Defendants, including PWG, to warn about the hazardous chemicals in their
products and Defendants breached this duty. (4AC ¶ 55.) Therefore, the 4AC
sufficiently states that PWG acted with conscious disregard for the safety of
the Decedent in failing to provide a warning and that said conduct was ratified
by PWG’s corporate officers. (4AC ¶¶ 344, 345.)
 
These allegations are
sufficient to sustain a claim for punitive damages against PWG. At
the pleading stage, the court does not consider whether Plaintiff will be able
to prove her claim for punitive damages, only that the pleading alleges
sufficient facts to show malice, oppression, or fraud by Defendants’ managing
agent or officers and directors. 
 
Defendant PWG’s request to
strike Plaintiff’s Prayer for punitive damages and references to punitive
damages in Paragraphs 94, 113, and 345 is denied. 
 
            B.        Request
to Strike References to CCP § 377.34
 
The
court agrees that because this action was filed in 2019 and not on or after
January 1, 2022, Plaintiff cannot recover for the Decedent’s pain, suffering,
and disfigurement. (See CCP § 377.34.) Therefore, the court agrees that the
following should be stricken from the 4AC without leave to amend: 
 
·      
Paragraph 76, Page 20, lines 21-28
·      
Paragraph 92, page 22, lines 26-27
·      
Paragraph 111, page 26, lines 1-3
·      
Paragraph 343, page 80, lines 14-16
·      
Paragraph 427, page 100, lines 20-25
·      
Paragraph 1 in Plaintiff’s “Prayer for
Relief” on page 101, lines 5-6. 
 
Conclusion
 
PWG’s Motion to
Strike is granted in part. PWG’s request to strike Paragraphs
94, 113, and 345 and Paragraph 7 in the Prayer for Relief is denied and granted
as Paragraphs 76, 92, 111, 343, 427, and Paragraph 1 in the Prayer for Relief,
without leave to amend.
