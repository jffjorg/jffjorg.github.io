* The Plaintiff alleges that PWG, along with other defendants, failed to warn about the hazardous chemicals in their products and provided inadequate instructions for their safe handling.
* The 4AC alleges that PWG's concealment was "despicable, malicious, oppressive, and perpetrated in conscious disregard of the rights and safety of Decedent" and was ratified by PWG's corporate office and managers.

**Disputes:**

* PWG's Motion to Strike seeks to strike the Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages and references to pain, suffering, and disfigurement.
