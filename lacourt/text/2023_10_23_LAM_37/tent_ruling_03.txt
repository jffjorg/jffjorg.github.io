Background
 
On March 22, 2023, Angel
Gallegos-Botello and Araceli Mejia (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint against various Defendants alleging six causes of action for (1)
negligence, (2) strict liability – warning defect, (3) strict liability -
design defect, (4) fraudulent concealment, (5) breach of implied warranties,
and (6) loss of consortium. This is a toxic tort action in which  Plaintiff Angel Gallegos-Botello alleges he
developed silicosis and other injuries due to his work with stone products
manufactured, distributed, and/or supplied by various named Defendants. 
 
On
August 14, 2023, Defendant Parsoda U.S.A., Inc. dba Pacifica Wholesale Tile and
Stone (“Parsoda”) filed a demurrer with a motion to strike Plaintiffs’
Complaint. Plaintiffs filed opposing papers on October 10, 2023. Defendant
Parsoda filed a reply on October 16, 2023. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP, § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th
861, 872.)¿For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
Defendant
Parsoda demurs to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment on the
basis that it lacks sufficient facts to state a claim. 
 
            A.        Summary of Allegations in the Complaint
 
Plaintiff
Angel Gallegos-Botello worked as a fabricator of stone and countertops from
1989 to 2002 at Renaissance Marble, Inc., and at SMG Store Company Inc. from
2002 to 2022. (Compl. ¶¶ 34, 35.) The Complaint alleges that the cutting,
grounding, drilling, edging, and polishing of artificial and natural stone
countertops exposed Plaintiff to hazardous silica products manufactured,
distributed, and/or supplied by various named Defendants and led Plaintiff to
develop silicosis and other conditions that required medical treatment and a
lung transplant. (Comp. ¶¶ 36, 37.) 
 
The
Complaint alleges that due to Plaintiff’s work as a cutter, fabricator, and
installer of stone countertops, Plaintiff was exposed to and inhaled silica,
meta dust and particles, and other toxins that were released during the
intended and expected use of said toxic mineral products. (Compl. ¶ 38.)
Plaintiff alleges that the various defendants purposefully concealed the
dangers of inhaling silica dust despite knowing the prevalence of silicosis
among workers in the stone industry. (Compl. ¶¶ 46-95.)
 
B.        Fourth Cause of Action - Fraudulent
Concealment
 
“‘[T]he elements of an action
for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the defendant must have
concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under
a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have
intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the
plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not
have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and
(5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff
must have sustained damage.’” (Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.)
 
“[F]raud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory
allegations do not suffice.” (Lazar v. Superior Court
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645) To survive demurrer, plaintiff must plead facts
that “show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations
were tendered.” (Hamilton v. Greenwich Investors XXVI, LLC (2011) 195
Cal.App.4th 1602, 1614.) “[T]he requirement of specificity is relaxed when the allegations
indicate that ‘the defendant must necessarily possess full information
concerning the facts of the controversy or when the facts lie more in the
knowledge of the opposite party.’ [Citation.]” (Tarmann v. State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.) 
 
The
court agrees that the claims against Defendant Parsoda lack sufficient
specificity to survive a demurrer. The Complaint fails to allege whether Parsoda
is a manufacturer, supplier, or distributor of silica and how Parsoda contributed
to Plaintiff’s silicosis and/or other injuries. The Complaint fails to allege
on what information or belief Plaintiff believes Parsoda is responsible for his
injuries, let alone how Parsoda concealed the damages of silica and what
specific duties it owed to disclose of the danger of silica to Plaintiff.   
 
The
only specific allegation is that Parsoda is a named Defendant whose product and
ingredients led to Plaintiff’s injuries, specifically the ingredients in its
Metroquartz and Viscoston/ Pentralquartz. (Comp. ¶ 33 at pp. 21:23-22:6.) The
Complaint fails to allege facts as to how Plaintiff was exposed to Parsoda’s
products and what specific material facts it concealed and suppressed from
Plaintiff. The Complaint only states in a conclusory fashion that Parsoda is
one of several Defendants who fraudulently concealed that their products were
toxic and contained silica and metal that cause fibrotic lung disease upon
inhalation. (Compl. ¶¶ 42, 43.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true, and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)
 
Although not required to prove his claims at the
pleading stage, Plaintiff must still allege essential facts to support the
fourth action against Defendant Parsoda. Without such facts, the court finds
that the pleading is deficient and does not give Defendant Parsoda sufficient
notice to enable it to prepare a defense or answer. 
 
The court sustains the demurrer to the fourth
cause of action with leave to amend. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
To state a claim for punitive damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a
plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that the defendant has been guilty
of malice, oppression or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.
App. 4th 1033, 1042.)  The basis for punitive damages must be pled with
specificity; conclusory allegations devoid of any factual assertions are
insufficient. (Id.)  
 
Defendant Parsoda requests that the allegation
relating to Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages be stricken from the
Complaint as the facts do not support a claim for punitive damages. 
 
The court agrees that the factual allegations
against Parsoda are deficient.  Plaintiff’s
conclusory allegations alleging to malice, oppression, and fraud are
insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court agrees that the
following should be stricken from Plaintiffs’ Complaint: 
 

Page 22, line 6 stating: “And other stone products to be
     identified during the course of discovery.”
Paragraphs 374, 375, 376, 391, 392,
     503, 504, and 505. 
Page 178, line 6 in the Prayer for
     Damages stating: “For punitive damages according to proof;” 

 
The court grants Defendant Parsoda’s motion to
strike with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
Parsoda’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave
to 
amend.
Parsoda’s motion to strike is also granted with 20 days leave to amend. The
court sets an 
OSC
Re Amended Complaint for December 4, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.  Defendant to give notice.
