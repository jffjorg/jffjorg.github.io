And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied Defendant Aurochemicals LLC's motion to strike allegations of punitive damages. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has pled facts sufficient to support an allegation of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are the necessary elements for punitive damages. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant Aurochemicals LLC was aware of the respiratory effects of diacetyl and acetyl propionyl, but chose to manufacture and sell these chemicals anyway. Additionally, it may be inferred that the decision to sell these chemicals was ratified by a managing agent, director, or officer.
