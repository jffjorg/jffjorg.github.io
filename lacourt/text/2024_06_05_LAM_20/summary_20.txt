Here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is a habitability matter involving Madara Jayasena as the plaintiff and Peter Schwartz and Preston Garland as the defendants. The plaintiff filed the operative Complaint on November 1, 2023, asserting nine causes of action. However, the defendant Peter Schwartz demurred to the Complaint's third and fifth causes of action for failure to state sufficient facts. Since there was no opposition, the subject causes of action were deemed abandoned. The demurrer was sustained, without leave to amend. Additionally, the defendant brought a motion to strike certain references to attorneys' fees and punitive damages. Since there was no opposition, the motion to strike was granted, without leave to amend. The judge's ruling is based on case laws Herzberg v. County of Plumas and Sexton v. Superior Court. The judge encourages counsel to submit their tentative ruling through LACourtConnect rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
