 This is a habitability matter.  On November 1, 2023, Plaintiff Madara Jayasena filed the operative Complaint asserting nine causes of action against Defendants Peter Schwartz and Preston Garland.  Garland has since been dismissed.Defendant Peter Schwartz now demurs to the Complaint’s third and fifth causes of action for failure to state sufficient facts.  Because there is no opposition, the subject causes of action are deemed abandoned.  (Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.)  The Demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend. Defendant has also brought a Motion to Strike as to (1) the third cause of action, (2) certain references to attorneys’ fees, and (3) certain references to punitive damages.  Because there is no opposition, the Motion to Strike is granted, without leave to amend. (See Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
