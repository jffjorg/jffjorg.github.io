```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's renewed motion to lift the stay of proceedings and for sanctions, or in the alternative, to compel defendants to pay the arbitration filing fees. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to establish that the defendant failed to comply with the requirements of CCP § 1281.97 et seq. and failed to establish that the defendant is in material breach of the arbitration agreement. The court notes that the AAA held the matter in abeyance pending compliance with the Solution Channel process and that the fee will only become due payable at a certain date to be determined if and when "this arbitration is ready to move forward". The court also finds that the Cvejic v. Skyview Capital, LLC (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 1073 case is not new law and is distinguishable from the instant case. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion is denied.

## Case Summary: Eric Brown v. Charter Communications, LLC

**Case Number:** 21TRCV003147
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Eric Brown
* **Defendant:** Charter Communications, LLC

**Background:**

Eric Brown filed a lawsuit against Charter Communications alleging wrongful termination, unpaid wages, and various other employment-related claims. The defendant moved to compel arbitration, which the court granted, staying the proceedings. 

**Issues:**

The plaintiff renewed his motion to lift the arbitration stay, arguing that Charter had failed to timely pay arbitration filing fees and that a recent appellate case (Cvejic v. Skyview Capital, LLC) mandates a different outcome.

**Judge's Ruling:**

The court denied the plaintiff's renewed motion. 

**Key Reasons:**

*  The court found that Charter did not breach the arbitration agreement because no proper invoice for arbitration fees was issued by the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The AAA held the matter in abeyance pending compliance with a contractual "Solution Channel" process.
*  The court distinguished Cvejic v. Skyview Capital, LLC, stating that the facts in that case were different. In Cvejic, the defendant had missed a specific due date for arbitration fees, which triggered a breach of the agreement. 


**Other Points:**

* The court noted that the plaintiff's request to compel Charter to pay fees and proceed with arbitration was not properly before the court. 


**Intentions:**

The judge's ruling upholds the previous decision to compel arbitration and maintains the current stay on the proceedings. 


**Significant Statements:**

The judge stated that "Defendant did not materially breach the agreement" and referred back to a previous ruling that explained the reasons for this conclusion.

**Consequences:**

The case will remain in arbitration, and the plaintiff's claims will be resolved through that process.
