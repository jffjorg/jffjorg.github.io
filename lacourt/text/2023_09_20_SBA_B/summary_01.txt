```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's renewed motion to lift the stay of proceedings and for sanctions, or in the alternative, to compel defendants to pay the arbitration filing fees. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to establish that the defendant failed to comply with the requirements of CCP § 1281.97 et seq. and failed to establish that the defendant is in material breach of the arbitration agreement. The court notes that the AAA held the matter in abeyance pending compliance with the Solution Channel process and that the fee will only become due payable at a certain date to be determined if and when "this arbitration is ready to move forward". The court also finds that the Cvejic v. Skyview Capital, LLC (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 1073 case is not new law and is distinguishable from the instant case. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion is denied.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Eric Brown's renewed motion to lift the stay of proceedings and for sanctions, or in the alternative, to compel Charter Communications, LLC to pay the arbitration filing fee. The judge found that Charter did not fail to pay the arbitration filing fee, as no proper invoice was generated by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) triggering the payment obligation. The judge also noted that the AAA held the matter in abeyance and did not order payment of fees by a certain deadline. As a result, the judge concluded that Charter did not materially breach the arbitration agreement. The judge also denied the alternative request to order Charter to pay fees and proceed to arbitration, as this was not a part of the original ruling and not a proper subject for a renewal motion.
