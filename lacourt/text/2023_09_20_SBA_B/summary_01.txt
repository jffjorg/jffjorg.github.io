```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's renewed motion to lift the stay of proceedings and for sanctions, or in the alternative, to compel defendants to pay the arbitration filing fees. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to establish that the defendant failed to comply with the requirements of CCP § 1281.97 et seq. and failed to establish that the defendant is in material breach of the arbitration agreement. The court notes that the AAA held the matter in abeyance pending compliance with the Solution Channel process and that the fee will only become due payable at a certain date to be determined if and when "this arbitration is ready to move forward". The court also finds that the Cvejic v. Skyview Capital, LLC (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 1073 case is not new law and is distinguishable from the instant case. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion is denied.
