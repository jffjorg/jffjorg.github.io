```

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages and orders the defendant to answer the first amended complaint (FAC) within 20 days. The judge notes that the defendant's moving papers make improper references to facts outside the FAC and admonishes Mr. Beck, the defendant's attorney, for this conduct. The judge finds that the FAC states sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The defendant disputes liability and claims that the plaintiff made an illegal left turn in front of his vehicle, while the plaintiff maintains liability and seeks punitive damages. The judge's ruling is based on the facts presented in the FAC and the opposition papers.
