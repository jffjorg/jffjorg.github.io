And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Fermin Santiago Toral's motion for summary judgment on the Quiet Title by Adverse Possession cause of action. The Judge finds that Plaintiff Deanna Edwards did not occupy the property hostilely for the statutory five-year period, did not pay taxes on the property for herself, and did not have exclusive possession of the property during the tax-paying period. The Judge concludes that there are no remaining triable issues of material fact and grants the motion for summary judgment.
