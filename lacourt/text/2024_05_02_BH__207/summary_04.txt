And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant in the amount of $213,035. The plaintiff, De Young Kim Legacy Trust, had requested the default judgment due to the defendant's failure to respond to the complaint. The court found that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to support the request for default judgment. Additionally, the court noted that as a trust, the plaintiff is not a legal entity that can sue and therefore the court cannot enter judgment as requested. The court has continued the Order to Show Cause re: Entry of Default Judgment to August 1, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.
