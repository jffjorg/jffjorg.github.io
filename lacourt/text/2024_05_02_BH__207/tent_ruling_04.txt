MATTER


Request for Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff De Young Kim Legacy Trust (“Plaintiff”) requests for default
judgment against Defendant Robbie Neman (“Defendant”) in the amount
of $213,035, which is composed of special damages in the amount of $212,500 and
costs in the amount of $535.
 
            a.         Damages 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges a single cause of action for breach of lease agreement.  Defendant was personally served with a copy
of the summons and complaint on August 29, 2023. Default was entered against
Defendant on February 7, 2024. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint seeks $212,500 in unpaid rent. (See Complaint ¶ 7.)  Therefore, Plaintiff does not seek damages in
excess of those pled in the Complaint.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if
there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v.
Smith (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1131,
1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is
limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            In support of the request, Plaintiff
has provided the Declaration of Soyoung Cho, but Plaintiff has not produced a
copy of the rental agreement or other financial records indicating the
outstanding balance due.  As such, the
Cho declaration is hearsay, and insufficient to satisfy Plaintiff’s evidentiary
burden.
 
            Moreover, the Court notes that “a
trust is not a legal entity” and “it cannot sue or be sued, but rather legal
proceedings are properly directed at the trustee[.]”  (Jo Redland Trust, U.A.D. 4-6-05 v.
CIT Bank, N.A. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 142, 156.)  Therefore, because the named Plaintiff is a
trust, as opposed to the trustee of a trust, the Court cannot enter judgment as
requested. 
 
            d.         Costs 
 
            Plaintiff also requests $535 in costs composed of $450 in filing fees and $85 in process server fees. (CIV-100.)  Once a proper Plaintiff is established, Plaintiff’s
request for costs is generally warranted as Plaintiff is the prevailing party
in this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Because Plaintiff
has not supported the request for default judgment with adequate evidence and
because Plaintiff is a trust, which is not a legal entity that can sue,
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is denied without prejudice.  
 
            Therefore, the
Court continues the Order to Show Cause re: Entry of Default Judgment to August
1, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.
