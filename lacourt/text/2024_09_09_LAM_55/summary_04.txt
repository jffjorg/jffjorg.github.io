And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the application of an arbitration clause in a Representation Agreement. The clause does not specify whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) or the California Arbitration Act applies. The judge notes that the FAA applies to contracts involving interstate commerce, and that the defendant is an online retailer, but does not address the issue of which act applies because the outcome is the same under federal or California law. The judge will not reach the issue of which act to apply.
