Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court grants ANLD's motion to expunge the lis pendens, which was recorded by Plaintiffs in June 2024. The Court finds that the First Amended Complaint (FAC) did not contain a real property claim, and therefore, the lis pendens must be expunged. The Court does not reach the issue of whether the constructive trust cause of action in the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) constitutes a real property claim. The Court awards ANLD attorney's fees in the amount of $6,855, which is reduced from the requested amount of $13,710. The Court concludes that the lis pendens must be expunged and that ANLD is entitled to attorney's fees.
