[1] The arbitration clause in the
Representation Agreement does not specify whether the Federal Arbitration Act
or California Arbitration Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 1280 et seq.,
applies. The substantive provisions of the FAA apply if the applicable
arbitration clause is in “a contract evidencing a transaction involving
commerce ... .” 9 U.S.C. § 2; see Volt Info. Sciences v. Leland Stanford Jr.
U. (1989) 489 U.S. 468, 476 (“It is undisputed that this contract falls
within the coverage of the FAA, since it involves interstate commerce.”).
Although it is undisputed that Defendant is an online retailer, neither the
order compelling arbitration in the separate case nor the party’s papers
addresses the issues of whether the FAA applies. Because the Court concludes
that the outcome is the same under federal or California law, it likewise does
not reach the issue here.
