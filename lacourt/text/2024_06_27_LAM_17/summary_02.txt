And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules in favor of the defendant, Farmers Group, Inc. and Farmers Insurance Exchange, and grants their motion for summary judgment. The judge finds that there is no triable issue as to the breach of contract claim, as the plaintiff has not submitted sufficient evidence to show that the collapse of the balcony wall was caused by a covered cause, such as "weight of ice, snow, sleet, or rain that collects on a roof". The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not met his burden of proof to disclose a triable issue of material fact as to the breach of contract claim.
