And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Eunice J. Bodak's motion to set aside the entry of default. Bodak argues that she was never actually served with the lawsuit, as she did not reside at the location where she was purportedly served. The Proof of Service shows that personal service was attempted on 12/13/2023, but Bodak was living with her mother at her mother's residence as the conservator at the time. The cross-complainants have filed a notice of no objection to this motion. Based on the facts presented, the judge has determined that Bodak's motion to set aside the entry of default is granted.
