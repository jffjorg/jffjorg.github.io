Significant Statements:

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings is granted in part, as to the 4th-8th causes of action (labor code violations), and denied in part as to the 1st-3rd causes of action (sexual harassment claims). The court finds that the defendant has met its burden to prove the existence of a valid arbitration agreement and that the scope of that agreement applies to the adjudication of all plaintiff's claims. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims for sexual harassment fall within the meaning of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA). However, the court rejects the defendant's argument that the arbitrator should decide the arbitrability of the plaintiff's sexual harassment claims, instead finding that it is the court's job to determine the application of the EFAA and the enforceability of the arbitration agreement. The case is stayed pending arbitration of the plaintiff's labor code claims.
