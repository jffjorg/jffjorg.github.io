TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants Blaze Pizza International, LLC, Blaze Pizza
Operations, LLC and Blaze Pizza, LLC’s (“Blaze Defendants) Demurrer to the 4th,
5th and 7th causes of action is OVERRULED.  Plaintiffs Anne Greene and Matthew Greenes’ 4th,
5th, and 7th causes of action within the FAC allege
ultimate facts to allege the necessary elements of each cause of action. 
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)
 
Plaintiff is only required to allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts. (See Committee on Children's Television, Inc. v. General
Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212 [“the complaint should set forth the
ultimate facts constituting the cause of action, not the evidence by which
plaintiff proposes to prove those facts”); 1 Cal. Affirmative Def. § 10:2 (2d
ed.) [allegations of agency, course and scope of employment, etc. qualify as
ultimate facts].) Plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as true on demurrer.
(See Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924
[“For purposes of reviewing a demurrer, we accept the truth of material facts
properly pleaded in the operative complaint”].)
 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 452 provides in full:
“In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect,
its allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice
between the parties.” This rule of liberal construction means that the
reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the defendant.
(Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238,
quoting CCP § 452.) On a demurer “the allegations of the complaint must be read
in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.” (Venice Town Council, Inc. v.
City of Los Angeles (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1547, 1557.)
 
 
I.                  
Demurrer to 4th cause of action for
Aiding and Abetting—OVERRULED
 
            "California imposes liability
on one who aids and abets the commission of an intentional tort if the person
(a) knows the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives
substantial assistance or encouragement to the other to so act or (b) gives
substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and the
person's own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of duty to
the third person." (Berger v. Varum (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 1013,
1025.)
 
            Defendants Blaze Pizza
International, LLC, Blaze Pizza Operations LLC, and Blaze Pizza LLC (“Blaze
Defendants”) argue that the Plaintiffs Anne Greene and Matthew Greenes’
(“Plaintiffs”) conclusory allegations are to generalized to support this type
of claim, but provide no authority that an aiding and abetting claim requires a
heightened pleading standard like that of a fraud claim. 
                         
            Moreover, Plaintiffs plead specific facts to meet all the
elements of an aiding and abetting claim against the Blaze Defendants. Specifically,
Plaintiffs plead:
 
1.     
“Blaze Pizza knew that Defendant Driz would transfer
his 49% interest in LA Metro BP Holdings to Defendant Koral via a series of
below-market transfers.” (SAC, ¶ 142.)
2.     
“Defendants Driz and Koral executed these transfers on
December 22-23, 2016, two days after Blaze Pizza had stated that it was
“actively working to remove” Driz from ownership and that “due to a legal
incident,” Driz had been removed from all ownership of Blaze Pizza.” (SAC, ¶
143.)
3.     
“Blaze Pizza provided substantial assistance and/or
encouragement to Driz and Koral to remove Driz from Blaze Pizza ownership in
order to protect its brand name, avoid associating with known
criminals/tortfeasors, and to avoid the financial impact of same.” (SAC, ¶ 144.)
4.     
“The Franchise Defendants provided substantial
assistance and/or encouragement to Driz and Koral to remove Driz from ownership
of in order to protect its brand name, avoid associating with known
criminals/tortfeasors, and to avoid the financial impact of same.” (SAC, ¶
145.)
5.     
“Moreover, just two (2) days before Driz and Koral
executed the December 22-23, 2016 transfers from Driz to Koral, Blaze Pizza
stated that it was “actively working to remove [Driz] from ownership.”
Accordingly, Blaze Pizza provided substantial assistance and/or encouragement
to Driz and Koral in furtherance of the fraudulent December 22-23, 2016
transactions.” (SAC, ¶ 146.)
6.     
“Blaze Pizza encouraged and/or facilitated Driz and
Koral’s December 22- 23, 2016 transactions that transferred Driz’s ownership
interest in eleven (11) Blaze Pizza franchises from Driz to Koral.” (SAC, ¶
150.)_
7.     
“Blaze Pizza’s encouragement and involvement thus
caused Plaintiffs ANNE GREENE and MATTHEW GREENE harm because Plaintiffs have
not been able to execute on Driz’s former forty-nine percent (49%) ownership
interest in La Metro BP Holdings to satisfy his judgment in the underlying
civil matter.” (SAC, ¶ 152.)
8.     
“Blaze Pizza also possessed actual knowledge that Driz
and Koral’s December 22-23, 2016 transactions would frustrate Plaintiffs’
ability to execute on their judgment obtained in the underlying civil matter.”
(SAC, ¶ 153.)
 
            Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs plead specific
facts to meet the elements of aiding and abetting cause of action as to the
Blaze Defendants. Blaze Defendants Demurrer to the 4th cause of
action is OVERRULED. 
 
II.               
Demurrer to 5th cause of action for
Civil Conspiracy—OVERRULED
 
            “[T]o state a cause of action based upon a conspiracy
theory the plaintiff must allege the formation and operation of the conspiracy,
the wrongful act or acts done pursuant to it, and the damage resulting from
such acts. [Citation.] In making such allegations bare legal conclusions,
inferences, generalities, presumptions, and conclusions are insufficient.” (State
of California ex rel. Metz v. CCC Information Services, Inc. (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 402, 419.)
 
            Plaintiffs plead the requisite factual accusations to
meet the elements for a conspiracy claim. Specifically, Plaintiffs plead:
 
1.     
On December 20, 2016, Blaze Pizza, in response to a
tweet discussing the impact of the underlying assault on Blaze Pizza’s
business, stated that Blaze Pizza was “actively working to remove [Driz] from
ownership.” (SAC, ¶ 158.)
2.     
On December 20, 2016, Blaze Pizza’s Leadership and
Support Team sent an internal e-mail to all “Blaze Partners” with the subject
line “BP LA Metro Group Notification.” This e-mail provided: “Due to a legal
incident, Daniel Driz, his brother, and his nephew have been removed from all
Blaze Pizza operations. BP LA Metro is now operated by Mr. Peter Koral and his
operating partner, Mr. Tom Cook.” (SAC, ¶ 159.)
3.     
The timing of Blaze Pizza’s communications with the
public, and its internal communications, lay bare that Blaze Pizza worked with
Koral and Driz to remove Driz from ownership of the ten (10) Blaze Pizza
franchises at issue in this lawsuit. (SAC, ¶ 160.)
4.     
Indeed, just two (2) days before Driz’s December 22-23,
2016 transfers to Koral, Blaze Pizza had already told its ownership group that
Driz “ha[s] been removed from all Blaze Pizza operations.” (SAC, ¶ 161.)
5.     
Moreover, that same day, Blaze Pizza admitted that it
was “actively working to remove [Driz] from ownership.” Accordingly, Blaze
Pizza was also a part of Driz’s agreement to transfer his interests to Koral,
and did so for its own financial benefit. (SAC, ¶ 162.)
6.     
On December 22 and 23, 2016, Driz engaged in a fire
sale of his fortynine percent (49%) ownership stake in LA METRO BP HOLDING CO.,
LLC and ten (10) Blaze Pizza franchises. (SAC, ¶ 166.)
7.     
Plaintiffs were damaged by the alleged conspiracy. (See
SAC, ¶¶ 164, 165, 174.) 
 
The
Court finds that the Plaintiffs plead the necessary factual allegations to
reach all the elements of a conspiracy cause of action. Blaze Defendants
demurrer to the 5th cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
 
III.            
Demurrer to 7th Cause of action for violation
of unfair competition 
 
 “To bring a UCL claim, a plaintiff must show
either an (1) unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice, or (2)
unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising. [citation] Because the UCL
is written in the disjunctive, it establishes three varieties of unfair
competition—acts or practices which are unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent.”
[citation] (Adhav v. Midway Rent A Car, Inc. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 954,
970.)
 
            The UCL defines “unfair
competition” to include “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice.” (De La Torre v. CashCall, Inc. (2018) 5 Cal.5th 966, 974.) “Because
Business and Professions Code section 17200 is written in the disjunctive, it
establishes three varieties of unfair competition—acts or practices which are
unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent.”
(Beasley v. Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 901,
911, review denied (Mar. 15, 2023).) “To prevail on a claim under the
unlawful prong of the unfair competition law, the plaintiff must show that a
challenged advertisement or practice violates any federal or California
‘statute or regulation.” (Id., at p. 912.)
 
            “[A]ny person who has suffered injury in fact and has
lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition” has
standing to bring a UCL claim.” (In re Tobacco II Cases (2009) 46
Cal.4th 298, 320.)
            
            It is rare to sustain a demurrer to a § 17200
“unfairness” claim because a determination of whether a practice is unfair
requires a full factual record. (Motors, Inc. v. Times Mirror Co. (1980)
102 Cal. App. 3d 735, 740.)
 
            Blaze Defendants argue the UCL claim is not based on the
aiding and abetting claims in the SAC, but instead are based on a violation of
the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (“UVTA”), or a violation of Cal Civ. Code
§§ 3439, without a UVTA claim alleged against Blaze Defendants in the FAC.
(Demurrer, pp. 13–15.) However, in addition to basing the claim on the UVTA
violation, Plaintiffs also include the conspiracy and aiding and abetting
allegations within the cause of action by incorporating and re-alleging each
and every allegation prior to the cause of action, and specifically including
facts within the cause of action itself. These specific allegations include:  
 
1.     
“On December 20, 2016, Blaze Pizza, in response to a
tweet discussing the impact of the underlying assault on Blaze Pizza’s
business, stated that Blaze Pizza was “actively working to remove [Driz] from
ownership.” (FAC, ¶ 202.)
2.     
“On December 20, 2016, Blaze Pizza’s Leadership and
Support Team sent an internal e-mail to all “Blaze Partners” with the subject
line “BP LA Metro Group Notification.” This e-mail provided: “Due to a legal
incident, Daniel Driz, his brother, and his nephew have been removed from all
Blaze Pizza operations. BP LA Metro is now operated by Mr. Peter Koral and his
operating partner, Mr. Tom Cook.” (FAC, ¶ 203.)
3.     
“In the course of conducting business, Defendants, and
each of them, committed unlawful business practices by, inter alia,
intentionally aiding Driz in attempting to conceal his assets in violation of
Plaintiffs’ rights, thus violating the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act, Cal.
Civ. Code §§ 3439 et seq., and any other applicable statutes and common law
causes of action, whether or not specifically alleged herein by intentionally
assisting, encouraging, and/or ratifying Driz’s attempts to conceal his assets from
Plaintiffs just fifteen days after Plaintiffs filed their original Complaint.” (FAC,
¶ 204.)
4.     
“As stated in this Complaint, Plaintiffs allege
violations of various laws and regulations resulting in harm to Plaintiffs as a
result of Defendants’ unfair business practices. Defendants, and each of them,
either affirmatively encouraged and/or assisted Driz in attempting to conceal
his assets from Plaintiffs or ratified this conduct after the fact. This is
fraudulent business practice because it was not done to further any legitimate
interest of either party, only to frustrate Plaintiffs’ exercise of their
rights. Plaintiffs also assert violations of the public policy against engaging
in fraudulent business acts and/or practices, including by affirmative
assisting, encouraging, and/or ratifying a debtor’s attempt to conceal his
assets from legitimate creditors. This conduct constitutes violations of the
unfair prong of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et seq.” (FAC, ¶ 207.)
5.     
“Defendants also violated, and in some instances
continues to violate, the UCL through one or more of the following unfair
and/or fraudulent practices: a. Failing to disclose that Driz intentionally
concealed his assets from Plaintiffs as a result of Defendants’ fraudulent
business acts and/or practices; b. Misrepresenting, or making statements or
omissions that were likely to deceive Plaintiffs that Driz is insolvent and/or
judgment proof; c. Violating Cal. Civ. Code §3439, et seq.; and d. Defrauding
Plaintiffs.” (FAC, ¶ 208.) 
6.     
“Specifically, Defendants Blaze Pizza International,
LLC, Blaze Pizza Operations, LLC and Blaze Pizza, LLC forced the sale of the
Blaze Pizza assets to insulate their brand and received a benefit as transfer
beneficiaries of Driz’s fraudulent conveyances and acquired ownership interests
therein.” (FAC, ¶ 209.)
 
The
Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged ultimate facts to meet the elements of
the unfair competition claim. Blaze Defendants’ Demurrer to the 7th cause of
action for unfair competition is OVERRULED. 
 
IV.            
Demurrer for uncertainty - OVERRULED
 
            "Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored, and are
granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot
reasonably respond . . . . We strictly construe such demurrers because
ambiguities can reasonably be clarified under modern rules of discovery."
(Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135. ["demurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored"].)
 
            Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and any
ambiguity can be clarified in discovery. Thus, Blaze Defendants demurrer for
uncertainty as to the FAC is OVERRULED.
