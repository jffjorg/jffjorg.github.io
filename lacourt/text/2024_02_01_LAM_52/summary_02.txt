And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by defendants Michelle Presnell, Ashley Presnell, and Peter Presnell to the first three causes of action in plaintiff Heidi Yu Ling Yu's first amended complaint. The plaintiff failed to timely oppose the demurrer and submitted an untimely brief requesting leave to amend the complaint. The Judge grants leave to amend the complaint, citing the case of Stevens v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601, which states that if there is a reasonable possibility that the defects can be cured by amendment, leave to amend must be granted. The Judge allows plaintiff to file a second amended complaint and gives the defendants 20 days to amend.
