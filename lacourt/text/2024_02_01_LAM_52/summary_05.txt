And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Hawthorne moves to strike Barry Rosen's complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, alleging that Rosen's claims are based on protected activity and lack minimal merit. The court grants the motion in part, striking certain portions of the complaint that arise from the City's protected activity of issuing traffic citations. The court also finds that Rosen fails to meet his burden of showing minimal merit to his claims for relief arising from the City's protected activity. As a result, the court denies Rosen's claims and awards the City $5,500 in attorney fees.
