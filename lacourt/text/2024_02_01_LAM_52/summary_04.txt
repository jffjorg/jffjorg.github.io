And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by plaintiff Gayane Mkrtchyan to file a second amended complaint. The defendants, QTC Management, Inc., Leidos Holdings, Inc., Leidos, Inc., Janett Fairchild, and Marcella Aiken, argued that the proposed amendment would be futile and that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed seeking to amend the complaint. However, the Judge has granted the motion, stating that courts have discretion to permit amendments "in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper." The Judge found that the defendants did not show any prejudice that would warrant denying the motion, and that any delay was minimal and did not prejudice the defendants. The Judge also noted that plaintiff's proposed amendments arise from the same general set of facts and circumstances as the operative first amended complaint.
