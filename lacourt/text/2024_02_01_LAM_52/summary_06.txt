And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Dignity Health dba St. Mary Medical Center, has moved for leave to conduct a second deposition of the plaintiff, Noushin Khoiny, M.D. The plaintiff argues that the defendant should be limited to deposing the plaintiff's experts on damages, but the court finds that this motion is not procedurally defective. The court grants the defendant's motion and allows them to depose the plaintiff again for up to 3.5 hours, limited to the subject of plaintiff's damages since July 2017. The parties are ordered to meet and confer within seven days to select a date for the plaintiff's subsequent deposition.
