And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motion to compel the deposition and production of documents by Dr. Bharat V. Merai. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs after Dr. Merai failed to appear for a scheduled deposition on March 11, 2024. The Judge finds that Dr. Merai's failure to appear was an abuse of the discovery process and grants the request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,334.21 against Dr. Merai and his counsel, Frank A. Weiser. The sanctions are to be paid within 30 days through counsel for the plaintiffs. The Judge has reduced the amount of the sanctions since there was no written opposition and Dr. Merai has now appeared for the deposition.
