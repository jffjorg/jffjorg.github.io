Perez v. Kim Johnson, et al.
Case
No. 22STCP01196
[Tentative]
Order Granting Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Petitioner Andres
Perez (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for writ of mandate directing the California
Department of Social Services and Kim Johnson, in her official capacity as
Director, to set aside an administrative decision denying Petitioner’s claim
for retroactive benefits.  The court
(Beckloff, J.) granted the petition, finding that Petitioner was entitled to
benefits for the time period of May 17, 2017, to March 2, 2020.  (See Court’s Order, dated August 25, 2023.)  Now, Petitioner’s counsel seeks $158,825.20
in attorneys’ fees under Welfare and Institutions Code section 10962.  Respondents’ counsel does not challenge Petitioner’s
right to attorneys’ fees but argues that they should receive only $90,000.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD


The
determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound
discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.)  The burden is on the party seeking
attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County
of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.)  The Court has broad discretion in determining
the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award which will not be overturned
absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or
necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.”  (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008)
167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The Court need not explain its
calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the
factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice.  (See Ventura v. ABM Industries Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Petitioner’s counsel requests that the court award hourly
rates for his attorneys as follows: (1) William Hanssen (licensed since 1983):
$805/hour in 2021 and $870/hour in 2022; (2) David A. Belcher (licensed since
2019): $520/hour in 2022, $ 615/hour in 2023, and $695/hour in 2024; (3) Lara
Holtzman (licensed since 1993): $878/hour; and (4) Natalie Klasky Mac (licensed
since 2014): $500/hour.  (Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees (“Mot.”) 7-8.)  Most of these
rates are high for writ proceedings (as opposed to other forms of civil litigation).  
 
Petitioner’s
counsel requests that the court authorize 249.6 hours for the petition,
including the instant motion.  These
hours are higher than what the court would expect for a petition of this nature.  Among other things, the court is concerned
that the number of attorneys resulted in inefficiencies.    
 
Based upon the
foregoing, the court applies a 20 percent negative multiplier, resulting in an
award of attorneys’ fees of $127,060.16. 
This is commensurate with what the court would expect for a petition of
this nature. 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Because Respondent does not contest
Petitioner’s right to attorneys’ fees, the motion is granted.
 
            2.         The court reduces the requested
attorneys’ fees from $158,825.20 to $127,060.16.
 
            3.         Respondents
shall pay this amount within ninety (90) days.
 
            4.         Petitioner
may lodge a proposed order for the court’s signature if necessary.
 
            5.         Petitioner’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
