And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the court's thinking based on information presented before the hearing. The case involves the City of San Gabriel's approval of a project without a review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The court overruled the demurrer filed by the City, finding that the clerk's office was required to accept the petition for filing on September 21, 2023. The court concluded that the clerk's office did not have authority to reject the petition due to alleged errors on the civil case cover sheet or because it was filed in the wrong location. The court noted that the CEQA box did not exist, and that the clerk's office should have filed the petition and notified the attorney or party to correct any perceived defects. The court ordered the demurrer to be overruled, and set a trial date for the case.
