Timoteo Lara Almanza
Case No.
24STLC00349
[Tentative] Order
Granting Application for Writ of Possession
 
 
Plaintiff Ally Bank (“Plaintiff”) moves for a writ of
possession against Defendant Timoteo Lara Almaza (“Defendant”) over the
following property: 2017 Toyota Tacoma, motor vehicle, Vehicle Identification
Number 5TFRX5GNXHX084462 (the “vehicle”). 
Plaintiff has complied with all statutory requirements under Code of
Civil Procedure section 512.010 as follows:
 
A.        Notice –
Plaintiff has provided proper notice, per the proofs of service filed on May 1,
2024, and June 11, 2024.
 
B.        Probable Validity of Plaintiff’s Claim –
Plaintiff seeks a writ of possession based on its claim for money on a
contract.  On or about August 12, 2022,
Defendant entered into a Retail Installment Sale Contract (the “contract”) with
Plaintiff’s assignor to purchase the Vehicle. 
(Singleton Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, Exh. A-C.) 
Plaintiff submits evidence that the contract was assigned to
Plaintiff.  (Id. ¶ 5 and Exh.
B.)  Defendant defaulted on the contract
by failing to make payments when due, and there is presently a balance due of
$27,517.99.  (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. D.)  Defendant has not responded to any of
Plaintiff’s evidence.  
  
            C.        Wrongful Detention – Under the contract, Plaintiff has the right to repossess the
Vehicle in the event of default.  (Singleton
Decl. Exh. A.)  Plaintiff has demanded
that Defendant surrender the Vehicle.  (Id.
¶¶ 6, 8, Exh. C.)  Plaintiff has made a showing that Defendant has wrongfully detained the Vehicle.
 
            D.        Description and Value of the Property –
The application satisfies this requirement.
 
            E.         Statutory Statements under Code of
Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(4) & (5) – The application satisfied
these requirements. 
 
F.         Undertaking – Plaintiff
submits evidence that the amount owed on the contract exceeds the Vehicle’s
value.  (Singleton Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, Exh. E.)  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding
that Defendant does not have any interest in the Vehicle and Plaintiff is not
required to post an undertaking.
 
G.        Turnover Order – Because the court is granting the writ of
attachment, the court issues a turnover order, per Code of Civil Procedure
section 512.070.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The application for writ of attachment
is granted.
 
            2.         The court issues a turnover order.
 
            3.         Plaintiff may lodge a proposed order
for the court’s signature if necessary.
 
            4.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.
