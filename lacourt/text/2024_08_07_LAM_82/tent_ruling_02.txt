[Tentative] Order Overruling Demurrer
 
INTRODUCTION
 
Supports Alliance for Environmental
Responsibility (“Petitioner”) filed this petition for writ of mandate and
complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the City of San Gabriel
and the City Council (collectively, “Respondents” or the “City”).  Petitioner challenges Respondents’ decision
to approve a project without a review under the California Environmental
Quality Act (“CEQA”).  The court
(Beckloff, J.) sustained a demurrer to the petition, finding that the petition
is barred by the statute of limitations. 
Petitioner filed a first amended petition, and Respondents demur on the
same grounds.  The Real Parties in
Interest—Adept
Development, American General Design dba Adept Development and Adept
Architecture, Povac Investments, Inc. dba Adept Building and Construction, and
Las Tunas Medical Office Condo, LLC (the “Real Parties”)—join in the demurrer.  The demurrer is overruled.   
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Petitioner
challenges City’s approval of the 330 West Las Tunas Drive Project (Planning Case
No. PPD21-008) (the “project”), including a Precise Plan of Design for the
Project, under CEQA.  The Project
“involves the demolition of an existing one-story, 5,032-square foot medical
office building and associated surface parking lot and the construction of a
new five-story, 74,490-square foot medical office building with two levels of
subterranean parking on a 63,779-square foot site, totaling approximately 1.46
acres, located at 330 West Las Tunas Drive in the City of San Gabriel.”  (Pet. ¶¶ 1-2.)  Petitioner contends that Respondents
“unlawfully determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to the
Class 32 In-Fill Development Categorical Exemption (‘In-Fill Exemption’), 14
Cal. Code Regs., § 15332.”  
(Id.
¶ 1.) 
 
             The City filed a Notice of Exemption on August
17, 2023, noticing exemption of the project from CEQA review pursuant to the
In-Fill Exemption.  (First Amended
Petition (“FAP”) ¶ 49.)  Per the 35-day
statute of limitations, Petitioner was required to file its petition no later
than September 21, 2023.  (FAP ¶
50.)  Petitioner’s counsel provided a
copy of case filing documents (the petition, the civil case cover sheet, the
summons, and the notice of intent to prepare the administrative record) to its
electronic filing service on September 21, 2023, at 3:20 p.m.  (FAP ¶ 52 & Exh. C.)  The documents were received at the clerk’s office
in the Northeast District on September 21, 2023, at 4:33 p.m. (FAP Exh.
E.)  The clerk’s office rejected the
filing because the “CA environmental [sic] Quality Act box [was] not checked” on
the civil case cover sheet.  (FAP Exh.
E.)  Petitioner’s counsel’s paralegal,
Ms. Toyer Grear, contacted the clerk’s office that same date because “there is no
such thing as a ‘CEQA box’ on the civil case cover sheet.”  (FAP ¶ 57.) 
The court clerk indicated that confirmed “that this was a clerical error
and that the CEQA box did not in fact exist,” but said he would need to speak
with a supervisor.  (Ibid.)  The court clerk called Ms. Grear back on
September 26, 2023, and said that even though the original rejection reason was
incorrect, the clerk’s office still would not accept the filing because it had
to be filed at the clerk’s office at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  (See ibid.)  Petitioner re-filed the case at the Stanley
Mosk Courthouse that same date.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the
grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from
judicially noticeable matters. (Code Civil Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “We assume the truth of the
allegations in the complaint, but do not assume the truth of contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of law.”  (California Logistics, Inc. v.
State (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.)  “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters.”  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  The
allegations in the petition must be liberally construed in favor of Petitioner
on demurrer.  (See Mobil Oil Corp. v
Exxon Corp. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 942, 947.)  “A demurrer must dispose of an entire
cause of action to be sustained.”  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            The court overrules the
demurrer because the clerk’s office was required to accept this petition for
filing on September 21, 2023.  The clerk’s
office first rejected the petition because, purportedly, a box on the civil cover
sheet was not checked.  Even if such a
box existed, that would not be a basis to reject the filing.  While the clerk’s office may refuse to file
a pleading that does not conform to the California Rules of Court, the clerk’s
office does not have authority to reject a pleading for other reasons.  (See Carlson v. State of California
Department of Fish & Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1276; see also Rojas
v. Cutsforth (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 774, 777.)  As Justice Arthur Gilbert recognized:  
 
It is difficult enough to practice law without having
the clerk’s office as an adversary. 
Here, paltry nit-picking took the place of common sense and fairness.  Where, as here, the defect, if any, is
insubstantial, the clerk should file the complaint and notify the attorney or
party that the perceived defect should be corrected at the earliest
opportunity.  
 
(Rojas,
supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at 777.)  But such
a box does not exist, so there really was no basis to reject the filing.   
 
            Nor did the clerk’s office have
authority to reject the petition because it was filed in the wrong location.  It is true that Local Rule 3.232(b) makes
clear that CEQA actions must be filed in the Central District (i.e., the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse).  Again, the
clerk’s office may only reject a pleading for non-conformity with the
California Rules of Court.  “[I]f a
pleading presented for filing complies with [the California Rules of Court],
the clerk may not refuse to file it for lack of compliance with a Los Angeles
Superior Court local rule.”  (Carlson,
supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at 1276.)  This is
consistent with Code of Civil Procedure section 402(a)(3) which states that “the
clerk may not reject a case for filing, because it is filed, or a person seeks
to file it, in a court location other than the location specified by local
rule.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 402(a)(3).)  Instead, “the court may transfer the case on
its own motion to the proper court location.” 
(Ibid.)
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the
petition is deemed to have been filed on September 21, 2023.  Therefore, the demurrer is overruled.

foregoing, the court orders as follows:
