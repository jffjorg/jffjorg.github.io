And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for attorneys' fees filed by Petitioner Andres Perez. The court has determined that Petitioner is entitled to attorneys' fees in the amount of $127,060.16, which is reduced from the originally requested amount of $158,825.20. The court's decision is based on its discretion to determine a reasonable amount of attorney fees, and the court has applied a 20% negative multiplier to the requested hours to arrive at the award. The court has also noted that the number of attorneys involved in the case may have resulted in inefficiencies, which is why the award is lower than the requested amount.
