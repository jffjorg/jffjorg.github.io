English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file an amended answer filed by Palisades Village Center Associates, LLC, Academy of Technology Art and Music LLC, and Anthony Wamble. The amended answer seeks to add an express agreement/waiver as an affirmative defense. The judge rules that even if the moving defendants unreasonably delayed in making the motion, the opposing party was not prejudiced by the amendment. The judge also notes that the proposed amended pleading will not delay the trial or prejudice the moving defendants in other ways. The judge grants the motion and orders the moving parties to file and serve the amended answer within 10 days.
