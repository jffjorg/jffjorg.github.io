Significant Statements:
  - "To establish a direct and immediate interest in the litigation for purposes of permissive intervention, a non-party seeking intervention must show that he or she stands to gain or lose by direct operation of the judgment, even if no specific interest in the property or transaction at issue exists."
  - "Whether the intervener's interest is sufficiently direct must be decided on the facts of each case."
  - "In order that a party may be permitted to intervene it is not necessary that his interest in the action be such that he will inevitably be affected by the judgment. It is enough that there be a substantial probability that his interests will also be so affected."

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting State Farm's motion to intervene in the case on behalf of its insured, Garibay Transport, Inc. Garibay Transport is a suspended corporation and is unable to defend itself in the action. State Farm has a sufficient interest to intervene to protect its own interests as the insurer of Garibay Transport, and to avoid potential liability under Insurance Code section 11580. The judge notes that the purpose of intervention is to protect the interests of those who may be affected by the judgment, and that State Farm's interest is direct and immediate. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 387, which permits permissive intervention, and Insurance Code section 11580, which allows an insurer to intervene on behalf of its insured. The judge also cites Revenue and Taxation Code section 19719, which permits an insurer or counsel retained by an insurer to provide a defense for a suspended corporation in a civil action.
