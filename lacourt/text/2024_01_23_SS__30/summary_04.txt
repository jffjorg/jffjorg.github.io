And here is a summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling grants the defendant's unopposed motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against American Guard Services (AGS). The cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same occurrence as the main action, namely, the slip and fall incident. The defendant seeks indemnification and contribution from AGS under the doctrine of equitable indemnity and apportionment, as AGS is required to indemnify and contribute to claims caused or contributed to by AGS under their vendor agreement. The Court finds that the defendant has not acted in bad faith and therefore grants the motion.
