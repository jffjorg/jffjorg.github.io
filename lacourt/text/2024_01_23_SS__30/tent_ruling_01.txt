(Quiller Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. A.) Defendant provided several extensions to plaintiff to provide responses, with the most recent due date being May 26, 2023. Despite numerous extensions, Plaintiff has yet to provide any responses to the discovery.As Defendant properly served the request for discovery, and Plaintiff has failed to provide responses, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to a court order directing Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery request served on Plaintiff. Therefore, the motions are granted.Defendant also requests sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.300(c) and 2030.290(c) mandate sanctions when the motion is unsuccessfully opposed. Here, as the motion was not opposed, the request for sanctions is denied.
