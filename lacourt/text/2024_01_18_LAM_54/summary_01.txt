Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the petition to compel arbitration between Uber Technologies, Inc. and Eric Ruiz, et al. regarding wage and hour claims. The court finds that an agreement to arbitrate exists based on the arbitration provision in the Platform Access Agreement executed by Ruiz on January 6, 2020. The court also finds that the request to compel arbitration of the related case appealing the DLSE decision is not properly before the court and must be filed as a separate motion. The court denies the request to stay the DLSE proceedings or the appeal from the DLSE decision.
