And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and motion to strike. The demurrer was filed by the defendants, County of Los Angeles, LAC+USC Medical Center, and Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center, to dismiss the complaint filed by plaintiff Del Deandre Young.

The plaintiff alleges that he developed a pressure sore while in the defendants' care and is suing for dependent adult abuse, negligence, and violation of the Residents' Bill of Rights. The defendants argue that the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations and that the plaintiff's claims for dependent adult abuse fail to allege sufficient facts.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the complaint is OVERRULED, meaning that the plaintiff's claims are not barred by the statute of limitations. The judge has also ruled that the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages is GRANTED, meaning that the plaintiff may not seek punitive damages against the defendants.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file and serve answers to the complaint within 30 days of notice of this ruling.
