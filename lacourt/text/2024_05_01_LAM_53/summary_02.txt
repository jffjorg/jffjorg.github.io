And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the defendant's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories and for sanctions. The defendant served the motion on counsel for the plaintiff, but it appears that the email address used for service is incorrect. The court notes that there may be a defect with service. Therefore, the court is continuing the hearing to give the defendant an opportunity to serve the plaintiff at the correct email address. The court orders the defendant to serve a notice of this ruling on all parties that have appeared in the action and to file a proof of service of the notice of ruling. The defendant must also serve the plaintiff with the moving papers at the correct email address and file a proof of service of that service.
