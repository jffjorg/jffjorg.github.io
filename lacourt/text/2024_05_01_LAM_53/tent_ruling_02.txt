[tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel responses to
  special interrogatories and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Vision Construction
Group, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories and for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Vision Construction Group, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves the
court for an order (1) compelling plaintiff Morillo Construction, Inc.
(“Plaintiff”) to serve responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, and
(2) awarding sanctions in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff in the
amount of $3,611.65.
The court
notes a possible defect with service.
Defendant
served the pending motion on counsel for Plaintiff, Howard S. Blum (“Counsel”)
by electronic service at the email address “howblum@gmail.com.”  (Mot., p. 34:10-13, 34:20-23.)  However, this appears to be the incorrect
email address for Counsel.  First, on
August 5, 2022, Plaintiff filed a “Proof of Service of Summons” on Judicial
Council for POS-010, which listed Counsel’s email address to be
“hblum@albrightblum.com.”  (POS-010 filed
Aug. 5, 2022, p. 1.)  Second, the emails
submitted by Defendant in support of its motion indicate that they were sent
from Counsel at the email address “hblum@albrightblum.com.”  (Rothstein Decl., Ex. 4, p. 1.)  Thus, it appears that Defendant has not
properly served Plaintiff with the pending motion at its Counsel’s correct
email address. 
The court
also notes that Defendant served the subject Special Interrogatories on
Plaintiff at the email address “howblum@gmail.com.”  (Rothstein Decl., Ex. 1, pp. 14:8-12,
15:1-4.)  Thus, although the court does
not reach the merits of this motion since Plaintiff has not been properly
served, the court notes that Defendant may not have served Plaintiff with the
Special Interrogatories at Counsel’s correct email address. 
The court
therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on Defendant’s
motion to give Defendant an opportunity to serve Plaintiff at Counsel’s correct
email address.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendant Vision Construction Group, Inc.’s motion to compel responses to
special interrogatories and for sanctions is continued to June 14, 2024, at
10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders defendant Vision
Construction Group, Inc. (1) to serve a notice of this ruling on all parties
that have appeared in this action and to file a proof of service of the notice
of ruling, and (2) to serve plaintiff Morillo Construction, Inc. with the
moving papers filed in connection with this motion at the proper email address
(or mailing address) for counsel no later than May 14, 2024, and to file a
proof of service of that service with the court. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  May 1, 2024
