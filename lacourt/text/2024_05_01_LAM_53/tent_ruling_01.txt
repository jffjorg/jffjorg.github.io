  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion for summary judgment or,
  in the alternative, summary adjudication
 



 
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication
Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District (“Defendant”) filed, on January 25, 2024, a motion for summary
judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication against plaintiff Eric Jones
(“Plaintiff”), with a hearing date of May 1, 2024.  At the time that Defendant’s motion was
filed, trial was scheduled for February 28, 2024. 
On January 29, 2024, the court
issued a minute order granting in part and denying in part Defendant’s ex parte
application to continue trial, and (1) denied Defendant’s request to continue
trial from February 28, 2024 to a date after the May 1, 2024 hearing date on
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment or adjudication on the ground that
Defendant filed the motion only 34 days before the February 28, 2024 trial date
and therefore did not comply with the notice requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, but (2) granted Defendant’s request to continue trial
to accommodate Defendant’s counsel’s vacation scheduled for mid-February
2024.  (Jan. 29, 2024 Minute Order, p.
1.)  Thus, the court continued trial for
the express purpose of accommodating Defendant’s counsel’s vacation to March
27, 2024.  (Ibid.) 
Thereafter, on March 6, 2024,
the court issued an order denying Defendant’s motion to continue trial to June
5, 2024, so that its motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary
adjudication could be heard based on the court’s finding that Defendant had not
filed its motion within the time limits of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c
by failing to file and serve the motion with 75 days’ notice (plus two court
days’ notice for electronic service) and with enough time to be heard at least
30 days before the then-scheduled trial date of February 28, 2024 or the
then-current March 27, 2024 trial date. 
(Mar. 6, 2024 Order, p. 2:1-17.) 
Also on March 6, 2024,
Plaintiff and Defendant lodged with the court a “Joint Stipulation and
[Proposed] Order to Continue Trial to Accommodate April 16, 2024 Mediation,” in
which the parties “stipulated to a continuance of trial to accommodate the
April 16, 2024 mediation[.]”  (Joint
Stip. & Order, p. 2:16-18.)  The
court entered an order on the parties’ stipulation on March 8, 2024, and
continued trial to June 5, 2024.  (Joint
Stip. & Order, p. 4.)  The parties
did not stipulate to extend the trial date to allow Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication to be heard. 
Based on the court’s finding
in its March 6, 2024 order that Defendant did not have a right to have its
motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication heard
because it was not filed within the time required by Code of Civil Procedure
section 437c, the court orders, nunc pro tunc, that Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication, filed on January 25,
2024, is stricken for that reason as of March 6, 2024.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) 
Thus, the court takes the May
1, 2024 hearing on defendant Los Angeles Unified School District’s motion for
summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication off calendar. 
The court directs the clerk to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  May 1, 2024
