  Order RE:
 
order to show cause re why the court should
  not, on its own motion, reconsider, vacate, and issue new order on plaintiff/
  relator’s code of civil procedure § 170.6 challenge to judge cochran
 



 
Order to Show Cause re why the court should not, on its own motion, (1)
reconsider and vacate Judge Cochran’s March 5, 2024 order accepting
plaintiff/relator Newton W. Kellam’s March 4, 2024 Code of Civil Procedure
section 170.6 challenge against Judge Cochran and reassigning this matter to
Judge Robert B. Broadbelt in Department 53 for all further proceedings, and (2)
issue a new order denying plaintiff/relator Newton W. Kellam’s Code of Civil
Procedure section 170.6 challenge against Judge Cochran
On April 18, 2024, the court
held a Case Management Conference in this action.  On that date, the court issued an Order to
Show Cause why the court should not, on its own motion, (1) reconsider and
vacate Judge Cochran’s March 5, 2024 order accepting plaintiff/relator Newton
W. Kellam’s March 4, 2024 Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 challenge
against Judge Cochran and reassigning this matter to Judge Robert B. Broadbelt
in Department 53 for all further proceedings, and (2) issue a new order denying
plaintiff/relator Newton W. Kellam’s March 4, 2024 Code of Civil Procedure
section 170.6 challenge against Judge Cochran. 
(April 18, 2024 Order, p. 2:3-9.) 
The court (1) set a hearing on the Order to Show Cause for the parties
to be heard on May 1, 2024, and (2) ordered that any response to the Order to
Show Cause shall be filed no later than April 26, 2024.  (April 18, 2024 Order, p. 2:9-11.)
First, the court finds that it
may reconsider the March 5, 2024 order issued by Judge Cochran accepting
plaintiff/relator Newton Kellam’s Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6
challenge because Judge Cochran is unavailable to reconsider the order since he
has been disqualified pursuant to the March 5, 2024 order.  (Geddes v. Superior Court (2005) 126
Cal.App.4th 417, 425-426 [although one trial court may not review the ruling of
another trial court judge, that principle “does not apply where the original judge
is ‘unavailable’”].) 
Second, the court grants its
own motion for reconsideration. 
On August 28, 2018, plaintiff/relator
Newton W. Kellam filed a Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 peremptory
challenge to Judge Nieto, which was accepted and granted on August 31,
2018.  (Aug. 28, 2018 Peremptory
Challenge.)  Thereafter, on March 4,
2024, plaintiff/relator Newton W. Kellam filed a Code of Civil Procedure
section 170.6 peremptory challenge to Judge Cochran, which was accepted and
granted on March 5, 2024.[1]  (Mar. 4, 2024 Decl. of Erik McLain Pursuant
to CCP § 170.6; Mar. 5, 2024 minute order, p. 1.) 
Thus, plaintiff/relator Newton
W. Kellam filed two peremptory challenges pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 170.6.  However, except as
otherwise provided, “no party or attorney shall be permitted to make more than
one such motion in any one action or special proceeding pursuant to this
section.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 170.6, subd. (a)(4).)  Thus, the
court finds that plaintiff/relator Newton W. Kellam’s second Code of Civil
Procedure section 170.6 peremptory challenge to Judge Cochran was
improper.  (Ibid.)  The court further notes that plaintiff/relator
Newton W. Kellam does not dispute this finding. 
(McLain Decl., p. 1:19-21 [“Plaintiff agrees with the Court’s tentative
issued April 18, 2024 that its Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 challenge
to Judge Cochran was improper and should be withdrawn”].) 
The court therefore (1)
vacates the March 5, 2024 order granting plaintiff/relator Newton W. Kellam’s
Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 challenge to Judge Cochran and
reassigning this matter to Judge Robert B. Broadbelt in Department 53, and (2) issues
a new order denying plaintiff/relator Newton W. Kellam’s Code of Civil
Procedure section 170.6 challenge, filed on March 4, 2024, to Judge Cochran.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 170.6, subd. (a)(4).) 
The court orders that this action is reassigned at the direction of
the Assistant Supervising Judge to Judge Steve Cochran in Department 16 at the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
            The court orders plaintiff/relator Newton W. Kellam to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
