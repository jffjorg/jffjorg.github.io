The court notes that the March 5, 2024 minute order states that Judge Cochran
reviewed, accepted, and granted “the Peremptory Challenge filed by Los Angeles
Community College District (Plaintiff) on 08/28/2018 . . . .”  (Mar. 5, 2024 minute order, p. 1.)   The court interprets the reference to the
August 28, 2018 peremptory challenge to be a clerical mistake because the
section 170.6 peremptory challenge to Judge Cochran was filed on March 4, 2024.  Thus, the court interprets the March 5, 2024
minute order as granting the peremptory challenge to Judge Cochran filed by
plaintiff/relator Newton Kellam on March 4, 2024.
