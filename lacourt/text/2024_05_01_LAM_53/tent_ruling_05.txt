  Order RE:
 
defendants’ motion to compel plaintiff’s
  deposition and request for monetary sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants Los Indios de San
Gabriel, Inc., and Andrew Salas
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Emilio Reyes
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition and Request for Monetary
Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc., and Andrew Salas
(“Defendants”) move the court for an order (1) compelling plaintiff Emilio
Reyes (“Plaintiff”) to appear for and testify at a videotaped, in-person
deposition, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendants and
against Plaintiff in the amount of $2,070.
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination . . . , the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a).)  
The court notes that, as a threshold matter, Plaintiff contends that
(1) this motion is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020, and
(2) Defendants did not file a meet and confer declaration that complies with
section 2016.040.  The court disagrees. 
First, the court finds that (1) Defendants timely noticed the
deposition of Plaintiff for February 26, 2024, more than 30 days before the May
15, 2024 trial date, and (2) this motion was scheduled for hearing more than 15
days before the May 15, 2024 trial date, and the court issued an order on April
29, 2024, continuing the hearing on this motion and ordering that the discovery
motion cutoff date is extended for the limited purpose of allowing this motion
to be heard on May 1, 2024.  (Lopez
Decl., Ex. C [Notice of Deposition]; Mar. 6, 2023 Minute Order, p. 1 [setting
trial in this action for May 15, 2024]; Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd.
(a) [“any party shall be entitled as matter of right to complete discovery
proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery
heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of
the action”]; Apr. 29, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  Thus, the court finds that Defendants’ motion
is timely. 
Second, the court finds that Defendants have submitted a meet and
confer declaration that satisfies Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.450, subdivision
(b)(2), and 2016.040 by submitting a declaration establishing that their
counsel (1) met and conferred with Plaintiff regarding his availability for
deposition in November 2023, December 2023, and January 2024, and (2) attempted
to meet and confer with Plaintiff telephonically on March 6, 2024 to schedule
his deposition.  (Lopez Decl., ¶¶ 15, 16,
18, 28, 29; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.450, subd. (b), 2016.040.) 
Thus, the court rules on the merits of Defendants’ motion. 
The court grants Defendants’ motion to compel the deposition of
Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.450, subd. (a).)  The court
notes that Plaintiff appears to be seeking accommodations necessitated by a
medical condition that would allow him to participate in the deposition.  The court acknowledges that Plaintiff has
submitted a letter from his nurse practitioner, Katherine Perry, in which Perry
states that Plaintiff “[w]ould benefit from a small pillow while in session,”
“may need lighting adjusted,” and “needs to be able to stand up as needed due
to medical conditions.”  (Reyes Decl.,
Ex. B to Ex. 3.)  
To the extent that Plaintiff’s opposition – and specifically, his
attached meet and confer letter dated February 20, 2024 – appears to request
accommodations that would facilitate his participation in the deposition, the
court considers each request pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 1.100
as follows: 
·      
Plaintiff requests that Defendants, nonmoving
defendant Alexandra R. McIntosh, and attorney Michael Sisson not be present at
the deposition.  (Reyes
Decl., Ex. 1, p. 2.)  The court denies
this request pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 1.100, subdivision
(f)(3) because it would fundamentally change the nature of the proceeding.  
·      
Plaintiff requests that the deposition be taken
in person, in writing only, and not recorded by video.  (Reyes Decl., Ex. 1, p. 2.)  The court denies this request pursuant to
California Rules of Court, rule 1.100, subdivision (f)(3) because it would
fundamentally change the nature of the proceeding.  
·      
Plaintiff requests a small pillow and ability to
stand.  (Reyes Decl., Ex. 1, p. 2.)  The court grants the request for Plaintiff to
bring a small pillow and to take reasonable, short breaks to stand and move
around, so long as the breaks are not taken while a question is pending. 
·      
Plaintiff requests low light in the room where
the deposition will occur.  (Reyes Decl.,
Ex. 1, p. 2.)  The court grants this
request to the extent reasonably possible to allow parties to conduct the
deposition. 
The court finds that the circumstances presented would make the
imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore denies Defendants’ request for
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  
ORDER
The court grants defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc.,
and Andrew Salas’s motion to compel deposition of plaintiff as follows. 
The court orders plaintiff Emilio Reyes to attend and testify in
person at a deposition to be taken and recorded by counsel for defendants Los
Indios de San Gabriel, Inc., and Andrew Salas on ___________________, 2024, at
10:00 a.m., at Diamond View, 350 10th Avenue, Suite 1000, San Diego,
California, 92101.  
The court orders that, at the deposition of plaintiff Emilio Reyes,
(1) plaintiff Emilio Reyes may bring a small pillow, (2) the lighting
may be adjusted in a reasonable manner, and (3) plaintiff Emilio Reyes may stand
up and take reasonable breaks as needed. 
The court denies defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc., and
Andrew Salas’s request for monetary sanctions.
            The court orders defendants Los
Indios de San Gabriel, Inc., and Andrew Salas to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
