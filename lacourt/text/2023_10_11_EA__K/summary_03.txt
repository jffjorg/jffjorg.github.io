```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied TARPWR's motion to dismiss the case based on Plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order to post a security undertaking. Although the Plaintiff failed to file the undertaking as of September 11, 2023, the Plaintiff's counsel has represented that the "undertaking process" has taken longer than anticipated and that a judicial bond application has been submitted to a local surety company. The court is willing to give the Plaintiff more time to comply with the order and will deny the motion if it is not moot by the time of the hearing on October 11, 2023.
