Legal Standard
“When the plaintiff in an action or special proceeding
resides out of the state, or is a foreign corporation, the defendant may at any
time apply to the court by noticed motion for an order requiring the plaintiff
to file an undertaking . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1030, subd. (a).) “If the
court, after hearing, determines that the grounds for the motion have been
established, the court shall order that the plaintiff file the undertaking in
an amount specified in the court's order as security for costs and attorney's
fees.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1030, subd. (c).)  
“The plaintiff shall file the undertaking not later than 30 days after
service of the court's order requiring it or within a greater time allowed
by the court. If the plaintiff fails to file the undertaking within the
time allowed, the plaintiff's action or special proceeding shall be dismissed
as to the defendant in whose favor the order requiring the undertaking was
made.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1030, subd. (d) (emphasis added).)  
Discussion
TARPWR moves the
court for an order dismissing this matter for Plaintiff’s failure to comply
with the court’s order to post a security undertaking.
TARPWR’s counsel
Sandra Av (“Av”) represents as follows:
On July 24, 2023, the court entered an
“Order Re: Motion for a Security Undertaking Pursuant to California Code of
Civil Procedure Section 1030” (“Order”). (Av Decl., ¶ 9, Exh. A.) The Order
provides, in relevant part, that “Plaintiff is ordered to post a security bond
in the amount of $30,235.00 within 30 days of this order.” (Id.
[emphasis in original].) On July 27, 2023, TARPWR served Plaintiff with a “Notice of Order.” (Id., ¶ 10, Exh.
B.) Plaintiff has failed to file an undertaking as of the September 11, 2023 date
of her declaration. (Id., ¶ 11).
Plaintiff’s counsel Z. Dean Hakkak (“Hakkak”), in turn,
represents that the “undertaking process” has taken longer than anticipated;
that, as of the September 28, 2023 date of his declaration, this office has
submitted a “Judicial Bond Application” to a local surety company, Noddle
Surety & Insurance Services, Inc.; and that he is confident his office will
file the undertaking in advance of the date set for hearing on the instant
motion. (Hakak Decl., ¶ 3).
The instant motion may well be moot as of the time of the
hearing, based upon Hakkak’s above representation; nevertheless, if the motion
is not moot by that time, the court will deny same, inasmuch as Plaintiff is in
the process of compliance.
