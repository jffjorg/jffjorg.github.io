[1]            Fennell represents that the date of
acceptance was June 29, 2022 (Fennell Decl., ¶ 59); Defendant’s counsel Cameron
Major (“Major”), however, attests that Plaintiffs accepted GM’s offer to settle
on June 1, 2021. (Major Decl., ¶ 9). The Section 998 offer attached as Exhibit
1 to Fennell’s Supplemental Declaration lists a June 1, 2021 acceptance date.
Fennell states that “[a]ttached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of the
signed 998 offer. After reviewing the 998 offer, I believe there was an inadvertent
mistake in terms of the dating of the document. There was confusion between the
date it expired and the date we signed and sent it back to the Defendant.”
(Supp. Fennell Decl., ¶ 5). Fennell also includes an email dated June 29, 2022
which reads in totality, “Enclosed please find Plaintiff’s signed 998 offer.” (Id.,
¶ 6, Exh. 2.)

Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1702, subdivision (b)(1) provides that “[a] notice of
motion to claim attorney's fees for services up to and including the rendition
of judgment in the trial court . . . must be served and filed within the time
for filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil
case.” CRC Rule 8.104, subdivision (a), in turn, provides as follows: “(a)
Normal time (1) Unless a statute or rules 8.108, 8.702, or 8.712
provide otherwise, a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest
of: (A) 60 days after the superior court clerk serves on the party filing the
notice of appeal a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a
filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, showing the date either was served; (B) 60
days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party
with a document entitled ‘Notice of Entry’ of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy
of the judgment, accompanied by proof of service; or (C) 180 days after entry of
judgment.”
