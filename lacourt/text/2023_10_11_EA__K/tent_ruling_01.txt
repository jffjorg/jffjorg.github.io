Legal Standard 
 
“Any buyer of consumer goods who is
damaged by a failure to comply with any obligation under this chapter or under
an implied or express warranty or service contract may bring an action for the
recovery of damages and other legal and equitable relief.” (Civ. Code § 1794,
subd. (a).)
 
“If the buyer prevails in an action
under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part
of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the
court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) 

Discussion 
 
Plaintiffs move the
court, per Civil Code § 1794, for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs in the
amount of $55,580.00 (i.e., $20,232.00 in fees, plus 1.5 multiplier enhancement
of $30,348.00, plus $5,000.00 in anticipated fees associated with reviewing the
opposition, preparing the reply and attending the hearing on this instant
motion).

Merits 
 
1.              
Entitlement to Fees
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel Joshua D. Fennell (“Fennell”) represents
that Plaintiffs’ counsel signed a 998 offer extended by Defendant (Fennell
Decl., ¶ 59)[1];
that Plaintiffs obtained a settlement of $193,520.99, which consists of a full
repurchase of the subject vehicle and an additional $111,151.46 in civil
penalty damages (Id., ¶ 81) and that the parties also agreed that
Plaintiffs could seek an award of costs and attorney’s fees recoverable under
Code of Civil Procedure § 1794, subdivision (d) (Id., ¶ 82). 
 
Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiffs are the
prevailing party and, as such, normally would be entitled to an award of
attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to Civil Code § 1794, subdivision (d). 
 
Defendant, however, asserts that the instant motion must be
denied as untimely because the motion is subject a to “180-day [filing]
deadline” after the time which “Plaintiffs signed and accepted [Defendant’s]
settlement offer.” (Opp., 5:5-10). Defendant also asserts that “[t]here is a long history of
caselaw pointing towards settlements serving as ‘judgments’” (Id., 4:25)
and cites to DeSaulles v. Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula
(2016) 62 Cal.4th 1140, 1155 (“DeSaulles”), Goodstein v.
Bank of San Pedro (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 899 (“Goodstein”)
and Madrigal v. Hyundai Motor America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th
385 (“Madrigal”) in support thereof. DeSaulles, however,
determined that a plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses an action after entering
into a monetary settlement is a prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure
§ 1032, subdivision (a)(4). 
 
In Goodstein, the court of
appeal affirmed the trial court’s grant of defendant’s motion to recover expert
witness fees and other costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 998
following a judgment of nonsuit, even though the offer of compromise called for
an entry of dismissal rather than a judgment against defendant; in doing so,
the court of appeal determined that the word “judgment” in Section 998
indicates that the statute contemplates that an offer to compromise that is
accepted will result in the final disposition of the underlying lawsuit. Madrigal
determined that Code of Civil Procedure § 998’s cost-shifting penalty
provisions applied under the facts of that case when an offer to compromise was
rejected and the case ended in settlement. None of these cases determined that
the deadline for filing a motion for attorney’s fees pursuant to California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1702[2] is
“triggered” by the acceptance of a Section 998 offer. Here, no judgment has ever
been entered, nor any dismissal, for any deadline to take effect per CRC
3.1702. 
 
Additionally, as shown in the accepted Section 998 offer,
the parties agreed that “Plaintiffs will file a Request for Dismissal of the
entire action, with prejudice, within five business days after receiving all
payments from GM due Plaintiffs and their counsel.” (Supp. Fennell Decl., ¶ 5,
Exh. 1.) No request for dismissal has been filed, to date. Defendant’s
untimeliness argument contradicts the terms of the accepted Section 998 offer.
 
The court determines that the instant motion is timely.
 
2.         Reasonableness
of Fees
 
The court turns to the issue of reasonableness of the fees
sought. “[T]rial courts have broad discretion in determining the amount of a
reasonable attorney's fee award. This determination is necessarily ad hoc and
must be resolved on the particular circumstances of each case.” (Meister v. Regents of University of
California (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
437, 452.) “Trial judges are entrusted with this discretionary determination
because they are in the best position to assess the value of the professional
services rendered in their courts.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) 
 
“[O]nce a party has established he or she is entitled to
fees, the lodestar method is generally presumed to be the starting point in
analyzing the appropriate amount of attorney fees. Under this method, a court
first calculates the number of hours reasonably spent multiplied by the reasonable
hourly rate for each billing professional, and then may adjust the amount based
on various relevant factors to ensure the fee reflects the fair market value
[of the attorney services] for the particular action. (K.I. v. Wagner (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1412, 1425
[quotation marks and citations omitted].) 
 
a.              
Reasonableness
of Hourly Rates 
 
“In determining
hourly rates, the court must look to the prevailing market rates in the
relevant community. The rates of comparable attorneys in the forum district are
usually used. In making its calculation, the court should also consider the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees. The court
may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market in setting
a reasonable hourly rate.” (Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972,
1009 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)
 
The hourly rates in
this matter are set forth as follows:
 
Joshua Fennell (“Fennell”), attorney - $370.00 and $460.00[3]
            Elaine Astorga (“Astorga”),
paralegal - $175.00 and $200.00[4]
 
Defendant, in turn,
argues that the court should, “[a]t a minimum,” “reduce Counsel’s 2022 and 2023
hourly rates back to their 2021 level, or $370 per hour for Mr. Fennel [sic],
and $175 for Ms. Astorga for any time awarded.” (Opp., 5:22-24).
 
Again, although there appears to be some confusion between
the parties as to when the Section 998 offer was accepted [see footnote one],
this event occurred no later than June 29, 2022 (i.e., before Fennell’s and
Astorga’s hourly rates increased). (Fennell Decl., ¶ 59). The court agrees,
then, that Fennell’s and Astorga’s rates of $370.00 and $175.00, respectively, applicable
as of the date of settlement should apply for all hours expended on this case.
 
b.              
Reasonableness of Time Incurred 
 
“[T]he verified time statements of the attorneys, as
officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of
work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the
specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the
evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice.” (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)
 
Exhibit 16 to
Fennell’s declaration reflects that Astorga expended 5.7 hours in connection
with this action and that Fennell expended 49.8 hours in connection with this
action; 5.7 multiplied by $175.00 equals $997.50 and 49.8 multiplied by $370.00
equals $18,426.00, for a total of $19,423.50. 
 
Fennell attests in his supplemental declaration that he spent
an additional 7 hours reviewing Defendant’s opposition and drafting a reply and
anticipates spending an additional 2 hours preparing for and attending the
hearing on the instant motion, all at $460.00/hour. After Fennell’s hourly rate
is reduced to $370.00, this additional amount equals $3,330.00. The $19,423.50
plus $3,330.00 equals $22,753.50.
 
The court has considered Defendant’s arguments regarding
proposed time reductions on pages 7-9 of Defendant’s opposition and agrees that
reductions of 2 hours’ time for settlement correspondence during the July
2022-February 2023 time period and 0.9 hours for auditing billing records are
warranted, for a reduction of $1,073.00 (i.e., 2.9 hours at $370.00/hour).
 
The $21,680.05 in attorney’s fees should also be reduced an
additional 2.5 hours for time requested in connection with the reply brief and
appearance time, for a reduction of $925.00 (i.e., 2.5 hours at $370.00/hour).
The resulting amount is $20,755.05.
 
c.              
Multiplier 
 
Plaintiffs
assert that they should be awarded a 1.5 multiplier. “[T]he lodestar. . . may
be adjusted by the court based on factors including, . . . (1) the novelty and
difficult of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment
by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. The purpose of
such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular
action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether the
litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill
justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the
fair market rate for such services.” (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131-1132.)
 
The court
determines that Plaintiffs have not articulated any basis warranting the
imposition of a multiplier.    
 
3.
        Conclusion
 
The motion is granted, in the reduced amount of $20,755.05
in attorney’s fees.
