And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a dispute over when the plaintiff, Fennell, accepted a settlement offer from GM. Fennell claims the acceptance date was June 29, 2022, while GM's counsel, Major, claims it was June 1, 2021. The Judge notes that the Section 998 offer attached to Fennell's declaration lists June 1, 2021 as the acceptance date, and Fennell admits that there was a mistake in the dating of the document. The Judge is also considering the timeliness of Fennell's notice of motion to claim attorney's fees, noting that it must be filed within 60 days of the entry of judgment or 180 days after entry. The Judge is also aware that Fennell's and Astorga's hourly rates have increased, with Fennell's rate increasing to $460.00 and Astorga's rate increasing to $200.00. The Judge is considering all of these facts and disputes in making a determination about the case.
