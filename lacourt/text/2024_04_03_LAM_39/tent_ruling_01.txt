  Case Number:  22STCV30451    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  39 Marta Lopez v.
Southern California Permanente Medical Group, et al.
Case No.
22STCV30451
Ex Parte
Application
 
            Defendants
filed an ex parte application to continue the trial date and all related dates
by at least ninety days.  Defendants’
counsel articulates good cause. 
Moreover, the Court has a trial on July 8, 2024, which will proceed on
that date, as well as three other trials on July 9, 2024, two of which are
older than the instant case.  
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court grants Defendants’ ex parte application.  The Court advances and continues the final
status conference and trial dates to the following dates:
 
            Final
Status Conference:        October 11,
2024, at 9:00 a.m. 
 
            Trial:                                       October
22, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. 
 
The discovery and motions deadlines shall be based on the
new trial date.  Due to congestion of the
Court’s calendar, the Court advances and continues the hearing on the motion
for summary judgment from June 10, 2024, to June 17, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
            Defendants’
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
