Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Tiffany Haddish's motion to compel arbitration in this lawsuit. The plaintiff, Trizah Morris, had opposed the motion, arguing that the arbitration clause was unconscionable. The judge finds that the defendant has satisfied her initial burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and that the clause is enforceable. The judge also finds no procedural or substantive unconscionability in the clause. As a result, the case is stayed pending the outcome of arbitration.
