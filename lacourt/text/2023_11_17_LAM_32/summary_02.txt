And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to requests for production filed by Plaintiff Jennifer Linares against Defendant Toluca Lake Collective, Inc. The Plaintiff sought further responses to requests for production, while the Defendant objected, claiming attorney-client privilege and failing to provide sufficient information. The Court found that the Defendant failed to provide adequate responses, despite promising to do so, and therefore granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses. The Defendant is also sanctioned in the amount of $900 for its failure to comply with discovery requests.
