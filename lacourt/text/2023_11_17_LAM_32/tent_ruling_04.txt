     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion to compel deposition 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            This is a landlord-tenant dispute arising
from alleged uninhabitable conditions. Plaintiffs are various tenants residing
at the subject premises. The operative First Amended Complaint, filed February
16, 2023, asserts breach of the warranty of habitability, negligence,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, nuisance, violation of Civil Code
section 1942.4, violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC), and
violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200.
            On October 26, 2023, Defendants
Monarch Apartments Owner LLC, Crescent Canyon Corp., and Manhattan West
Property Management LLC filed the instant motion to compel the deposition of
Plaintiff Garcia. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.     
LEGAL STANDARD
 “If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an
organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document … described in the deposition
notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document …
described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
DISCUSSION
            Defendants served the deposition
notice on October 6, 2023 to Plaintiff’s email. (Mahbubani Decl. ¶ 3.) The
notice scheduled Plaintiff’s deposition for October 23, 2023. (Id., ¶
2.) Plaintiff did not respond to the notice or serve any objections. (Id.,
¶¶ 5-6.) Defendants sent a reminder to Plaintiff of the deposition on October
20, 2023. (Id., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff did not respond to this email either. (Id.,
¶ 8.) Plaintiff failed to appear on October 23, 2023. (Id., ¶ 10.) These
facts warrant an order compelling the deposition.  
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion to compel
deposition is GRANTED. Plaintiff shall appear for deposition on or before
November 21, 2023. Evidentiary sanctions are denied.
