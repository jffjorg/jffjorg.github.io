And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, granting their motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Garcia. The Plaintiff failed to respond to the deposition notice, did not serve any objections, and failed to appear for the deposition scheduled on October 23, 2023. The Judge finds that these facts warrant an order compelling the deposition. The Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition on or before November 21, 2023. The Judge also denies the defendants' request for evidentiary sanctions.
