The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24STCV01461, a Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) action filed by Christina Mendoza against Yoshinoya America, Inc. The defendant has filed a demurrer, arguing that the instant action should be abated due to a concurrent class action complaint, Martinez v. Yoshinoya America, Inc.

The case is stayed pending the plaintiff's motion to amend. The court has also vacated the trial date of April 14, 2025, and set an Order to Show Cause re: Status of the Stay/Martinez PAGA Action/Scope of Leave to Amend.
