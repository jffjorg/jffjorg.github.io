And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the Plaintiffs' application to vacate the pre-filing order and remove from the vexatious litigant list. The Plaintiffs, Judith M. Brown-Williams and Alvin E. Williams, have been declared vexatious litigants since 2015 and have repeatedly filed applications to vacate the pre-filing order and remove from the vexatious litigant list. The court has denied these applications repeatedly and has imposed sanctions on the Plaintiffs.

The court finds that the Plaintiffs have consistently violated orders by filing multiple applications per year and have failed to obtain pre-filing leave of court. The court also finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to provide a new basis for relief and that their applications are without merit.

The court orders that the Plaintiffs remain barred from any new filing with the court on any case or claim and will remain on the vexatious litigant list. The Plaintiffs may file a renewed application for removal from the vexatious litigant list one year from the date of this order—November 6, 2025.
