RESPONDING
PARTY: N/A
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
Application
for Order to Vacate Pre-filing Order and Removal from the Vexatious Litigant
List
 
RULING: Denied.
On
May 5, 2015, and again on September 4, 2015, the court declared Plaintiffs
vexatious litigants, thereby barring them from filing any new actions in the
superior court without obtaining pre-filing leave of court. On October 6, 2016,
the court heard the first of six motions to vacate the underlying
judgment on the action. The court specifically stated that Plaintiffs are
barred from filing any “additional petitions, applications or motions” in this
case.
 
Plaintiffs
filed a motion to vacate for hearing on September 19, 2017. The court denied
the hearing on grounds that Plaintiffs failed to obtain leave from the
presiding judge. On October 12, 2017, the presiding judge in Department 1
denied Plaintiffs motion for leave and instructed Plaintiffs that any motion
for leave must be filed before the court entering the order declaring
Plaintiffs vexatious litigants. 
 
On
October 23, 2017, the court specifically denied the motion for leave to file a
motion to vacate and remove Plaintiffs from the vexatious litigant list. The
court also denied Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend to file a first amended
complaint seeking $100 trillion dollars in damages on the same date. On
December 21, 2017, Department 1 denied Plaintiffs’ motion for leave. On January
17, 2019, April 4, 2019, August 28, 2019, October 16, 2019, January 13, 2020,
and March 3, 2020, the court again denied the motions to vacate the judgment
and remove Plaintiffs from the judicial council litigation list. Meanwhile, on
February 24, 2020, the court denied Plaintiffs separate application for removal
from the vexatious litigant list. 
 
Notwithstanding
the March 3, 2020 order barring any new applications until February 24, 2021,
Plaintiffs again filed a request to vacate, etc. on March 12, 2020 and a second
request on July 2, 2020. The court subsequently set an OSC: Sanctions and
Striking the Application for October 22, 2020, but granted Plaintiffs an
opportunity to withdraw petitions instead of appearing in court. The
applications were withdrawn.
 
Plaintiff
Judith Williams timely filed a renewed application for removal from the
vexatious litigant list on February 26, 2021, which the court considered. The
court denied the application and barred Plaintiffs from filing any renewed
motion for removal from the vexatious litigant list until February 26, 2022.
Notwithstanding the order, Plaintiffs filed additional motions which led to the
imposition of sanctions in the amount of $500 against Plaintiffs on July 13,
2021. 
 
Plaintiffs
filed a motion to set aside/vacate a judgment on February 14, 2022, which both
violated the time frame set out in the prior order by more than one week, but
also constituted a motion other than a request to be removed from the vexatious
litigant list. On April 11, 2022, the motion was denied on this basis, and the
court set another hearing for sanctions.
 
On
March 8, 2023, application before Department 1, whereby the court directed
Plaintiffs back to Department 49. On March 28, 2023, the Second District Court
of Appeal also dismissed Plaintiffs’ appeal, due to their failure to obtain
leave to file an appeal from the administrative presiding judge of the
Appellate Court and then not submit any request in writing how their appeal was
meritorious and not for the purpose of delay or harassment (remittitur filed on
June 7, 2023).
 
Also
on March 28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed separate Applications for Order to Vacate
Pre-filing Order and Removal from the Vexatious Litigant List. On April 11,
2023, the court first found the timing of the filing was premature in that it
was filed before the April 11, 2023, opening date set from the hearing in 2021,
but still elected to consider the petition given the order was filed on the one
year anniversary date. The court again found no basis of relief, and set a new
submission date of April 11, 2024. 
 
On
April 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On August 7, 2023, the
Second District again dismissed Plaintiffs’ appeal, due to their failure to
obtain leave to file an appeal from the administrative presiding judge of the
Appellate Court and then not submit any request in writing how their appeal was
meritorious and not for the purpose of delay or harassment (remittitur filed on
November 13, 2023). On November 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed Applications for
Order to Vacate Pre-filing Order and Removal from the Vexatious Litigant List. On
November 22, 2023, the court first found the timing of the filing was premature
in that it was filed before the April 11, 2024, opening date set from the prior
hearing. The court set an OSC re: Striking the Applications and for Sanctions
for February 6, 2024. Plaintiffs withdrew their applications prior to the
hearing on November 28, 2023.
 
On
November 29, 2023, and January 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed Amended Motions to
Vacate. On February 13, 2024, the court again reiterated the April 11, 2024,
renewed filing date. 
 
On
May 17, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their latest Applications for removal from the
Vexatious Litigant List. On July 10, 2024, Department 1, declined to consider
the application, and directed the parties to Department 68. On August 21, 2024,
the court specially set the hearing.
 
Plaintiffs
are limited to seeking an order vacating the vexatious litigant designation
and/or allowing the filing of a new motion. The previously considered motion
included a 284 paragraph declaration providing a very detailed account
regarding the subject action, including a description of the involvement of any
and all person and entities, no matter how tangential, that interacted with or
became involved some way with Mr. and Mrs. Williams dispute involving the 2004
Bentley vehicle. 
 
The
current application includes a four-page letter dated May 10, 2024, from The
State Bar of California Office of Chief Trial Counsel addressed to Judith
Brown-Williams. The State Bar reviewed the presented information and elected to
close the complaint.
 
The
court again reviews the standard for relief.

(a) A vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order under Section 391.7
may file an application to vacate the prefiling order and remove his or her
name from the Judicial Council’s list of vexatious litigants subject to
prefiling orders. The application shall be filed in the court that entered the
prefiling order, either in the action in which the prefiling order was entered
or in conjunction with a request to the presiding justice or presiding judge to
file new litigation under Section 391.7. The application shall be made before
the justice or judge who entered the order, if that justice or judge is
available. If that justice or judge who entered the order is not available, the
application shall be made before the presiding justice or presiding judge, or
his or her designee.
(b) A vexatious
litigant whose application under subdivision (a) was denied shall not be
permitted to file another application on or before 12 months has elapsed after
the date of the denial of the previous application.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 391.8, subds. (a-b).)
 
“The
clerk may not file any litigation presented by a vexatious litigant subject to
a prefiling order unless the vexatious litigant first obtains an order from the
… presiding judge permitting the filing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 391.7, subd. (c).)
For purposes of this section, ‘litigation’
includes any petition, application, or motion…” (Code Civ. Proc., §
391.7, subd. (d).) 
 
The
court again finds no basis for removal of Plaintiffs from the vexatious
litigant list. The record shows a 20-year history challenging the case in
various trial courts and with the Second Appellate District. Plaintiffs have
systematically sought removal from vexatious litigant list following the 2015
designation, frequently more than once a year. The court finds no new basis for
relief. The court therefore orders that Plaintiffs remain barred from any new
filing with the court on any case or claim. Plaintiffs will also remain on the
vexatious litigant list. Plaintiffs may file a renewed application for removal
from the vexatious litigant list one year from the date of this order—November
6, 2025.
 
Continuous and systematic challenge to the prior judgment and
violation of the order barring more than one application for removal from the
vexatious litigant list per year can constitute a basis for the imposition of
sanctions. Sanctions may be imposed even after judgment has been entered in a
case.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 177.5; See e.g. Day v. Collingwood (2006)
144 Cal. App. 4th 1116, 1125-26.) 
 
Again, Plaintiffs remain barred from filing any application
for removal from the vexatious litigant list until November 6, 2025—one year
from the date of this rejected application.
