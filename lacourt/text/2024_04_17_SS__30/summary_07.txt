And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The motion to consolidate the two cases, 22STCV25040 and 23CHCV03354, is DENIED. The judge finds that the cases are distinct and unrelated, with different parties, issues, and laws involved. The personal injury case involves a negligence cause of action, while the insurance coverage claim involves fraud, which will require elements of proof not at issue in the personal injury litigation. The judge concludes that consolidating the cases would cause jury confusion and prejudice the defendant by requiring disclosure of her insurance to the jury.
