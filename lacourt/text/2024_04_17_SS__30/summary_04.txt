And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The judge has granted the motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories for requests 12.7 and 16.2, and denied it for requests 15.1, 16.3, 16.4, and 16.5. The respondent is ordered to provide further code compliant responses within 20 days. The motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents is granted for requests 17, 37-40, and 42-52, and denied for requests 10 and 26. The respondent is also ordered to provide further code compliant responses within 20 days. The motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories is denied. The judge finds that responses to request 12.7 are deficient and requires the respondent to provide the name, address, and telephone number of the person who inspected the accident scene. The judge also finds that the request for production of documents was not exhaustive and requires the respondent to identify the documents and whether the search was exhaustive. The judge denied the request as to request 18 because the Separate Statement's amended response was unintelligible."
