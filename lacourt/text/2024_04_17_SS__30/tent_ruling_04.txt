Respondent must provide the name, address, and telephone number of the person who went to the scene of the accident to inspect the area and the date that the inspection occurred. If the inspector is an employee or part of the litigation team, then the address and telephone number can be a representative who can contact that person.The Court finds that the responses to the 16 series are adequate except for 16.2 which is not formatted the same.Request for Production of DocumentsRequests 17, 37-40, 42-42.The preamble "The responding party will produce all documents responsive to this request that are within
the responding party’s possession, care, custody, or control" is improper. Responding party must identify what those documents are, and whether the search was exhaustive.The Court denied the request as to Request 18 because the Separate Statement's amended response was unintelligible. However, to the extent that the amended response began with the above preamble, then it should be further amended.Special InterrogatoriesThe Court finds that no further response is necessary.
