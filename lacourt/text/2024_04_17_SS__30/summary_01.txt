And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Vahid Fayazi, moves to set aside the dismissal of the case, alleging that his counsel's mistake and/or excusable neglect led to the dismissal. However, the court finds that the motion is untimely filed, exceeding the six-month time limit provided by Code of Civil Procedure ยง473(b). The court cites several cases, including Austin v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. and Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp., to emphasize the strict enforcement of the six-month time limit. The court denies the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and orders the clerk to give notice.
