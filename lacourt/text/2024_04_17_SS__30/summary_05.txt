And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to set aside the entry of default. The defendants argue that the plaintiff did not serve them properly, as the address where they were served does not correspond to their actual residence. The plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that the defendants were served at the address 11049 McCormick St Apt 306, North Hollywood, CA 91601-6201, but the defendants have submitted evidence showing that this address is not their dwelling, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address. The burden is on the plaintiff to prove the facts requisite to an effective service, but the plaintiff has failed to do so. Therefore, the default judgment is void and the motion to set aside is granted.
