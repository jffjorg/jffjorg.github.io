  - "A hirer generally has no duty to act to protect the contractor's employee when the contractor fails in that task."
  - "A hirer actually exercises control when it involves itself...such that the contractor is not entirely free to do the work in the contractor's own manner."
  - "Where the contractor's conduct is the immediate cause of injury, the affirmative contribution requirement can be satisfied only if the hirer in some respect induced -- not just failed to prevent -- the contractor's injury-causing conduct."

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the second cause of action for dangerous condition of public property. The court finds that the Privette doctrine bars the plaintiff's claim because the defendant, Caltrans, hired the contractor, PPM, to perform the work and did not retain control over the methods of the work or the manner in which PPM's employees performed their tasks. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether Caltrans retained control over jobsite safety and exercised that control in a way that affirmatively contributed to the plaintiff's injuries. The court concludes that the defendant is entitled to summary adjudication as to the second cause of action for dangerous condition of public property.
