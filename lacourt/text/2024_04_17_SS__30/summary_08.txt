And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is that the Motion to Consolidate the case with 23VECV0102 is DENIED. The Judge notes that the two cases are related to the same accident, but the Defendant has not complied with the California Rules of Court, specifically rule 3.350(a)(3), by failing to file a notice of this motion in 23VECV0102. Additionally, the Judge notes that six of the named defendants have not been served, and the complaint was filed over a year ago. The Court orders the Judicial Assistant to calendar an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re failure to file proof of service of summons and complaint upon the remaining named defendants within 60 days. The OSC will address the failure to comply with California Rules of Court rule 3.110(b) and (f) and the failure to obtain an extension of time to serve the pleadings. The Judge also orders the Clerk to give notice of the OSC.
