MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
FORM INTERROGATORIES FROM POTOMAC RIVER PRODUCTIONS, LLC
Plaintiff Dan Sackheim
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Potomac
River Productions, LLC (“Potomac”) to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s
Form Interrogatories, numbers 15.1, 16.1, 16.9, and 16.10, and (2) awarding sanctions
in favor of Plaintiff and against Potomac in the amount of $5,469.
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Potomac’s further
responses to Form Interrogatories, numbers 15.1, 16.1, and 16.9, because
Potomac’s answers to those interrogatories are evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Potomac’s further
responses to Form Interrogatories, number 16.10 because Potomac’s answer to
that interrogatory is not evasive or incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).)
In light of the mixed results of the court’s ruling on this motion,
the court finds that the circumstances presented make the imposition of
sanctions unjust and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions against Potomac.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
FORM INTERROGATORIES FROM GENRE ARTS, INC.
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling defendant Genre Arts, Inc. (“Genre Arts”) to serve
further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, numbers 3.7, 4.1, 4.2,
15.1, 16.1, and 16.9, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Genre Arts in the amount of $5,469. 
(Nov. 29, 2023 Not. of Partial Withdrawal, p. 2:6-9.) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Genre Arts’ further
responses to Form Interrogatories, numbers 3.7, 4.1, as to subdivisions (c) and
(g), 15.1, 16.1, and 16.9, because Genre Arts’ answers to those interrogatories
are evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court denies motion to compel Genre Arts’ further responses to
Form Interrogatories, number 4.2 because Genre Arts’ answer to that
interrogatory is not evasive or incomplete. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
In light of the mixed results of the court’s ruling on this motion,
the court finds that the circumstances presented make the imposition of
sanctions unjust and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions against Genre Arts.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
FORM INTERROGATORIES FROM CARLTON CUSE PRODUCTIONS
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling defendant Carlton Cuse Productions (“CC Productions”)
to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, numbers 4.1,
15.1, 16.1, and 16.9, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against CC Productions in the amount of $5,469. 
(Nov. 29, 2023 Not. of Partial Withdrawal, p. 2:6-9.) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel CC Productions’ further
responses to Form Interrogatories, 4.1, as to subdivisions (c) and (g), 15.1,
16.1, and 16.9 because CC Productions’ answers to those interrogatories are
evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court finds that the circumstances presented make the imposition
of sanctions unjust and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions against CC Productions.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
