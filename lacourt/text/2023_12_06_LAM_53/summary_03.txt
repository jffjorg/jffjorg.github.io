```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories filed by the plaintiff, Dan Sackheim, against three defendants: Potomac River Productions, LLC, Genre Arts, Inc., and Carlton Cuse Productions. The court grants the motions in part, compelling the defendants to provide further responses to certain interrogatories, but denies the motions in part, finding that the defendants' answers to other interrogatories are not evasive or incomplete.

The court finds that the defendants' answers to interrogatories numbers 15.1, 16.1, and 16.9 are evasive and incomplete, and orders them to provide further, full, and complete answers within 20 days. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendants, finding that the circumstances presented do not warrant the imposition of sanctions.

The court orders the plaintiff to serve notice of this ruling and sets a deadline of 20 days for the defendants to comply with the court's order.
