The court makes this determination based on the understanding that Bazille,
Green, and Leavitt are all part of plaintiff’s protected class (i.e., her sex
and gender as a female), because “[t]he ‘me-too’ doctrine . . . does not permit
a plaintiff to present evidence of discrimination against employees outside of
the plaintiff’s protected class to show discrimination or harassment of the
plaintiff.”  (Compl., ¶ 19 [alleging
that “Plaintiff’s sex/gender (female) made her a member of a protected class
pursuant to FEHA”]; Pinter-Brown, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at p.
96.)
