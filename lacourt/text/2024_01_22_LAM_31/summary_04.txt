```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is not awarding attorney's fees and costs to the Nonparty Developers. The Nonparty Developers were not residents of Redondo Beach and therefore were not eligible to bring the action. The judge is relying on the California Supreme Court's opinion in Travis v. Brand (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 240, which held that a prevailing defendant should not be awarded fees and costs unless the court finds that the action was objectively without foundation when brought, or the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so. The judge is also rejecting the Nonparty Developers' argument that attorney's fees can be awarded under section 1021.5 to non-parties, as this is not relevant to the case at hand. The judge's ruling is based on the principle that a prevailing defendant should not be awarded fees and costs unless the court finds that the action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.
