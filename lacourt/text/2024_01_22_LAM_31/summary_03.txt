And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for attorney fees filed by the Nonparty Developers (Redondo Beach Waterfront, LLC, Fred Bruning, Jean Paul Wardy). The Nonparty Developers argued that they were prevailing parties under the Political Reform Act (PRA) and were entitled to fees under CCP section 1021.5. However, the judge found that the Nonparty Developers were not parties to the action and therefore did not meet the definition of prevailing parties under the PRA. The judge also found that the Nonparty Developers did not meet the requirements for attorney fees under CCP section 1021.5, including the requirement that the party has conferred a significant benefit to the general public or a large class of people. The judge noted that the public at large did not know or care about the issues in the case and that the claim for fees fails element one of the test under CCP section 1021.5.
