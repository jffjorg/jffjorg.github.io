**Significant Statements**
```
"The primary and fundamental subject of inquiry is as to whether the money is to be used for a public or private purpose. If it is for a public purpose it is not generally speaking, to be regarded as a gift." (San Diego County v. Hammond)
"The determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature, and its discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis."
"The Legislature's purpose in passing AB 218 was to assure that victims of childhood sexual abuse receive justice."
