child sexual abuse case.  On July 12,
2023, Plaintiff, D.S., filed a Complaint against Defendants, County of Los
Angeles (“County”), Ninos Latinos Unidos, (“NLU”), and Does 3 through 25, alleging
she was sexually abused in foster care while under Defendants’ legal custody,
care, and control.
 
            On August 16,
2023, NLU filed this motion to strike punitive damages from the Complaint.  At the hearing for the motion on November 7,
2023, the parties represented to the court that this matter may be deemed as
complex.  The parties further requested
that the Hearing on Motion to Strike be heard when the case is reassigned.  Accordingly, the court set the Motion to
Strike on 01/22/2024 for tracking purposes.

            On January
10 and 11, 2024, the County and NLU, respectively, filed Case Management
Statements indicating that this matter has been deemed complex and is awaiting reassignment.
 
            Accordingly,
the court will continue the Motion to Strike to March 22, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  The court will also inquire of the status of
reassignment to the complex department.
