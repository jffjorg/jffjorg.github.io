[1] These facts are adapted from the
Court of Appeal’s opinion in Travis v. Brand (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 240,
245 (Travis I), rev’d and remanded, Travis v. Brand (2023) 14
Cal.5th 411, 523 (Travis II). 
 


[2] Throughout their papers RBW, Bruning, and Wardy refer
to themselves collectively as the “Developer Parties”.  They do so, no doubt, to suggest that they
were parties to the action.  But they
were not parties.  This court will refer
to them in the same manner as the court of appeal – nonparties.   


[3] Brand, Brand for Mayor 2017, and
Moffat filed a Joinder to Nehrenheim’s opposition.


[4] Nonparty Developers could not have
been plaintiffs in this action.  Gov.
Code section 91003, subdivision (a) permits “[a]ny person residing in the
jurisdiction” to sue for injunctive relief to enjoin violations or to compel
compliance with the provisions of the Political Reform Act.  (Emphasis added.)  As Defendants point out, the Nonparty
Developers were not residents of Redondo Beach and were therefore barred from
bringing this action. Nonparty Developers do not contest this point.


[5] As stated in Travis III:
“[W]e conclude applying an asymmetrical standard to fee awards under the
Political Reform Act is consistent with the principles outlined by our high
court in Christiansburg. To reiterate, under the asymmetrical standard,
a prevailing defendant “should not be awarded fees and costs unless the
court finds the action was objectively without foundation when brought, or the
plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.” (Williams, supra,
61 Cal.4th at p. 115, 186 Cal.Rptr.3d 826, 347 P.3d 976; accord, Christiansburg,
supra, 434 U.S. at p. 421, 98 S.Ct. 694 [prevailing defendants may
recover only when “the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or
without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith”].)” (Travis
III, supra, 14 Cal.5th at pp. 427–28.)
 


[6] Nonparty Developers citation to Chaparral Greens v.
City of Chula Vista (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1134 (Chaparral
Greens) Chaparral Greens is inapposite.  Chaparral Green involved the recovery
of costs, not fees.  
   


[7] CCP section 1032 “does not
purport to define the term ‘prevailing party’ for all purposes.” (Galan v. Wolfriver
Holding Corp. (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1128.)  California courts have uniformly rejected the
premise that a litigant who prevails under CCP § 1032 is “ ‘necessarily the
prevailing party for purposes of attorney fees[.]’ ”  (Galan, at pp. 1128-1129; see also Pacific
Custom Pools, Inc. v. Turner Construction Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1254,
1271, fn. 13 [“[T]he determination of the prevailing party for the purposes of
costs is not controlling as to the issue of prevailing party for the
entitlement of attorney's fees.’ ”].)  


[8] Nonparty Developers cite Save Our Heritage
Organization v. City of San Diego (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 154 (SOHO)
for the proposition that attorney’s fees can be awarded under section 1021.5 to
non-parties.  Maybe so and maybe under
certain circumstances not found here. 
Indeed, SOHO is not helpful to Nonparty Developers’ cause because
the Committee in SOHO, unlike the Nonparty Developers here, satisfied the
essential elements of the private attorney general statute. 


[9] Indeed, the California Supreme
Court Opinion did not mention the Nonparty Developers, let alone discuss the
issue relevant to the Nonparty Developers -- the appropriateness of a judgment
entered against a nonparty.  And
ultimately the Nonparty Developers cannot overcome the Travis III Court’s
opinion that no party enforced an important right affecting the public interest or conferred a significant benefit to the general public or
a large class of people. Indeed, in the final analysis, Nonparty Developers
pursued their appeal to untangle themselves from the improper judgment entered against
them, not in pursuit of a larger public interest.
