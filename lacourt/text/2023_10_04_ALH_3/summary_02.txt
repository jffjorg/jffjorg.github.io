And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel defendant US GC Investment, LP's responses to form interrogatories will be continued to a later date. The defendant's counsel, Charles C. McKenna, has stated that a change in staff resulted in the discovery requests being overlooked, and that the verifications for the previous responses have been located, but not for the form interrogatories. The Court has granted the defendant's request for a brief continuance to allow additional verified responses to be provided. The Court expects that the motions will be taken off calendar if the defendants provide the verified responses, and is not inclined to impose sanctions in these circumstances. The new hearing date is to be determined, but will be scheduled for November at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse.
