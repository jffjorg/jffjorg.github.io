## Summary of Tentative Ruling: City of Pasadena v. Caltech

**Case Number:** 21AHCV00070

**Plaintiff:** City of Pasadena

**Defendant:** California Institute of Technology (Caltech)

**Facts:**

* Pasadena alleges that Caltech's operations at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) contaminated Pasadena's drinking water wells (Sunset and Eastside wells).
* The EPA designated JPL as a Superfund site in 1992 and issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in 2018 addressing contamination, but excluding Pasadena's wells.
* Pasadena filed this lawsuit seeking remediation costs from Caltech.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Forum Non Conveniens:** Caltech argues that this case should be stayed and heard in federal court, as the EPA's involvement is crucial due to the Superfund designation.

**Judge's Reasoning:**

* The Judge finds that Caltech's arguments are similar to those previously rejected by the Court and the Second Appellate District.
* NASA and EPA haven't indicated a need to be involved in the litigation.
* Staying the case and allowing federal litigation to proceed first would cause undue delay.
* California has a strong interest in ensuring clean drinking water for its residents.

**Ruling:**

* Caltech's motion to stay is **denied without prejudice**.


**Key Points:**

* Judge emphasizes that this ruling doesn't preclude Caltech from filing a renewed motion to stay in the future if circumstances change.
* The case will proceed in state court for now, but Caltech can seek to move it to federal court later.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion to stay the action filed by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) against the City of Pasadena. Caltech had argued that the action should be stayed pending the outcome of a federal lawsuit it had filed, citing the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The judge found that Caltech had failed to meet its burden of showing that the federal court was a more suitable forum for the action. The judge noted that Caltech had previously argued that the action should be dismissed or stayed, and that the same arguments were being made again. The judge also found that the facts underlying the case had not changed since the last hearing, and that new facts had not been presented that would persuade the court that the federal court was a more suitable forum.

The judge also noted that the state court action was filed first and was the first to acquire jurisdiction, and that staying the action would cause undue delay. The judge denied the motion to stay, but did so without prejudice, meaning that Caltech may file a renewed motion to stay if the federal lawsuit is resolved in its favor.

English text:
This tentative ruling is for a hearing in the Superior Court of the State of California, Northeast District, Los Angeles County, for Case Number 21AHCV00070. The hearing is scheduled for October 4, 2023, in Department 3. The case involves the City of Pasadena (plaintiff) and the California Institute of Technology (defendant), with the United States and NASA as additional parties.

The case concerns the contamination of Pasadena's drinking water supply wells, which are located in the Raymond Groundwater Basin. Pasadena alleges that the contamination was caused by the management and operation of the JPL Facility, which is owned by NASA and operated by Caltech. The JPL Facility is a federally-funded research and development center and is listed as a Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).

In April 2022, Judge Colin P. Leis denied Caltech's demurrer or motion to dismiss or stay the action based on the doctrine of "primary jurisdiction". Caltech had argued that the action could not continue without joining the United States as a "necessary party" because Pasadena's allegations assume, as a matter of law, that the contamination of the Sunset and Eastside Wells will become a "facility" under CERCLA, and any remediation efforts will require EPA approval. Judge Leis found that the United States was not a necessary party to the action and emphasized that the United States, through the EPA, has declared that the JPL facility did not include the Sunset and Eastside wells.

On March 8, 2023, the Second Appellate District of the Court of Appeal denied Caltech's petition for writ of mandate. The court left open the possibility of a stay if Pasadena "proves its underlying contention that the contamination is from the Jet Propulsion Lab", so that new information could be presented to the EPA, which might then take over remediation efforts and amend its ROD.

On August 21, 2023, Caltech filed a motion for a stay based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens. On September 11, 2023, Pasadena filed its opposition brief. On September 14, 2023, Caltech filed a complaint in the Central District of California against Pasadena and the United States for cost recovery under CERCLA and declaratory relief. On September 18, 2023, Caltech filed its reply brief.

The legal standard for forum non conveniens requires the court to consider whether the alternate forum is a suitable place for trial and the private and public interests of the litigants. The moving party bears the burden of establishing both components in the analysis.

In this case, Caltech argues that the Central District is a suitable alternative forum because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over CERCLA cost recovery claims and may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Pasadena's state law claims if Pasadena brings them as counterclaims. Caltech also argues that federal court is more suitable for Pasadena's claims because only there may the United States be brought into the litigation in federal court and federal involvement is necessary because the EPA must approve any proposed remedial action.

However, Caltech fails to meet its burden of showing that Pasadena's claims should be tried in federal court. The facts underlying Judge Leis's initial finding that the United States is not a necessary party have not changed, and no new facts have been presented which would persuade the Court that the same outcome – trying Pasadena's state law claims in federal court – should result, even under the more discretionary standard of forum non conveniens.

Therefore, Caltech's motion to stay is denied without prejudice.
