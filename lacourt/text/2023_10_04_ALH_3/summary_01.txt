Significant Statements:
  - "The doctrine of forum non conveniens is an equitable doctrine invoking the discretionary power of a court to decline to exercise the jurisdiction it has over a transitory cause of action when it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere." (Stangvik v. Shiley Inc.)
  - "The Court notes that Caltech made these same arguments and requests in its demurrer and motion to dismiss, as well as its supplemental briefing provided to the Court of Appeal. Specifically, in its supplemental brief, Caltech urged the Second Appellate District to dismiss the case without prejudice or stay it 'unless and until EPA approves Pasadena's proposed remedial action or the JPL facility is removed from the National Priorities List by EPA and is no longer a Superfund site.'"
