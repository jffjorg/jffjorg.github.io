  DEMURRER



 
I.        INTRODUCTION
This case arises
out of a payment dispute between Plaintiffs Edwin Kwon MD (“Kwon”), Jason
Bailey MD (“Bailey”), Lone Star Surgical Partners, P.A. (“Lone Star”), Patrick
Shih MD (“Shih”)(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) and Defendants Blue Cross of
California dba Anthem Blue Cross (“Blue Cross”) and Anthem Blue Cross Life and
Health Insurance Company (“Blue Cross Insurance”)(collectively, “Defendants”).
Kwon has his primary office in California. Bailey, Lone Star, and Shih all have
their primary offices in Houston, Texas. Plaintiffs, all medical providers,

III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007
(citation omitted); see also Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.
(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed
to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally
construed. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).)  
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See
Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court
to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a), emphasis
added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of
the meet and confer process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
          Defendants
filed a declaration attesting to the parties’ meet and confer efforts, which consisted
of an email and telephone call. (See Declaration of Adam Pullano filed September
6, 2024, ¶¶ 2-4.). The
Court finds Defendants have complied with their meet and confer obligations.

V.       ANALYSIS  
As a
preliminary matter, the Court notes Plaintiffs, in their Opposition, state they
will dismiss their fourth cause of action for promissory estoppel. (See Opposition,
pg. 14.) As that was the only cause of action alleged against Blue Cross
Insurance, Blue Cross Insurance shall be dismissed from the action and the
Court will consider Defendants’ Demurrer as it applies to Plaintiffs’
allegations against Blue Cross only. 
A.            
As Currently Pleaded, Plaintiffs are
Properly Joined.
Code of Civil
Procedure § 430.10(d) provides that a demurrer may be brought on grounds of
misjoinder of parties. “[A] defendant may not make allegations of defect or
misjoinder of parties in the demurrer if the pleadings do not disclose the
existence of the matter relied on; such objection must be taken by plea or
answer.” (Harboring Villas Homeowners Ass’n v. Superior Ct. (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 426, 429.)
“All
persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if: (1) They assert any right to
relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative, in respect of or arising out
of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences
and if any question of law or fact common to all these persons will arise in
the action; or (2) They have a claim, right, or interest adverse to the
defendant in the property or controversy which is the subject of the action.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 378(a).)
Defendants
argue Plaintiffs have not corrected the issues this Court previously found
prevented it from finding joinder was proper. (See Demurrer, pp. 5-7.) Defendants
acknowledge Plaintiffs have added “new allegations that the Texas Plaintiffs
rendered their services in Texas to patients who reside in both Texas and
California and have health plans or insurance contracts in California that
process and determine reimbursement for out-of-network medical claims.” (See
id. at 5, citing SAC, ¶¶ 14, 18, 19, 103, fn. 3.) Defendants reiterate,
however, that these additions do nothing to establish “that the Texas
Plaintiffs are subject to California law regarding reimbursement for
out-of-network care provided in California.” (See id. at 6.) 
In
opposition, Plaintiffs (as they did in opposition to Defendants’ previous
Demurrer) argue joinder is permissible here because they allege a common scheme
of liability. (See Opposition, pg. 7.) Plaintiffs also note “Defendants
cite no case – because there is none – holding that joinder is improper because
patients’ residency ‘does not provide any basis to ignore the state and
governing law under which the services were provided.’” (Id., citing Demurrer,
pg. 6.)
The
Court agrees with Plaintiffs and finds joinder is proper. As the Court found in
its Order on Defendants’ previous Demurrer, Plaintiffs have alleged a common
plan of liability: Defendants’ alleged failure to fully reimburse Plaintiffs
for their services as allegedly required under California’s Knox-Keene Health
Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (“Knox-Keene Act”), specifically Code Regs. §
1300.71(a)(3)(B). (See Order issued July 2, 2024.) Plaintiffs have also
clarified the factual confusion present in their FAC. In their SAC, Plaintiffs
allege the patients in Texas “were residents of Texas and California and
members or beneficiaries of health plans sponsored, funded, operated,
controlled and/or administered by DEFENDANTS.” (SAC, ¶ 18.) Plaintiffs thus
make clear the patients treated in Texas also lived in California and had
California health insurance through Defendant Blue Cross of California. Because
the parties remain at the pleading stage, because joinder is permissive, and
because Defendants do not provide this Court with a reason why Plaintiffs
cannot be joined as a matter of law, Plaintiffs’ additional allegations
are sufficient to permit joinder.   
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendants’ Demurrer as to misjoinder.

B.            
Unfair Business Practices
Unfair
competition is defined as “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
act or practice.” (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.) “‘Practice’ consists
of the ‘habitual doing of certain things, the doing of an act more than once.’ Black’s
Law Dictionary, 3d edition, defines ‘Practice’ as ‘Repeated or customary
action.’” (Wilson v. Stearns (1954) 123 Cal.App.2d 472, 479
(citation omitted).) By proscribing “any unlawful” business act or
practice, the unfair competition law (“UCL”) “borrows” rules set out in other
laws and makes violations of those rules independently actionable. (See
Zhang v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal.4th 364, 370.) A “violation of
another law is a predicate for stating a cause of action under the UCL’s
unlawful prong.” (Berryman v. Merit Property Management, Inc.
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.) 
In suits
based on the Knox-Keene Act, a plaintiff “may as a general matter state a claim
under the unfair competition law” if the plaintiff states a claim under the
unlawful prong under UCL because, in doing so, the plaintiff shows “the
challenged practice violates a California ‘statute or regulation.’” (Long
Beach Memorial Med. Center v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (2021) 71
Cal.App.5th 323, 342 (“Long Beach Memorial”) (citation omitted).) In
doing so, a plaintiff can receive “two types of relief—namely, restitution and
injunctive relief.” (See id., citing Bus. & Prof. Code § 17203 and Kasky
v. Nike, Inc. (2002) 27 Cal.4th 939, 950.) Injunctive relief is the primary
form of relief, but relief does not include consequential or punitive damages.
(See Long Beach Memorial, 71 Cal.App.5th at 342, citing Korea Supply Co.
v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1148, and Inline,
Inc. v. Apace Moving Systems, Inc. (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 895, 904.) Injunctive
relief that seeks an order enjoining a company from violating the Knox-Keene
Act by underpaying for future emergency medical services, however, is legally
unavailable because “such an injunction would be so vague that persons of
common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its
application; as such, it would be invalid and could not form the basis for the
potent weapon of contempt.” (See Long Beach Memorial, 71 Cal.App.5th at
343 (cleaned up).)
Defendants
argue: (1) Plaintiffs continue to challenge Blue Cross’s methodology; (2) The
Court should thus abstain from ruling on Plaintiffs’ UCL cause of action because
to do so would “encroach on regulatory authority the California legislature
entrusted exclusively to the DMHC by rendering a ruling on the propriety of its
methodology;” and (3) Plaintiffs’ UCL cause of action does not allege any
unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent actions on the part of Blue Cross. (Demurrer, pp.
8-14.) 
In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue they are not challenging Blue Cross’s methodology
but are “simply seeking restitution of the money BLUE acquired by such unfair
competition and unlawful business practices.” (Opposition, pg. 9.) 
   The Court again finds Plaintiffs seek to
challenge the methodology employed by Blue Cross. The Court acknowledges Plaintiffs’
efforts to alter their allegations in their SAC and avoid allegations against
Blue Cross’s methodology. (Compare FAC, ¶¶ 34, 132(b), (d) and SAC, ¶¶
32, 137.) However, Plaintiffs’ SAC still contains either direct challenges to
Blue Cross’s methodology[2]
or reworded, indirect challenges to Blue Cross’s methodology.[3]
Plaintiffs in their SAC also still improperly seek to enjoin Blue Cross “from
utilizing or employing unilateral payment practices that significantly
underpays each of the PLAINTIFFS’ claims.” (SAC, ¶ 143.) Plaintiffs may bring a
UCL claim for violations of the Knox-Keene Act, but such claims must only
be based on challenging “the actual reasonable and customary value derived from
[a health care service plan’s] methodology”, not on an attempt to “enjoin the
methodology Blue Shield uses under Section 1300.71(a)(3)(B) and
the Gould factors.” (NorthBay Healthcare Group - Hospital
Division v. Blue Shield of California Life & Health Insurance (N.D.
Cal. 2018) 342 F.Supp.3d 980, 987.)
Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS Defendants’ Demurrer as to Plaintiffs’
third cause of action for unfair business practices against Blue Cross WITH
LEAVE TO AMEND. Again, because the Court is sustaining Defendants’ Demurrer for
the reasons stated above, the Court does not find it necessary to address
Defendants’ abstention argument. (See Long Beach Memorial, 71 Cal.App.5th
at 344, citing Alvarado v. Selma Convalescent Hosp. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th
1292, 1297-98, and Hambrick v. Healthcare Partners Med. Grp., Inc. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 124, 150.)
C.            
Promissory Estoppel 
Plaintiffs
state they will dismiss their fourth cause of action for promissory estoppel. (See
Opposition, pg. 14.) As that was the only cause of action alleged against
Blue Cross Insurance, the Court orders Plaintiffs to dismiss Blue Cross
Insurance from the action. 
VI.    
CONCLUSION
Based on
the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES Defendants’
Demurrer as to misjoinder and SUSTAINS WITH LEAVE TO AMEND Defendants’ Demurrer
as to Plaintiff’s third cause of action for unlawful business practices. 
Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of action for promissory estoppel is
dismissed by stipulation.  
Plaintiffs shall file a third amended
complaint and shall dismiss Blue Cross Insurance on or before November 8, 2024.

          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      ­­­­October 22, 2024
