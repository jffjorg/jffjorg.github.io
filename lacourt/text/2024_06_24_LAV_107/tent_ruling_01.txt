COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  RULING RE: 
(1)
  Demurrer
(2) Leave
  to Amend 
 



 
 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE
CASE]:        
 
Defendant Kynkai Naope demurs to the complaint filed
by plaintiff Marie-Lise
Sagine Archer. Plaintiff Marie-Lise
Sagine Archer moves for leave to amend the complaint and file a first amended
complaint. This court grants the motion for leave to amend and denies the
demurrer as moot.
 
I.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff
Marie-Lise Sagine Archer (“Plaintiff”) entered a personal relationship with
defendant Kynkai Naope (“Defendant”) in 2016. (Complaint p. 1.) Over the next
few years, Plaintiff lent Defendant money, but in October 2021, parties ended
their relationship and Defendant refused to repay Plaintiff. (Id. at pp. 2–3.) 
 
On
April 10, 2024, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint (the
“Complaint”) alleging causes of action for fraud and intentional infliction of
emotional distress.
 
On
May 22, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”), which Plaintiff
opposed on June 10, 2024.
 
On
June 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion (the “Motion”) for leave to amend the Complaint
and file a first amended complaint (the proposed “FAC”).
 
III. LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“The
court may…, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon
any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding….” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §¿473, subd. (a)(1).) “A trial court has wide discretion to
allow the amendment of¿pleadings, and generally courts will liberally allow
amendments at any stage of the proceeding.” (Falcon v. Long Beach Genetics,
Inc. (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1280.) “The policy favoring amendment is
so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be
justified.” (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) “Time and knowledge are important factors to be considered when granting
or denying a¿motion¿to¿amend.” (Stockton v. Ortiz (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d
183, 194.) “If the¿motion¿to¿amend¿is timely made and the granting of
the¿motion¿will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse
permission to¿amend¿and where the refusal also results in a party being
deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious
defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v.
Superior Court of Cal. In and For Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d
527, 530.) A court may grant leave to amend to add new causes of action, except
an amendment may not be permitted where “an attempt is made to state facts
which give rise to a wholly distinct and different legal obligation against the
defendant” and “a change is made in the liability sought to be enforced against
the defendant.” (Klopstock v. Superior Court in and for the City and County
of San Francisco (1941) 17 Cal.2d 13, 20.)¿ 
 
“[T]he
filing of an amended complaint renders moot a demurrer to
the original complaint.” (JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468,
477.)
 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff
seeks to add four new causes of action in the proposed FAC: (1) breach of
contract, (2) conversion, (3) quantum meruit, and (4) declaratory relief. Plaintiff
also seeks to add more detailed factual allegations to support her causes of
action. 
 
A
trial date has not yet been set and Plaintiff brings the Motion after the
filing of the Demurrer. This case remains in an early stage of litigation, and
we do not believe that granting the Motion will prejudice the Defendants
because of any delay. 
 
Although
Plaintiff seeks to add factual allegations, these factual allegations are
already generally referred to in the Complaint or arise from the same events
and transactions alleged in the Complaint. The new factual allegations do not “give
rise to a wholly distinct and different legal obligation against the
defendant.” Additionally, the liability sought to be enforced against Defendant
is unchanged. Therefore, it is permissible for these factual allegations to be
added. And, to the extent that the new causes of action arise from the same
general facts alleged in the Complaint, which we find that the causes of action
Plaintiff seeks to add through the proposed FAC do, they are also permissible.
 
This
court has broad discretion to liberally grant leave to amend so long as such
amendment does not prejudice the other party. We find that no prejudice to the
other party will result from the proposed amendments in this case. 
 
Accordingly,
this court GRANTS the Motion.
 
Because
the proposed FAC replaces the Complaint, the Demurrer is thereby rendered moot.
 
Accordingly,
this court DENIES the Demurrer as moot.
