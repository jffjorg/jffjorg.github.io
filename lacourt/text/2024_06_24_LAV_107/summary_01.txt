And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a demurrer filed by the defendant and a motion for leave to amend the complaint filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff, Marie-Lise Sagine Archer, seeks to add four new causes of action to the complaint and to add more detailed factual allegations to support her causes of action. The court grants the motion for leave to amend and denies the demurrer as moot. The court finds that the proposed amendments will not prejudice the defendant and that the liability sought to be enforced against the defendant is unchanged. The court notes that the filing of an amended complaint renders a demurrer to the original complaint moot. The court grants the motion for leave to amend and sets the proposed first amended complaint as the operative pleading.
