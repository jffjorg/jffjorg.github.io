And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' unopposed motion for change of venue, and orders the case reassigned to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in the Central District of the Los Angeles Superior Court. The Judge finds that the case was filed in an improper district, specifically the Santa Monica Courthouse in the West District, and that the evidence shows that neither defendant resides in Santa Monica. The court cites the Code of Civil Procedure and the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court, which govern venue and the assignment of cases between districts. The case will be reassigned shortly, and the moving party will give notice.
