And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Young Chow Dai's motion to file new litigation as a vexatious litigant. The motion is procedurally improper and does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the proposed new litigation has merit and is not being filed for purposes of harassment or delay. As a vexatious litigant, Dai is subject to a prefiling requirement under Code of Civil Procedure section 391.7, which requires permission from the presiding judge to file new litigation. The judge has determined that Dai's request does not meet this requirement.
