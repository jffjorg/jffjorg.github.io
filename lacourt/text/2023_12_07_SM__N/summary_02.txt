And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff 435 N. Roxbury Drive, LLC's motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication. The Plaintiff seeks to resolve its dispute with Defendants Michael K. Obeng, M.D. and M.D., PA, Inc. regarding nonpayment of rent for the property located at 435 N. Roxbury Drive, Suite 205, in Beverly Hills. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants failed to pay commercial rent, including past due rent of $53,003.72, plus holdover damages. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has provided undisputed evidence that the Defendants failed to pay the rent as stated in the notices and have not paid rent for July through October 2023. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has incurred legal fees, which it is entitled to recover under the lease. Since the Defendants failed to oppose the motion and create a triable issue, the Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication. The Plaintiff shall prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.
