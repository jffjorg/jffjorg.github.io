And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Petitioners' petition to confirm the arbitration award against Respondents Paul Kambur and Kambur Construction Group, Inc. is GRANTED. The Judge also orders the Petitioners to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.

The Judge denies the Respondents' petition to vacate the arbitration award, finding that the limited grounds for vacating an award under Code of Civil Procedure section 1286.2, subdivision (a) are not met. The Judge concludes that the Respondents' arguments and evidence presented are not new and were available to them at the time of the arbitration, and therefore, it is not the Court's role to consider new arguments and evidence.

The Judge notes that the arbitrator's award was procured through a valid arbitration agreement and that the Respondents' claims of corruption, fraud, or other undue means are not supported by evidence.
