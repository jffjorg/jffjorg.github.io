[1] The Court reminds
Plaintiff that each of his causes of action should be separately stated, must
be separately and continuously numbered, and must identify the parties
asserting the claim and against whom it is asserted. (See California
Rules of Court, rule 2.112; see also Campbell v. Rayburn (1954)
129 Cal.App.2d 232, 235.) 
 
The
FAC is misnumbered at various points to such an extent that it makes references
to specific paragraphs virtually useless. It jumps from Paragraph 76 to 110 on
pages 27 and 28, contains two different paragraphs 111 and 112 on pages 28 and
29, then jumps from Paragraph 120 to a third different Paragraph 111 on
page 36, at which point the paragraphs continue through 122 before jumping to
Paragraph 141 and back to 123 on page 38. The FAC then resumes sequentially
until Paragraph 163, which incorporates paragraphs 1 to 167, even though
164-168 are never alleged because the FAC jumps yet again to Paragraph 169.
 
As
a result of these issues, the Court will refer to the paragraphs as they are
erroneously numbered and trust that the context of each citation will make
clear which paragraph its analysis refers because the Court has organized its
analysis by cause of action.
 
Of
slightly lesser concern given the length of the FAC and number of exhibits
attached to it, Plaintiff hasn’t properly electronically bookmarked each
exhibit separately.

[3] “The FAC alleges that
the parties’ mutual understanding was that Croitoru, through OZ, would ensure
the provision of additional capital to stabilize the FMB entities. This mutual
understanding is demonstrated by Croitoru’s acceptance of 25% equity, suggesting
ongoing obligations that transcend a mere deferral of prior investments.” (See
Opposition, pg. 6 (emphasis added).)
