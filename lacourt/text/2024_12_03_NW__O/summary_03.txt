And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is reminding the plaintiff to properly format their complaint (FAC) to ensure that each cause of action is separately stated, numbered, and identifies the parties involved. The judge notes that the FAC is misnumbered, jumping between paragraphs in a way that makes it difficult to track. The judge will refer to the paragraphs as they are misnumbered and will organize their analysis by cause of action. Additionally, the judge notes that the plaintiff has not properly electronically bookmarked each exhibit separately, which is a minor issue given the length of the FAC and the number of exhibits attached.
