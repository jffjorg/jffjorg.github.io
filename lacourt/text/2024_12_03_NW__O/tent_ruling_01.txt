Case No.: 18VECV00128

ORDER
   GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO VACATE THE COURT’S JULY 5, 2024, ORDER
   AWARDING PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS



 
I.        INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs Juana Mendoza, Fabian Vargas, and Jose
Edmundo Vargas (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) brought this action against their
former landlord, Defendant North Hills Wills Apts., Inc. (“Defendant”) alleging
three causes of action: (1) Breach of the Warranty of Habitability; (2)
Negligent Maintenance; and (3) Nuisance. 
Following a jury trial that spanned several days,
the jury returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiffs as to all three of their
causes of action and awarded damages in the amount of $14,400 to Juana Mendoza,
$8,100 to Fabian Vargas, and $7,500 to Jose Edmundo Vargas. 
On July 5, 2024, the Court awarded Plaintiffs’
attorney’s fees (“Order”) after Defendant did not file an opposition to
Plaintiff’s properly noticed motion. 
Defendant now seeks to vacate to vacate the Order.  
II.      PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On October 26, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their
Complaint against Defendant.
On December 6, 2018, Defendant filed its Answer to
the Complaint. 
On February 6, 2024, the jury trial commenced.
On February 20, 2024, the jury returned with a
verdict in favor of all three Plaintiffs as to all three of their causes of
action in the amounts listed above.
On May 6, 2024, the Court entered judgment in favor
of Plaintiffs.
On July 5, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiffs’
Attorney’s Fees Motion in part.
On October 25, 2024, Defendant filed the instant
Motion to Vacate the Court’s July 5, 2024, Order Awarding Plaintiffs Attorney’s
Fees and Costs (“Motion”). 
On November 15, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
Opposition.
On November 22, 2024, Defendant filed its Reply. 
III.     ANALYSIS
On July 5, 2024, this Court granted Plaintiffs’
Attorney’s Fees Motion in part. Defendant did not oppose or appear at the
hearing. Defendant now requests this Court vacate its Order granting
Plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees due to its counsel’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect, pursuant to § 473(b). (See Declaration
of Laura Adler (“Ms. Adler”) filed October 25, 2024 (“Adler Decl.”).) Defendant
requests this relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b)’s mandatory
relief provision or, in the alternative, under its discretionary relief
provision. (See Motion, pp. 5-7.)  
Ms. Adler declares her firm’s legal department has
undergone structural changes as a result of the appointment of a Receiver. (See
Adler Decl., ¶ 4.) She also declares the attorney assigned to the present
case left the firm at the end of August of this year. (See id.) “As
explained in the Declaration of Laura Adler filed with the motion, the original
failing to calendar and appear at the June 7, 2024, was compounded by the
internal tumult surrounding the appointment of the Receiver and the departure
of Mr. Whitaker.” (Reply, pg. 3.) 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue the Motion is
procedurally defective as the Court’s Order must be appealed under Code of
Civil Procedure § 904.1 and, even if Code of Civil Procedure § 473 applies, “there
is nothing or no facts to support a basis for mistake or excusable neglect.”
(Opposition, pp. 4-5.)
The Court finds Ms. Adler has met her burden of
proof to demonstrate mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b). As an initial matter, while the Court’s Order
can be appealed under Code of Civil Procedure § 904.1, it does not have
to be appealed under § 904.1. (See Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries (1993)
6 Cal.4th 644, 656.) Mandatory relief is also not appropriate in this instance,
as mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) is limited to defaults,
default judgments, and dismissals. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b).) Discretionary
relief is, however, appropriate. “As the California Supreme Court recently
observed: The discretionary relief provision of section 473, subdivision (b)
applies to any judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding. Thus, for
example, the failure of counsel to meet a procedural deadline is a proper
subject for section 473 relief.” (Huh v. Wang (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th
1406, 1419 (internal quotations and citations omitted).) The Court recognizes Plaintiff’s
counsel’s firm did not formally go into receivership until after the
hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees. However, firms do not go
into receivership overnight; financial and structural problems like those that
lead to a receivership usually simmer until they boil over. Thus, the Court is
willing to give Ms. Adler’s declaration the benefit of the doubt coming from an
officer of the court that her firm’s failure “to calendar and appear at the
June 7, 2024, [hearing] was compounded by the internal tumult surrounding the
appointment of the Receiver and the departure of Mr. Whitaker.” (Reply, pg. 3.)
This showing is sufficient for the Court to grant Defendant’s Motion pursuant
to its ability to award discretionary relief under Code of Civil Procedure §
473(b). 
IV.     CONCLUSION
          Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate its Order granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorney’s
Fees. Defendant shall file its Opposition to Plaintiffs’
Motion for Attorney’s Fees forthwith and the Court shall reset Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees for hearing on January 2, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
          IT IS
SO ORDERED.
DATED:      December 3, 2024
