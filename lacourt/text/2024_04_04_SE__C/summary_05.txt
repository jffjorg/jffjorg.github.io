And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Sully-Miller Contracting Company, which argues that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff, Andes Gallegos, was injured in a car accident on July 22, 2021, and filed his complaint on July 27, 2023. The judge has sustained the demurrer and given the plaintiff 30 days to amend his complaint to plead additional facts related to equitable tolling. The judge has also granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages, as the complaint fails to plead facts that support a recovery of punitive damages. Additionally, the judge has granted the request for judicial notice.
