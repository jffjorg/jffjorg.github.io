Here is a YAML summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23NWCV02396
* Hearing Date: April 4, 2024
* Department: C
* Plaintiffs: [Unknown]
* Defendants: American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
* Parties: Plaintiffs, Defendant
* Court: [Unknown]

**Summary**

* Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Honda) seeks to compel arbitration of the dispute under the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and its accompanying arbitration agreement.
* Plaintiffs argue that their claims arise from Honda's statutory obligations and not from the sales contract.
* The Court finds that Defendant has met its burden of proving a valid arbitration agreement, but Defendants' claims do not arise from and are not intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract.

**Ruling**

* The motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is DENIED.
* Defendant Honda may not compel arbitration because Plaintiffs' claims arise from Defendant's statutory obligations and not from the sales contract.

**Key Points**

* Equitable estoppel does not apply because Plaintiffs' claims do not arise from and are not intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract.
* Defendant Honda is not a third-party beneficiary as contemplated by the RISC because there is no motivating purpose between Plaintiff and the Dealership to provide a benefit for Defendant.
* The RISC does not reveal a motivating purpose to include Defendant as a third-party beneficiary.
