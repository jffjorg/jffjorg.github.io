And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Defendant, Universal Fitness Club Norwalk, LLC, has moved to strike certain allegations from the Plaintiff, David Garfinkle's, First Amended Complaint. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's claim that the lease was extended from 10 to 15 years is inconsistent with the written lease attached to the Complaint. However, the Plaintiff argues that the extension date is "on or about" May 16, 2016, and that the lease was extended on May 6 and 9, 2016, which falls "on or around" May 16, 2016. The Court has denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint are not inconsistent and that the Court must accept the factual allegations as true at this stage in the litigation.
