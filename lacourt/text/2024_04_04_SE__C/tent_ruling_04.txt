INC. v. OCHOA 
CASE NO.:  23NWCV01463
HEARING: 04/04/24
 
#7
 
     I.       
Defendant VANESSA JIMENEZ’s Motion to Set Aside
Default is GRANTED.  
 
    II.       
Defendant JOSE L. OCHOA’s Motion to Set Aside
Default is GRANTED.  
 
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
Defendant’s Proposed Answers attached as Exhibit A to the Moving
Papers are not deemed filed. Defendants VANESSA JIMENEZ and JOSE L. OCHOA are ORDERED
to file the Proposed Answers within five court days of the Court’s issuance of
this Order. 
 
Default was entered against Vanessa Jimenez on July 7, 2023
and against Jose L. Ochoa on July 14, 2023. 
 
Defendants now separately move to set aside the defaults
under CCP §473(b). 
 
CCP § 473(b), states that “[t]he court may…relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” 
 
The policy of hearing cases on
their merits is well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971)
17 Cal.App.3d 900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set
Aside Defaults, the Court finds the Declarations of
the Defendants sufficient to warrant to relief. The law favors trials on
the merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.) 
 
The Motions are GRANTED.
