And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents (set one) against the defendant, Melvin Rene Morales Astorga. The plaintiff originally served the request for production on June 7, 2023, and the defendant responded on August 11, 2023. However, the plaintiff's counsel sent a meet and confer letter on August 25, 2023, regarding purported deficiencies in the defendant's responses. The defendant provided amended responses on September 15, 2023, but the plaintiff argues that these responses are not code-compliant. The court finds that the defendant's responses do not comply with CCP §2031.230 and that the plaintiff did not meet and confer over the amended responses. The court grants the motion and orders the defendant to provide further responses within 30 days.
