 Case Number:  24NWCV00208    Hearing Date:   April 4, 2024    Dept:  C GARFINKLE v.
UNIVERSAL FITNESS CLUB NORWALK, LLC 
CASE NO.:  24NWCV00208
HEARING:  04/04/024
 
#8
 
Defendant UNIVERSAL FITNESS CLUB NORWALK, LLC’s Motion to
Strike Portions of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is DENIED.
Defendant Universal Fitness Club Norwalk, LLC to Answer in 5 court days.  
 
Opposing Party to Give notice. 
 
This action for unlawful detainer was filed by Plaintiff
DAVID GARFINKLE (“Plaintiff”) on January 18, 2024. On February 16, 2024, the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed. 
 
Defendant UNIVERSAL FITNESS CLUB NORWALK, LLC (“Defendant”)
moves to strike the following allegation from the FAC: “On or about 05/16/2016,
the parties extended the original lease term from 10 years to 15 years” from
Plaintiff’s Complaint. Defendant argues that this sentence should be stricken
on the basis that the “written lease attached to Exhibit 1 to the First amended
Complaint contained inconsistent facts as to the date the parties purportedly
extended the lease term.” (Notice 2:4-7.) 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that there is no inconsistency
between ¶6d of the FAC and the attached Lease because the First Amendment to
the Lease was executed on May 6, 2016 by the landlord and on May 9, 2016 by the
tenant, which adequately falls within the alleged date of “on or about” May 16,
2016. 
 
A motion to strike lies either when (1) there is “irrelevant, false or
improper matter inserted in any pleading”; or (2) to strike any pleading or
part thereof “not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule or order of court.” (CCP §436.)
 
The motion to strike allegations
contained in ¶6d of the FAC is DENIED. There is no inconsistency pled here that
renders the FAC fatally uncertain. The FAC adequately alleges that the lease
was extended “on or about May 16, 2016”—the FAC does not allege that the lease
was extended specifically on the date of May 16, 2016. May 6 and May 9 of 2016
fall “on or around” May 16, 2016. The Court must accept the factual allegations set forth in the FAC
as true at this stage in the litigation. (See Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)
