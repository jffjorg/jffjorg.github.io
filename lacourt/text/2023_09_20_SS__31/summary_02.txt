And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the June 20, 2023 order denying the plaintiff's motion for relief from late expert designation. The plaintiff failed to attach a CV to the expert witness designation and did not cure the defect until after the Court's June 20, 2023 ruling. The judge found that the plaintiff did not comply with CCP § 2034.260 and did not provide sufficient evidence of prompt service of the proposed expert witness information. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is not based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law than those before the Court at the time of the original ruling.
