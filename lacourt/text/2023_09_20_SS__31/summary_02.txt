## English Summary

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim regarding a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Milton Flores. Plaintiff previously sought relief from a late expert designation in his lawsuit against the Los Angeles Dodgers, but the request was denied.  

The court found that Plaintiff's expert designation did not comply with the requirements of California law because it did not include a curriculum vitae (CV) as required by CCP § 2034.260(c)(1).  

Defendant had brought this issue to Plaintiff's attention on multiple occasions, but Plaintiff argued they were unaware of the defect until the initial hearing on the motion for relief. The court disagreed, finding that Plaintiff failed to promptly cure the defect after being informed of it and therefore denied the motion for reconsideration.  


The court emphasized the importance of complying with the California Code of Civil Procedure to ensure fairness in discovery.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the prior order denying the motion for relief from late expert designation. The plaintiff had filed a supplemental designation of an expert witness, Dr. Hazany, without attaching a CV, which the court deemed insufficient under CCP § 2034.260(c)(1). The court held that the plaintiff had been on notice of the defect since May 24, 2023, and did not provide evidence that the defect was cured "promptly thereafter" as required by CCP § 2034.720(c)(3). The court also noted that the plaintiff's argument that the court should grant relief despite the plaintiff's failure to comply with the statutory requirements was unavailing. The court further stated that the plaintiff curing the defect after the court's June 20, 2023 ruling was not new or different facts, circumstances, or law than those before the court at the time of the original ruling.

English text:
The tentative ruling is for a case in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles - Central District, hearing date September 20, 2023, department 31. The title of the ruling is Tentative Order Re: Motion for Reconsideration. The plaintiff, Milton Flores, filed a motion for relief from late expert designation, which was denied by the court. The plaintiff then filed a motion for reconsideration, which is being opposed by the defendant, Los Angeles Dodgers, LLC and ET AL. The ruling discusses the legal standard for supplemental expert designation and the conditions for granting leave to submit tardy expert witness information. The plaintiff argues that they provided a brief narrative statement of Dr. Hazany’s qualifications in the supplemental designation, but the CV was not attached. However, the court finds that this is not sufficient and the plaintiff did not comply with CCP § 2034.260(c)(1) and CCP § 2034.720(c)(3). Therefore, the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is denied.

## Case Summary: Milton Flores v. Los Angeles Dodgers, et al. (Case No. 19STCV43535)

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Milton Flores
* **Defendant:** Los Angeles Dodgers, LLC

**Issue:** Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's denial of his motion for relief from late expert designation.

**Background:**

* Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the Dodgers for damages arising from an alleged assault and battery at Dodger Stadium.
* On June 20, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff's motion for relief from late expert designation due to a lack of a detailed curriculum vitae (CV) for the expert witness, Dr. Hazany.
* Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration on June 29, 2023, arguing that the requirement for a CV was not explicitly stated in the relevant code section (CCP § 2034.260) and that he was unaware of this requirement.

**Legal Arguments:**

* Plaintiff: 
    * The Court's ruling was incorrect as CCP § 2034.260 does not explicitly require a CV.
    * He was unaware of the CV requirement until the June 20, 2023 hearing.
    * He should be allowed to file a new motion for relief under CCP § 2034.720.
* Defendant: 
    * Plaintiff's initial expert designation failed to comply with CCP § 2034.260(c)(1) by not providing a brief narrative of Dr. Hazany's qualifications. 
    * Plaintiff was alerted to the missing CV on May 24, 2023, and again on June 6, 2023, and failed to rectify the issue promptly.

**Court Decision:**

* The Court denied Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
* The Court found that Plaintiff's initial expert designation was insufficient as it did not provide a detailed narrative of Dr. Hazany's qualifications.
* The Court also found that Plaintiff was aware of the missing CV issue before June 20, 2023, and therefore did not promptly cure the defect as required by CCP § 2034.720(c)(3).
* The Court declined to rule on the propriety of a potential future motion under CCP § 2034.720.

**Significant Statements:**

* "The Legislature has laid out the requirements for the simultaneous exchange of expert witness information in Chapter 18 of the Civil Discovery Act. As the parties know, the general rule requires the simultaneous exchange of expert witness information."
* "Compliance with 2034.720 and 2034.260, taken together, places the party that was compliant with the rules (here, the Defendant) as close as possible to the position it would have been in had there been full compliance with Article 2, which includes 2034.260."

**Summary**: The Judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's June 20, 2023 order denying their motion for relief from late expert designation. The Court found that Plaintiff failed to provide a brief narrative statement of Dr. Hazany's qualifications in their supplemental expert designation, and did not attach a CV as required by CCP § 2034.260(c)(1). The Court also found that Plaintiff did not provide new or different facts, circumstances, or law than those before the Court at the time of the original ruling, and therefore will not grant the motion for reconsideration.
