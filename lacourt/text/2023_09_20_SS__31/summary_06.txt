And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Carmen Trujillo's motion to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted and imposing sanctions on Defendant Miguel Reyes. The RFAs were propounded on October 27, 2022, but Defendant failed to respond, waiving any objections. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's motion is granted because Defendant has not filed an opposition or demonstrated that he has served a substantially compliant response to the RFAs. As a result, the RFAs are deemed admitted against Defendant, and the Judge imposes sanctions in the amount of $561.65. The Judge also awards Plaintiff $500 in attorney fees for preparation and appearance, as well as a motion filing fee of $61.65.
