 Case Number:  20STCV49024    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  09/20/23 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  HENG ZHAO VS GILIBERTO ZUNIGANORBERTO, ET AL; 20STCV49024 REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  GILIBERTO ZUNIGANORBERTO,  JORGE LUIS RESENDIZAGUILAR   RECOMMENDATION:  DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  The request for default judgment submitted on 08/17/2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  • Plaintiff filed two statements of damages on June 30, 2022, with proof of service showing Defendants were each served with the statements on June 29, 2022. However, a statement of damages must be served on a defendant before default is entered by the Court Clerk. (Hamm v. Elkin (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1343, 1345-46).  In personal injury and wrongful death cases, a plaintiff must serve a statement of damages setting forth the nature and amount of damages to be sought before default may be taken. (Code Civ. Proc., section 425.11.) The purpose of the statement of damages is to ensure that a defendant who declines to contest an action does not thereby subject himself to open ended liability. (Schwab v. Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991) 53 Cal.3d 428, 435 (quoting Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826.) A statement of damages is the functional equivalent to an amendment to a complaint that increases the amount of damages sought. (Plotitsa v. Superior Court (1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 755, 759.)  Plaintiff obtained entry of default against Defendants on May 4, 2021. Because the statement of damages were served on Defendants after entry of default, the Court finds the underlying default VOID. Plaintiff must obtain a new entry of default.   • Once Plaintiff obtains a new entry of default and submits a new default package, Plaintiff Plaintiff must submit a proposed judgement on Judicial Council Form JUD-100, as opposed to a proposed judgment on pleading paper. In the proposed judgement, Plaintiff must include a notation limiting Resendizaguilar’s liability as thealleged vehicle owner to no more than statutorily allowed per Vehicle Code §17151(a).   • Lastly, Plaintiff did not submit sufficient evidence with the default judgement request. Specifically, while Plaintiff requests general damages of $4,985,000 from Zuniganorberto and $15,000 from Resendizaguilar, Plaintiff’s declaration provides no admissible evidence of the damages sought. Plaintiff merely attaches a copy of the Traffic Collision Report (“TCR”), which is inadmissible hearsay, and a single photograph of an arm. Plaintiff must introduce admissible prima facie evidence of his damages.
