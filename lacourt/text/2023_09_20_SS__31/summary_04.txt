And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the request for default judgment submitted by the Plaintiff, Heng Zhao, against the Defendants, Giliberto Zuniganorberto and Jorge Luis Resendizaguilar. The Judge's decision is based on several reasons. Firstly, the Plaintiff failed to serve the statement of damages before default was entered, which is a requirement under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11. Secondly, the statement of damages was served after default was entered, which makes the default void. Thirdly, the Plaintiff did not submit sufficient evidence to support the damages claimed, including general damages of $4,985,000 from Zuniganorberto and $15,000 from Resendizaguilar. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to obtain a new entry of default and to submit a proposed judgment on Judicial Council Form JUD-100, which must include a notation limiting Resendizaguilar's liability as the alleged vehicle owner to no more than statutorily allowed under Vehicle Code ยง17151(a).
