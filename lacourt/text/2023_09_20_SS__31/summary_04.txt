And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the request for default judgment submitted by the Plaintiff, Heng Zhao, against the Defendants, Giliberto Zuniganorberto and Jorge Luis Resendizaguilar. The Judge's decision is based on several reasons. Firstly, the Plaintiff failed to serve the statement of damages before default was entered, which is a requirement under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11. Secondly, the statement of damages was served after default was entered, which makes the default void. Thirdly, the Plaintiff did not submit sufficient evidence to support the damages claimed, including general damages of $4,985,000 from Zuniganorberto and $15,000 from Resendizaguilar. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to obtain a new entry of default and to submit a proposed judgment on Judicial Council Form JUD-100, which must include a notation limiting Resendizaguilar's liability as the alleged vehicle owner to no more than statutorily allowed under Vehicle Code §17151(a).

## English Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's request for default judgment. 

The primary reason for denial is that the Plaintiff served the statement of damages **after** the default was entered against the Defendants. This is a violation of California law, which requires the statement of damages to be served **before** default entry.

The Judge also states that the Plaintiff must:

* Obtain a new entry of default.
* When submitting a new default package, use Judicial Council Form JUD-100 for the proposed judgment and limit Resendizaguilar's liability to the statutory maximum allowed under Vehicle Code §17151(a).
* Provide admissible evidence of the damages sought, exceeding simply attaching a traffic collision report and a photograph.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the request for default judgment submitted by Heng Zhao against Giliberto Zuniganorberto and Jorge Luis Resendizaguilar. The reason for this denial is that the statement of damages was served on the defendants after the default was entered, which is contrary to the law. In personal injury and wrongful death cases, a statement of damages must be served on a defendant before default may be taken. The judge also found that the default is void and that the plaintiff must obtain a new entry of default.

Additionally, the judge has ordered the plaintiff to submit a new default package, including a proposed judgment on Judicial Council Form JUD-100, and to limit the liability of Resendizaguilar to no more than statutorily allowed per Vehicle Code §17151(a).

Finally, the judge has denied the request for default judgment because the plaintiff did not submit sufficient evidence with the request, including admissible prima facie evidence of the damages sought.

```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to deny the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants, Giliberto Zuniganorberto and Jorge Luis Resendizaguilar. The reason for the denial is that the plaintiff filed statements of damages after the entry of default, which is not allowed under California law. The plaintiff must obtain a new entry of default and submit a new default package, including a proposed judgment on a Judicial Council form. Additionally, the plaintiff must provide admissible evidence of damages, as the current evidence submitted is inadmissible hearsay. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff must limit Resendizaguilar's liability as the alleged vehicle owner to no more than the statutorily allowed amount under Vehicle Code §17151(a). The plaintiff's request for general damages of $4,985,000 from Zuniganorberto and $15,000 from Resendizaguilar is also insufficient due to lack of admissible evidence.
