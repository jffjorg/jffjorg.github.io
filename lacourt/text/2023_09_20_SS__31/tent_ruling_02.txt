 Case Number:  19STCV43535    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  31  SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  MILTON FLORES, Plaintiff(s), vs.  LOS ANGELES DODGERS, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 19STCV43535  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  September 20, 2023  I. Background  Plaintiff Milton Flores (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Los Angeles Dodgers, LLC, et al. for damages arising from an alleged assault and battery at Dodger stadium.¿ On June 20, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for relief from late expert designation.   On June 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for reconsideration of the June 20, 2023 order.  Defendant Los Angeles Dodgers, LLC (“Defendant”) opposes the motion, and Plaintiff filed a reply.   II. Legal Standard – Supplemental Expert Designation CCP § 2034.280 permits a supplemental designation responsive to the opposing party's designation if and only if the supplementing party has not previously retained an expert on the subject(s) in question.  There are, however, limitations on the use and, more importantly, abuse of the supplemental expert witness designation provisions of section 2034.280.  The legislatively preferred method of expert witness exchange is simultaneous and mutual.  (CCP § 2034.210.)  If the parties do not comply with the requirements of a mutual and simultaneous exchange of experts, the Court has the authority to strike any non-conforming expert witness designation in whole or part.  (CCP § 2034.300; see Osborne v. Todd Farm Service (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 43, 202 Cal.Rptr.3d 84; Fairfax v. Lords (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1021, 41 Cal.Rptr.3d 850.)     CCP § 2034.720 provides:   The court shall grant leave to submit tardy expert witness information only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (a) The court has taken into account the extent to which the opposing party has relied on the absence of a list of expert witnesses.¿ (b) The court has determined that any party opposing the motion will not be prejudiced in maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits.¿ (c) The court has determined that the moving party did all of the following:¿ (1) Failed to submit the information as the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.¿ (2) Sought leave to submit the information promptly after learning of the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.¿ (3) Promptly thereafter served a copy of the proposed expert witness information described in Section 2034.260 on all other parties who have appeared in the action.¿ (d) The order is conditioned on the moving party making the expert available immediately for a deposition under Article 3 (commencing with Section 2034.410), and on any other terms as may be just, including, but not limited to, leave to any party opposing the motion to designate additional expert witnesses or to elicit additional opinions from those previously designated, a continuance of the trial for a reasonable period of time, and the awarding of costs and litigation expenses to any party opposing the motion.¿ Furthermore, CCP § 2034.260 (c) provides:¿ If a witness on the list is an expert as described in subdivision (b) of Section 2034.210, the exchange shall also include or be accompanied by an expert witness declaration signed only by the attorney for the party designating the expert, or by that party if that party has no attorney. This declaration shall be under penalty of perjury and shall contain all of the following:¿¿ (1) A brief narrative statement of the qualifications of each expert.¿¿ (2) A brief narrative statement of the general substance of the testimony that the expert is expected to give.¿¿ (3) A representation that the expert has agreed to testify at the trial.¿¿ (4) A representation that the expert will be sufficiently familiar with the pending action to submit to a meaningful oral deposition concerning the specific testimony, including an opinion and its basis, that the expert is expected to give at trial.¿¿ (5) A statement of the expert's hourly and daily fee for providing deposition testimony and for consulting with the retaining attorney.¿  III. Motion for Reconsideration CCP § 1008(a) states:   When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. CCP § 1008(a), thus, requires the Court to reconsider a prior ruling if it finds there are new or different facts, circumstances, or law than those before the Court at the time of the original ruling.  Once the Court determines the existence of new or different facts, circumstances, of law, it can either modify or affirm its prior decision.  (Corns v. Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 202.) The legislative intent was to restrict motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a party offers the court some fact or circumstance not previously considered, and some valid reason for not offering it earlier.  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 150.)  “[A] court acts in excess of jurisdiction when it grants a motion to reconsider that is not based upon ‘new or different facts, circumstances, or law.’”  (Id.)  The burden under § 1008 “is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at the trial.”  (New York Times Co. v. Sup.Ct. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213.)   Here, Plaintiff asserts, “Even though Plaintiff provided a brief narrative statement of Dr. Hazany’s qualifications in the supplemental designation, the Court denied it because the CV was not attached” (Mot. p. 5, lines 15-17) and that “no law was cited supporting that a CV must be attached in order to be in compliance with the code.” (Id. at p. 8, lines 23-24.) First, the supplemental designation did not, in this Court’s estimation, provide a brief narrative of Dr. Hazany’s qualifications. Instead, under subsection “A. Qualifications”, Plaintiff provides: “Dr. Hazany is a neuroradiologist, and a board-certified radiologist. Dr. Hazany’s Curriculum Vitae is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.” Pursuant to CCP § 2034.260(c)(1), the expert witness declaration shall contain a brief narrative statement of the qualifications of each expert. Merely providing Dr. Hazany’s professional title does not provide a brief narrative of Dr. Hazany’s qualifications. Secondly, Plaintiff’s citation to Bannout v. Weider Health and Fitness, Inc., No. BC325466, 2007 WL 7269573 (Cal.Super. June 07, 2007), a trial court case, is unavailing for two reasons: (1) a trial court’s ruling is not persuasive authority, and (2) Plaintiff omits the full context for the quote chosen from Bannout, which is specific to CCP § 2034.260(c)(2) regarding the subject matter of the expert testimony to be given. At issue is not CCP § 2034.260(c)(2), but CCP § 2034.260(c)(1). Furthermore, Plaintiff misunderstands the Court’s ruling. It was not the Court’s ruling that a CV must always be attached to be code compliant. Rather, instead of providing a brief narrative as required by CCP § 2034.260, Plaintiff opted to refer to an attached CV, which is a practical and oft utilized method provided the referenced document was attached. However, no CV was attached, and the Court held Plaintiff’s counsel to their own selection.  In this Court’s view, if this Court were to accept a recitation of the expert’s professional title in the form provided (“Dr. Hazany is a neuroradiologist, and a board-certified radiologist.”), without anything further, it would seem to subvert the purpose of the statutory scheme. The Legislature has laid out the requirements for the simultaneous exchange of expert witness information in Chapter 18 of the Civil Discovery Act. As the parties know, the general rule requires the simultaneous exchange of expert witness information. There are many requirements laid out by the Legislature in Article 2 of Chapter 18, including those requirements as laid out in CCP § 2034.260. Article 5 of Chapter 18 is devoted to procedures when there has been an untimely exchange. As relevant here, CCP § 2034.720 is labelled “Scope of judicial authority to grant tardy filing of list; satisfaction of certain conditions”. The Court interprets the statutory scheme as follows: the parties must simultaneously exchange expert witness information in order to promote fair play; if a party deviates from this requirement, relief is possible, but only upon strict compliance with section 2034.720 and 2034.260, and, importantly, the judge’s authority to grant leave is limited in this regard. This makes sense to the Court because compliance with 2034.720 and 2034.260, taken together, places the party that was compliant with the rules (here, the Defendant) as close as possible to the position it would have been in had there been full compliance with Article 2, which includes 2034.260. Here, there was a failure to strictly comply with 2034.260. Full and timely compliance with 2034.260 are important to give the receiving party the substantive information needed for the receiving party to actually understand the nature and qualifications of the expert.     Thus, the court shall grant leave to submit tardy expert witness information only if certain conditions were satisfied, including the court determining that the moving party promptly served a copy of the proposed expert witness information described in Section 2034.260 on all other parties who have appeared in the action. (CCP § 2034.720(c)(3).) Aside from failing to comply with CCP § 2034.260(c)(1), as noted above, the Court found that Plaintiff had been on notice of this defect since May 24, 2023, and Plaintiff did not provide any evidence that the defect was cured “promptly thereafter” as required by CCP § 2034.720 (c)(3). (Min. Order, June 20, 2023.) Plaintiff’s counsel contends they were unaware of the defect until the June 20, 2023 hearing. However, Defendant first alerted Plaintiff and the Court to the missing CV on May 24, 2023, and again brought the issue to Plaintiff’s and the Court’s attention on June 6, 2023. Accordingly, the Court was unable to grant Plaintiff the relief requested, as the Court was bound by the “scope of judicial authority” as determined by the Legislature. (Ibid.) Plaintiff curing the defect after the Court’s June 20, 2023 ruling is not new or different facts, circumstances, or law than those before the Court at the time of the original ruling. Lastly, Plaintiff argues that if the Court were to deny the motion for reconsideration, that Plaintiff should be entitled to file a new motion for relief pursuant to CCP § 2034.720. However, the Court will not rule on the propriety of a motion not currently before it.   Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is DENIED.    Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 19th day of September 2023      Hon.
