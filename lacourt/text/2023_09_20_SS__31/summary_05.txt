The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for prevailing party costs filed by defendant Angela Michelle Purcell. The defendant seeks costs in the amount of $2,534.20 for filing, motion, jury, and witness fees related to the lawsuit. The plaintiff, Raul Luis Hernandez, voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice.

The judge finds that the defendant is a prevailing party under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 1032(a)(4), which defines a prevailing party as a party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, or a defendant who receives no relief.

The judge also finds that the filing and service of costs are timely, as the defendant filed and served the costs within 15 days of the notice of entry of dismissal, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(a)(1).

Finally, the judge finds that the costs sought by the defendant are reasonable and necessary, as they were incurred in the course of the litigation.

Based on these findings, the judge grants the defendant's motion for prevailing party costs and orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs in the amount of $2,534.20.
