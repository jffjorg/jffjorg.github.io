And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint filed by Bijan Torabi and Farideh Khorrami against Raisa Zilberman. The plaintiffs' attorney, Russel F. Behjatnia, declared that the failure to appear at trial was due to an office mistake in calendaring the date of the matter, which was not discovered until after the court's order for dismissal. The court finds that the plaintiffs have set forth sufficient grounds for relief based on mistake and grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The court sets an Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default for February 24, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
