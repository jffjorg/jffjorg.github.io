negligence based on a motor vehicle accident. Trial was initially set for
January 6, 2023. 
 
At the trial on January 6, 2023, Plaintiffs did not appear, and no proofs
of service of the summons and complaint were filed. As a result, the Court
dismissed the complaint without prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section
581(b)(3). (Min. Order, 1/6/23.) 
 
On July 3, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to set aside the dismissal
which was granted on March 15, 2024. The Court also set an Order to Show Cause
Re: Dismissal for Failure to Serve Summons and Complaint for May 14, 2024. (Min.
Order, 3/15/24.) 
 
On May 14, 2024, the Court held an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for
Failure to Serve Summons and Complaint. Plaintiffs did not appear, and seeing no
proof of service of the summons and complaint, the Court dismissed the

dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). No opposition has been
filed.

ANALYSIS
I.                  
Legal
Standard
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b),
the Court may relieve a party from a dismissal taken against him through his mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  This application must be
filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).)   
 
A mistake is a basis for relief under section 473 when by
reason of the mistake a party failed to make a timely response.¿ Surprise
occurs when a party is unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without
any negligence of his own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the
party has shown some reasonable excuse for the default.¿ (Credit Managers
Association of California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984)
162 Cal.App.3d 1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892,
905.)¿ Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the
burden of demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake,
justifying a court’s vacating a judgment.¿ (Basinger v. Roger & Wells
(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)¿¿¿ 
 
Relief under this section is mandatory when based on an
attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise, it is discretionary. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473, subd. (b).) However mandatory relief is only available when a party
fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are procedurally equivalent to a
default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc.¿(2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision does not apply to
dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals for
failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted], dismissals
based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted], and
voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].” (Id.)  
 
II.        Discussion
            As an
initial matter, this motion is timely because it was filed within six months
after the complaint was dismissed.            
Here, Plaintiffs’ counsel Russel F.
Behjatnia, declares the following: “[o]ur failure to appear was due to my
office's inadvertence and mistake in calendaring the date of the matter. This
mis-calendaring was not discovered until my office received notice of the
court's order for dismissal. I apologize to the court for the inconvenience
caused by this non-appearance and ask this court to excuse Plaintiff and I for
this mishap.” (Behjatnia Decl. ¶ 4-5.) 
            Based on
this declaration, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have set forth sufficient
grounds for relief based on mistake. Accordingly, the motion to set aside is
granted. 
RULING
             Plaintiffs Bijan
Torabi and Farideh Khorrami’s motion to set aside dismissal is GRANTED.  The Court sets an OSC re Entry of Default for February 24, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
