 Case Number:  24STLC00113    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  85 
Ally Bank Lease Trust v.
National Transportation Inc, et. al 24STLC00113
 
Tentative decision on application
for writs of possession: granted in part



 
            
            Plaintiff
Ally Bank Lease Trust (“ABLT”) seeks writs of possession against Defendants
National Transportation Inc. (“National”), John Eldon Kindt (“Kindt”), and
James Jim Gleich (“Gleich“) to recover a 2018 Kia Sorento, VIN 5XYPGDA58JG346689
(“Vehicle”). 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
ABLT filed the Complaint against Defendants National, Kindt, and Gleich, on January
8, 2024, alleging (1) claim and delivery and (2) money on a contract.  The Complaint alleges as follows.
            Defendants
entered into a written Contract in which they leased the Vehicle from ABLT’s
assignor.  Defendant Gleich signed a
personal guaranty.  At all relevant
times, ABLT has been the holder of a first priority security
interest in the Vehicle.  The Certificate
of Title from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”) reflects ABLT’s
interest.  The Contract gives ABLT
the right to take and have immediate possession of the Vehicle after
default.  
            Defendants
breached the Contract on February 12, 2022, by failing to make the $405.33 monthly
installment due.  Defendants have since
failed to make the regular monthly payments of   $405.33 due thereafter.  The balance due and owing is $19,461.  Demands to turn over the Vehicle have
failed.
            ABLT
seeks recovery of the Vehicle, a temporary restraining order enjoining Defendants
from transferring possession of the Vehicle, and $19,461 in
damages less proceeds from ABLT’s resale of the Vehicle.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings 
            On
March 13, 2024, ABLT served Defendants Gleich and National with the Complaint, Summons,
and moving papers by personal service, and filed POS-010 for each Defendant
April 2, 2024.  No proof of service is on
filed for Kindt.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            A
writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a cause of action for
claim and delivery, also known as replevin. 
See Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right to
possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are determined
in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting
declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b). 
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            On April 12, 2021, Defendants
and ABLT’s assignor, Community Partners Funding, Inc. (“Partners”) entered into
a written lease (“Lease”) for the Vehicle. 
Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Pursuant
to the Lease, Defendants were required to make 60 monthly payments of $405.33 thereafter.  Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  In the event of Defendants’ default for
failure to pay, Partners had the right to accelerate the amount owed, and
repossess the Vehicle.  Singleton Decl.,
¶7, Ex. A.  Defendant James Jim Gleich
signed a personal guaranty.  Singleton
Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  
            Partners
assigned all of its rights under the Lease to ABLT and Ally Financial Lease
Trust.  Singleton Decl., Ex. A.  The July 2, 2022 Certificate of Title from
the DMV reflects Ally Financial as the lienholder.[2]  Singleton Decl., Ex. B.  
            Defendants
breached the Lease on February 12, 2022 when they failed to pay $405.33.  Singleton Decl., ¶7.  Defendants have since failed to make the
regular monthly payments of $405.33 due thereafter.  Singleton Decl., ¶7.  As of November 9, 2023, the
balance due and owing is $19,461.  Singleton
Decl., ¶7.  Demands to turn over the Vehicle
have failed.  Singleton Decl., ¶9.  
            The
J.D. Power report for November 9, 2023 lists the Vehicle’s wholesale value as $14,000.00
and retail value as $16,875.  Singleton
Decl., ¶8, Ex. C.  
            The
Lease lists Defendant National’s address as 1417 Madrid Ave, Torrance, CA
90501.  Singleton Decl., ¶11, Ex. B.  ABLT’s file lists Defendant Gliech as
residing at the same address.  [3]  Singleton Decl., ¶11.  ABLT believes the Vehicle is currently at that
address.  Singleton Decl., ¶11.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
ABLT seeks a writ of possession and turnover order against Defendants for the Vehicle.  No proof of service is on file for Defendant
Kindt and no writ of possession may issue against him.
 
            1.
Breach of Agreement
            The
Lease is almost illegible and Plaintiff’s’ counsel is warned that legible
agreements must be provided or Plaintiff will be at risk that future
applications will be denied.  
The Lease required Defendants to make 60 monthly payments of
$405.33 for the Vehicle.  Singleton
Decl., Ex. A.  Any late payment would entitle
the assignor to accelerate the amount owed and repossess the Vehicle.  Singleton Decl., Ex. A.  Partners assigned all of its rights under the
Contract to ABLT and Ally Financial Lease Trust.  Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  The Certificate of Title from the DMV
reflects Ally Financial as the Vehicle lienholder.  Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  Despite the fact that the Certificate of
Title names a different lienholder, ABLT is the assignee and therefore the
proper Plaintiff.
            In seeking a writ of possession, the supporting declaration
must be set forth with particularity. 
CCP §516.030.  This means that the
plaintiff must show evidentiary facts rather than the ultimate facts commonly
found in pleadings.  A recitation of
conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is insufficient.  See Rodes v. Shannon, (1961)
194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions inadequate for
summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 663, 669
(same).  ABLT presents conclusory
evidence that the balance due is $19,461. 
Singleton Decl., ¶7.  ABLT
fails to support this conclusion with a payment history or calculation that
these are the amounts owed.  As Defendants
have not opposed, this defect is waived.
 
            2.
Undertaking 
            The
undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of the
defendants’ interest in the property or in a greater amount.  CCP §515.010(a).  
            The
Vehicle’s retail value is estimated to be $16,875.  Singleton Decl., ¶8, Ex. C.  The balance Defendants owe is $19,461.  Singleton Decl., ¶6.  The difference is $16,875- $19,461 = -$2,586,
meaning that Defendants have no legal interest in the Vehicle.  No undertaking is necessary.
 
            3.
Redelivery
            When
an undertaking is required, the defendant may prevent the plaintiff from taking
possession by filing an undertaking in an amount equal to either the amount of
the plaintiff’s undertaking (CCP
§515.020(a)) or the amount determined by the court under CCP section
515.010(b).  The redelivery
bond will be the amount owed of $16,875. 
 
            4.
Order to Enter Private Property
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
Lease and Certificate of Title list Defendant National’s address as 1417 Madrid
Ave., Torrance, CA 90501.  Singleton
Decl. ¶11, Exs. A-B.  This is also Gleich’s
address.  Singleton Decl., ¶11.  ABLT believes the Vehicle is located at that
address.  Id.  A writ may issue to enter a private residence
at this address.  
 
            5.
Turnover Order
            The
court may issue a turnover order directing the defendant to transfer possession
of the property to the plaintiff (See
Mandatory Form CD-120).  The order must
notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject him or her to contempt
of court.  CCP §512.070.  The turnover remedy is not issued in lieu of
a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff with a less
expensive means of obtaining possession. 
See Edwards, supra,
230 Cal.App.3d at 178.  
            ABLT
requests a turnover order compelling Defendants to transfer possession of the
Vehicle.  Mem. at 3.  The request for a turnover order is granted.
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
applications for a writ of possession and turnover order for the Vehicle is
granted against Defendants National and Gleitch only.  ABLT has not filed a proposed order for writ
of possession and must do so within two court days of this hearing on the
proper Judicial Council form or it will be waived.  The redelivery bond shall be $16,875.  The levying officer may enter a private
residence and/or commercial residence at 1417 Madrid Ave., Torrance, CA 90501, as
well as any commercial or public address.
