And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the case of Elizabeth, the plaintiff, against Shaw, the defendant, regarding a dispute over the use of a recording as evidence in a Board of Rights hearing. The judge notes that Shaw objected to the use of the recording, citing that it was recorded surreptitiously, but the Board of Rights overruled the objection. The judge also references an investigation by the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) and an article by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency about boldenone. The judge concludes that the remedy for a Skelly violation is not reinstatement, but rather back pay from the effective date of discharge to the date of Chief Moore's decision to remove Shaw. The judge also dismisses the Department's reliance on the Board of Rights Manual, as it was not received in evidence at the administrative hearing.
