  Case Number:  23STCP03062    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
Jason Shaw v. City of
Los Angeles and Michel Moore, 23STCP03062

 
Tentative decision on petition
for writ of mandate:   denied




 
            
Petitioner Jason Shaw (“Shaw”) seeks a writ of mandate compelling
the City of Los Angeles (“City”) and Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD” or
“Department”), and Chief Michael Moore (“Chief Moore”) to set aside and
vacate the decision to discharge Shaw from his employment as a police officer.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders
the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Shaw commenced this action on August 23, 2023, alleging a cause of action for administrative
mandamus.  The Petition alleges in
pertinent part as follows. 
Shaw was a
police officer with LAPD for approximately 19 years.  He was accused of using anabolic steroids and
engaging in a domestic altercation with his former spouse, Elizabeth Shaw
(“Elizabeth”).  LAPD found that Shaw violated
LAPD policy and directed him to a Board of Rights (sometimes, “Board”) hearing which
commenced on November 1, 2022.  
At the Board
hearing, Petitioner faced two charges: 
Count 1:
On or before September 17, 2019, you, while off-duty, pulled E. Shaw’s hair and
grabbed her face during a domestic altercation.
Count 2: Between January 1, 2016 and October 7,
2021, on one or more occasions, you, while on or off duty, improperly used
anabolic steroids. 
The Board
found Petitioner guilty on both counts. The Board recommended a penalty of
removal which Chief Moore imposed.  
            Petitioner
Shaw seeks a peremptory writ of mandate to (a) set aside the decision to
discharge him, (b) reinstate him with back pay and interest retroactive to the
day he was taken off payroll, (c) restore all benefits which he would have
accrued, (d) remove all records related to his discharge from his personnel
file, (e) award ancillary damages, and (f) award costs and attorney’s fees. 
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On August 23, 2023, Shaw
filed the Petition.
No Answer is on
file.
 
            B.
Standard of Review
            CCP
section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision which structures the
procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by
administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  The
pertinent issues under section 1094.5 are (1) whether the respondent has
proceeded without jurisdiction, (2) whether there was a fair trial, and (3)
whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. CCP § 1094.5(b).  An abuse of discretion is established if the
respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
CCP §1094.5(c).




            CCP
section 1094.5 does not in its face specify which cases are subject to
independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (1999) 20
Cal.4th 805, 811.  In reviewing decisions
which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court exercises independent
judgment on the evidence.  Bixby v.
Pierno, (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.  See
CCP §1094.5(c).  The right to practice a
trade or profession is deemed to be a fundamental right requiring application
of the independent judgment test.  Golde
v. Fox, (1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 167, 173.
            Under
the independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  Id. at 143.  The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City
of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860,
868.  In short, the court substitutes its
judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when,
why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon
v. Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.  However, “[i]n exercising its independent
judgment, a trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness
concerning the administrative findings, and the party challenging the
administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the
administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.”  Fukuda v. City of Angels, supra,
20 Cal.4th at 817.  Further, an agency is
presumed to have regularly performed its official duties.  Evid. Code §664.
            The
agency’s decision must be based on the evidence presented at the hearing.  Board of Medical Quality Assurance v.
Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860, 862.  The hearing officer is only required to issue
findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine whether,
and upon what basis, to review the decision. Topanga, supra, 11
Cal.3d at 514-15.  Implicit in section
1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the
analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Topanga, 11 Cal.3d at 15.
            An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code
§664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden of proof to demonstrate
wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or showed
prejudicial abuse of discretion. Alford v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d
682, 691.
            
            C.
Governing Law



            1.
Suspension, Demotion, and Termination
Police officers who have completed their probationary period
and are permanent employees have a property interest for purposes of due
process with respect to their job and compensation.  A public entity must accord the police
officer constitutional procedural due process before depriving the officer of
this property interest.  City Charter
§1070(a); see Skelly v. State Personnel Board, (“Skelly”) (1975)
15 Cal.3d 194, 215.
Generally, LAPD officers cannot be suspended, demoted, or
removed from service except for good cause upon a showing of guilt before a
Board of Rights.  City Charter
§1070(a).  An exception to this rule
permits the Chief of Police to demote a police officer or suspend him or her
for up to 22 days following appropriate pre-disciplinary procedures.  City Charter §1070(b).  Any such action is subject to
pre-disciplinary procedures required by law and a Board of Rights hearing if
sought by the police officer.  Id.  This procedure, where the police officer
elects to have a Board of Rights hearing, is commonly referred to as an “opted”
hearing.  A Board of Rights hearing
occurring after the Chief of Police demotes or imposes less than a 22-day
suspension satisfies the requirement of an administrative appeal under Govt.
Code section 3304(b).  Jackson v. City
of Los Angeles, (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 769, 780; Holcomb v. City of Los
Angeles, (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1560, 1566. 
            If
the Chief of Police intends a penalty greater than a 22-day suspension,
including termination, the matter is automatically referred to a Board of
Rights hearing.  This procedure, where
the police officer has no choice in the referral decision, is commonly called
an “ordered” Board of Rights hearing. 
There is a one-year limitations period for termination, suspension, and
demotion.  City Charter §1070(d).  
            Whether
the Board of Rights hearing is opted or ordered, it is a de novo
evidentiary hearing.  City Charter
§1070(f).  The Board of Rights consists
of two officers with the rank of captain or above and one civilian.  City Charter §1070(h).  LAPD has the burden of prove by a
preponderance of evidence.  City Charter
§1070(l).  
Upon a finding of guilt, the Board of Rights recommends
discipline, ranging from reprimand to removal. 
City Charter §1070(n).  The Chief
of Police has discretion to impose a lesser penalty, but not a greater penalty,
than recommended.  City Charter §1070(p).
 The officer can ask the Chief of Police
for a rehearing at any time within three years. 
City Charter §1070(t).
 
2.  Penal Code Sections
632 and 632.5
Penal
Code section 632 provides:
 
“Anyone who,
intentionally and without the consent of all parties to a confidential
communication, uses an electronic amplifying or recording device to
eavesdrop upon or record the confidential communication, whether the
communication is carried on among the parties in the presence of one another or
by means of a telegraph, telephone, or other device, except a radio, shall be
punished by a fine up to two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per
violation by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or in the
state prison, or by both that fine and imprisonment.”  Penal Code §632(a) (emphasis added).
 
A “confidential
communication” for purposes of Penal Code section 632(a) is defined as: 
 
“any communication
carried on in circumstances that may reasonably indicate that any party to the
communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto, but excludes a
communication made in a public gathering or in any legislative, judicial,
executive or administrative proceeding open to the public, or in any other
circumstance in which the parties to the communication may reasonably expect
that the communication may be overheard or recorded.”  Penal Code §632(c).
 
The first clause of Penal Code section 632(c)’s definition
of “confidential communication” includes any conversation under circumstances
showing that a party desires it not to be overheard or recorded.  The second clause then excludes a
conversation where the party reasonably believes it will be overheard or
recorded.  Flanagan v. Flanagan,
(2002) 27 Cal.4th 766, 774.
Penal Code section 633.5 states:
 
“Nothing in Section 631
or 632 shall be construed as prohibiting one party to a confidential
communication from recording such communication for the purpose of obtaining
evidence reasonably believed to relate to the commission by another party
to such communication of the crime of extortion, kidnapping, bribery, any
felony involving violence against the person, or a violation of  Section 653m, and nothing in Section 631 or
632 shall be construed as rendering inadmissible in a prosecution for
extortion, kidnapping, bribery, any felony involving violence against the
person, or a violation of Section 653m, or any crime in connection therewith,
any evidence so obtained.” (emphasis added).
 
Penal Code section 633.5 allows
one party to record a confidential communication for the purpose of obtaining
evidence reasonably believed to relate to the commission of domestic violence
by the other party.  The recording does
not need to be made only for purposes of instituting a prosecution.  People v. Ayers, (“Ayers”)
(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 370, 377 (recordings to show bribery made for
parties’ own use and not prosecution were admissible at criminal trial).          
D. Statement of Facts
1. Background
Petitioner Shaw and Elizabeth Shaw (“Elizabeth”) met
in 2003.  AR 37.  They began a
romantic relationship in 2010 and married in 2014.  AR 57. 
They had two children.  AR 57.  They had one child, Sydney, was born on
December 11, 2011.  AR 57, 796.  They married on January 2, 2014 just before
the birth of their second child, Spencer, born on February 7, 2014.  AR 57, 796. 
Shaw and Elizabeth separated in 2021 and
began divorce proceedings.  AR 374.  
Prior to their marriage
Shaw had been married to an LAPD officer named Katie Archuleta (“Katie”).  AR 293. 
Elizabeth was married to a man named Luke Wagner (“Luke”).  AR 355. 

Elizabeth suffers
from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”). 
AR 692.  Elizabeth testified that
she has a mental health disorder and was diagnosed by the Veterans
Administration as having PTSD.  AR
360-61.  She receives $4,000 a month from
the V.A. for her disability.  AR 808,
812, 820. 
 
2. Accusation
Against Luke
When Luke was
married to Elizabeth, she reported to police that he had assaulted her,
resulting in his arrest.  AR 355.  Elizabeth testified that she was in the Air
Force at the time, and they saw her bruises when she came to work.  AR 355. 
She was forced to seek a restraining order against Luke and his father.  Id. 
She was then confined to the base for 31 days “for my protection…and
they gave me medical [sic].”  AR
355, 359.  Elizabeth said Luke did not
want to go to jail so he instructed her to go to Kaiser and tell them she made
stuff up and request a prescription for Prozac “to verify that I made
everything up so it looked like I was the one that did bad, not him.”  AR 357-58.  She stopped cooperating with the District
Attorney and eventually she requested that the charges be dropped.  AR 200, 649. 
 
 3. The Email to Katie
Shaw and Elizabeth
began a romantic relationship in 2010. 
AR 293.  Katie and Shaw were still
married at the time, but Elizabeth did not know it.  Id.
Elizabeth emailed
Katie on September 2, 2014 to apologize for hurting her and breaking up her
family.  AR 795.  She stated that she and Shaw planned to
divorce, she planned to move out, and she expressed the hope that Katie would
adopt Sydney and Spencer and treat them as her own. AR 795.  
Elizabeth
testified that Shaw was abusing her mentally but had not yet started to abuse
her physically when she wrote this email. 
AR 291-92.  She wrote the email to
get Katie off their backs by thinking the relationship was over.  AR 293. 
She did so because “Jason always said we had to hide our relationship
from Katie, because she was crazy and that she would flip out and do something
to me.”  AR 293.  
In 2015 or 2016,
Elizabeth filed a personnel complaint accusing Katie of stalking, but an LAPD
investigation found the accusation to be unfounded.  AR 201, 290, 688. 
 
4. The Referral by Elizabeth’s Therapist
On October 5,
2021, the Murrieta Police Department (“MPD”) was informed by Child Protective
Services (“CPS”) of a referral they had received from Elizabeth’s therapist.  AR 568. 
 Elizabeth had told the therapist,
a court mandated reporter, that Shaw recently had threatened their daughter
when she walked in front of the television while he was watching Monday Night
Football.[1]  AR 635.  Elizabeth said that she did not believe the
threat was credible, but it was the last straw helping her to decide to divorce
Shaw.  AR 636.  MPD told Elizabeth about restraining orders
and how to get one.  AR 636. 
Later the same
day, MPD paid a follow-up visit to Elizabeth. 
AR 643-45.  She told police that
there had been unreported cases of domestic violence by Shaw since they were
married, the last incident occurring two or three months earlier.  Id.  According to Elizabeth, Shaw would hold her
down for a few seconds and yell at her.  Id.  She has never had any serious injuries
requiring medical attention or lasting overnight.   Id. 
She also told the officers that she believed Shaw was cheating on her
with other women.  Id.  She also said that Shaw was an alcoholic and
was taking steroids.  Id.  
MPD investigated the allegation of abuse.  AR 644-45.  MPD presented the case to the Riverside
County District Attorney’s Office (“DA”). 
AR 569.   On March 8, 2022, the DA
notified MDP that it declined to file criminal charges against Shaw for “lack
of sufficient evidence.”  AR 633. 
MPD then reported
the incident to LAPD and the complaint came to the attention of Lieutenant
James Canales (“Lt. Canales”) on October 7, 2021.  Id. 

 
6. Family
Law Court Proceedings
a. Request
for Restraining Order
On September 9,
2020, Elizabeth filed a request in family law court for a restraining order
against Shaw, custody of their children, and for spousal support.  AR 143-44. 
At that time, she did not allege any domestic abuse.  Id.  
Elizabeth told the court there had been no “domestic altercations”
during the marriage.  AR 57. 
 
b. Separation and Petition for Divorce 
According to Elizabeth’s declaration and other family law court
documents, Elizabeth and Shaw separated on July 8, 2021.  AR 739, 796, 810.  Shaw testified that he and Elizabeth separated

On September 3,
2021, Elizabeth filed for divorce.  AR
796.  She reported that her disability
income of $4,000 per month would be reduced upon entry of dissolution.  AR 816.  Her petition for divorce made no claim of
abuse.  AR 294-95. 
On September 9,
2021, the family law court ordered the parties to attend an appointment on
November 8, 2021, via video conference, concerning child custody issues.  AR 802. 
 
c. October
2021 Emergency Protective Orders 
MPS contacted a
judge and obtained an emergency protective order (“EPO”) for Elizabeth.  Id. 
On October 6, 2021, the court granted Elizabeth a one-week EPO requiring
Shaw to move out of their home immediately and stay at least 100 yards away
from her.  AR 648. When MPD advised Shaw
of the EPO, he told them that Elizabeth had false police reports against her previous
husband, “Weaver”.  AR 648.  
LAPD Captain
Hurtado served the EPO on Shaw at work on October 7, 2021.  AR 632. The same day, Shaw surrendered all his
firearms to MPD and, with the help of his mother, removed his personal property
from the home.  AR 646, 649. 
On October 12,
2021, Elizabeth filed a request for a domestic violence restraining order and a
request for child custody.  AR 700-13. 
 
            d.
Dissolution of the Restraining Order and Forensic Substance Evaluation
On November 2,
2021, Shaw appeared in family law court to contest the restraining order that had
been imposed.  AR 144.  With Elizabeth’s consent, the court dismissed
the complaint she had filed and dissolved the “Temporary Restraining Order as
to Domestic Violence with Children.”  AR
733.  
On December 13,
2021, Shaw submitted to a forensic substance abuse evaluation by O’Brien and
Associates for purposes of the family law court proceeding.  AR 160. 
After interviewing Shaw, his mother, his sister, a family friend and two
neighbors, as well as administering two alcohol and drug assessment tests,
O’Brien and Associates advised the family law court that Shaw had no substance
use disorder.  AR 728-32. 
 
e. May 2022
Request to Amend Shaw’s Parenting Time
On February 15,
2022, the family law court issued an order limiting Shaw’s “parenting time” to
24 hours a week.  AR 740. 
On March 15, 2023,
the court ordered that Shaw have unsupervised child visitation.  Ar 790. 
The court required Shaw to “enroll in Soberlink,” and to “give notice to
the City Attorney for the Pitchess motion.” 
Id.  The court set July 20,
2023, for further hearing.  Id. 
On May 16, 2022,
Elizabeth filed an ex parte request to amend Shaw’s parenting time, alleging
child abuse. Pursuant to Family Code section 3027, the court ordered CPS to
investigate Elizabeth’s claim that Shaw was physically and emotionally abusing
their children and set a hearing date of July 25, 2022.  AR 148, 735. 
 
f. Pitchess
Motion and Request for Sole Custody
On October 26,
2022, Elizabeth filed another request for an order, alleging child abuse and
seeking sole legal and physical custody of the children and limiting Shaw’s
visitation to 24 hours per week, “professionally supervised” at Shaw’s expense.  AR 744-45. 
She also asked the court to order Shaw to pay child support and spousal
support, including “arrears” for October and November 2021, and to pay
sanctions to her in the amount of $10,000. 
AR 749.   The hearing was set for November 15, 2022.  AR 744-45, 748.  
Elizabeth also
filed a Pitchess motion, requesting an order compelling LAPD to disclose
Shaw’s records regarding his employment termination and the grounds for
dismissal.  AR 749-50, 783-88. 
 
7. IAD Interview
of Elizabeth 
On May 23, 2022,
Elizabeth was interviewed by LAPD Internal Affairs Division (“IAD”) investigator
Sergeant Mark Wright (“Sgt. Wright”).  AR
685.  She told Sgt. Wright that Shaw told
her he had started taking steroids in 2016 or 2017.  AR 686.  
She explained that
Shaw committed acts of domestic violence against her two to three times per
month during the first year of their relationship and it slowed to once every
six months.  AR 686.  In the last year, his domestic violence had increased
to once a month.  Id.  Approximately 85% of the time, these
incidents occurred after Shaw had been drinking.  Id. 
She reported incidents of domestic violence to MPD.  Id. 
She stated that she had not reported these incidents in the past because
Shaw told her that he would lose his job if LAPD found out and they would have
no money to survive.  AR 686.  
The last incident
occurred two or three months prior to her report to MPD.  Id.  
They had been drinking and arguing and later fell asleep.  In bed, Shaw got on his hands and knees and
urinated all over her.  Id.  She smacked him to “wake up”.   He laughed, got up, and urinated on a
dresser.  Id.
Elizabeth said that
she had photographs of her injuries, but she later deleted them.  AR 686. 
She did have an eight-minute recording she had made on September 17,
2019, in which Shaw admitted grabbing her face and pulling her hair.  Id. 

 
8. The Urinalysis
Results 
LAPD policy, dated
February 21, 1992, states: “Drug abuse is the wrong or improper use of chemical
substances.  It includes the use of any
illegal drug or controlled substance, along with the misuse of other chemical
substances such as alcohol, anabolic steroids, and prescription or
over-the-counter medications.”  AR 614
(emphasis added).
Due to the
allegation of anabolic steroid use, Shaw was ordered by Lt. Canales to provide
a urine sample to LAPD’s Medical Services Division.  AR 569. 
On October 19, 2021, Shaw submitted to a urinalysis test.  AR 691. 
On July 29, 2022,
nine months after the October 2021 urinalysis, NMS Labs reported the presence
of a steroid in Shaw’s urine identified as Boldenone.  AR. 618-22.  On the same date, Shaw signed a release
allowing the lab results to be released to IAB Sgt. Wright.  AR 691. 
 
9. The Charges
On August 18,
2022, IAB completed its investigation. 
AR 690.  On October 6, 2022, the
Department charged Shaw with misconduct as follows: 
 
“Count 1:
On or before September 17, 2019, you, while off duty, pulled 
E. Shaw’s hair and
grabbed her face during a domestic altercation. 
Count 2:
Between January 1, 2016, and October 7, 2021, on one or more 
occasions, you,
while on or off duty, improperly used anabolic steroids.” 
AR 26, 218. 
 
Shaw received a Skelly
package containing a Letter of Transmittal with the investigation report and
attachments.  AR 103, 692-99 (without
attachments).  
 
10. Board of
Rights Hearing
The Board of
Rights began hearing evidence on May 22, 2023.  AR 2.  Shaw
pleaded not guilty to both charges.  AR
27.
 
a.      Sgt.
Wright
Sgt. Wright testified in
pertinent part that, after he prepared his investigation report, when Elizabeth
learned that she would testify at the Board of Rights, she provided the
Department with several photographs and screenshots of her text messages with
Shaw.  AR 228-29, 653-81.  AR 184, 186, 195, 685.  She also
provided an audio recording in which he admitted grabbing her face and pulling
her hair.  AR 196.  She had not reported this incident to MPD.  AR 198-99.[2]

The NMS Labs report
did not say what amount or quantity of Boldenone was present.  AR 208. LAPD’s Medical Services Division had
no familiarity with the drug, stating only that it was an anabolic steroid for
veterinary use.  AR 209-10.  
 
b. Elizabeth
Elizabeth’s adult
daughter, Haley Smith, was present at the Board of Rights as a “support person”
during Elizabeth’s testimony.  AR 238.
Elizabeth took photographs in
July 2021 and gave them to her divorce attorney around August 2021.  AR 245-46, 248, 252-54.  She provided them again to her attorney in April or May 2023 for
the court’s evaluation of parenting practices or mental health by an expert under
Evidence Code section 730, but she did not know whether her attorney ever submitted
them to the court.  AR 246. [3]

Several photographs showed vials,
syringes, and other medications that Shaw kept either in the refrigerator or in
a box located in his closet.  AR 248-52,
342-43, 654-58.  The vials were labeled
“Boldenone” and “Equipose.”  AR 654-55. 
Shaw told
her around the beginning of 2017 that he had been using steroids for six months.  AR 244. He told her that he wanted to look
younger, and he wanted to be stronger so he could take down the “meth heads” he
encountered in his work “because they were strong when they were on meth.”  AR 278, 347. 

One photo
Elizabeth provided showed a box which she described as “a box of steroids, the
alcohol prep pads, extra needles.”  AR
249.[4]
 She photographed the box in July 2021, which
had been “in our closet.”  AR 248.  The box was addressed to Shaw with a return
address to Wilson Pena.  AR 248, 653.  Elizabeth
explained that is how the vials of steroids would arrive every six months.  AR 248.  Shaw purchased steroids from Wilson Pena.  AR 244. 
He made her pay Wilson Pena via her Venmo account.  AR 254-55. 
Elizabeth testified to screenshots of Venmo payments and text messages
discussing specific payments.  AR 254-59,
263, 269-71, 659-62, 677-78.  
Shaw did not buy gym equipment
and did not have any gym equipment at home.  
AR 351.  He went to the gym to
exercise.  AR 276, 351. 
She provided LAPD
with screen shots of text messages between herself and Shaw which referenced
his use of “man juice,” which she thought meant steroids.  AR 255-69, 665-75.  He also texted that this “man juice made him
sterile and he would become small if he did not use steroids.”  AR 667-73. 
She acknowledged that Shaw used the terms “steroids” and
“testosterone” interchangeably. AR 344-45.  
Shaw physically, verbally,
emotionally, and mentally abused her during their marriage.  AR 242-43, 271-272, 291.  He would grab her and force her to do
something she did not want to do,  which
she felt was abusive.  He also put her
down non-stop.  AR 243.  On August 17, 2020, they had been drinking and
went to bed.  AR 271.  About 30 minutes later, she felt him rollover
get on his hands and knees, and pee on her. 
AR 271.  There were about ten
occasions of physical abuse.  AR 291.  
During their divorce proceedings,
upon her attorney’s advice, Elizabeth submitted affidavits detailing Shaw’s emotional
abuse of their children.   AR
735-43.  At the advice of her counsel,
she did not put Shaw’s abuse of herself at issue because he could lose his job.
 AR 287- 288.  She told her therapist, who is a mandated
reporter, and law enforcement became involved. AR 325-26. 
On September 17,
2019, Elizabeth recorded Shaw admitting to pulling her hair and grabbing her
face.  AR 240-41, 609.  She made the audio recording while they were
riding in Shaw’s truck having an argument about what had happened the night
before.  AR 240.  In the recording, Shaw admitted that he had
grabbed her face and pulled her hair.  AR
609.  Shaw denied on the recording that
it was abuse or that he was hurting her.  AR 241, 688, 609 (timestamp 3:35-3:47).   Elizabeth
had not reported the incident because Shaw told her he would lose his job.  AR 243. 
The conversation on the audio
recording beginning at 3 minutes and 30 seconds is as follows: 
 
SHAW:  Because I’m trying to have a conversation with
you and talk to you.
ELIZABETH:   So, are you denying you pulled my hair?
SHAW:  Yea, I pulled your hair. Yea. I pulled it. I
grabbed your face like that
because I want
you to look at me. That’s not abuse. That’s not hurting you. Is it? You won’t
look at me. That’s disrespectful. When I ask you to look at me, then you look
at me.  AR 609. 
 
Elizabeth previously
agreed to dissolve the temporary restraining order because “I was told Officer
Shaw would never be able to work again with a restraining order against him”.  AR 323. 
 
c.
Shaw
Shaw testified in
pertinent part as follows.  He has worked
for LAPD for 19 years.  AR 53.  His relationship with Elizabeth started in
2010 and they stopped living together in October 2021.  AR 57. 
There have not been any domestic altercations in their
relationship.  AR 57.
He
denied ever pulling his wife’s hair or grabbing her face.  AR 58, 156. 
When the recording was played, he testified that he gently reached to
touch her face so that she would look at him. 
AR 60, 157.  She became angry and slapped
his hand away, which caught in and pulled her hair.  AR 157. 
He admitted pulling her hair in the recording because he was frustrated
by their conversation about a possible divorce and was being sarcastic.  AR 59, 63, 158.  He wanted her to stop talking about divorce
and wanting to leave him with the kids and disappear.  AR 64.
He is familiar
with LAPD drug policy and that all officers are required to follow it.  AR 67-69. 
In 2021, he was not taking any prescribed medication except testosterone.   AR 69-70. 
He was ordered to take a drug test for steroids in October 2021.  AR 76. 
He was notified of the results in September 2022.  AR 78. 
He did not know why his positive urine test result showed up.  AR 79.  He denied ever taking Boldenone or knowing
what it was before the investigation.  AR
74.  He has never had it in his house.  AR 74.
Shaw was
prescribed testosterone cypionate, which was taken by injection and prescribed
to him by his board-certified practitioner. 
AR 89, 91-92, 689.  This was for
erectile dysfunction.  AR 91.  The clinic mails it to you.  AR 72. 
It comes in a Fed Ex package and the bottles are labeled “testosterone
cypionate.”  AR 72.  Shaw said he took it only off-and-on between
2016 and 2020 because, at $300 to $500 a month, “it was always a little too
pricey for me.”  AR 75, 85.  He could only remember the name “Game Show” as
a clinic supplier and could not remember the name of other clinic
suppliers.  AR 75.  He produced
an August 1, 2022 statement from GameDay clinic that stated he was under its
care for testosterone.  AR 92-93, 683.  
He knows a man
named Wilson Pena.  AR 80.  He is a gentlemen Shaw met at the gym. AR
80.  Wilson Pena is deceased.  AR 80. 
He received one package from Wilson Pena that he recalled, but he could
not recall what was in it.  AR 80.  He bought a large piece of workout equipment
from Wilson Pena for about $1000 and paid by Venmo.  AR 80, 82. 
He has never seen the
needles, alcohol prep pads, and other stuff in the box depicted in the
photographs.  AR 409.  He recognized the picture of “bacteriostat
water” and said it was for Elizabeth’s dogs.  AR 423.  Additionally, he recognized the bottle of
Anastrozole as something he was prescribed to keep his estrogen levels down.  AR 424-25. 
His use of the
term “man juice” in his texts to Elizabeth referred to the testosterone he was
taking.  AR 83-84.  In one of the text messages, he said his
“liver count levels may be off from taking steroids.”  AR 664. 
He denied that this was an admission that he was taking steroids.  AR 84.  It was just shorthand for “testosterone.”  AR 417.  “She didn’t understand that testosterone was
not steroids.  She didn’t have an
understanding of that.”  AR 417. “She
believed everything was steroids.”  AR
419. 
In one of the text
messages, Shaw said he did not want to tell the doctor why his levels were all
messed up.  AR 675.  Shaw testified that in 2018, his “levels”
were “off,” and he was getting a lot of blood work done and eventually he was
diagnosed with celiac disease.  He did
not want to tell the doctor that he was taking testosterone because he feared
she would tell him to quit.  AR 413-14. 
 
d. Brianna
Peterson
Briana Peterson (“Peterson”) testified in pertinent part
as follows.  She is a forensic
toxicologist for NMS Labs.  AR 111.  She wrote the report for Shaw’s test
result.  AR 111, 113-14.  Shaw submitted
to a urine test for illegal substances and tested
positive for Boldenone.  AR 113-15.  See AR 618-22.  Boldenone is a steroid that is legally
used in animals for weight gain.  AR113-16.  It is illegally used by humans to build
muscle mass.  AR115-16.  Boldenone is an
illegal steroid and not for human consumption. AR 115-16.[5]   Two
tests were conducted: an initial test and a confirmatory test.  AR113-14.  The original screening test was
conducted on November 8, 2021, and the confirmation test was on November 12,
2021.  AR 114.  Her lab does a qualitative report, but not a
quantitative report.  AR 128-29.  The qualitative
assessment was sufficient to show accurate results.  AR113-15. 

 
e. Marvin Pietruska
Dr. Marvin Pietruskia (“Pietruskia”) testified for Shaw
as an expert.  AR 456-57.  He is a board-certified pathologist and forensic
toxicologist.  Id.  In his opinion, the test used by NMS Labs did
not reveal whether the Boldenone in Shaw’s system was exogenous or endogenous.  AR 495. 
If a person were to have a minor production of Boldenone in his system,
there is a test, not used by NMS Labs, that would determine whether the
substance originated from within the body or originated outside the body.  AR 469-70.  To rule out contamination in the test
laboratory and to determine whether the substance actually passed through a person’s
liver, a search must be conducted to find the metabolite as the boldenone
degraded, which was not done.  AR 470.  The test NMS Labs used was valid as a
screening test, but not as a confirmatory test. 
AR 495.  “With the proper testing,
you have essentially 100% accuracy as to whether it’s positive or negative,
whether it’s there or not. With the testing that they did, we have zero percent
chance of knowing anything.” AR 495. 
He did not test the urine sample
and admitted he was unfamiliar with Boldenone. 
AR 476. 
 
f. Carla
Hogan 
Carla Hogan (“Hogan”)
submitted a declaration in which she stated that, near the end of August 2021,
Elizabeth told her she had retained divorce counsel, and planned to tell the
attorney that Jason was abusive and that she “needed the money [sic]”.  AR 793. 
‘I (Hogan) told her (Elizabeth) that is a lie and she stated that they
will take her side because she is a woman, and her lying cannot be proved.’” AR
793.  
Hogan also testified in pertinent part as follows.  She was friends with Elizabeth and not so
much with Shaw.  AR 437.  Elizabeth talked about divorce the first time
they met.  AR 452-53.  Elizabeth did not ever say that she had been physically
abused or had her hair pulled by Shaw.  AR
442.  Elizabeth told Carla that her
divorce attorney said it was not enough to claim that her husband was cheating
on her; there had to be some kind of abuse.  Elizabeth told Carla that she was okay with
lying about that so long as Shaw got what was coming to him.  AR 446-47. 
Hogan had lived
with Shaw’s father, Parris, for 14 years but they never married.  AR 448, 454. 
Beginning in June 2021, Elizabeth was saying she wanted to divorce Shaw
and leave the children because she thought Shaw was cheating on her and she
needed to get on with her life.  AR
442-43.  Carla said Elizabeth told her
that she had been diagnosed with a mental health disorder, and some of it was
PTSD from being in the service. AR 444, 454. 
Elizabeth told her it would be a good thing if Shaw lost his job.  Elizabeth also told her she hoped Shaw would
get killed in an accident.  AR 445.  
Elizabeth told her about the recording and said that she was
baiting Shaw.  AR 451-52.  
 
10. The Board’s Decision
On May 25, 2023,
the Board of Rights found Shaw guilty of both counts of misconduct.  AR 856. 
Regarding Count 1,
the Board noted that it focused on one particular
incident on approximately September 17, 2019. 
AR 849.  Shaw admitted the
allegations in Count 1 but explained that he merely touched Elizabeth’s cheek
to turn her face towards him and his hand got tangled in her hair.  AR 850-51. 
The Board paid particular attention to the audio recording, and
Shaw’s tone of voice and word choices were demonstrably abusive.  AR 851. 
Some of the phrases were common markers of abusive behavior by domestic
violence perpetrators. Id.  
The Board found Elizabeths’
testimony on Count 1 believable.  Based
on the totality of the evidence presented and a pattern of conduct over more
than ten years, the Board found Shaw guilty of the charges set forth in Count
1.
Regarding Count 2,
the Board noted that the Department presented test results from NMS Labs
showing the presence of Boldenone, an illegal anabolic steroid, in Shaw’s urine
sample.  AR 851.  The Board heard from Peterson as to the
accuracy of the test results and the need for only a qualitative assessment,
which were sufficient for this purpose.  Id.  
Pietruszka testified
to the effect that the NMS Lab test result was a false positive.  AR 852. 
If this were a criminal proceeding, Pietruszka’s testimony might have
been sufficient to create reasonable doubt. 
Id.  However, under the preponderance
of the evidence standard, there are factors presented to the Board that suggest
Shaw injected Boldenone. Id.  In
addition to the NMS Labs result, other factors include Pietruszka’s own lack of
familiarity with Boldenone or a history with it for analysis other than his
recent research for this case, his insistence that every forensic toxicologist
would agree with his conclusion (even though Peterson did not), his insistence
of the need for 100% testing accuracy, Shaw’s reference to steroids in text
messages with Elizabeth, and Elizabeth’s photograph of Boldenone vials in a box
kept by Shaw.  Id.
With respect to
the photo, Shaw indicated that he did not know where the Boldenone came from
and that the syringes in the picture were not the type that would be used for
intramuscular injection based on the color of the cap.  AR 852-53. 
Shaw’s testimony suggests that Ellizabeth planted the Boldenone as
evidence.  Id.  This conclusion is controverted by the
testimony that her photo of the box holding Boldenone vials was taken before
the Department’s receipt of the lab results identifying the presence of Boldenone
in Shaw’s urine.  AR 853.
Shaw testified that
the syringes were for diabetic use, but his support for this statement based on
the color of the syringe cap is controverted by common knowledge.  Id. 
In addition, Shaw testified that he only used testosterone-enhancing
supplements and prescription for erectile dysfunction.  Id. 
However, Elizabeth testified that Shaw said he was using steroids to
“fight the meth heads,” and Shaw also testified that he competed in
weightlifting competition.  Id.  The Board found Shaw guilty on Count 2.  Id. 

The Board stated it was proper to note the Department’s
penalty guide and noted the only recommended penalty for steroid use in the
penalty guide is termination. AR 855. 
For a first-time sustained domestic violence count, the penalty guide
has several recommendations, including removal. 
AR 855.  The Board considered
Shaw’s 38 minor commendations as well as his disciplinary history of four
sustained complaints resulting in one admonishment, one official reprimand, and
two suspensions of seven and ten days, respectively.  AR 854. 
The Board recommended that Chief Moore terminate Shaw’s employment.  AR 855.
 
15. The
Termination
On May 31, 2023,
Chief Moore followed the Board’s recommendation and removed Shaw from his
position as police officer, retroactive to November 4, 2022, presumably the
date he was relieved of duty.  AR 856. 
 
            E. Analysis
Petitioner Shaw
contends that the Board erred because (1) the text messages and photographs
should have been excluded as a Skelly violation, (2) the audio recording
should have been excluded as illegally recorded, and (3) the weight of the
evidence does not support a finding of guilt on Count 2.
 
1. Shaw’s Right to Due Process 
a. The Text Messages and Photographs
After the investigation was concluded and the matter was set
for hearing, Elizabeth provided IAB with photographs she had taken as well as
images of text messages between herself and Shaw.  Shaw objected to this evidence on the ground it
had not been provided to him during the Skelly process.  AR 247. The Board overruled the objection. AR 279.
 Pet. Op. Br. at 13-14.
Shaw argues that there is no evidence that the Department
provided this evidence to him before he was relieved of duty.  In using this evidence without giving him an opportunity
to review and respond to it before he was relieved of duty, LAPD violated his
right to due process under Skelly, supra, 15 Cal.3d at 194.  Skelly spells out what is required of a
public employer before taking punitive action. 
Pre-disciplinary safeguards, the court said, must include at a
minimum, “notice of the proposed action, the reasons therefor, a copy of
the charges and materials upon which the action is based, and the right
to respond, either orally or in writing, to the authority initially imposing
discipline.”  Id. at 215 (emphasis
added).  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
Shaw was not provided the text messages or photographs supplied
by Elizabeth to support Count 2 before he was removed from duty on or about
October 5, 2022, and taken off the payroll on November 4, 2022.  The remedy for a Skelly violation
is clear.  Shaw is entitled to have the
Board’s action set aside and reinstatement with back pay.  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
Shaw is incorrect.  Due process requires,
at a minimum, that a permanent public employee against whom dismissal is
proposed receive a copy of all materials upon which the proposed discipline is
based and an opportunity to respond to those materials at a pre-deprivation
administrative hearing, commonly referred to as a “Skelly hearing.”  In Skelly, supra, 15 Cal.3d at 206-08,
the California Supreme Court ruled that civil service employees who cannot be
fired without good cause have a “property right in continued employment.”  See also Cleveland Board of
Education v. Loudermill, (1985) 470 U.S. 532, 538-41.  Due process entitles such public employees to
procedural safeguards before discipline is imposed against them, which include:
(1) notice of the disciplinary action proposed to be taken; (2) a statement of
the reasons therefor; (3) a copy of the charges and materials upon which the
action is based; and (4) the right to respond, either orally or in writing, to
the authority initially imposing the discipline.  Skelly, supra, 15 Cal.3d at
215-16.  The purpose of these safeguards
is to protect the employee who is wrongly disciplined against the temporary
deprivation of property before he has a hearing.  Id. at 215.
Constitutional principles of due process do not create general
rights of discovery.  Gilbert v. City
of Sunnyvale, (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1280. A “‘tenured public
employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an
explanation of the employer’s evidence, and an opportunity to present his side
of the story.’”  The employee has “‘the
right to be informed not only of the nature of the charges but also of the
substance of the relevant supporting evidence.’” Id. at 1278 (italics
omitted).  But the mere fact that the
employer provides additional materials following his Skelly hearing is
not a Skelly violation. Ibid. 
“What Skelly requires is unambiguous warning that matters have
come to a head, coupled with an explicit notice to the employee that he or she
now has the opportunity to engage the issue and present the reasons opposing such
a disposition.”  Ibid. (citation
omitted).  
Skelly only required LAPD to provide Shaw with a copy of
the charges and materials upon which its action was based.  The purpose of doing so is to give the public
employee a pre-deprivation opportunity to avoid discipline by explaining
whatever evidence the Department had at the Skelly hearing.  The required disclosure is not intended to
limit the scope of whatever evidence the public employer may develop after the Skelly
hearing for the post-deprivation hearing.[6]
As the Department argues, Shaw was only entitled to the evidence
Chief Moore may have reviewed in rendering his decision. If the Department did
not have an item prior to the Skelly hearing, then he could not have
been relied on it.  Chief Moore did not
rely on the photographs and text messages to render his decision because the
Department did not have them yet.  Opp.
at 8-9.
In reply, Shaw argues that the Department contends that it can
withhold evidence and then introduce it at the Board hearing simply because the
Chief of Police did not review it.  Skelly
does not allow for such gamesmanship. 
Reply at 6.  Maybe so, but that is
not what happened.  The Department did
not withhold the text messages and photographs. 
It was unaware of them until Elizabeth produced them after she learned that
she would testify at a Board of Rights hearing (AR 228-29), at which point they
were disclosed to Shaw as evidence.[7]
 
b. The Audio Recording
On September 17, 2019, Elizabeth recorded Shaw in a
conversation where he admitted to pulling her hair and grabbing her face. AR 60-61,
240-41, 609.  Shaw was unaware that
Elizabeth was recording.  AR157, 693.  In the recording, Shaw admitted that he had
pulled her hair and grabbed her face.  However,
he denied in the recording that it was “abuse” or that he was hurting her.  AR 241, 609 (audio file, 3:35 - 3:47).  On May 23, 2022, Elizabeth told IAB Sgt.
Wright that she had the recording and provided it to him.  AR 184, 186, 195, 685.  
Elizabeth testified that she made the recording while the
two of them were riding in Shaw’s truck and having an argument about what had
happened the night before.  AR 240.  Shaw testified that he was trying to get his
wife to stop talking about divorce, “and to stop bringing up the fact that she
wanted to leave me with the kids and disappear.” AR 64.  
During the IAB investigation, Shaw’s attorney objected to
use of the recording since it had been recorded surreptitiously.  AR 688. 
Shaw now reiterates that contention that the recording was inadmissible
as evidence.  The conversation recorded
by Elizabeth was clearly “confidential” within the meaning of Penal Code section
632 and may not be relied on as evidence. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 15; Reply at 4.
Penal Code section 632 provides that “[a]nyone
who, intentionally and without the consent of all parties to a confidential
communication, uses an electronic amplifying or recording device to eavesdrop
upon or record the confidential communication…” is guilty of a crime.  Penal Code §632(a).  A “confidential communication” for purposes of Penal Code
section 632(a) is defined as any conversation under circumstances showing that
a party desires it not to be overheard or recorded.  Flanagan v. Flanagan, (2002) 27
Cal.4th 766, 774.
Penal Code section 633.5 provides an exception to Penal Code
section 632 and states:
 
“Nothing in Section 631
or 632 shall be construed as prohibiting one party to a confidential
communication from recording such communication for the purpose of obtaining
evidence reasonably believed to relate to the commission by another party
to such communication of the crime of extortion, kidnapping, bribery, any
felony involving violence against the person, or a violation of  Section 653m, and nothing in Section 631 or
632 shall be construed as rendering inadmissible in a prosecution for
extortion, kidnapping, bribery, any felony involving violence against the
person, or a violation of Section 653m, or any crime in connection therewith,
any evidence so obtained.” (emphasis added).
 
Penal Code section 633.5 allows a party to record a
confidential communication for the purpose of obtaining evidence reasonably
believed to relate to the commission of domestic violence by another party.  The recording does not need to be made only
for the purpose of instituting a prosecution. 
Ayers, supra, 51 Cal.App.3d at 377 (recordings to show
bribery made for parties’ own use and not prosecution were admissible at
criminal trial).  Opp.
at 9.
Shaw replies that Ayers
concerned a conspiracy to commit murder.  Id. 
at 372.  In upholding the
admission of recordings at the criminal trial, the court pointed out that Penal
Code sections 631 and 632 make “it a crime for private individuals to intercept
or record telephonic or other conversations without the consent of all
parties to the conversation….  Id.
at 376 (emphasis added).  Shaw argues
that the recording was not made “for the purpose of obtaining evidence” of any
crime.  Even though Elizabeth made the
recording on September 17, 2019, she never reported the incident to MPD.  AR 198-99. 
She did not even tell IAB investigator Sgt. Wright about the recording
until she knew Shaw was under investigation. 
AR 184, 186, 195, 685.  Shaw
concludes that Penal Code section 633.5 does not make the illegal audio
recording admissible at a Board of Rights hearing.  Reply at 5.
Shaw is incorrect.  Elizabeth
recorded Shaw to capture his admission about his domestic abuse. Pursuant to Penal
Code section 633.5, Elizabeth lawfully recorded him, and the audio recording
was properly admitted.  The issues
whether Shaw’s domestic violence amounted to a felony, and whether she intended
to use his admission to file a criminal complaint, do not affect its
admissibility. 
The Department also
argues that it did not record the conversation and Shaw’s legal recourse is
against Elizabeth.[8]  Opp. at 9. 
This is incorrect.  As Ayers
noted, Penal Code section 631 expressly provides that “‘[e]xcept as proof in an
action or prosecution for violation of this section, no evidence obtained in
violation of this section shall be admissible in any judicial, administrative,
legislative or other proceedings.’” 51 Cal.App.3d at 376 (emphasis added).  
However, Ayers noted that the two witnesses who recorded
the defendants testified at trial and could have testified to all the matters
on the recording without any contention that the criminal defendants’ rights were
violated.  Id. at 378.  Essentially, the court found any error in
admitting the recordings was harmless.  Id.  In this case, both Elizabeth and Shaw
testified at the hearing, and both testified to what Shaw said on the recording.  In his testimony, Shaw admitted that he grabbed
Elizabeth’s face and pulled her hair.  He
explained it by testifying that he gently reached to touch her face so
that she would look at him.  AR 60, 157.  She became angry and slapped his hand away,
which caught in and pulled her hair.  AR
157. He should not have admitted this conduct if he wanted to preserve
his objection to the significance of the recording.  It is true that Shaw’s tone also was of significance
to the Board, but the fact is that he admitted the misconduct.
As a result, any error was harmless.  “Reversible error requires demonstration of
prejudice arising from the reasonable probability the party ‘would have
obtained a better outcome’ in the absence of the error”.  Fisher
v. State Personnel Board, (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1, 20.   CCP section 1094.5(a)’s requirement of a
fair hearing is no different.  “A writ of
administrative mandamus will not be issued unless the court is persuaded that
an abuse of discretion was prejudicial.”  Quinitar v. County of Riverside, (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
1226, 1236.   
 
2. the Sufficiency of the Evidence on Count 2
Count 2 alleged that “Between
January 1, 2016, and October 7, 2021, on one or more occasions, you, while on
or off duty, improperly used anabolic steroids.” AR 26, 218. 
Preliminarily, Shaw argues that, to the extent that the
Board relied on screenshots of text messages from Shaw to Ellizabeth alluding
to “man juice” and making other comments, that reliance is unlawful under Penal
Code sections 632, 632.5, 632.6 and 632.7. 
 
“These statutes protect
against interception or recording of any communication.  When the Legislature determined that there was
no practical means or protecting cordless and cellular phone conversations from
accidental eavesdropping, it chose to protect all such conversations from
malicious or intentional eavesdropping or recording, rather than
protecting only conversations where a party wanted to keep the contents
secret.”  Flanagan v. Flanagan, supra,
27 Cal.4th at 776 (italics in original; underlining added).  Pet. Op. Br. at 17.            
 
            Penal section 632 only applies to the recording of audible sound
or symbol-based communications. People v. Drennan, (2000)
84 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1353, 1358 (statute does not apply to
photographs).   While the statute
can apply to written words, Elizabeth did not “record” any text messages.  They were sent to her by Shaw and appeared on
her telephone.  They are no different for
purposes of analysis than testimony about the contents of a telephone call or an
email, neither of which is protected by Penal Code section 632.  The text messages were admissible.
Shaw contends that the evidence is
insufficient on Count 2.  On October 5,
2021, Elizabeth told MPD that she believed her husband was cheating on her with
other women and that he was an alcoholic and taking steroids.  AR 642-43. 

Shaw testified that in 2021 he was not
taking any prescribed medication except testosterone.   AR 69-70. He was prescribed testosterone
cypionate, which was taken by injection and prescribed to him by his
board-certified practitioner.  AR 89,
91-92, 689.  This was for erectile
dysfunction.  AR 91. Shaw had a
prescription for testosterone cypionate, which was taken by injection.  AR 89, 689, 690.  According to Wikipedia,[9] testosterone cypionate is an anabolic
steroid, approved by the FDA for treatment of hypogonadism.  Reply at 6. 

Shaw testified that he knew a man named
Wilson Pena, who now is deceased.  AR
80.  He received one package from Wilson Pena
but could not recall what was in it.  AR
80.  He bought a large piece of workout
equipment from Wilson Pena for about $1000. 
AR 80, 82.  He paid Pena by
Venmo.  AR 82.  
On October 21,
2021, Shaw submitted to a drug test.  AR
623.  The test results were positive for testosterone.  AR 620. 
This qualitative test was also positive for Boldenone.  A.R. 620, 621.  He did not know why his positive urine test result
for Boldenone showed up.  AR 79.  He denied ever taking Boldenone or knowing
what it is before the investigation.  AR
74.  He has never had it in his
house.  AR 74.
The
Department’s investigation referenced an article by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (“USADA”)
about Boldenone. A.R. 685, 690. Based on this article, the Department investigation
states that “[B]oldenone was not approved by the Food and Drug for use in
humans for any reason.” A.R. 685.  However,
the Department investigation also acknowledged that the same USADA article
indicated that “boldenone had been found in adulterated nutritional supplements
sold over the counter and were often not declared on the product labels.” AR
685.  
Shaw argues that there
is no dispute that the Department’s “qualitative” test cannot be used to
distinguish if the Boldenone detected was “endogenous” (naturally occurring)
versus “exogenous” (externally administered). AR 131, 466, 469-470. The
Department did not do the “isotope testing” that Peterson admitted is
“recommended…in order to determine why boldenone is in the sample.” AR
130.  Therefore, the Department cannot
assert that the qualitative positive result necessarily means that Shaw was
taking Boldenone.  Using the flawed test
report, the Department charged Shaw with violating Department policy which
defines “drug abuse” as, among other things, the misuse of anabolic steroids
and prescription or over the counter medications.  A.R. 614.[10]

            The
weight of the evidence supports the guilty finding on Count 2.  The qualitative test conducted by NMS
Labs reported the presence of Boldenone. 
AR. 618-22.  As Pietruskia testified, this test was not conclusive
of the quantity of Boldenone in Shaw’s urine and could not definitively say
that it did not come from another source, such as whether the Boldenone in
Shaw’s system was exogenous or endogenous. 
AR 495.  To determine whether the Boldenone
actually passed through Shaw’s liver, a search must be conducted to find the
metabolite as the Boldenone degraded, which was not done.  AR 470.  Nonetheless, Pietruskia admitted that the test
NMS Labs used was valid as a screening test, albeit not as a confirmatory
test.  AR 495.  
The
remaining evidence confirmed that Shaw injected himself with the Boldenone,
which is illegally used by humans to build muscle mass.
 AR 115-16.  Elizabeth testified
that Shaw told her around the beginning of 2017 that he had been using steroids
for six months.  AR 244. Shaw told her
that he wanted to look younger, and he wanted to be stronger so he could take
down the “meth heads” he encountered in his work “because they were strong when
they were on meth.”  AR 278, 347.  Elizabeth contradicted Shaw by testifying that he did not
buy gym equipment and did not have any gym equipment at home.   AR 351. 
He went to the gym to exercise.  AR
276, 351. 
            Screenshots
of text messages show ongoing conversations between Shaw and Elizabeth regarding
steroids spanning from 2016 to 2022. AR 660-81.  In the text messages, Shaw which referenced
his use of “man juice,” which Elizabeth thought meant steroids.  AR 255-69, 665-75.  He also texted that this “man juice made him
sterile and he would become small if he did not use steroids.”  AR 667-73. 
Elizabeth acknowledged that Shaw used the terms “steroids” and
“testosterone” interchangeably. AR 344-45. 
Several photographs showed vials, syringes, and other
medications that Shaw kept either in the refrigerator or in a box located in
his closet.  AR 248-52, 342-43, 654-58.  The vials were labeled “Boldenone” and
“Equipose.”  AR 654-55.  Elizabeth testified that the vials of steroids would arrive in
packages every six months. AR 248.  Shaw kept
the steroids in his closet and in their refrigerator. AR 249-52.  Elizabeth saw Shaw inject the contents of the
vials using needles into his buttocks.  AR
250-51.   
One photo
Elizabeth provided showed a box which she described as “a box of steroids, the
alcohol prep pads, extra needles.”  AR
249.  She photographed the box in July
2021, which had been in “our closet.”  AR
248.  The box was addressed to Shaw with
a return address to Wilson Pena.  AR 248,
653.  Shaw
purchased steroids from Wilson Pena.  AR 244.  He made her pay Wilson Pena via her Venmo
account.  AR 254-55.  
Thus, Shaw’s use of Boldenone is supported by the test
results reported by NMS Labs, Elizabeth’s testimony, the text messages, the Venmo
payments, and the photographs. 
Elizabeth’s testimony is credible and supported by her evidence.  It is also credible, as the Board noted, because
she would not have known about the positive Boldenone test when she took the
photo of the box holding Boldenone vials. 
See AR 853.  Shaw’s use
also is corroborated by his own testimony that he competed in weightlifting
competition, and Boldenone is used to build muscle mass.
Shaw further
argues that the evidence does not support his use of Boldenone in the timeframe
between January 1, 2016 and October 7, 2021. 
Shaw submitted to a urine test on October 19, 2021, which was outside
the timeframe.  See AR 691.  Elizabeth testified that he told her he was
using steroids at the beginning of 2017, but she also acknowledged that Shaw
used the terms “steroids” and “testosterone” interchangeably.  AR 344-45. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 16. 
The evidence shows Petitioner’s steroid use
was during the pertinent timeframe.  Elizabeth
testified that Shaw told her around the beginning of 2017 that he had been
using steroids for six months. AR 244.  In
July of 2021, Elizabeth took photographs of the steroid vials and other
substances in their home.  AR 254. The
Venmo transaction to pay Wilson Pena was on August 26, 2021.  AR 255, 659.  Text messages between Shaw and Elizabeth
pertaining to steroids were sent on various dates from 2016 to 2021. AR 256-70.  The evidence supports the dates in Count 2.  
The weight of the evidence supports Shaw’s guilt
on Count 2. 
 
            F.
Conclusion
Given that the questioned evidence was properly received,
Shaw essentially admitted guilt on Count 1 and the test results are
corroborated on Count 2.  The Petition is
denied.  
The City’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed
judgment, serve it on Shaw’s counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days
after service for any objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and
then submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the
existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for May 23, 2023
