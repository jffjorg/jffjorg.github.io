Summary in English text:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling granting defendant PAMA Management, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment in a personal injury action. The Court finds that there is no triable issue of material fact regarding the issue of duty, as PAMA Management, Inc. did not own or control the subject property at the time of the incident. The Court notes that PAMA Management, Inc. presented sufficient evidence to establish the absence of a triable issue of fact, including property management agreements and testimony from a property manager. The Court also agrees with PAMA Management, Inc. that the Plaintiff's discovery responses were factually devoid on the issue of PAMA Management, Inc.'s alleged ownership or control of the subject property. As a result, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to establish the existence of a triable issue of material fact and is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Court orders PAMA Management, Inc. to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days.
