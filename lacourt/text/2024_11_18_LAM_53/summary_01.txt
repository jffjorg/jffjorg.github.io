And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to bifurcate the trial to first determine whether Karlen Galstyan is entitled to declaratory relief regarding his identity theft claim. The court finds that there is likely to be an overlap of issues, witnesses, and evidence, and that bifurcating the trial would not be in furtherance of convenience, the ends of justice, or judicial economy. The court has also denied the joinder to the motion to bifurcate filed by the joining parties. The judge has ordered cross-complainant Karlen Galstyan to give notice of this ruling.
