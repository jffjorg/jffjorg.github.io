plaintiff’s motion for new trial
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Rebecca Marshall     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Defendant College Hospital Inc.
Motion for New Trial
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Rebecca Marshall (“Plaintiff”) filed her First Amended
Complaint in this action on March 17, 2022, alleging seven causes of action
against defendant College Hospital Inc. (“Defendant”) for (1) material breach
of arbitration agreement; (2) discrimination on the basis of age, disability,
and medical condition; (3) medical condition and disability harassment and
hostile work environment; (4) failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent
discrimination, harassment, and retaliation; (5) retaliation; (6) interference
and retaliation; and (7) wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. 
On August 27, 2024, the court issued an order granting Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.  (Aug. 27, 2024 Order, p. 21:16-17.)  The court entered judgment in favor of
Defendant and against Plaintiff pursuant to that order on October 18,
2024.  (Oct. 18, 2024 Judgment.)  Defendant served Plaintiff with notice of
entry of the court’s judgment on October 18, 2024.  (Oct. 18, 2024 Notice of Entry of Judgment,
p. 5 [proof of electronic service of Notice].) 
Plaintiff now moves the court for an order setting aside the order
granting Defendant’s motion for summary judgment and granting Plaintiff a new
trial on the grounds that (1) there was an irregularity in the proceedings of
the court, Defendant and its counsel, or any order of the court or abuse of
discretion by which Plaintiff was prevented from having a fair trial, and (2)
there was an error in law.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 657, subds. (1) [a new trial may be granted based on “[i]rregularity
in the proceedings of the court, jury or adverse party, or any order of the
court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a
fair trial”], (7) [a new trial may be granted based on an “[e]rror in law,
occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application”]; Doe
v. United Air Lines, Inc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1504 [“An order
granting summary judgment is properly challenged by a motion for a new
trial”].) 
First, as a threshold matter, the court notes that, in Plaintiff’s
“Notice of Motion to Move for New Trial,” filed on November 1, 2024, Plaintiff
asserted that the court’s jurisdiction to rule on Plaintiff’s motion expired as
of November 11, 2024.  (Nov. 1, 2024
Notice of Mot. for New Trial, p. 2:25-27.) 
The court finds that it has jurisdiction to rule on Plaintiff’s motion until
November 25, 2024.
“[T]he power of the court to rule on a motion for a new trial shall
expire 75 days after the mailing of notice of entry of judgment by the clerk of
the court pursuant to Section 664.5 or 75 days after service on the moving
party by any party of written notice of entry of judgment, whichever is
earlier, or if that notice has not been given, 75 days after the filing of the
first notice of intention to move for a new trial.  If the motion is not determined within the
75-day period, or within that period as extended, the effect shall be a denial
of the motion without further order of the court.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 660, subd. (c).) 
The court acknowledges, as Plaintiff has asserted, that Defendant
served on Plaintiff notice of the court’s order granting Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment on August 27, 2024.  (Def.
Aug. 27, 2024 Notice of Ruling, p. 6 [proof of electronic service of notice of
ruling].)  However, to the extent that
Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s notice of ruling began the 75-day period by
which the court is required to rule on this motion, the court disagrees.  As set forth above, the power of a court to
rule on a motion for a new trial shall expire 75 days after the earliest that one
of the following three circumstances occurs: (1) the mailing of notice of entry
of judgment by the clerk pursuant to Section 664.5, (2) service on the moving
party by any party of written notice of entry of judgment, whichever is
earlier, or, if notice has not been given, (3) the filing of the first notice
of intention to move for a new trial. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 660, subd. (c).)  
The court finds, and Plaintiff does not appear to contest, that the clerk
of the court did not mail notice of entry of judgment pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.5 after the court issued its August 27, 2024 order
granting Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.  Further, the court finds that service on
Plaintiff of notice of the court’s order granting Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment does not constitute service “of written notice of entry of
judgment” because the court, while granting summary judgment in favor of
Defendant, did not enter judgment in its August 27, 2024 order.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 660, subd. (c); Aug. 27,
2024 Order, p. 21:16-17 [granting summary judgment], 21:20-21 [ordering
Defendant to prepare proposed judgment]; Collins v. Sutter Memorial Hospital
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1, 11 [finding that “notice of entry of [the order
granting summary judgment] was not the same as notice of entry of a judgment
that triggers the [former] 60-day period to rule on a new trial motion under
section 660”], 15 [“While an order granting summary judgment may be the
‘rendition’ of judgment, such that the losing party is aggrieved and may move
for a new trial without running afoul of the prematurity trap, it is not a
‘judgment’ and does not trigger the [former] 60-day deadline”].) 
Because neither the clerk of the court nor Defendant served Plaintiff
with “notice of entry of judgment” on August 27, 2024, the 75-day time period
commenced when Plaintiff filed her first notice of intention to move for a new
trial on September 11, 2024.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 660, subd. (c) [“if that notice has not been given, [the power of the
court to rule on a motion for new trial shall expire] 75 days after the filing
of the first notice of intention to move for a new trial”]; Collins, supra,
196 Cal.App.4th at p. 14 [“When the notice of entry of judgment has been served
after the notice of intent to move for a new trial, it is the notice of intent
to move for a new trial that serves as the operable trigger for the [former]
60-day clock, not notice of the judgment”].)  Thus, the court finds that it has jurisdiction
to rule on Plaintiff’s motion until 75 days after September 11, 2024, which the
court has calculated to be November 25, 2024. 
Second, based on the court’s review of all the papers filed in
connection with Defendant’s motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication
and Plaintiff’s motion for new trial, the court finds that Plaintiff has not
shown that (1) there was an irregularity of the proceedings of the court by
which Plaintiff was prevented from having a fair trial, or (2) there was an
error in law occurring at the trial. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subds. (1), (7).) 
“An ‘irregularity in the proceedings’ is a catchall phrase referring
to any act that (1) violates the right of a party to a fair trial and (2) which
a party ‘cannot fully present by exceptions taken during the progress of the
trial, and which must therefore appear by affidavits.’”  (Montoya v. Barragan (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 1215, 1229-1230 [internal citation omitted].)  “Under [the error in law] ground, a trial
court may grant a new trial if ‘its original ruling, as a matter of law, was
erroneous.’”  (Collins, supra,
196 Cal.App.4th at pp. 17-18 [internal citation omitted].) 
As to Plaintiff’s contention that Defendant failed to provide a
legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason “for failing to provide [Plaintiff] with
accommodations for her medical conditions[,]” the court (1) disagrees and finds
that it did not err in determining that Defendant met its burden to produce
evidence to show that Defendant had a nondiscriminatory reason for terminating
Plaintiff, which is the adverse employment action that is alleged in
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (FAC ¶ 15); (2) notes that Plaintiff did
not allege that Defendant failed to accommodate her in support of the second
cause of action  or in support of any
other cause of action; and (3) notes that, even if Plaintiff had attempted to
allege that the adverse employment action on which she based the cause of
action for discrimination was a failure to accommodate her or to engage in the
interactive process, such an allegation would be insufficient to support the
cause of action for discrimination because alleged failures to accommodate a
disability and to engage in the interactive process are separate from
discrimination.  (Mot., p. 7:20-22; Aug.
27, 2024 Order, pp. 5:1-6:25; Doe v. Department of Corrections &
Rehabilitation (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 721, 735-736 [“No court has ever held
that a failure to reasonably accommodate an employee’s disability—which is a
separate cause of action under FEHA (§ 12940, subd. (m))—can qualify as the
adverse action underlying a discrimination or retaliation claim”].)  The court further finds that it did not err in
finding that Plaintiff did not meet her burden to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists as to whether Defendant’s proffered reason for terminating
her was pretext for discrimination. 
The court also finds that (1) the court did not err in granting
summary adjudication as to the cause of action for harassment because, although
“[h]arassment cases are rarely appropriate for disposition on summary
judgment[,]” the court concluded that (i) Defendant met its burden to show that
this cause of action had no merit, and (ii) Plaintiff did not meet her burden
to show a triable issue of material fact exists as to the element of
harassment; (2) the court did not err in granting summary adjudication as to
Plaintiff’s causes of action for retaliation in violation of the Fair
Employment and Housing Act and California Family Rights Act; and (3) the court
did not err in granting summary adjudication as to the derivative causes of
action for failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, and
wrongful discharge in violation of public policy since the court has determined
that it did not err in granting summary adjudication as to the underlying
causes of action.  (Gov. Code, § 12923,
subd. (e); Aug. 27, 2024 Order, pp. 15:11-13, 15:27-28, 16:20-17:4, 18:9-26,
19:20-20:10.) 
The court notes that Plaintiff has also argued that the court erred in
granting summary judgment because Defendant failed to provide Plaintiff
reasonable accommodations and failed to engage in the interactive process with
Plaintiff.  (Mot., pp. 15:5-16:19.)  However, Plaintiff did not allege, in her
First Amended Complaint, that Defendant engaged in those unlawful employment
practices.  (FAC ¶¶ 17-31 [alleging
breach of arbitration agreement], 32-44 [alleging discrimination], 45-52
[alleging harassment], 53-61 [alleging failure to prevent discrimination, harassment,
and retaliation], 62-70 [alleging retaliation], 71-82 [alleging retaliation],
83-89 [alleging wrongful discharge]; Alameda Health System v. Alameda County
Employees’ Retirement Assn. (2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 1159, 1174 [“The
pleadings establish ‘the outer measure of materiality in summary judgment
proceedings’”].)  While the court notes
(and noted in its order granting summary judgment) that, in support of the
cause of action for failure to take steps to prevent discrimination,
harassment, and retaliation, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant’s conduct was
done with the intent to harm Plaintiff and to prevent her from “receiv[ing] a
reasonable and good faith interactive process from her employers to determine
an accommodation” (FAC ¶ 59), that allegation is conclusory, does not cite
Government Code section 12940, subdivisions (m) and (n), and therefore does not
fairly allege a failure to accommodate or to engage in the interactive process
on the part of Defendant.  (Gov. Code, §
12940, subds. (m) [it is an unlawful employment practice to fail to make a
reasonable accommodation], (n) [it is an unlawful employment practice to fail
to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process to determine effective
reasonable accommodations].) 
Thus, the court finds that the court did not make an error in law in
granting Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subd. (7).)  For the same reasons, the court finds that
there was not an irregularity in the proceedings of the court by which
Plaintiff was prevented from having a fair trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subd. (1).) 
The court therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion for a new trial.  
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Rebecca
Marshall’s motion for a new trial. 
            The court orders defendant College
Hospital Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
