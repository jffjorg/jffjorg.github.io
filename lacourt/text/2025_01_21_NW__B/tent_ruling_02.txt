[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL
   PLAINTIFF’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY MOTIONS

DATE:
  JANUARY 21, 2025
TIME:  8:30 A.M.
 
COMPLAINT
  FILED: MAY 2, 2022
TRIAL
  DATE: NONE



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
On May 2, 2022, Plaintiff Noah Cvengros (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendant Sam Tucker (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 10
alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence.
On March 4, 2024, Defendant filed three
motions to compel further responses against Plaintiff, as to the following
discovery documents: (1) Form Interrogatories, Set One; (2) Requests for
Admissions, Set One; and (3) Special Interrogatories, Set One (“Discovery
Motions”). Plaintiff also requests sanctions in the total amount of $4,065
($1,355 per motion).
On December 19, 2024, the Court held a
hearing on the instant motions. Plaintiff’s counsel’s was recently substituted
into the matter on December 2, 2024. (See December 19, 2024, Minute
Order.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s counsel represented that they would provide
verified, code-compliant, objection-free responses within 20 days. 
Consequently, counsel were to submit a joint
statement on the status of discovery at least five days prior to the next
hearing. Counsel have not done so.  The
Court assumes from the failure to file a joint statement that Plaintiff failed
to provide discovery responses as represented and issues the following
tentative ruling. 
The motions remain unopposed.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
Interrogatories
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 provides, in pertinent part, that
“[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that
any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under
Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general.” (CCP § 2030.300(a).) 
Unless notice of a motion to compel further responses is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response. (CCP § 2030.300(c).) 
 
Request for
Admissions
CCP § 2033.290 provides, in pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a
response to requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move
for an order compelling a further response if that party deems that either or
both of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive
or incomplete. (2) An objection to a particular request is without merit or too
general.” (CCP § 2033.290(a).) 
Unless notice of a motion to compel further responses is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response. (CCP § 2033.290(c).)
Under California law, the objecting party has the burden of justifying
its objections when the propounding party requests that the Court order further
responses. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Further, under CCP § 2023.010, it is a misuse of discovery to make unmerited
objections. (CCP § 2023.010(e).) 
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer
Requirement
A motion to compel further responses shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration. (CCP §§ 2030.300(b) and 2033.290(b).) Here, defense counsel
provides a declaration demonstrating diligent efforts to meet and confer with
opposing counsel. (Silva Van Vo Decl. ¶ 13; Exh. E [meet and confer letter].)
On February 9, 2024, defense counsel sent a Meet and Confer Letter to opposing
counsel, outlining the deficiencies in Plaintiff’s responses and offering
fourteen additional days for further response. (Ibid.) Defense counsel
did not receive a response nor supplemental discovery. Therefore, the Court
finds Defendant’s meet and confer efforts to be sufficient pursuant to CCP §
2030.300(b).)
 
Form Interrogatories,
Set One
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One Nos. 2.5-2.6, 6.1-6.7, 8.5, 17.1, 20.1, and
20.3-20.10.
The motion is granted.. Plaintiff generally fails to provide any
response to these interrogatories, with or without objection. Each
interrogatory is related to discoverable matter. Therefore, Plaintiff is
ordered to provide verified, objection-free, supplemental responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 2.5-2.6, 6.1-6.7, 8.5, 17.1, 20.1, and
20.3-20.10.
 
Requests for
Admissions, Set One
Defendant moves to compel the Plaintiff's further responses to Requests
for Admissions, Set One, Nos. 4-9 and 12-13.
The motion is granted. Plaintiff’s responses are generally riddled with
typing errors and what appear to be incoherent drafting notes. Plaintiff is
ordered to provide verified, clear, objection-free, supplemental
responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One, Nos. 4-9 and 12-13.
 
Special
Interrogatories, Set One
Defendant moves to compel the Plaintiff’s further responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 2-9 and 11-14.
The motion is granted. Plaintiff’s responses to Nos. 2-4 are generally
riddled with typing errors and what appear to be incoherent drafting notes.
Plaintiff’s responses to Nos. 5, 9, and 11, are incomplete. Plaintiff fails to
provide any responses to Nos. 6-8 and 12-14.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, clear, objection-free,
supplemental responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 2-9 and 11-14.
 
Monetary Sanctions
“The court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct”
under CCP § 2023.030(a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
Here, Plaintiff failed to completely and coherently respond to
Defendant’s Discovery Motions, constituting a misuse of the discovery process.
Therefore, monetary sanctions are appropriate.
Defendant requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,355 per
motion, representing a $60 filing fee, four hours preparing each motion and an
anticipated three hours for the hearing of each motion at an hourly rate of
$185. (Silva Van Vo Decl. ¶ 15.) The Court reduces monetary sanctions to $615
per motion, representing three hours of work per motion at an hourly rate of
$185 and a $60 filing fee, as each motion is largely identical and no
oppositions were filed. Therefore, the Court awards monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff in the total amount of $1,845.
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s Discovery
Motions are GRANTED.
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff provides verified, complete and
code-compliant responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One Nos. 2.5-2.6, 6.1-6.7, 8.5, 17.1, 20.1, and
20.3-20.10, Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 2-9 and 11-14, and Requests
for Admissions, Set One, Nos. 4-9 and 12-13, within 20 days of this order.
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, are also ordered to
pay defense counsel $1,845.00 in monetary sanctions within 20 days of this
order.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
