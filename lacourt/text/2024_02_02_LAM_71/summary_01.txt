And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Frank H. Whitehead III's motion for attorneys' fees and costs against Plaintiffs Shari Giuliany, Bill Demarest, and Helen Ortega. The motion is granted in the reduced total amount of $22,682.50. The court finds that Defendant was the prevailing party in the Anti-SLAPP Motion and is entitled to recover attorneys' fees and costs under CCP §425.16(c). The court uses the lodestar method to calculate the attorneys' fees and reduces the total amount sought by Defendant's counsel due to block billing and vague time entries. The court awards Defendant $22,682.50 in attorneys' fees and costs, which includes $18,762.50 for work done on the Anti-SLAPP Motion and $3,800 for work done on the instant motion. The court also awards Defendant $120.00 in costs for filing fees.
