And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge denies the Plaintiff's default judgment packet and sets a hearing to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed. The hearing is scheduled for February 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The Judge intends to dismiss the complaint without further notice if the reasons for the default judgment are not addressed.

The Judge has concerns that the Plaintiff did not provide a DOES dismissal, interest calculation, or a calculation of attorneys' fees according to the Local Rule 3.2 schedule. Additionally, the judgment seeks damages greater than the amount in the FAC's prayer for damages, which may be a violation of California law.

The Judge intends to sanction the Plaintiff's counsel $250 for failing to enter the default judgment and sets a hearing to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed. The Judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 578 and 579, California Rule of Court rule 3.110(h), and the case of Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831.
