Defendant Frank H. Whitehead III’s motion for
attorneys’ fees against Plaintiffs Shari Giuliany, Bill
Demarest, and Helen Ortega is granted in the reduced total amount of $22,682.50.
 
Defendant
Frank H. Whitehead III (“Whitehead”) (“Defendant”) moves for an order awarding
his attorneys’ fees and costs against Plaintiffs Shari Giuliany (“Giuliany”),
Bill Demarest (“Demarest”), and Helen Ortega (“Ortega”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
in the total amount of $31,424.15, comprised of $25,664.15 for
attorney’s fees and costs already incurred, and an additional $5,760.00 for
this motion and future anticipated attorney’s fees and costs.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P.
§425.16(c)(1).)
 
Background
On August 22, 2022,
Plaintiffs filed their operative complaint (“Complaint”) against Defendant
Whitehead and the Law Offices of Frank H. Whitehead III (“Law Office”)
(collectively, “Defendants”), alleging two causes of action: (1) Violation of
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1692, et seq.
(“FDCPA”); and (2) Violation of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act, Civil Code §§1788 et seq. (“RFDCPA”).  On July 11, 2023, this Court granted Defendant’s
special motion in the alternative to strike (“Anti-SLAPP Motion”) the 2nd cause
of action in Plaintiffs’ Complaint. 
(7/11/23 Minute Order.) 
On September 18, 2023, Defendant
filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees. 
On October 3, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their opposition.  On December 4, 2023, Defendant filed his
reply.
 
Discussion
C.C.P.
§425.16(c)(1) provides, in part, “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to
strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.”  California law makes the award of attorneys’
fees and costs to a prevailing anti-SLAPP defendant mandatory.  (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1131 [“[u]nder Code of Civil Procedure §425.16, subdivision (c), any
SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to
mandatory attorney’s fees.”].)  Here, Defendant
was the prevailing party in the Anti-SLAPP Motion.  (See 7/11/23 Minute Order.)  Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for
attorneys’ fees is proper and he is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and
costs.
 
Reasonable Fees
The California Supreme Court has determined
the lodestar method is the proper mechanism to calculate attorneys’ fees under
C.C.P. §425.16(c).  (See Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at pg. 1136.)  To calculate a
lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by Defendant’s counsel.  The “reasonable hourly rate” applicable under
the lodestar method is the rate “prevailing in the community for similar work.”
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  “The trial court makes its determination
after consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the
litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its
handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and
other circumstances in the case.”  (Id. at pg. 1096.)
Defendant’s Counsel declares his hourly rate
in this case is $475 per hour.  (Decl. of
Hovsepian ¶¶14-15, Exh. H.)  The Court
determines based on its experience that Defendant’s Counsel’s hourly rates are
reasonable in his community of practice.
An anti-SLAPP motion is complex in nature and requires the
submission of declarations and evidence akin to a motion for summary judgment
or a preliminary injunction.  Defendant’s counsel declares the Anti-SLAPP
motion in the instant case required him to spend many hours researching the
relevant law, interviewing his client, and reviewing the Complaint and
underlying eviction cases.  (Decl. of Hovsepian
¶4.)  Defendant’s efforts resulted in the
dismissal of one of two causes of action alleged against him.  Accordingly, Defendant’s requested attorneys’
fees are reasonable.
 
Billed Hours
The verified time entries of the attorneys
are entitled to a presumption of credibility, which extends to an attorney’s
professional judgment as to whether time spent was reasonably necessary to the
litigation.  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 [“We think
the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of the court are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”].)  “California courts do not
require detailed time records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees
based on declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and the
court’s own view of the number of hours reasonably spent.”  (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.) 
Here, the billing statement of the
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred on the motion and the declarations by
counsel demonstrate the reasonableness of the time spent on this case.  (See Decl. of Hovsepian ¶14, Exh. H.)  However, Defendant’s billing statement contains
block billing and vague time entries. 
Further, Defendant’s counsel seeks compensation for billing entries that
are unrelated to the anti-SLAPP motion.  Accordingly, the Court reduces the total attorneys’ fees and
costs sought on this motion to $18,762.50.
With regards to the instant motion for attorneys’ fees, Defendant’s
counsel requests attorneys’ fees for 3.5 hours, and an additional 4.5 hours in
anticipated fees for reviewing the opposition, preparing a reply, and appearing
at the hearing for the instant motion. 
(Decl. of Hovsepian ¶16.)  The
Court calculates the fees on the instant motion as follows (3.5 hours + 4.5
hours) x $475/hour = $3,800 in attorneys’ fees.
Accordingly, the Court calculates the total reduced
attorneys’ fees to be $22,562.50.
 
Costs
Defendant requests $120.00 in costs for
filing fees for filing the anti-SLAPP motion and the instant motion for
attorneys’ fees.  The Court awards
Defendant’s request for costs in the amount of $120.00
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in the reduced total amount of
$22,682.50.
