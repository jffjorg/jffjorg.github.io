And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and instead sets a hearing to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250 for failing to enter the default judgment. The reason for this decision is that the proposed judgment seeks an amount greater than the amount demanded in the complaint, which is prohibited by California law. The judge cites a previous case, Falahati v. Kondo, as authority for this ruling. The hearing is set for March 5, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
