```

And here is a brief summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant Sylvia Tidwell's motion for attorneys' fees and costs in the reduced total amount of $61,360.00. The motion was filed in response to the Defendant's successful Anti-SLAPP motion, which struck two of the three causes of action alleged against her by the Plaintiff, Art Colony Property, LLC. The Judge found that the Defendant was the prevailing party and was entitled to mandatory attorneys' fees and costs under California law. The Judge also found that the hourly rate of the Defendant's counsel, $800 per hour, was reasonable in his community of practice. However, the Judge reduced the total amount of attorneys' fees and costs sought by the Defendant, eliminating block billing and vague time entries, and calculating the fees on the instant motion as follows: 16.7 hours x $800/hour = $13,360.00 in attorneys' fees.
