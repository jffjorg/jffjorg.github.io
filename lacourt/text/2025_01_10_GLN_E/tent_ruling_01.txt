[TENTATIVE
RULING ON MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER OF OBJECTIONS] 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED 
Defendant, Daniel Khoshnudyan, moves the Court for an order permitting Defendant
to be relieved from waiver of objections to Plaintiff’s discovery responses. This
motion is made pursuant to Code Of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a)
and 2033.280(a), on the grounds that Defendant’s failure to serve timely
responses was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and
Defendant subsequently served compliant responses.

ANALYSIS
As
a preliminary matter, Defendant is not clear as to which sets of discovery he
is seeking relief from waiver of objections, Defendant simply states he is
seeking relief from waiver of objections to “Plaintiff’s discovery responses.”
 
On
9/3/2024, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses without
objections as to FROGs, SROGs, RFPs, and motion to deem the truth of the
matters admitted (RFAs).
 
Further,
Defendant filed two different motions on hearing for today, one to be granted
relief from waiver of objections to “discovery responses,” and one to withdraw
or amend deemed admissions. In both motions, Defendant cites the same standard
for relieving a party from waiver of objections. [Defendant cites 2030.290(a),
2031.300(a), and 2033.280(a).]
 
Statutes
on Granting Relief from Waiver of Objections
“If a party to whom a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve
a timely response to it, the following rules shall apply:
(a) The party to
whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed
waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).
The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280.
(2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.” (CCP §2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
The relief is also
available with respect to interrogatories and requests for admissions under
similar provisions in CCP sections 2030.290(a)(1)-(2) and 2033.280(a)(1)-(2).
As indicated from
2031.300(a), 2030.290(a), and 2033.280(a), Defendant must demonstrate he
subsequently served a response that was substantially compliant and that the
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
Here, as to the factor
of substantial compliance, the parties do not dispute whether Defendant served
responses that were substantially compliant.
The issue the parties fight
over here is whether Defendant’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
Bettencourt
v. Los Rios Community College Dist. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 276 examined whether there was excusable
neglect for an attorney’s failure to file a claim with the correct public
entity. The court in Bettencourt stated that when deciding whether
counsel’s error is excusable, the court looks to: (1) the nature of the mistake
or neglect, and (2) whether counsel was otherwise diligent in investigating and
pursuing the claim. (Id.) Further in Bettencourt, the court noted
that in examining the mistake or neglect, the court inquires whether “a
reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances” might have
made the same error.
Here, as to the first
factor in Bettencourt, the nature of the mistake or neglect appears
excusable. 
Discovery was served
on March 11, 2024, and Defendant’s responses were due on April 14, 2024. Defendant’s
counsel, Dondanville, explains that she was advised of representation on April
12, 2024. Defendant’s motion states that Dondanville first became aware of the
discovery on April 26, 2024. Dondanville explains that the discovery was
propounded on Defendant, not Defendant’s counsel, and Defendant was 19 years
old at the time and had never been involved in a lawsuit. Dondanville explains
that she did not become aware of the discovery until the April 14, 2024
deadline has already passed. Therefore, here, the nature of the mistake or neglect
appears excusable. 
As to the second
factor in Bettencourt, as to whether counsel was otherwise diligent in
investigating and pursuing the claim, Dondanville was not diligent, thus
Dondanville did not fully demonstrate excusable neglect.
Here, Dondanville’s
motion states, “Ms. Dondanville first became aware of the discovery on April
26, 2024, when she received Mr. Koppelman’s meet and confer letter regarding
the same. By that time, however, the deadline for Defendant to respond had
already passed. (Decl. JRD, at ¶19.) Mr. Koppelman also subsequently denied
defense counsel’s request for an extension to serve discovery responses with
objections.” (Def. Mot. p. 7.)
Dondanville was not
diligent in seeking relief from waiver of objections for several reasons.
First, as
Dondanville’s motion indicates, she was aware of waiver of objections on April
26, 2024 when opposing counsel informed her that the deadline had passed and
responses were due without objections.
Despite Ms.
Dondanville knowing that objections were waived on April 26, 2024, Dondanville
did not file these motions to be relieved from the waiver of objections until
11/14/2024. The Court does not find this diligent. 
Despite knowing that
her objections were waived on April 26, 2024, when Plaintiff filed the motion
to compel responses on May 23, 2024, Dondanville still hadn’t filed for relief
from waiver of objections despite knowing that objections were waived. 
Further, the discovery
motions were initially called for hearing on August 9, 2024, and on August 9,
2024, the discovery motions were continued. Ms. Dondanville was present at this
hearing. By this date, she still had not filed for relief from waiver of
objections despite the fact she was aware that Defendant waived objections.
On August 22, 2024,
the discovery motions were again called for hearing and continued. Ms.
Dondanville was present at this hearing. By this date, she still had not filed
her relief from wavier of objections despite knowing she had waived objections
on April 26, 2024.
On September 3, 2024,
the discovery motions were called for hearing and all of them were granted. Ms.
Dondanville was also present at this hearing, and not only had she not filed a
motion to be relieved from waiver of objections, but she also did not even submit
opposition to the motions. 
While Defendant
submits an additional motion with respect to why the RFAs should not be deemed
admitted, the Court does not find these arguments availing. 
Defendant cites St.
Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 766 for the proposition
that a deemed admitted motion should not have been granted where the responding
party had provided substantially compliant responses before the hearing on the
motion. 
The Court does not
find this argument availing, because as Opposition pointed out, Defendant did
not oppose the motions, and Defendant appeared at the hearing. Defendant not
only could have made this argument at the hearing, but Defendant could have
filed a motion for reconsideration after the September 3, 2024 hearing.
Instead, Defendant waited until 11/14/2024 to file these motions despite the
fact she knew the objections were waived on April 26, 2024.
Defendant’s counsel
argues in Reply that her delay should not be considered as to whether her
neglect was excusable or not. The premise behind Defendant’s argument appears
to be that the discovery statutes of 2031.300(a), 2030.290(a), and 2033.280(a)
don’t explicitly mention delay but instead simply refer to “mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
While the Defendant is
correct to note that those statutes don’t explicitly mention delay, the Court
notes that there is a long line of cases that examine what is considered
“excusable neglect.” While many of those cases may not necessarily deal with 2031.300(a),
2030.290(a), and 2033.280(a), the line of cases do grapple with what is
considered “excusable neglect.”
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
Opposition largely proceeds from the false premise that relief from waiver of
discovery objections is governed by Section 473. 
Defendant states his “sole
remedy for relief from waiver in the context of discovery is contained within
the provisions of the Act and [they] cannot rely upon the provisions of section
473.” (Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 263,
274-75.)
The Court does not
find this availing because Scottsdale Ins. Co. also stated, “However,
the Legislature did intend that general principles developed in application of
section 473 would be utilized in connection with the discretion to be exercised
pursuant to the Act.” (Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 263, 275.)
Further, the Court
notes how Defendant’s own moving papers stated, “In deciding whether an error
is excusable, courts look at both the nature of the mistake or neglect, and
whether the party was otherwise diligent in investigating and pursuing the
claim. (Tackett v. City of Huntington Beach (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 60,
65.)”
Not only did Defendant’s
own moving papers cite the line of cases stating that diligence was an element
of excusable neglect, but Defendant’s Reply presumably changed its tone and
argued that diligence was not relevant because Plaintiff Opposition highlighted
how egregious Defendant’s delay was in filing for relief from waiver of
objections in light of the fact of how early Ms. Dondanville was aware of the
waiver of objections. 
TENTATIVE
RULING
Defendant’s motion for relief from waiver of
objections as to all discovery methods, including relief from waiver of deemed
admissions, is DENIED.
