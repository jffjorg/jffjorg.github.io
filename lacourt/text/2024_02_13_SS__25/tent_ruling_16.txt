BACKGROUND
A. Factual

Plaintiffs’
Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs Riestra and Cruz were the driver and
passenger, respectively, of a vehicle traveling northbound on Van Nuys Blvd on
August 14, 2021. Defendant Joaquin was traveling in the exact directions as the
Plaintiffs. When Plaintiff Riestra slowed down to stop for a red light,
Plaintiffs allege that they were rear-ended by Defendants’ vehicle. Plaintiffs
contend that Defendants were inattentive to the road conditions and negligently
driving at an unsafe speed due to traffic conditions. Defendant’s driving at an
unsafe speed violated California Vehicle Code Section 22350. As a result of
Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiffs allege they have injuries, all of which have
caused and continue to cause Plaintiffs physical pain and suffering. Plaintiffs
further allege that Plaintiff’s injuries and property damage are the direct and
proximate result of the Defendant’s negligence, recklessness, carelessness, and
unlawful act.
 
 
B. Procedural
On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed two causes of action against
Defendant for the following: 1) Motor Vehicle, and 2) General Negligence. 
On January 17, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint. No opposition has been filed. 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Defendants pray
for the Court to sustain their demurrer and dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint
because Plaintiffs are time-barred under the statute of limitations. Defendants
argue that under CCP § 335.1, Plaintiffs had two years from the date the
accident occurred on August 14, 2021, to file an action against the Defendants.
Defendants note that the action was filed on August 15, 2023, more than two
years after the alleged accident, and thus would be time-barred under CCP
335.1. Therefore, since the action is time-barred, Defendants argue that their
demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be sustained without leave to amend. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
No opposition was filed.  
REPLY

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
 “The primary function of a pleading is to give the other
party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that otherwise
properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa
Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is
on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully.
(Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 128.)
However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state
a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Plaintiffs
state the following causes of action in its complaint against Defendants: 1)
General Negligence, and 2) Motor Vehicle. 
 
            A. Meet and Confer Requirement 
 
The
demurring party must meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading to resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.
(CCP § 430.41(a).) 
 
Here,
Defendants provide the Court with a declaration from their counsel, who states
that on December 20, 2023, she wrote to Plaintiff’s counsel asking why the Complaint
was not barred under the statute of limitations. (Carla M. Barcelos-Pettit
Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. B.) Still, as of drafting the instant demurrer, she did not
receive a response from Plaintiffs’ counsel. (Id.)
Thus, the Court finds that Defendants have satisfied the meet and confer
requirement under CCP § 430.41(a).
 
The
Court now moves to the merits of the demurrer. 
 
B.
First and Second Cause of Action – General Negligence and Motor Vehicle. 
 
First, the Court notes that the causes
of action for general negligence and motor vehicle negligence are essentially
the same since both involve duty, breach, and proximate causation. Thus, the
Court will analyze the complaint under one claim for negligence.
 
To state a claim for negligence,
Plaintiff must allege the elements of (1) “the existence of a legal duty of
care,” (2) “breach of that duty,” and (3) “proximate cause resulting in an
injury.” (McIntyre v. Colonies-Pacific,
LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.)
 
Plaintiffs’
Complaint alleges that on August 14, 2021, Plaintiffs Riestra and Cruz were the
driver and passenger, respectively, of a vehicle traveling northbound in Van
Nuys Blvd. (Compl. p. 4.) Defendant Joaquin was traveling in the same direction
as the Plaintiffs. (Id.) When
Plaintiffs slowed down to stop for a red light, Plaintiffs allege that they
were rear-ended by Defendants’ vehicle. (Id.)
Plaintiffs contend that Defendants were inattentive to the road conditions and
negligently driving at an unsafe speed due to traffic conditions. (Id.) Defendants’ driving at an unsafe speed
violated California Vehicle Code Section 22350. (Id.)
As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiffs allege they have injuries,
all of which have caused and continue to cause Plaintiff physical pain and
suffering. (Id.) Plaintiffs further
allege that Plaintiff’s injuries and property damage are the direct and
proximate result of Defendant’s negligent, reckless, careless, and unlawful
act. (Id.)  
 
Defendants argue
that under CCP § 335.1, Plaintiffs had two years from the date the accident
occurred on August 14, 2021, to file an action against the Defendants.
Defendants note that the action was filed on August 15, 2023, more than two
years after the alleged accident, and thus would be time-barred under CCP
335.1.
 
Here, the Complaint arises from an alleged accident that
occurred on August 14, 2021, and alleges two causes of action for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence causing personal injury to Plaintiff and
their property. (Compl., p. 4, 5.) Thus, the applicable statute of limitations
is two years under CCP 335.1. Plaintiffs action falls outside the statute of
limitations because it was filed on August 15, 2023, just one day over the
statute of limitations.
 
The Court notes that Plaintiffs have not filed a defense to the
demurrer that provides a basis for why the Complaint is not barred under the
statute of limitation or provides an exception for why CCP § 335.1 would not
apply in this case. Additionally, the Court does not find a reasonable
possibility of a successful amendment that would bring a successful amendment
of the Complaint.
 
Thus, because
Plaintiffs’ action to recover damages for personal injury has a two-year
statute of limitations, and because this Complaint was filed over two years
after the accident, the Court finds that the statute of limitations bars
Plaintiffs’ causes of action. Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS Defendants’
Demurrer without leave to amend.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Defendants Cirino
Melero and Joaquin Melero’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Moving parties are ordered to give
notice.
