BACKGROUND
On July 31, 2023, Petitioner Pomona Islander, L.P. dba Pomona
Islander Mobile Home Park (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition for Permanent
Injunction Pursuant to Civil Code section 798.88 (the “Petition”) against
Respondent Miguel A. Murillo (“Respondent”). 
Petitioner entered proof of service on Respondent on September 25,
2023, via personal service. 
On October 02, 2023, the Court granted Petitioner’s petition and
issued a permanent injunction pursuant to Civil Code § 798.88. 
On October 05, 2023, Petitioner filed Notice of Ruling indicating
that Respondent has been served with a copy of the Court’s Order. 
On December 08, 2023, Petitioner filed the instant Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs. 
No opposition has been filed. 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
             Petitioner prays for the Court to enter an
award of attorney’s fees of $10,425.00 and recoverable court costs of $550.28,
for a total amount of $10,975.28. Petitioner argues that under Civil Code §§
798.85, 1717(a) and (b), since it prevailed on its petition for a permanent
injunction under Civil Code § 798.88, it is the prevailing party under the
matter and thus entitled to recover its attorney’s fees and costs incurred in
the action.
 
OPPOSITION

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
 A prevailing
party in an action is entitled to recover costs, including attorney’s fees, as
a matter of right.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1032(a)(4), 1032(b),
1033.5.)  Attorney’s fees are allowable as costs
when authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a)(10).) 
 
Civil Code § 798.85 provides: 
 
“In any
action arising out of the provisions of this chapter the prevailing party shall
be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs.  A party shall be
deemed a prevailing party for the purposes of this section if the judgment is
rendered in his or her favor or where the litigation is dismissed in his or her
favor prior to or during the trial, unless the parties otherwise agree in the
settlement or compromise.” 
 
“A notice of
motion to claim attorney's fees for services up to and including the rendition
of judgment in the trial court . . . must be served and filed within the time
for filing a notice of appeal under . . . rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited
civil case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1702(b)(1).)  In a limited civil
case, a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of 30 days
after service of a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or 90 days
after the entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.822(a)(1).) 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
The Court notes that the Motion
is not timely filed. 
 
CRC rule 3.1702(b)(1) states in
relevant part that “A notice of motion to claim attorney’s fees for services up
to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court . . . must be
served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under . . .
rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited civil case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1702(b)(1).) In a limited civil case, a notice of appeal must be filed on or
before the earliest of 30 days after service of a document entitled “Notice of
Entry” of judgment or 90 days after the entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 8.822(a)(1).)  
 
Here, Petitioner served Notice of
Ruling on Petition on Respondent on October 05, 2023. The Notice of Ruling on
Petition functions as a “Notice of Entry” because it provides the non-moving
party with notice that a decision has been made. Thus, under CRC rule
3.1702(b)(1), Petitioner must have filed notice of its Motion for Attorney’s
fees within 30 days of October 05, 2023. The Court notes that Petitioner filed
the instant Motion on December 08, 2023, more than 30 days from when it served
its Notice of Ruling on Petition on Respondent. Therefore, the Court considers
the motion untimely under CRC rule 3.1702(b)(1).

 
Accordingly,
the Court DENIES Petitioner’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Petitioner Pomona
Islander, L.P.’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is DENIED.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
