Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to quash service of summons and request for dismissal filed by Defendant Averiel C. Blair. The motion was filed late, and the Court notes that the Defendant has not been served with the summons and complaint. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's service of summons and complaint is defective and that the Defendant's motion should be granted. The Court orders the Defendant to provide service via certified mail and to have the motion properly filed with the correct mailing address. The parties are ordered to file timely opposition and reply briefs. The hearing on the motion is continued to a later date.
