And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendant's demurrer and dismissing the complaint. The complaint alleges that the defendant was negligent and caused an accident, resulting in injuries to the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that the complaint is time-barred under the statute of limitations, which states that a lawsuit must be filed within two years of the accident. The court found that the complaint was filed more than two years after the accident and therefore is time-barred. The court also noted that the plaintiffs did not file a defense to the demurrer that provides a basis for why the complaint is not barred under the statute of limitations or provides an exception for why CCP ยง 335.1 would not apply in this case. The court did not find a reasonable possibility of a successful amendment that would bring a successful amendment of the complaint.
