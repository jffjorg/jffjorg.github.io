BACKGROUND
On May 17, 2023, Armen Barseghyan (“Plaintiff”) filed a cause of
action against Anahid Vartanyan (“Defendant”) for motor vehicle negligence
seeking compensatory damages according to proof. 
On June 21, 2023, Defendant filed his Answer to the Complaint. 
On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Reclassify Case as an Unlimited Jurisdiction Action. Defendant files in
opposition. Plaintiff does not file in reply. 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff prays
for an order from the Court reclassifying Case No. 23STLC03273 from a limited
civil jurisdiction to unlimited civil jurisdiction under CCP § 403.040(b).
Plaintiff argues that the instant case was improperly classified because
Plaintiff’s counsel mistakenly filed the action as a limited case when the
severity and extent of Plaintiff’s injuries are such that it should be
classified as an unlimited civil case.
OPPOSITION
 
            In
opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s Motion to Reclassify should be
denied because the Complaint does not seek relief of more than $35,000.00.
Defendant contends that reclassification is not mandatory as the case is
correctly classified as a limited civil case. Defendant additionally argues
that Plaintiff does not demonstrate good cause for his motion to reclassify as
Plaintiff’s resumption of medical treatment would not likely yield a verdict
over 35,000.00.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
Code of Civil
Procedure § 403.040 allows a plaintiff to file a motion for reclassification of
an action within the time allowed for that party to amend the initial
pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿403.040(a).)  “A party may amend its
pleading once without leave of court at any time before an answer, demurrer, or
motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed if
the amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer to motion to strike.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
472(a).)  If the motion is made after the time for the plaintiff to amend
the pleading, the motion may only be granted if (1) the case is incorrectly
classified; and (2)¿the plaintiff shows good cause for not seeking reclassification
earlier.  (Code¿Civ.¿Proc.¿§¿403.040(b).) 
 
In Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257,
262, the California Supreme Court held that a matter may be reclassified from
unlimited to limited only if it appears to a legal certainty that the
plaintiff’s damages will necessarily be less than $25,000.  (Walker v.
Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257.)  If there is a possibility that
the damages will exceed $25,000.00, the case cannot be transferred to limited
civil.  (Id.)  This high standard is appropriate considering
“the circumscribed procedures and recovery available in the limited civil
courts.”  (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005) 129¿Cal.App.4th 266,
278.) 
 
In Ytuarte, the Court of Appeal examined the
principles it set forth in Walker and held that “the court should reject
the plaintiff’s effort to reclassify the action as unlimited only when
the lack of jurisdiction as an ‘unlimited’ case is certain and clear.”  (Ytuarte,
supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at 279 (emphasis added).)  Nevertheless, the
plaintiff must present evidence to demonstrate a possibility that the damages
will exceed $25,000.00 and the trial court must review the record to determine
“whether a judgment in excess of $25,000.00 is obtainable.”  (Id.) 
Effective January 01, 2024, the jurisdictional limit in a limited
civil jurisdiction case now stands at $35,000.00 per Code of Civil Procedure §
85(a). (Code Civ. Proc. § 85(a).)
II.        Discussion 
 
            The instant case arose from a
motor vehicle accident involving the parties on September 26, 2022, at North
Hollywood Way and West Victory Blvd, Burbank, CA 91505. (Compl. p. 4.) The case
was filed as a limited civil case based on damages stemming from Plaintiff’s
medical expenses. Plaintiff’s counsel states that at the time of filing,
Plaintiff had only received chiropractic treatment, orthopedic treatment, and
diagnostic imaging of his lumbar spine, amounting to medical bills totaling
$8,460.00. (Meghry S. Chopurian Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. A.) Counsel further declares
that Plaintiff received an epidural injection to his lumbar spine on October
04, 2023, and his medical bills are now more than $19,050.00. (Id. ¶ 5; Exh. B.) Counsel believes the
Motion is necessary because she believes a jury will render a verdict exceeding
$25,000 even before factoring in general damages. (Id. ¶
8.)
 
            Plaintiff argues that due to his
unforeseen flare-ups and the need for further medical attention, which were not
previously accounted for, the amount in controversy in this case has
substantially increased. Plaintiff notes that when considering Plaintiff’s
general damages, it is highly likely that the trial will result in a verdict
higher than $25,000.00.
 
            In opposition, Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s Motion to Reclassify should be denied because the
Complaint does not seek relief of more than $35,000.00. Defendant contends that
reclassification is not mandatory as the case is correctly classified as a limited
civil case. Defendant additionally argues that Plaintiff does not demonstrate
good cause for his motion to reclassify as Plaintiff’s resumption of medical
treatment would not likely yield a verdict over 35,000.00. Defendant concedes
that while the Walker test
continues to govern the substantive and procedural law governing
reclassification, recent changes to the jurisdictional amount under CCP § 85(a)
support the denial of Plaintiff’s Motion.
 
            The Court finds
that Plaintiff has met his burden of showing good cause for not seeking
reclassification earlier. Furthermore, Plaintiff has produced evidence
demonstrating that there is a possibility that his medical costs will exceed
$25,000.00 and the new jurisdictional amount of $35,000.00. Here, Plaintiff
provides evidence that his special damages incurred through medical treatment has
reached $19,050.00. Given the amount of medical expenses and
the extent of treatment for Plaintiff’s injury, it is possible that the
trier of fact will award pain and suffering damages that will result in
Plaintiff’s total amount of damages exceeding the jurisdictional limit of this
Court.  
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
Motion to Reclassify the instant action to unlimited jurisdiction.
 
             
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff Armen
Barseghyan’s Motion to Reclassify Case to an Unlimited Civil Jurisdiction is GRANTED.
Plaintiff is ordered to pay the reclassification fee within twenty (20) days
service of this order.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
