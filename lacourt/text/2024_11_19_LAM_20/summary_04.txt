Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for summary adjudication filed by Belmont One Investment Holdings, LLC and Belmont Two Investment Holdings, LLC. The Cross-Complainants, 321 Properties, Inc. and Sung Won Yi, had filed a Cross-Complaint alleging breach of implied contract, quantum meruit, and declaratory relief, claiming they were not compensated for their services as managers of the Cross-Defendants. The Cross-Defendants argued that they had paid 321 Properties, Inc. a monthly fee of $4,000.00 for their services, which rendered any claims for compensation by Sung Won Yi moot. The Cross-Complainants countered that the payment to 321 Properties, Inc. was irrelevant to their claims and that the Cross-Defendants had waived any argument that Sung Won Yi should not be compensated for his services by allowing him to act as manager for years without complaint. The judge found that there are triable issues as to whether full compensation was provided for Sung Won Yi's services and therefore denied the motion for summary adjudication.
