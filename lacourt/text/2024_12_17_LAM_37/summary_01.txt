Significant Statements:
  - "The court fails to see why this demurrer with a motion to strike the Second Amended Cross-Complaint should go forward when a motion for leave to file a Third Amended Cross-Complaint is pending."
  - "The purpose of the meet and confer process is to try to resolve issues and avoid unnecessary motion practice."
  - "If upon review of a declaration under 430.41(a)(3), a court learns no meet and confer has taken place, or concludes further conferences between counsel would likely be productive, it retains the discretion to order counsel to meaningfully discuss the pleadings with an eye toward reducing the number of issues or eliminating the need for a demurrer, and to continue the hearing date to facilitate that effort."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has decided to continue the demurrer with motion to strike the Second Amended Cross-Complaint until after the hearing on the motion for leave to file a Third Amended Cross-Complaint. The court believes that the parties should have met and conferred to see if they could stipulate to the filing of a Third Amended Cross-Complaint, but since no resolution was reached, the cross-complainants should have promptly sought leave to file a new amended cross-complaint. The court encourages the parties to continue meeting and conferring in good faith with the aim of reducing the number of motions brought before the court.
