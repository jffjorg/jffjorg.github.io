And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Windsor Troy's motion to be relieved as counsel for Carlos Adrian Cancela Cabrera, effective upon the filing of a proof of service showing service of the signed order upon the Client at the Client's last known address. The court has determined that the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 have been sufficiently met, including the notice of motion and motion, declaration, service of the notice and motion, and proposed order. The breakdown of the attorney-client relationship between Mr. Cabrera and Windsor Troy has led to irreconcilable differences, making it impossible for representation to continue. The court notes that the attorney has failed to confirm the Client's current address, but has served the motion papers on the Client's last known address.
