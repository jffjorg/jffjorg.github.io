And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is sustained, with leave given to amend. The plaintiff alleges that she was injured in a motor vehicle accident on January 20, 2022, and filed her complaint on January 24, 2024. The defendants argue that the complaint is time-barred by the statute of limitations, as it was filed more than two years after the date of the accident. The plaintiff concedes that her complaint was filed in excess of two years after the date of the incident, but argues that the statute of limitations was tolled because the defendants live out of state. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to invoke tolling, and that the complaint is therefore barred by the statute of limitations. The court has given the plaintiff leave to amend her complaint to plead around the defense.
