Here is the YAML summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

```
Case Number: 18STCV05076
Plaintiff's Name: Sina Mardani and Azadeh Mardani
Defendant's Name: County of Los Angeles
People-Names: Sina Mardani, Azadeh Mardani, Adler, Manor Healthcare Corp.
Company-Names: Manor Healthcare Corp.
Places: Los Angeles
Dates: March 21, 2024
Events: Motion for Summary Adjudication, Inverse Condemnation Claim
Money: None mentioned
Intentions: The Plaintiffs seek summary adjudication on their first cause of action for inverse condemnation against the County of Los Angeles, limited to the issue of County's liability.
Facts: The Plaintiffs argue that they own the property, the public sewer maintained by the County caused destructive sewage, and their property was damaged by sewage flowing from the manhole. The County argues that the motion is improper, that the Plaintiffs failed to establish their case by reference to expert testimony, and that the sag in the sewer line did not meaningfully contribute to the occurrence of the sewer overflows.
Disputes: The disputes revolve around the County's liability for the damages, the amount of damage that could have been averted by the installation of a backwater valve, and the County's maintenance of the sewer line.
Acts: The Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary adjudication, and the County filed an opposition to the motion.
Agreements: None mentioned
Laws: Code of Civil Procedure § 437c, Code of Civil Procedure § 1260.040, Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, City of Oroville v. Superior Court (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1091, Paramount Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 226, Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840
Statutes: Code of Civil Procedure § 437c, Code of Civil Procedure § 1260.040
Roles: Judge, Plaintiff, Defendant
Significant Statements: The Judge denied the Plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication, finding that the motion was procedurally defective and that the relief sought could not be granted. The Judge held that the Plaintiffs' motion was improper because it sought summary adjudication of less than the entire cause of action for inverse condemnation. The Judge also held that the Plaintiffs failed to meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 437c, as the motion did not dispose of the entire cause of action.
