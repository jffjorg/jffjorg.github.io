And here is the summary in English text:

The judge, Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Eden Dabalus v. Jose Ian Mangisay, et al. (Case Number: 22TRCV00168). The case involves a dispute over a default judgment entered against Ferdinand Canlas, a defendant, on October 12, 2023.

The defendant, Ferdinand Canlas, moves to set aside the default judgment on grounds of excusable neglect, fraud, and/or mistake. The judge finds that the defendant has demonstrated a meritorious defense and a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. The judge also finds that the defendant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking to set aside the default once discovered.

As the default was entered more than six months prior to the filing of this motion, the motion can only be granted pursuant to the equitable power of the court. The judge grants the motion and reinstates the defendant's Answer filed on October 14, 2022. The judge also orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling.

The judge notes that it is unclear how any writs of execution or levy mentioned in the motion and reply were obtained, as no judgment has been entered. The judge will have questions for the plaintiff at the time of the hearing regarding these writs.
