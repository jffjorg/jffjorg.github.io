And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for trial preference filed by the plaintiffs, without prejudice, due to the lack of sufficient evidence. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Christopher Louis Samarin, Inge Yvonne Samarin, and Monique Natasha Samarin, against the defendant, George Oliver Carter, seeking trial preference based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 36(d)-(f). The section allows the court to grant a motion for preference if a party has an illness or condition that raises substantial medical doubt of survival beyond six months. The judge found that the plaintiffs did not provide clear and convincing evidence of Mr. Samarin's medical condition, specifically the prognosis and side effects of his chemotherapy, and therefore denied the motion. The judge will entertain a continuance if the plaintiffs wish to provide supplemental information regarding Mr. Samarin's medical condition.
