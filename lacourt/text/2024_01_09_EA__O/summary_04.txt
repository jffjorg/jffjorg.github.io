And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for trial preference in a lawsuit involving Christopher Samarin, his wife Inge, and their daughter Monique. Christopher is over 70 years old and is seeking trial preference due to his age and health. The judge notes that Fox, the defendant, has been participating in the lawsuit through discovery responses. The judge is considering the trial preference motion under Code of Civil Procedure §36(a), which requires the court to give preference to parties over 70 who have a substantial interest in the action and whose health makes it necessary to prevent prejudicing their interest in the litigation. The judge is using the case of Fox v. State of California (1996) as guidance, which held that a trial court erred in denying trial preference when the plaintiff made an uncontroverted showing of sickness. The judge is reviewing the facts of the case, including Christopher's driving and the presence of his wife and daughter as passengers, and will make a determination based on their discretion.
