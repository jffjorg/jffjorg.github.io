CROSS-COMPLAINT is SUSTAINED with leave to amend, but on different

quiet title action regarding properties located at 16485 Monte Cristo Drive,
Hacienda Heights, CA 91745 (the “Monte Cristo Property”), 1621 Derringer Lane,
Diamond Bar, CA (the “Derringer Lane Property”), and 14211 Skyline Drive,
Hacienda Heights, CA (the “Skyline Drive Property”).

SUN, an individual (“Sun” or “Defendant”); ALL PERSONS UNKNOWN, Claiming Any
Legal or Equitable Right, Title, Estate, Lien, or Interest in the Property

On August 24,
2022, Defendant filed a Demurrer, which on October 4, 2022 the court sustained
with leave to amend. 
 
On December

3. Fraud 4. Declaratory Relief 5. Injunctive Relief 6. Unjust Enrichment/

On January
12, 2023 Defendant filed its demurrer to the FAC, which on 2/28/23 the court
sustained with leave to amend as to the fraud and quiet title causes of action,
and overruled as to the others. 
 
On March 10,
2023, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (SAC). 
 
On June 14,
2023, the parties filed a stipulation for leave for Plaintiff to file a
proposed third amended complaint (TAC). That same day, Plaintiff filed a TAC,
alleging the following COAs:
 
1.     Breach of Fiduciary Duty
2.     Quiet Title 
3.     Fraud and Concealment [the third COA
is categorized into two counts].

the court (on 9/20/23) sustained in its entirety without leave to amend, meaning
that the 2nd and 3rd COAs were stricken. According to the
minute order, Defendant was given until October 20, 2023 to file a responsive

On December 26, 2023, Defendant filed his opposition to
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s cross-complaint.
 
Discussion
 
At the outset, the court notes that Defendant had until
October 20, 2023 to file its responsive pleading, but he did not do so until
October 24, 2023, rendering his answer untimely. However, as Plaintiff does not
raise this point in a motion to strike or in the demurrer, the court will not
strike the answer. 
Plaintiff demurs to all 3 COAs in the cross-complaint on the
grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action for quiet title, the pleading is uncertain,[2]
and the quiet title COA is barred by the statute of limitations. 
 
The court cannot squarely each of Plaintiff’s arguments
because the court finds the cross-complaint contradictory, which amounts to
uncertainty (though for a different reason asserted by Plaintiff). 
 
The basis of the cross-complaint is that as part of the
April 17, 2007 judgment confirming an arbitration award in cases BC330493
and BC335624 (Cross-Complaint ¶5),
“Sun and Lin agreed that Lin was going to satisfy the judgment by having her
give her 50% interest that she had in 16485 Monte Cristo 12368 Valley to Sun.”
(¶9.) Consequently, on September
5, 2007, “Lin executed a transfer deed transferring her 50% interest in
16485 Monte Cristo to Sun.” (¶10,
emphasis added.) However, in a contradictory fashion, the cross-complaint then
alleges that “Lin never transferred the 50% ownership interest in 1648
Monte Cristo to Sun.” (¶14,
emphasis added.) Accordingly,
it is uncertain whether Plaintiff transferred Plaintiff’s 50% interest to
Defendant. 
 
As it is well-established, a demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint meaning that the defects must appear on the face of
the complaint or judicially noticeable material; no other extrinsic evidence
can be considered. Thus, even if the parties have a better understanding of the
facts, such facts must be found in the complaint/cross-complaint.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave
to amend.
