[1] As more elaborated
in the motion, Christopher Samarin and Inge Samarin are married. Monique
Samarin is their daughter. Mr. Samarin was driving, and his wife and daughter
were passengers. 
 


[2] Based on the instant
motion, Defendant has been participating in the lawsuit as evidenced by its
11/16/23 discovery responses. (Motion p. 3.) 
 


[3] To the extent that
trial preference is mandatory, that pertains to litigants over the age of 70.
(See Code of Civil Procedure¿§¿36
(a) [A party to a civil action who is
over the age of 70 must be given preference if the party has a substantial
interest in the¿action¿as a whole, and¿the health of the party is such that a
preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party’s interest in the
litigation.].) Therefore, the court’s determination rests on its discretion. 
 


[4] At the outset, Fox
involved subdivision (a), not subdivision (d), the latter of which is “more specific and more rigorous” and the former of
which is “is more open-ended. (Id. at p. 534.) That aside, in Fox,
the plaintiff made an “uncontroverted
showing” about her sickness. (Id. at p. 535.) For example, the doctor(s) explained that the plaintiff suffered from
stage IV lung cancer that metastasized to plaintiff’s femur,
clavicle, and spine. Regarding her treatment, the plaintiff received
chemotherapy treatments every three weeks, but the side effects created
severe body aches and pain such as severe abdominal and bowel complications,
nausea and vomiting, dehydration, drowsiness, extreme weakness and fatigue. Thus,
the appellate court determined the trial court erred in denying trial
preference because the there was no “genuine dispute that [plaintiff was] very
sick . . . all told, the evidence shows that while [plaintiff] is currently
able to participate in a trial, she has good reason for concern that will not
be the case for much longer as her health deteriorates.” (Ibid.)
