cross-complaint the plaintiff is also deemed a cross-defendant, for clarity
purposes, the court will continue to refer to Wendy as Plaintiff. 


[2] Plaintiff avers that
the pleading is uncertain because it conflates between the Monte Cristo
property the 12368 Valley property. (¶ 9 [“Sun and Lin agreed that Lin was
going to satisfy the judgment by having her give her 50% interest that she had
in 16485 Monte Cristo 12368 Valley to Sun.”].) Paragraph 9 was clearly a
typographical error as the cross-complaint generally focused on the Monte
Cristo property. This type of error is insufficient to render the
cross-complaint uncertain.
