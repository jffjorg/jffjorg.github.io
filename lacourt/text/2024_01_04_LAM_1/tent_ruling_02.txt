Itkin filed 22STCV20177 against Defendants Jon Greenfield, Robert Greenfield, 21326

On December 21, 2022, Judge

Motion

 
On December 6, 2023, Garry Itkin
filed the instant motion seeking to relate 23VECV03841 and 23STCV20344 with the
two previously related cases, 22STCV16061 and 22STCV20177. 
 
The motion is unopposed. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1005.) 
 
Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The Court Declines to Relate the Cases
at Issue
 
On November 20, 2023 and November
29, 2023, Itkin filed a Notice of Related Case in 22STCV16061. On November 30,
2023, Judge Gregory Keosian issued an order finding “22STCV16061 and
23VECV03841, are not related within the meaning of California Rules of Court,
rule 3.300(a).” Thus, Itkin’s motion to relate is properly brought before
Department 1. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule
3.3(f)(3).) 
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).)
 
Itkin
seeks to relate 23VECV03841 and 23STCV20344 with the previously related
22STCV16061 and 22STCV20177. Itkin contends the cases are related based upon second,
third, and fourth grounds enumerated in Rule 3.300(a). 
 
As
Itkin acknowledges, (Mot. at 5:17-22), the cases do not involve the same
parties. The cases also do not involve the same or substantially similar claims:
22STCV16061 involves claims of partition and accounting, 22STCV20177 involves
claims of breach of a sales contract and specific performance, 23STCV20344
involves claims for breach of a lease and guaranty, and 23VECV03841 involves a
claim for unlawful detainer. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).) 
 
Cases
23VECV03841 and 23STCV20344 do not arise from the same arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact
as each other or as the other two previously related cases. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(a)(2).) Both 23VECV03841 and 23STCV20344 arise from the expiration of a
sublease whereas 22STCV16061 arises from the desire to partition jointly owned
real property and 22STCV20177 arises from an alleged breach of a purchase
agreement. Additionally, 23VECV03841 and 23STCV20344 will not require the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact
such that they should be related. The complaint and cross-complaint in 23STCV20344
will require determinations regarding the lease, guaranty, and sublease, the
parties’ relative liability, if any, and potential damages for alleged breaches
during the lease and the subsequent holdover. The unlawful detainer case
involves limited issues regarding the sublessees’ present occupation of the
premises. (Hong Sang Market, Inc. v. Peng (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 474, 490
(“An unlawful detainer action is a summary proceeding designed to adjudicate
the right of immediate possession; the only claims that are cognizable in such
a proceeding are those bearing directly on the immediate right of possession.”).)
While there may be some overlap, it is not sufficient to warrant relating 23VECV03841
and 23STCV20344, either to each other or to the previously related cases. 
 
Furthermore,
while the cases each involve the same property, they do not all involve claims
against, title to, possession of, or damages to that property. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a)(3).) The previously related cases, 22STCV16061 and 22STCV20177,
involve claims of ownership and competing claims regarding the right to buy and
sell the property. The claims in 23STCV20344 are entirely contractual and seek compensatory
damages. Possession or title are not at issue in 23STCV20344. Only immediate possession
is at issue in 23VECV03841 and claims to title generally cannot be litigated in
an unlawful detainer proceeding. Given the summary nature of the unlawful
detainer action in 23VECV03841, there is good cause not to relate this case
with the previously related cases. 
 
The
cases are also not likely to require a substantial duplication of judicial
resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).) In the
motion, Itkin contends if 23STCV20344 and 23VECV03841 “are tried separately,
this could result in double damages to the plaintiff or inconsistent rulings.”
(Mot. at 6:7-10.) However, trial in 23VECV03841 is set for January 8, 2024 and
will be completed before any questions of law or fact are determined in 23STCV20344.
Because the unlawful detainer case will be resolved, there is no risk of inconsistent
rulings or double damages. (See also Hong Sang, supra, 20 Cal.App.5th at
497 (“the lessor is not only precluded from recovering twice for the same items
of damages but also may not renew a claim for back-due rent associated with a
particular time period if that periodic claim was denied on the merits in the
unlawful detainer action.”).) The expedited nature of the unlawful detainer
action substantially limits the potential duplication of judicial resources. 
 
The
Court finds the cases are not related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(a). Separately, there is good cause not to relate unlawful
detainer action 23VECV03841 with 23STCV20344 or previously related 22STCV16061
and 22STCV20177. The limited similarities and issues in the cases do not
warrant the further delay in resolution of the unlawful detainer action that
would result from relating the cases. The motion is DENIED.
