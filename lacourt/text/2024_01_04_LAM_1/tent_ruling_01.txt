M HEINL vs ODET BEVERLY HILLS JEWELERS, et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion for Change of Venue Code of Civil
Procedure section 397
TENTATIVE RULING:  Plaintiff’s Motion for Change of Venue Code of
Civil Procedure section 397 is taken OFF-CALENDAR.  Clerk to give notice to all parties.
Plaintiff Heinl’s motion consists
of a two-page handwritten pleading, a restatement of the 2nd Amended Complaint,
a civil case cover sheet and addendum, and a summons.
The motion is not accompanied by a
proof of service and the time to file a proof of service has expired. (Cal. R.
Ct., rule 3.1300(c) (“Proof of service of the moving papers must be filed no
later than five court days before the time appointed for the hearing.”).)
“[P]ro per litigants are not entitled to special exemptions from the California
Rules of Court.” (Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284.)
Additionally, there is no evidence
that the remaining defendant was served with notice of the January 4, 2024
hearing date. Plaintiff has not filed a new notice of motion and it is unclear
whether the defendant is aware of the new hearing date and location. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1010 (“the notice of a motion . . . must state when . . . it will be
made.”).) Proper service and notice are required to satisfy due process. (See
generally, McMillin v. Eare (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 893, 913 (describing the
“right to notice, which is an element of due process.”).) Plaintiff’s motion is
unopposed. Absent evidence of proper notice and service, the Court lacks
jurisdiction to act. (See e.g. Lee v. Placer Title Co. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th
503, 509; Code Civ. Proc. § 1005.)
Plaintiff’s motion is therefore
taken OFF-CALENDAR for lack of proper service and notice.
