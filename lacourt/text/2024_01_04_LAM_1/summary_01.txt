And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has taken the plaintiff's motion for a change of venue off the calendar due to lack of proper service and notice. The plaintiff's motion was not accompanied by proof of service, and the time to file the proof of service has expired. Additionally, there is no evidence that the remaining defendant was served with notice of the January 4, 2024 hearing date. The judge notes that pro per litigants (those representing themselves) are not exempt from the California Rules of Court, and that proper service and notice are required to satisfy due process. Without evidence of proper notice and service, the court lacks jurisdiction to act. The motion is therefore taken off the calendar.
