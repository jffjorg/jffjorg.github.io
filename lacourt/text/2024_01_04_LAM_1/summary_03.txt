And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to transfer the case from the North Central District to the East District. The defendant argued that the case has no connection to the North Central District or Glendale, where the case was filed. The judge found that the case was filed in an incorrect location and that the Pomona Courthouse South is a proper filing location. The judge based its decision on the evidence presented, including the complaint, the Retail Installment Sale Contract, and the parties' stipulation to transfer venue. The judge noted that the parties' stipulation stated that the parties had met and conferred regarding the most appropriate and convenient venue for the action and had agreed to transfer the venue from Glendale Courthouse to Pomona Courthouse.
