And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint to add a cause of action for negligence against Bank of Hope. The judge has determined that the delay in seeking to add Bank of Hope as a defendant is unexplained and prejudices the defendant. The judge has also concluded that the statute of limitations for the plaintiffs to assert a negligence claim against Bank of Hope has run. The judge has stated that the relation back doctrine does not apply in this case, as it only relates to new causes of action against newly named defendants, not to revive previously time-barred claims.
