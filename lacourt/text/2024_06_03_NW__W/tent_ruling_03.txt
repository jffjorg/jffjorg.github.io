Marco Lopez is GRANTED.

DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Kevin Gallo moves this court for an order deeming the truth
of all matters specified in Request for Admissions, Set One, Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One served on
Plaintiff Marco Lopez. Defendant Gallo also seeks monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff for costs incurred as a result of bringing each motion. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On February 8, 2024, Defendant propounded discovery requests on
Plaintiff including request for admissions, request for production of
documents, and form interrogatories. (Slack Decl. ¶4, Exh. A.) On March 1,
2024, Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff requesting discovery responses,
without objection. (Slack Decl. ¶5, Exh. B.) To date, no discovery responses
have been received nor has Plaintiff attempted to reach out to Defense Counsel.
(Slack Decl. ¶6.) 
 
The court finds Plaintiff has failed to
timely respond to Defendant’s properly served discovery request. Defendant’s unopposed
motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Request for Production of Documents,
Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One and deem admitted Requests for
Admissions, Set One are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide, objectionless responses
within 20 days. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant seeks $230 per motion for approximately 1 hour per
motion plus $60 filing fee for each motion, totaling $690 in monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff. 
 
The court GRANTS Defendant’s request for sanctions in the amount
of $230 per motion ($690 total). (See CCP §2023.010.) Sanctions to be paid
within 30 days.
