The
Court notes that on March 21, 2023 the Court set the initial trial date for

On
December 21, 2023 the parties stipulated to continued the mediation completion
date to after February 6, 2024 as they were not able to schedule a mediation
until that date.

Trial seeking a continuance until June 5, 2024 or thereafter.  The Court
granted that request and continued the trial to June 24, 2024 with associated
final status conference date.
On
May 28, 2024 the parties again stipulated to continue the trial and associated
dates and requested a new trial date of July 15, 2024.  The Court granted
that request and set the trial for July 15, 2024.
The
Court shall not accept the stipulation at this time, and orders the parties to
attend the Final Status Conference scheduled for July 5, 2024 at 9:00. 
Participation may be by remote participation, with both audio and visual, not
merely audio.  Lead trial counsel must attend.  The Court intends to
explore all aspects of trial preparation in order determine how best to manage
this litigation.  The Court expects the parties to have met and conferred
regarding all aspect of scheduling all remaining events, including remaining
discovery.  The Court is dis-inclined to grant any further discovery in
light of the fact that the parties have known since March 21, 2023 that the
initial trial date was March 27, 2024 and discovery was to be completed months
ago.
