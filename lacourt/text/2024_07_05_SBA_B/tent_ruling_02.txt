 Case Number:  23TRCV03872    Hearing Date:   July 5, 2024    Dept:  B ONYI KO vs MERCEDES-BENZ USA, LLC, A DELAWARE LIMITED
LIABILITY COMPANY, et al.
Case No. 23TRCV03872
On April 24, 2024 the Court ruled on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Discovery Responses.  The tentative
ruling provided:
“The motion is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE as to No. 30. The court is ordering the case bifurcated for both
discovery and trial. In phase one the parties shall try the basic Song Beverly
Act claim arising from the claimed breach of the Song Beverly statutory
obligations. Phase two shall involve plaintiff’s claim to a civil penalty under
Civil Code §1794(c) for a willful violation of the statute. Discovery on the
phase two issues, such as whether defendant knew that it could not repair the
claimed defects, based on its knowledge learned from vehicles other than
plaintiff’s vehicle (No. 30), shall be deferred until after the trier of fact
has returned a verdict favorable to plaintiff in phase one.”
At the hearing the Court inquired of the parties whether
they desired to brief the Court’s bifurcation order.  Plaintiff requested that opportunity and the
Court set a briefing schedule for that purpose.
“The Court will allow the issue
regarding Bifurcation to remain open.  Plaintiff's
Counsel is to file opening brief no later than 05/30/2024.  Defendant's Counsel opposition briefs are due
by 06/20/2024.  Plaintiff's Counsel is to
file any reply by 06/28/2024.
Hearing - Other Re: Bifurcation is
scheduled for 07/05/2024 at 08:30 AM in Department B at Torrance Courthouse.”
Plaintiff did not file any papers in connection with this
July 5, 2025 hearing.  (Plaintiff had
previously filed a Motion for Reconsideration heard and denied on June 4,
2024.)  Therefore, the Court’s Order of
April 24, 2024 ordering the bifurcation of the trial of this case remains the
Order of this Court.
Defendant shall give notice of this Ruling.
