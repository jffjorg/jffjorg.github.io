And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has ruled on the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Discovery Responses, denying the motion without prejudice as to No. 30. The Court has also ordered the case to be bifurcated for both discovery and trial. The bifurcation will involve two phases: the first phase will involve the basic Song Beverly Act claim arising from the claimed breach of the Song Beverly statutory obligations, and the second phase will involve the Plaintiff's claim to a civil penalty under Civil Code §1794(c) for a willful violation of the statute. Discovery on the phase two issues will be deferred until after the trier of fact has returned a verdict favorable to the Plaintiff in phase one. The Court has also set a briefing schedule for the issue of bifurcation and scheduled a hearing on July 5, 2024.
