And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to produce its person most qualified ("PMQ") to testify and to produce documents. The judge notes that there has been a dramatic increase in motions to compel further responses to document requests and motions to compel defendant car manufacturers to produce a PMQ for deposition in actions for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The judge finds that the parties' meet and confer efforts have not been made in good faith, and that the defendant has repeatedly and improperly failed to serve a privilege log, maintained objections without supporting evidence, and unilaterally limited the scope of inquiry.

The judge orders the parties to meet and confer with the court's prior rulings in mind, and if they are unable to resolve all issues, to file a joint statement of items remaining in dispute. The judge also orders the parties to file a joint statement of each item remaining in dispute regarding the document request. The judge continues the hearing to January 17, 2024, and will consider the plaintiff's request for imposition of monetary sanctions at the next hearing if necessary.
