[TENTATIVE]
ORDER CONTINUING THE HEARING ON PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME  
 
      Petitioner
filed this petition on July 17, 2023, to change his name from Orlandes Fletcher
III to Landon Lang Primous in order to honor his deceased mother’s request. The
basis for the petition does not adequately explain the relationship between
Petitioner’s mother’s wish and the name change, which is substantially
different from Petitioner’s present name. 
      Proof
of publication was filed on September 21, 2023. The Court has considered the
Criminal History Assessment which shows a discrepancy in Petitioner’s Social
Security Number. 
      The
Court continues the hearing to November 17, 2023,  at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton
courthouse. Petitioner is ordered to file, no less than 10 days before the
hearing, a supplemental declaration under penalty of perjury explaining the
reasons for the name change with specificity.
