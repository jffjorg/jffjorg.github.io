Additionally, the lis pendens was improperly served and filed, further weakening the Plaintiff's case.  The court finds that the Plaintiff has not met his burden of proving a probability of prevailing on his claims.  

Therefore, the court will grant the Defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens, and the Plaintiff will be ordered to pay $2,535.00 in attorney's fees and costs to the Defendant.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to expunge the notice of pendency of action (lis pendens) recorded by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant transferred real property to a trust without the plaintiff's knowledge or consent, and seeks to quiet title and obtain possession of the property. The defendant argues that the trust does not own the property and that the plaintiff did not meet his burden of showing a probability of prevailing on his claims.

The judge finds that the plaintiff did not properly serve the lis pendens on the defendant, and that the plaintiff has not shown a probability of prevailing on his claims. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's complaint fails to allege a claim for breach of contract, and that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support his claims.

As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens and orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorney's fees and costs.
