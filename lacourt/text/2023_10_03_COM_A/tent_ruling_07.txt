 Case Number:  23CMCV00229    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  A 23CMCV00229 Maribel Cuevas v. Miguel VazquezTuesday, October 3, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. [TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING THE HEARING ON THE MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF The complaint, filed on February 14, 2023, arises from injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident.Carpenter & Zuckerman, counsel of record for Plaintiff, Maribel Cuevas, filed this motion on August 29, 2023, for an order to be relieved as counsel due to irreconcilable differences. Counsel served the motion on the client by mail and email, but Counsel does not state in the declaration how or if these addresses have been confirmed. (CA Court Rules, Rule 3.1362.)The address given for the client is the last known address in which case the motion must be supported by a declaration stating that the attorney has not been able to locate a more current address after making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion and describing those efforts. Accordingly, the Court orders Plaintiff’s counsel to file a supplemental declaration attesting to the foregoing, to be filed no less than 10 days before the hearing.      The court continues the hearing to November 1, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
