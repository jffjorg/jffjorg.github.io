And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants three motions to compel further responses from Maya Griffith, Marshall Trujillo, and Niko Griffith to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents. The judge also grants a motion to compel further responses from Niko Griffith. The ruling is based on the complaint alleging that the plaintiffs checked into the defendants' hotel on July 1, 2020, and sustained injury from bed bugs. The plaintiffs alleged claims for battery, negligence, emotional distress, fraudulent concealment, nuisance, and breach of contract. The defendants moved to compel further responses, but the plaintiffs asserted meritless objections and failed to respond to the defendants' efforts to meet and confer. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' objections are without merit and that the defendants are entitled to further responses. The judge also imposes sanctions on each plaintiff and counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $225 per hour, for a total of $630 for Marshall Trujillo, $630 for Maya Griffith, and $285 for Niko Griffith.
