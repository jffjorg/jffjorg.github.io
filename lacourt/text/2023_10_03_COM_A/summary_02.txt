The judge finds that the plaintiffs' objections are without merit and that the defendants are entitled to further responses.

## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting three motions to compel discovery from each Plaintiff in a case involving alleged bed bug injuries at a Motel 6.

The Plaintiffs, Maya Griffith, Marshall Trujillo, and Niko Griffith, failed to adequately respond to the Defendants' discovery requests, asserting meritless objections and failing to engage in good-faith efforts to meet and confer. The Judge found their conduct warranted sanctions and ordered them to provide complete and truthful responses to the discovery requests. 

Each Plaintiff and their attorney will be jointly and severally liable for monetary sanctions totaling $285 for Niko Griffith, $630 for Maya Griffith, and $630 for Marshall Trujillo. These sanctions reflect the reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Defendants in preparing the motions to compel.

The hearing on these motions is scheduled for October 3, 2023, where the Judge will finalize the order.
