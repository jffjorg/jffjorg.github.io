And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action (lis pendens) recorded by the plaintiff on January 27, 2023. The plaintiff alleges claims for quiet title, declaratory relief, and specific performance, but the court finds that the plaintiff has not met his burden of showing a probability of prevailing on his claims by a preponderance of evidence.

The court notes that the lis pendens was improperly served on the defendant, which renders it void. Even if the lis pendens was properly recorded and served, the court would still expunge it because the defendant can file an appropriate undertaking. The court awards attorney's fees to the defendant in the amount of $2,475.00 and costs of $60. The total fees and costs are $2,535.00, which are payable to the defendant within 10 days.

The court concludes that the plaintiff's complaint fails to allege a claim for breach of contract, as it does not set out the material terms of the purported contract, including the date of the contract, when the transfer would occur, or the consideration supporting the promise. The court also notes that the plaintiff's revocable living trust does not support his claim of title.

## English Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the Defendant, James W. Young, who is the Co-Trustee of a trust that owns the real property at the center of the dispute. 

The Plaintiff, Jeffrey W. Young, filed a lawsuit seeking ownership of the property based on a claimed contract with his father. He recorded a "lis pendens," a notice that affects the title to the property, but the Judge found that the lis pendens was improperly served and filed, making it void. 

Furthermore, the Judge determined that the Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim, particularly the details of the alleged contract.  

Therefore, the Judge grants the Defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens and awards the Defendant $2,535.00 in attorney's fees and costs.
