And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling orders the continuation of the hearing on Petitioner Orlandes Fletcher III's petition to change his name from Orlandes Fletcher III to Landon Lang Primous. The court is concerned that the basis for the petition does not adequately explain the relationship between Petitioner's mother's wish and the name change, which is substantially different from Petitioner's present name. As a result, the court orders Petitioner to file a supplemental declaration under penalty of perjury explaining the reasons for the name change with specificity. The hearing is continued to November 17, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton courthouse.
