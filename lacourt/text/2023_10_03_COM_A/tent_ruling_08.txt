 ROIC Paramount Plaza, LLC v. Viva Donas, Inc., dba Donas a California
 Corporation, et al.

[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO DEEM FACTS ADMITTED AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS 
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
      This
action arises from Defendants’ alleged breach of a commercial lease agreement.
Plaintiff alleges claims for breach of contract, account stated, and for money
had and received. 
      On June
12, 2023, Plaintiff served a first set of requests for admission on all
Defendants. Defendants did not serve responses due on July 17, 2023, nor have
Defendants sought extensions of time to respond. Defendants did not file an
opposition to the motion.
II.      DISCUSSION
      On
August 16, 2023, defense counsel, Bruce R. Menke, filed
substitutions of attorney on behalf of all Defendants. The individual
Defendants, Ashley Leon and David Vasquez, are presently self-represented. 
      The
next day, Mr. Menke filed a substitution of attorney form on behalf of
Defendant, Viva Donas, LLC, dba Donas, a California corporation. It
is firmly established that a corporation cannot represent itself and appear in
court, except through an agent that is an officer of the court. (Merco Constr. Engineers,
Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 730;
Thomas G. Ferruzzo, Inc. v. Superior Court (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 501, 503.)
The Judicial Council form for substitution is proper when substituting one
attorney for another. The substitution was signed by David Vasquez on behalf of
the corporation, although it does not appear that he is a California attorney. As
the substitution is improper and not filed in conformity with the law, it is
subject to a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.)  
      With
respect to the individual Defendants only, the Court can deem requests admitted
against the non-responding party, where that party fails to respond to requests
for admission unless it finds that a proposed response to the requests that
substantially complies with statutory requirements is served before the hearing.
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 subd. (c).) Imposition of
sanctions is mandatory where a party’s failure to respond to the requests
necessitates the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 subd. (c).)
III.    CONCLUSION
      As
there is no evidence that Defendants, Ashley Leon and David Vasquez, served code-compliant
responses prior to the hearing, the motion is GRANTED as to those Defendants
only. The responses to requests for admission served on Ashley Leon and David
Vasquez are deemed admitted. 
      While
Plaintiffs’ counsel requests $525 per hour for attorney’s fees, the Court finds
that $350 per hour is reasonable for this discovery motion which is not complex
and is unopposed. (Decl. Sam Yebri, ¶ 5-7.) The Court finds that two hours to
prepare this motion is reasonable (reduced from five hours). The Court imposes
monetary sanctions against the individual defendants totaling $700, ($350
each), payable to Plaintiff’s counsel within 10 days. 
      The
motion with respect to the corporation, Viva Donas, LLC, dba Donas, Inc., is continued
to November 22, 2023, to determine whether it was improperly served on the
corporation, and not its counsel of record, whose substitution is arguably improper.
The Court sets an Order to Show Cause [OSC] hearing why
the substitution of attorney form pertaining to Viva Donas, LLC, dba Donas should
not be stricken pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure 436. (Cal. Civ. Pro. § 436, subd., (b).)  The OSC is set on November 22, 2023, at
8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.

      A copy of minute order shall be served on
all interested parties, including defense counsel Bruce R. Menke.
