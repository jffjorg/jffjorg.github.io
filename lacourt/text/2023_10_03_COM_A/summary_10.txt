And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied American Honda Motor Co, Inc.'s (Honda) motion to compel arbitration in the case of Francisco Villareal v. American Honda Motor Co, Inc. The plaintiff, Villareal, purchased a 2020 Honda Pilot from Carson Honda and alleges that the vehicle developed defects that Honda could not repair. Honda claims that the parties agreed to arbitrate disputes arising out of the purchase or condition of the vehicle through the Retail Installment Sales Contract. However, the judge finds that Honda lacks standing to enforce the arbitration provision because it is not a signatory to the contract and did not have a direct relationship with the plaintiff. Additionally, the judge concludes that the plaintiff's claims are not founded on the sales contract, but rather on the manufacturer's warranty obligations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Therefore, the judge denies Honda's motion to compel arbitration.
