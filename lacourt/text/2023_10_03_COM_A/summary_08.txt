The court imposes monetary sanctions against the individual defendants in the amount of $700, payable to the plaintiff's counsel within 10 days. The motion with respect to the corporation, Viva Donas, LLC, dba Donas, Inc., is continued to November 22, 2023, to determine whether the substitution of attorney was improper.
