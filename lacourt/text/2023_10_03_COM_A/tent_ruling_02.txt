I.       
BACKGROUND
      The
complaint alleges that Plaintiffs checked into Defendants’ hotel on July 1,
2020, and sustained injury from bed bugs. Plaintiffs alleges claims for battery,[1] negligence,
emotional distress, fraudulent concealment, nuisance, and breach of contract. 
      Defendants
move to compel further responses to the initial set of discovery served on each
Plaintiffs, Marshall Trujillo and Maya Griffith, and further responses to form
interrogatories served on Plaintiff, Niko Griffith. Plaintiffs asserted
meritless objections after given an extension of two months to respond. Plaintiffs
did not respond to Defendants’ efforts to meet and confer. The Court should
impose sanctions against each Plaintiff and counsel. 
      Defendants
served the motion on Plaintiffs’ counsel by electronic mail on July 28, 2023.
Plaintiffs did not file an opposition by September 19, 2023 (nine court days
before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., 1005(b).)
      A
party can move to compel a further response to interrogatories or a request for
production of documents where the party deems an answer to be evasive or
incomplete, or an exercise of the option to produce documents is unwarranted or
inadequate, or an objection is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.300(a); § 2031.310(a)). Defense counsel attempted to meet and confer by
letter dated June 26, 2023; however, Plaintiff did not respond. (Decl. of
Gabriella Sternfeld, Ex. C, ¶ 4.) 
      The
separate statements in support of each motion reflect that Plaintiffs asserted
objections to all discovery requests. Plaintiffs have not opposed the motions
to explain the merits of any of the objections.
      Accordingly,
Defendants’ seven motions to compel further responses from each Plaintiff are
GRANTED. All Plaintiffs are ordered to provide further, verified and
code-compliant responses to the discovery requests at issue without objection. Imposition
of monetary sanctions is warranted. The Court finds that $225 per hour is a
reasonable fee. As all seven motions are essentially identical, the Court finds
that two hours to prepare three motions directed to Plaintiff Marshall Trujillo’s
responses, and two hours to prepare three motions directed to Maya Griffith’s
responses are reasonable. One hour to prepare one motion to compel Niko
Griffith’s responses is reasonable.  Therefore,
the Court imposes sanctions against each Plaintiff and counsel, jointly and
severally, and payable in 10 days to Defendants as follows:



Plaintiff


Attorney’s fees 


Filing Fees


Total Sanction




Niko Griffith –
  1 motion


$225 x 1 hour =

$ 285.00




Maya Griffith –
  3 motions


$225 x 2 hours =
  $450 


$180


$ 630.00




Marshall
  Trujillo – 3 motions


$225 x 2 hours =
  $450


$180


$630.00
