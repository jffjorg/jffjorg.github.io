```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant the anti-SLAPP motion to strike the fifth cause of action alleged in the complaint against defendants Allen Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis, LLP, Andrew Wood, and K. Erik Freiss. The Judge finds that the defendants have made a prima facie showing that the claims arise from protected activity, namely, litigation-related activity in connection with the underlying dispute in Crawford I. The Judge also finds that the defendants' conduct is protected by the litigation privilege under California Civil Code section 47(b). Since the plaintiff has not filed an opposition, the Judge is unable to determine that the complaint is legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment. Therefore, the Judge grants the anti-SLAPP motion to strike the fifth cause of action and orders the defendants' dismissal from the action. The Judge also orders the defendants to file a supplemental declaration substantiating costs incurred to prepare the motion to strike within 10 days.

**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the anti-SLAPP motion filed by attorneys Allen Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis, LLP, Andrew Wood, and K. Erik Freiss. 

The judge finds that the fifth cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) against these attorneys arises from protected litigation activity and is therefore subject to the anti-SLAPP statute.  Because Plaintiff did not oppose the motion, the judge concludes that Defendants are likely to prevail on this claim.  As a result, the judge dismisses the fifth cause of action and orders the attorney defendants to submit documentation supporting their costs for preparing the anti-SLAPP motion.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the anti-SLAPP motion to strike the fifth cause of action, which alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress against the attorney defendants. The judge has determined that the claims arise from protected activity, specifically litigation-related activity, and that the attorney defendants have made a prima facie showing that the claims are based on constitutional rights.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's opportunity to amend the complaint, noting that the plaintiff cannot avoid an anti-SLAPP motion by filing an amended pleading before the motion is heard.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file a supplemental declaration substantiating costs incurred to prepare the motion to strike and has dismissed the attorney defendants from the action.

The judge has also ordered the prevailing defendant to recover attorney's fees and costs as mandated by statute, but only as to the motion to strike and not the entire litigation.
