And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant the anti-SLAPP motion to strike the fifth cause of action alleged in the complaint against defendants Allen Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis, LLP, Andrew Wood, and K. Erik Freiss. The Judge finds that the defendants have made a prima facie showing that the claims arise from protected activity, namely, litigation-related activity in connection with the underlying dispute in Crawford I. The Judge also finds that the defendants' conduct is protected by the litigation privilege under California Civil Code section 47(b). Since the plaintiff has not filed an opposition, the Judge is unable to determine that the complaint is legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment. Therefore, the Judge grants the anti-SLAPP motion to strike the fifth cause of action and orders the defendants' dismissal from the action. The Judge also orders the defendants to file a supplemental declaration substantiating costs incurred to prepare the motion to strike within 10 days.
