And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Yotam Regev Trustee of the Estrondo Trust Dated March 2, 2017's motion to quash service of summons. The Plaintiff, Omar McCallister, slipped and fell at a property owned by the Defendant on June 10, 2022, and subsequently filed a complaint. The Defendant filed a motion to quash service of summons, arguing that the service was not properly and validly effectuated. The judge found that the proof of service submitted by the Plaintiff did not satisfy the statutory requirements, and that the Defendant's declaration, which stated that they were not present in the USA from August 28 to September 7, 2024 and did not live or work at the property, rebutted the presumption that service was proper. As a result, the judge granted the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons.
