COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:       
Quash
  Service of Summons
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: Granted.
 
 
I.               
BACKGROUND
 
On or about June 10, 2022,
Plaintiff Omar McCallister (“Plaintiff”) slipped and fell at a property located
at 4488 Estrondo Dr, Encino, CA 91436-3263 (the “Subject Property”). (Complaint
¶¶ 2, 10.) Defendant Yotam Regev Trustee of the Estrondo Trust Dated March 2,
2017 (“Defendant”), owns the Subject Property. (Complaint ¶ 2.) 
 
On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendants Yotam Regev Trustee of the Estrondo Trust Dated
March 2, 2017, Doe Cleaning Lady and Doe Company and Doe Employee, Liv Lux LA
Properties and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for premises
liability, negligence, and negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. 
 
On November 1, 2024, Defendant
filed a motion to quash service of summons (the “Motion”). Plaintiff filed no
opposition.
 
II.            
PROCEDURAL
ISSUES
 
“A defendant, on or before the
last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court
may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion. . .
[t]o quash service of summons[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a)(1).) Generally,
a responsive pleading is due within thirty days after service of the summons. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3).) 
 
Plaintiff filed a proof of service
showing Defendant was served by substituted service on September 7, 2024.
(Proof of Service filed 09/30/24.) Defendant’s counsel submits a declaration
stating that, on October 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to extend the
responsive pleading deadline by thirty days. (Matta Declaration ¶ 2.) Defendant
filed the Motion on November 1, 2024.
 
Accordingly, Defendant timely filed
the Motion.
 
III.          
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“A
defendant, . . . may serve and file a notice of motion…to quash service of
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc., §¿418.10(a)(1).) A defendant may move to quash
service of summons for lack of jurisdiction based on ineffective service of
process. (See Ziller Elecs. Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 1222, 1229.)
 
When
a defendant moves to quash service of the summons and complaint, the plaintiff
has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that
is the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Coulston v. Cooper
(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) The plaintiff must establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. (Aquila, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.) 
 
“The
filing of a proof of service declaration ordinarily creates a rebuttable
presumption that the service was proper, but only if the service declaration
‘complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.’” (Lebel v.
Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1164.) That presumption may be rebutted by
contrary evidence submitted by a defendant. (Fernandes v. Singh (2017)
16 Cal.App.5th 932, 941, fn. 6.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If
service of summons is not properly and validly effectuated by one or more of
the approved methods, California courts lack personal jurisdiction over the
defendants, and any judicial actions taken without such service violates
principles of fundamental due process and is therefore void. (County of San
Diego v. Gorham (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1226-1227.)¿
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 415.20, subdivision (a), states:
 
In lieu of personal
delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint to the person to be served as
specified in Section 416.10, 416.20, 416.30, 416.40, or 416.50, a summons may be
served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint during usual office hours
in his or her office or, if no physical address is known, at his or her usual
mailing address, other than a United States Postal Service post office box, with
the person who is apparently in charge thereof, and by thereafter mailing a
copy of the summons and complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the
person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were
left. When service is effected by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint
at a mailing address, it shall be left with a person at least 18 years of age,
who shall be informed of the contents thereof. Service of a summons in this
manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.
 
IV.          
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant argues Plaintiff’s proof
of service does not satisfy the statutory requirements because Defendant “has
never lived nor worked at the Premises where substitute service was purportedly
made[.]” (Motion pp. 3-4.)
 
Plaintiff submitted a proof of
service showing Defendant was served by substituted service on September 7,
2024, at 4488 Estrondo Drive Encino, CA 91436. (Proof of Service filed
09/30/24.) 
 
The submitted proof of service is
not signed by the process server.  (Proof
of Service filed 09/30/24 pp. 2-3.) But even if Plaintiff’s proof of service
created a rebuttable presumption that service was proper, that presumption can
be rebutted by Defendant’s contrary evidence. (See Lebel v. Mai, supra, 210
Cal.App.4th at 1163; Fernandez v. Singh, supra, 16 Cal.App.5th at 941,
fn. 6.)
 
Defendant submits a declaration
stating Defendant “do[es] not live in the USA[,]” was “not . . . present in the
USA from August 28 to September 7, 2024[,]” and “do not now, [or] ever, lived
or worked at 4488 Estrondo Dr. Encino, CA 91436.” (Regev Declaration ¶¶ 2-3.) 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
declaration rebuts the presumption that Defendant was properly served.
 
V.             
 CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons,
Defendant’s Motion is granted.
