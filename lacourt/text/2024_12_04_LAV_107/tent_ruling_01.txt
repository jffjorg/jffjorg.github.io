COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:       
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: (1) Sustain demurrer
with leave to amend; (2) Grant motion to strike, in part, and deny, in part.

I.               
BACKGROUND¿ 
 
This is a landlord-tenant dispute. Beginning
on or about January 2023, Plaintiffs Angie Burandt Kolfschoten, Amber Rose
Burandt, and Ruby Grace Kolfschoten resided at 8534 Canoga Avenue, Canoga Park,
California 91305 (the “Subject Property”). (Complaint ¶¶ 1-3.) Defendants Rubinstein
1999 Living Trust, Judith Rubinstein, and Zvi Arie Rubinstein (“Defendants”)
owned, managed, and controlled the Subject Property. (Complaint ¶¶ 4-6.)
 
On or about November 2023, Plaintiffs discovered
the Subject Property was rat infested, had inadequate and leaking plumbing, had
inadequate trash disposal, had mold and mildew, contained uneven, unstable, and
not properly insulated doors and windows, had walls and fixtures coming apart,
had holes around windows, had a pest and rodent infestation, and had
deteriorating interior walls. (Complaint ¶¶13-14.) Plaintiffs notified
Defendants but Defendants failed to repair the defects. (Complaint ¶ 14.)
 
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint against Defendants and Does 1 to 50, alleging eight causes of action
for: (1) violation of Civil code section 1942.4; (2) tortious breach of
warranty of habitability; (3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; (4)
negligent maintenance of the premises; (5) maintenance of nuisance; (6)
violation of Business & Professions code section 17200 et. seq.; (7)
negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (8) intentional infliction of
emotional distress. 
 
On October 17, 2024, Defendants filed a
motion to strike. On October 18, 2024, Defendants filed a demurrer. On November
19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike. Defendant
filed no replies.
 
II.            
PROCEDURAL
MATTERS 
 
A.   
Timeliness 
 
“A person against whom a complaint or
cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after service of the
complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §¿430.40(a).) 
 
Per California Code of Civil Procedure section¿435,
subdivision (b)(1), a motion to strike should be filed within 30 days after
service of the complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3).)  
 
Per California Code of Civil
Procedure §¿1005, subdivision (b), moving papers should be filed at
least 16 court days before they are set for hearing, oppositions thereto should
be filed at least nine court days before the set hearing, and replies to any
oppositions should be filed at least five court days before the set hearing. 
 
Defendants filed a declaration seeking an automatic thirty-day
extension of time to file a responsive pleading so the parties could meet and
confer. (Newell Declaration re: Attempt to Meet and Confer ¶¶
3, 6.) Defendants’ counsel’s declaration stated that the “responsive pleading
[was then] due on or before October 16, 2024.” (Newell Declaration re: Attempt to Meet
and Confer ¶ 7.) Defendants filed the motion to strike on October 17, 2024,
and the demurrer on October 18, 2024. Thus, the motion to strike and demurrer
were untimely.
 
Judges have discretion as to whether to consider or strike an
untimely demurrer or pleading. (McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281.) This court will exercise its discretion and consider
the motion to strike and demurrer.
 
The motion to strike, demurrer, and oppositions were timely filed
under section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
B.   
Meet
and Confer 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure section¿430.41,
subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and confer” in good faith before the
filing of a demurrer to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in
the demurrer.¿The demurring party is required to file and serve with the
demurrer a declaration either confirming that parties were unable to resolve
the issues raised by the demurrer despite having met and conferred or that the
opposing party failed to meet and confer with the demurring party in good
faith. (Code Civ. Proc. §¿430.41(a)(3).) 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure §¿435.5, subdivision (a)
also requires parties to meet and confer before filing a motion to strike. 
 
Defendants’ counsel submits a declaration stating Defendants’
counsel met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel, but the parties were unable
to resolve the issues. (Newell Declaration ¶¶ 2-9.)
 
This court finds that Defendants
satisfied the meet and confer requirement. 
 
III.          
DEMURRER 
 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not the evidence or the facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc.
v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such,
the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied
factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 745.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it
contains “[a]¿statement¿of the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in
ordinary and concise language.” (Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this
standard, a “complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather
than evidentiary facts.” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th
531, 550.) 
 
A party may demur to a complaint because the complaint “does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e).) 
 
A party may also demur because “[t]he pleading is uncertain.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) “’[U]ncertain’ includes ambiguous and
unintelligible.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) Demurrers for uncertainty are
strictly construed, because discovery can be used for clarification. (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Against a
demurrer, a plaintiff is required only to “set forth in his complaint the
essential facts of his case with reasonable precision and with particularity
sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant of the nature, source, and
extent of his cause of action.” (Elder v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co. (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 841, 858.)  
 
B.   
Discussion 
 
Defendants demur
to Plaintiffs’ first cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4
and eighth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
(Demurrer p. 2.) Defendants argue the causes of action fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute causes of action and are uncertain, vague, and
ambiguous. (Demurrer pp. 2-3.)
 
i.                
Violation of Civil Code
Section 1942.4
 
Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ first cause of action for violation
of Civil Code section 1942.4 fails to state a cause of action because
Plaintiffs do not allege that a public officer inspected the premises.
(Demurrer p. 6.)
 
Civil Code section 1942.4 states: 
 
A landlord of a
dwelling may not demand rent, collect rent, issue a notice of a rent increase,
or issue a three-day notice to pay rent or quit pursuant to subdivision
(2) of Section 1161 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if all of the
following conditions exist prior to the landlord's demand or notice:
 
(1)   The dwelling
substantially lacks any of the affirmative standard characteristics listed
in Section 1941.1 or violates Section
17920.10 of the Health and Safety Code, or is deemed and declared substandard as set
forth in Section 17920.3 of the Health and Safety Code because
conditions listed in that section exist to an extent that endangers the life,
limb, health, property, safety, or welfare of the public or the occupants of
the dwelling.
 
(2)   A public officer
or employee who is responsible for the enforcement of any housing law, after inspecting the premises, has notified the
landlord or the landlord's agent in writing of his or her
obligations to abate the nuisance or repair the substandard conditions.
 
(3)   The conditions
have existed and have not been abated 35 days beyond the
date of service of the notice specified in paragraph (2) and
the delay is without good cause. For purposes of this
subdivision, service shall be complete at the time of deposit in the United
States mail.
 
(4)   The conditions
were not caused by an act or omission of the tenant or lessee in violation
of Section 1929 or 1941.2.
 
Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the Subject Property
“contained inadequate and leaking plumbing.” (Complaint ¶ 13.) Civil Code section 1941.1,
subdivision (a) states that a “dwelling shall be deemed untenantable for
purposes of Section 1941 if it substantially lacks . . . [p]lumbing or gas
facilities that conformed to applicable law in effect at the time of
installation, maintained in good working order.” Thus, Plaintiffs allege facts
supporting the first element under section 1942.4. 
 
Plaintiffs also allege that “[t]he [Subject Property] had
inadequate trash disposal and removal which left the Premises unsanitary and
subject to major health hazards which requires involvement of Government Code
Enforcement” but do not allege that a public officer or employee responsible
for enforcing any housing law inspected the Subject Property and notified the
landlord or landlord’s agent of their obligation to abate the nuisance or
repair the conditions. (Complaint ¶
13.) Thus,
Plaintiffs have not alleged facts supporting the second element under section
1942.4.
 
Plaintiffs further allege that “[w]ithout good cause
Defendants failed to make repairs within thirty-five (35) days of receiving
notice during which time the substandard conditions continued to exist without
abatement” and that “Plaintiffs did not cause, create, or contribute to the
existence of the defective conditions[.]” (Complaint ¶¶ 19, 26.) Thus, Plaintiffs allege facts
supporting the third and fourth elements under section 1942.4. 
 
Because Plaintiffs have not alleged a
public officer or employee, responsible for the enforcement of housing law,
inspected the Subject Property and notified the landlord or the landlord’s
agent in writing of their obligation to abate the nuisance or repair the
conditions, this court sustains the demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ first cause of
action.
 
ii.              
Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress
 
¿“The elements of a cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress are (1) the defendant engages in extreme and
outrageous conduct with the intent to cause, or with reckless disregard for the
probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff suffers extreme
or severe emotional distress; and (3) the defendant's extreme and outrageous
conduct was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's extreme or severe
emotional distress.” (So v. Shin (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 671.)¿ “[W]hether
conduct is ‘outrageous’ is usually a question of fact.” (Id. at p. 672.)
To be outrageous, the conduct must be “so extreme as to exceed all bounds of
that usually tolerated in a civilized society.” (Huntingdon Life Sciences,
Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1259.) 
 
A tenant
may bring a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress
when the landlord knowingly, intentionally, and willfully fails to correct
defective conditions. (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1069.) In Burnett, the premises contained mold that the
respondents refused to repair, causing appellants to “inhale[] the toxic
airborne spores and fumes emitted from the mold” and causing “severe physical
injury and discomfort, and severe emotional and mental distress.” (Id. at
p. 1062.) The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings as to respondents’
intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action. (Id. at 1068-1069.)
The Court of Appeal held that the trial court erred by granting judgment on the
pleadings and rejected the argument that “the complaint’s allegations do not
meet the standard of extreme and outrageous conduct.” (Id. at p. 1069.) 
 
Plaintiffs
allege the Subject Property contained numerous defects, including a rat infestation, inadequate and leaking
plumbing, inadequate trash disposal, mold and mildew, uneven, unstable, and not
properly insulated doors and windows, walls and fixtures coming apart, holes
around windows, a pest and rodent infestation, and deteriorating interior walls.
(Complaint ¶ 13.) Plaintiffs allege Plaintiffs notified Defendants about these
issues but “Defendants failed and refused to repair any of the defective and
dangerous conditions.” (Complaint ¶ 14.) Plaintiffs further allege that
Defendants’ conduct was intentional and “rose to a level of extreme and
outrageous conduct that shocks the conscience and falls outside the bounds of
decency.” (Complaint ¶ 66.) “[W]hether conduct is ‘outrageous’ is usually a question of
fact.” (So v. Shin, supra, 212 Cal.App.4th at 672.) Like Burnett
v. Chimney Sweep, this court cannot determine that, as a matter of law, these
allegations do not constitute outrageous conduct.
 
Plaintiffs allege they lived “in a
constant fear of rats and other vermin at the [Subject Property].” (Complaint ¶
65.) However, Plaintiffs have not alleged that they have suffered “severe or
extreme emotional distress.” Moreover, Plaintiffs have not alleged that
Defendants’ conduct was the actual and proximate cause of Plaintiffs’ extreme
or severe emotional distress. Specifically, Plaintiffs
allege “each of the Defendants fictitiously named herein as a DOE is legally
responsible, negligently or in some other actionable manner, for the events and
happenings hereinafter referred to, and thereby proximately and legally caused
the injuries and damages to Plaintiff as hereinafter alleged.” (Complaint ¶ 8.)
But Plaintiffs do not specifically allege Defendants caused Plaintiffs severe
emotional distress.

 
Thus, because Plaintiffs have not alleged
sufficient facts showing they suffered severe or extreme emotional distress or
a causal connection between Defendants’ conduct and Plaintiffs’ emotional
distress, Plaintiffs’ complaint fails to state a cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress.
 
iii.            
Uncertain, Vague, or
Ambiguous
 
Defendants
argue Plaintiffs’ first and eighth causes of action fail because they are
uncertain, vague, and ambiguous. (Demurrer p. 3.) 
 
Plaintiffs’
complaint sets forth the essential facts of their case such that Defendant can
be acquainted with the nature, source, and extent of Plaintiffs’ causes of
action. (See Elder v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co., supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 858.)  Thus, Plaintiffs’
complaint is not uncertain, vague, or ambiguous.
 
IV.          
MOTION
TO STRIKE 
 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(a).)
The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 436(b).) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the
face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc. §¿437(a).)¿ 
¿ 
A motion to strike is appropriate to
attack a claim for punitive damages. (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.) “In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation
of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief
must be pled by a plaintiff.¿In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a
motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to
strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clauson
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255 (internal citations
omitted).) “Further, even though certain language pleads ultimate facts or
conclusions of law, such language when read in context with the facts alleged
as to defendants' conduct may adequately plead the evil motive requisite to
recovery of¿punitive¿damages.” (Monge v. Superior Court (1986) 176
Cal.App.3d 503, 510.) 
 
“In order to state a prima facie claim
for¿punitive¿damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the
general¿punitive¿damage¿statute,¿Civil Code section 3294.” (Turman v.
Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
“[P]roof of negligence, even gross negligence, or recklessness is insufficient
to warrant an award of punitive damages.” (Dawes v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82, 87.) To justify a punitive damages award, the
defendant must be “guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.”¿(Civ. Code., §
3294.)  
 
Malice is defined as “conduct which is intended
by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which
is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(1).) Oppression is defined as
“despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 3294(c)(2).)
Fraud is defined as “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a
material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the
defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or
otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).) 
¿ 
“Punitive¿damages¿may not
be¿pleaded¿generally.” (Today’s IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1193.) “The mere
allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an
award of¿punitive¿damages.” (Grieves v. Superior Court, supra,
157 Cal.App.3d 159 at 166.) And “conclusory characterization of defendant's
conduct as intentional, wilful and fraudulent is a patently insufficient
statement of ‘oppression, fraud, or malice, express or implied,’ within the
meaning of¿section 3294.” (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d
864, 872.) “Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or
malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves
v. Superior Court, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d at p. 166; Today’s IV,
Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, supra,
83 Cal.App.5th at p. 1193 [“In addition to the requirement that the operative
complaint set forth the elements as stated in¿section 3294, it must
include¿specific¿factual allegations showing that defendant's conduct was
oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious to support a claim
for¿punitive¿damages.”].)¿ 
 
An employer shall not be liable for
punitive damages based on the acts of an employee,  
“unless the employer had advance knowledge of the
unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of
the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct
for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression,
fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge
and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression,
fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent
of the corporation.” (Civ. Code, § 3294(b).) 
 
B.   
Discussion 
 
Defendants seek an order striking the
allegations, references to, and the prayer for punitive damages in the
complaint. (Motion to Strike pp. 1-2.) Defendants argue “the [c]omplaint is
silent as to extreme or outrageous conduct and offers nothing meeting the
threshold for pleading an award of punitive damages.” (Motion to Strike p. 7.)
Defendants further argue that “Plaintiffs’ grievances sound in mere negligence
and do not support any malice.” (Motion to Strike p. 7.)
 
i.                
Negligent
Maintenance of the Premises
 
Plaintiffs seek punitive damages for their fourth cause of
action for negligent maintenance of the premises. (Complaint ¶ 44.) “Simple negligence cannot support
an award of punitive damages.” (Jackson v. Johnson (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th
1350, 1354.) Accordingly, this court grants Defendants’ motion to strike
paragraph 44 of the complaint. 
 
ii.              
Malice,
Fraud, and Oppression 
 
A failure to complete repairs can, under some circumstances,
be sufficient to recover punitive damages. In Stoiber v. Honeychuck
(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 920, a residential tenant “pleaded sufficient facts
to support her prayer for exemplary damages” when her complaint both “alleged
that defendant had actual knowledge of defective conditions in the premises
including leaking sewage, deteriorated flooring, falling ceiling, leaking roof,
broken windows, and other unsafe and dangerous conditions” and “alleged that
defendants ‘In maintaining said nuisance,… acted with full knowledge of the
consequences thereof and the damage being caused to plaintiff, and their
conduct was willful, oppressive and malicious.’”¿In Stoiber, the tenant alleged
that she repeatedly notified the defendants of the conditions, “and that no
effort was made to repair the defects, except that on one occasion a plumber
had been sent in response to a complaint regarding the toilet.” (Id. at
pp. 912-913.) 
 
Similarly, in Penner v. Falk (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 858, 867, the Court of Appeal stated the pleadings adequately
supported a punitive damages award because “[t]he pleadings sufficiently allege
facts setting forth long existing physical conditions of the premises which
portend danger for the tenants” and “[t]he pleadings also set out that
respondents knew of those conditions for up to two years, had power to make
changes, but failed to take corrective and curative measures.” The Court stated
that “[i]f proven, these allegations would support an award of punitive
damages.” (Id.)  
 
Plaintiffs allege that on or about
November 2023, “Plaintiffs notified Defendants orally, in writing and/or in
person regarding the various issues and defects and requested that Defendants
have them repaired” but “Defendants failed and refused to repair any of the
defective and dangerous conditions.” (Complaint ¶ 14.) Plaintiffs also allege
that Plaintiffs complained to Defendants about rat and vermin at the Subject
Property, but “[d]espite Plaintiffs complaining to Defendants about these
concerns repeatedly, for months, Defendants refused and continue to refuse to
remediate.” (Complaint ¶ 65.)
 
Plaintiffs further allege that, as
“experienced owners and managers of residential property” Defendants “are aware
that absent appropriate maintenance serious habitability violations would
develop that would seriously and materially affect Plaintiffs’ tenancy.”
(Complaint ¶ 15.) 
 
Finally, Plaintiffs allege that “[i]n
maintaining the nuisance, Defendants acted with full knowledge of the
consequences thereof of the damage being caused to Plaintiffs” but “[d]espite
this knowledge, Defendants failure to bate the nuisance by repairing the
defective and dangerous conditions of the Premises or to have them repaired
within a reasonable time . . . was both oppressive and malicious within the
meaning of Civil Code Section 3294 in that they subjected Plaintiffs to
cruel and unjust hardship in willful conscious disregard of Plaintiffs’ rights
and safety[.]” (Complaint ¶ 49.)
 
Like Stoiber v. Honeychuck and Penner
v. Falk, Plaintiffs allege here that the Subject Property had various
defects, Defendants were aware of those defects but failed to take action to
remediate the defects, and, as experienced property managers, Defendants were
“aware that absent appropriate maintenance serious habitability violations
would develop that would seriously and materially affect Plaintiffs’ tenancy.”  (Complaint ¶¶ 13-15.) These allegations are
sufficient to support Plaintiffs’ punitive damages claim.
 
Accordingly, this court overrules
Defendants’ motion to strike paragraph 49 of the complaint and item 4 of
Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief. Because the court sustains the demurrer, the motion to strike relating to
paragraph 66 is moot.

 
V.             
LEAVE
TO AMEND 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to
strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure, ‘leave to amend is
routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the
defect in question.’” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) 
 
This court finds there is a reasonable
possibility Plaintiffs can cure the defects and grants Plaintiffs leave to
amend. 
 
VI.          
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, this court
sustains the demurrer. This court also grants the motion to strike as to
paragraph 44 but denies the motion to strike as to paragraphs 49 and 66 (moot)  and item 4 in Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief. Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend within thirty (30) days’
notice of this order.

COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:       
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: (1) Sustain demurrer
with leave to amend; (2) Grant motion to strike, in part, and deny, in part.

I.               
BACKGROUND¿ 
 
This is a landlord-tenant dispute. Beginning
on or about January 2023, Plaintiffs Angie Burandt Kolfschoten, Amber Rose
Burandt, and Ruby Grace Kolfschoten resided at 8534 Canoga Avenue, Canoga Park,
California 91305 (the “Subject Property”). (Complaint ¶¶ 1-3.) Defendants Rubinstein
1999 Living Trust, Judith Rubinstein, and Zvi Arie Rubinstein (“Defendants”)
owned, managed, and controlled the Subject Property. (Complaint ¶¶ 4-6.)
 
On or about November 2023, Plaintiffs discovered
the Subject Property was rat infested, had inadequate and leaking plumbing, had
inadequate trash disposal, had mold and mildew, contained uneven, unstable, and
not properly insulated doors and windows, had walls and fixtures coming apart,
had holes around windows, had a pest and rodent infestation, and had
deteriorating interior walls. (Complaint ¶¶13-14.) Plaintiffs notified
Defendants but Defendants failed to repair the defects. (Complaint ¶ 14.)
 
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint against Defendants and Does 1 to 50, alleging eight causes of action
for: (1) violation of Civil code section 1942.4; (2) tortious breach of
warranty of habitability; (3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; (4)
negligent maintenance of the premises; (5) maintenance of nuisance; (6)
violation of Business & Professions code section 17200 et. seq.; (7)
negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (8) intentional infliction of
emotional distress. 
 
On October 17, 2024, Defendants filed a
motion to strike. On October 18, 2024, Defendants filed a demurrer. On November
19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike. Defendant
filed no replies.
 
II.            
PROCEDURAL
MATTERS 
 
A.   
Timeliness 
 
“A person against whom a complaint or
cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after service of the
complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §¿430.40(a).) 
 
Per California Code of Civil Procedure section¿435,
subdivision (b)(1), a motion to strike should be filed within 30 days after
service of the complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3).)  
 
Per California Code of Civil
Procedure §¿1005, subdivision (b), moving papers should be filed at
least 16 court days before they are set for hearing, oppositions thereto should
be filed at least nine court days before the set hearing, and replies to any
oppositions should be filed at least five court days before the set hearing. 
 
Defendants filed a declaration seeking an automatic thirty-day
extension of time to file a responsive pleading so the parties could meet and
confer. (Newell Declaration re: Attempt to Meet and Confer ¶¶
3, 6.) Defendants’ counsel’s declaration stated that the “responsive pleading
[was then] due on or before October 16, 2024.” (Newell Declaration re: Attempt to Meet
and Confer ¶ 7.) Defendants filed the motion to strike on October 17, 2024,
and the demurrer on October 18, 2024. Thus, the motion to strike and demurrer
were untimely.
 
Judges have discretion as to whether to consider or strike an
untimely demurrer or pleading. (McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281.) This court will exercise its discretion and consider
the motion to strike and demurrer.
 
The motion to strike, demurrer, and oppositions were timely filed
under section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
B.   
Meet
and Confer 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure section¿430.41,
subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and confer” in good faith before the
filing of a demurrer to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in
the demurrer.¿The demurring party is required to file and serve with the
demurrer a declaration either confirming that parties were unable to resolve
the issues raised by the demurrer despite having met and conferred or that the
opposing party failed to meet and confer with the demurring party in good
faith. (Code Civ. Proc. §¿430.41(a)(3).) 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure §¿435.5, subdivision (a)
also requires parties to meet and confer before filing a motion to strike. 
 
Defendants’ counsel submits a declaration stating Defendants’
counsel met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel, but the parties were unable
to resolve the issues. (Newell Declaration ¶¶ 2-9.)
 
This court finds that Defendants
satisfied the meet and confer requirement. 
 
III.          
DEMURRER 
 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not the evidence or the facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc.
v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such,
the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied
factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 745.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it
contains “[a]¿statement¿of the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in
ordinary and concise language.” (Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this
standard, a “complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather
than evidentiary facts.” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th
531, 550.) 
 
A party may demur to a complaint because the complaint “does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e).) 
 
A party may also demur because “[t]he pleading is uncertain.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) “’[U]ncertain’ includes ambiguous and
unintelligible.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) Demurrers for uncertainty are
strictly construed, because discovery can be used for clarification. (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Against a
demurrer, a plaintiff is required only to “set forth in his complaint the
essential facts of his case with reasonable precision and with particularity
sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant of the nature, source, and
extent of his cause of action.” (Elder v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co. (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 841, 858.)  
 
B.   
Discussion 
 
Defendants demur
to Plaintiffs’ first cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4
and eighth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
(Demurrer p. 2.) Defendants argue the causes of action fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute causes of action and are uncertain, vague, and
ambiguous. (Demurrer pp. 2-3.)
 
i.                
Violation of Civil Code
Section 1942.4
 
Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ first cause of action for violation
of Civil Code section 1942.4 fails to state a cause of action because
Plaintiffs do not allege that a public officer inspected the premises.
(Demurrer p. 6.)
 
Civil Code section 1942.4 states: 
 
A landlord of a
dwelling may not demand rent, collect rent, issue a notice of a rent increase,
or issue a three-day notice to pay rent or quit pursuant to subdivision
(2) of Section 1161 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if all of the
following conditions exist prior to the landlord's demand or notice:
 
(1)   The dwelling
substantially lacks any of the affirmative standard characteristics listed
in Section 1941.1 or violates Section
17920.10 of the Health and Safety Code, or is deemed and declared substandard as set
forth in Section 17920.3 of the Health and Safety Code because
conditions listed in that section exist to an extent that endangers the life,
limb, health, property, safety, or welfare of the public or the occupants of
the dwelling.
 
(2)   A public officer
or employee who is responsible for the enforcement of any housing law, after inspecting the premises, has notified the
landlord or the landlord's agent in writing of his or her
obligations to abate the nuisance or repair the substandard conditions.
 
(3)   The conditions
have existed and have not been abated 35 days beyond the
date of service of the notice specified in paragraph (2) and
the delay is without good cause. For purposes of this
subdivision, service shall be complete at the time of deposit in the United
States mail.
 
(4)   The conditions
were not caused by an act or omission of the tenant or lessee in violation
of Section 1929 or 1941.2.
 
Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the Subject Property
“contained inadequate and leaking plumbing.” (Complaint ¶ 13.) Civil Code section 1941.1,
subdivision (a) states that a “dwelling shall be deemed untenantable for
purposes of Section 1941 if it substantially lacks . . . [p]lumbing or gas
facilities that conformed to applicable law in effect at the time of
installation, maintained in good working order.” Thus, Plaintiffs allege facts
supporting the first element under section 1942.4. 
 
Plaintiffs also allege that “[t]he [Subject Property] had
inadequate trash disposal and removal which left the Premises unsanitary and
subject to major health hazards which requires involvement of Government Code
Enforcement” but do not allege that a public officer or employee responsible
for enforcing any housing law inspected the Subject Property and notified the
landlord or landlord’s agent of their obligation to abate the nuisance or
repair the conditions. (Complaint ¶
13.) Thus,
Plaintiffs have not alleged facts supporting the second element under section
1942.4.
 
Plaintiffs further allege that “[w]ithout good cause
Defendants failed to make repairs within thirty-five (35) days of receiving
notice during which time the substandard conditions continued to exist without
abatement” and that “Plaintiffs did not cause, create, or contribute to the
existence of the defective conditions[.]” (Complaint ¶¶ 19, 26.) Thus, Plaintiffs allege facts
supporting the third and fourth elements under section 1942.4. 
 
Because Plaintiffs have not alleged a
public officer or employee, responsible for the enforcement of housing law,
inspected the Subject Property and notified the landlord or the landlord’s
agent in writing of their obligation to abate the nuisance or repair the
conditions, this court sustains the demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ first cause of
action.
 
ii.              
Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress
 
¿“The elements of a cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress are (1) the defendant engages in extreme and
outrageous conduct with the intent to cause, or with reckless disregard for the
probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff suffers extreme
or severe emotional distress; and (3) the defendant's extreme and outrageous
conduct was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's extreme or severe
emotional distress.” (So v. Shin (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 671.)¿ “[W]hether
conduct is ‘outrageous’ is usually a question of fact.” (Id. at p. 672.)
To be outrageous, the conduct must be “so extreme as to exceed all bounds of
that usually tolerated in a civilized society.” (Huntingdon Life Sciences,
Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1259.) 
 
A tenant
may bring a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress
when the landlord knowingly, intentionally, and willfully fails to correct
defective conditions. (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1069.) In Burnett, the premises contained mold that the
respondents refused to repair, causing appellants to “inhale[] the toxic
airborne spores and fumes emitted from the mold” and causing “severe physical
injury and discomfort, and severe emotional and mental distress.” (Id. at
p. 1062.) The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings as to respondents’
intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action. (Id. at 1068-1069.)
The Court of Appeal held that the trial court erred by granting judgment on the
pleadings and rejected the argument that “the complaint’s allegations do not
meet the standard of extreme and outrageous conduct.” (Id. at p. 1069.) 
 
Plaintiffs
allege the Subject Property contained numerous defects, including a rat infestation, inadequate and leaking
plumbing, inadequate trash disposal, mold and mildew, uneven, unstable, and not
properly insulated doors and windows, walls and fixtures coming apart, holes
around windows, a pest and rodent infestation, and deteriorating interior walls.
(Complaint ¶ 13.) Plaintiffs allege Plaintiffs notified Defendants about these
issues but “Defendants failed and refused to repair any of the defective and
dangerous conditions.” (Complaint ¶ 14.) Plaintiffs further allege that
Defendants’ conduct was intentional and “rose to a level of extreme and
outrageous conduct that shocks the conscience and falls outside the bounds of
decency.” (Complaint ¶ 66.) “[W]hether conduct is ‘outrageous’ is usually a question of
fact.” (So v. Shin, supra, 212 Cal.App.4th at 672.) Like Burnett
v. Chimney Sweep, this court cannot determine that, as a matter of law, these
allegations do not constitute outrageous conduct.
 
Plaintiffs allege they lived “in a
constant fear of rats and other vermin at the [Subject Property].” (Complaint ¶
65.) However, Plaintiffs have not alleged that they have suffered “severe or
extreme emotional distress.” Moreover, Plaintiffs have not alleged that
Defendants’ conduct was the actual and proximate cause of Plaintiffs’ extreme
or severe emotional distress. Specifically, Plaintiffs
allege “each of the Defendants fictitiously named herein as a DOE is legally
responsible, negligently or in some other actionable manner, for the events and
happenings hereinafter referred to, and thereby proximately and legally caused
the injuries and damages to Plaintiff as hereinafter alleged.” (Complaint ¶ 8.)
But Plaintiffs do not specifically allege Defendants caused Plaintiffs severe
emotional distress.

 
Thus, because Plaintiffs have not alleged
sufficient facts showing they suffered severe or extreme emotional distress or
a causal connection between Defendants’ conduct and Plaintiffs’ emotional
distress, Plaintiffs’ complaint fails to state a cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress.
 
iii.            
Uncertain, Vague, or
Ambiguous
 
Defendants
argue Plaintiffs’ first and eighth causes of action fail because they are
uncertain, vague, and ambiguous. (Demurrer p. 3.) 
 
Plaintiffs’
complaint sets forth the essential facts of their case such that Defendant can
be acquainted with the nature, source, and extent of Plaintiffs’ causes of
action. (See Elder v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co., supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 858.)  Thus, Plaintiffs’
complaint is not uncertain, vague, or ambiguous.
 
IV.          
MOTION
TO STRIKE 
 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(a).)
The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 436(b).) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the
face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc. §¿437(a).)¿ 
¿ 
A motion to strike is appropriate to
attack a claim for punitive damages. (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.) “In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation
of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief
must be pled by a plaintiff.¿In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a
motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to
strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clauson
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255 (internal citations
omitted).) “Further, even though certain language pleads ultimate facts or
conclusions of law, such language when read in context with the facts alleged
as to defendants' conduct may adequately plead the evil motive requisite to
recovery of¿punitive¿damages.” (Monge v. Superior Court (1986) 176
Cal.App.3d 503, 510.) 
 
“In order to state a prima facie claim
for¿punitive¿damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the
general¿punitive¿damage¿statute,¿Civil Code section 3294.” (Turman v.
Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
“[P]roof of negligence, even gross negligence, or recklessness is insufficient
to warrant an award of punitive damages.” (Dawes v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82, 87.) To justify a punitive damages award, the
defendant must be “guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.”¿(Civ. Code., §
3294.)  
 
Malice is defined as “conduct which is intended
by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which
is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(1).) Oppression is defined as
“despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 3294(c)(2).)
Fraud is defined as “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a
material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the
defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or
otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).) 
¿ 
“Punitive¿damages¿may not
be¿pleaded¿generally.” (Today’s IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1193.) “The mere
allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an
award of¿punitive¿damages.” (Grieves v. Superior Court, supra,
157 Cal.App.3d 159 at 166.) And “conclusory characterization of defendant's
conduct as intentional, wilful and fraudulent is a patently insufficient
statement of ‘oppression, fraud, or malice, express or implied,’ within the
meaning of¿section 3294.” (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d
864, 872.) “Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or
malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves
v. Superior Court, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d at p. 166; Today’s IV,
Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, supra,
83 Cal.App.5th at p. 1193 [“In addition to the requirement that the operative
complaint set forth the elements as stated in¿section 3294, it must
include¿specific¿factual allegations showing that defendant's conduct was
oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious to support a claim
for¿punitive¿damages.”].)¿ 
 
An employer shall not be liable for
punitive damages based on the acts of an employee,  
“unless the employer had advance knowledge of the
unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of
the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct
for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression,
fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge
and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression,
fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent
of the corporation.” (Civ. Code, § 3294(b).) 
 
B.   
Discussion 
 
Defendants seek an order striking the
allegations, references to, and the prayer for punitive damages in the
complaint. (Motion to Strike pp. 1-2.) Defendants argue “the [c]omplaint is
silent as to extreme or outrageous conduct and offers nothing meeting the
threshold for pleading an award of punitive damages.” (Motion to Strike p. 7.)
Defendants further argue that “Plaintiffs’ grievances sound in mere negligence
and do not support any malice.” (Motion to Strike p. 7.)
 
i.                
Negligent
Maintenance of the Premises
 
Plaintiffs seek punitive damages for their fourth cause of
action for negligent maintenance of the premises. (Complaint ¶ 44.) “Simple negligence cannot support
an award of punitive damages.” (Jackson v. Johnson (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th
1350, 1354.) Accordingly, this court grants Defendants’ motion to strike
paragraph 44 of the complaint. 
 
ii.              
Malice,
Fraud, and Oppression 
 
A failure to complete repairs can, under some circumstances,
be sufficient to recover punitive damages. In Stoiber v. Honeychuck
(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 920, a residential tenant “pleaded sufficient facts
to support her prayer for exemplary damages” when her complaint both “alleged
that defendant had actual knowledge of defective conditions in the premises
including leaking sewage, deteriorated flooring, falling ceiling, leaking roof,
broken windows, and other unsafe and dangerous conditions” and “alleged that
defendants ‘In maintaining said nuisance,… acted with full knowledge of the
consequences thereof and the damage being caused to plaintiff, and their
conduct was willful, oppressive and malicious.’”¿In Stoiber, the tenant alleged
that she repeatedly notified the defendants of the conditions, “and that no
effort was made to repair the defects, except that on one occasion a plumber
had been sent in response to a complaint regarding the toilet.” (Id. at
pp. 912-913.) 
 
Similarly, in Penner v. Falk (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 858, 867, the Court of Appeal stated the pleadings adequately
supported a punitive damages award because “[t]he pleadings sufficiently allege
facts setting forth long existing physical conditions of the premises which
portend danger for the tenants” and “[t]he pleadings also set out that
respondents knew of those conditions for up to two years, had power to make
changes, but failed to take corrective and curative measures.” The Court stated
that “[i]f proven, these allegations would support an award of punitive
damages.” (Id.)  
 
Plaintiffs allege that on or about
November 2023, “Plaintiffs notified Defendants orally, in writing and/or in
person regarding the various issues and defects and requested that Defendants
have them repaired” but “Defendants failed and refused to repair any of the
defective and dangerous conditions.” (Complaint ¶ 14.) Plaintiffs also allege
that Plaintiffs complained to Defendants about rat and vermin at the Subject
Property, but “[d]espite Plaintiffs complaining to Defendants about these
concerns repeatedly, for months, Defendants refused and continue to refuse to
remediate.” (Complaint ¶ 65.)
 
Plaintiffs further allege that, as
“experienced owners and managers of residential property” Defendants “are aware
that absent appropriate maintenance serious habitability violations would
develop that would seriously and materially affect Plaintiffs’ tenancy.”
(Complaint ¶ 15.) 
 
Finally, Plaintiffs allege that “[i]n
maintaining the nuisance, Defendants acted with full knowledge of the
consequences thereof of the damage being caused to Plaintiffs” but “[d]espite
this knowledge, Defendants failure to bate the nuisance by repairing the
defective and dangerous conditions of the Premises or to have them repaired
within a reasonable time . . . was both oppressive and malicious within the
meaning of Civil Code Section 3294 in that they subjected Plaintiffs to
cruel and unjust hardship in willful conscious disregard of Plaintiffs’ rights
and safety[.]” (Complaint ¶ 49.)
 
Like Stoiber v. Honeychuck and Penner
v. Falk, Plaintiffs allege here that the Subject Property had various
defects, Defendants were aware of those defects but failed to take action to
remediate the defects, and, as experienced property managers, Defendants were
“aware that absent appropriate maintenance serious habitability violations
would develop that would seriously and materially affect Plaintiffs’ tenancy.”  (Complaint ¶¶ 13-15.) These allegations are
sufficient to support Plaintiffs’ punitive damages claim.
 
Accordingly, this court overrules
Defendants’ motion to strike paragraph 49 of the complaint and item 4 of
Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief. Because the court sustains the demurrer, the motion to strike relating to
paragraph 66 is moot.

 
V.             
LEAVE
TO AMEND 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to
strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure, ‘leave to amend is
routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the
defect in question.’” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) 
 
This court finds there is a reasonable
possibility Plaintiffs can cure the defects and grants Plaintiffs leave to
amend. 
 
VI.          
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, this court
sustains the demurrer. This court also grants the motion to strike as to
paragraph 44 but denies the motion to strike as to paragraphs 49 and 66 (moot)  and item 4 in Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief. Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend within thirty (30) days’
notice of this order.
