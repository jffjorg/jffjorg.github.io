And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to address issues regarding the proper plaintiff, despite opposition from the defendants. The defendants argued that the court's previous denial of an ex parte application to amend was "law of the case" and that the amendment was futile because the plaintiff knew the information to be added when the original complaint was filed. The judge rejected these arguments, stating that the previous denial was based on the defendants' opposition and lack of exigency, and that the issue of statute of limitations can be tested at a later stage of the case. The judge ordered the plaintiff to file a conforming amended complaint within 5 court days and the defendants to answer or respond within 5 court days, with the intention of proceeding efficiently.
