And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to quash the jurisdiction of the court. The defendant, an LLC organized in Nevada, argues that it has no meaningful contacts with California and therefore the court lacks jurisdiction. However, the court finds that the defendant's manager, RMD, had ostensible authority to sign the contract, despite lacking actual authority. The Operating Agreement of the defendant LLC explicitly states that third parties can rely on the manager's apparent authority to enter into contracts without inquiring further. The court concludes that the defendant failed to present evidence to challenge jurisdiction and therefore the motion is denied. The court will stay the action for 15 days, during which time the defendant can seek writ review.
