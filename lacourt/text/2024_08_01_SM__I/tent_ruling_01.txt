  Case Number:  19SMCV02145    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  I The motion for leave to amend is GRANTED.    
 
Plaintiff seeks to file an amended complaint to address
issues with regard to who is the proper plaintiff given some apparent confusion
by the defense.  The substantive
allegations have not changed, nor are there new theories of liability.  The trial is still over a year away.
 
Defendants oppose. 
They seem to contend that because the court denied an ex parte
application to amend, this is somehow law of the case.  It is not. 
The ex parte was rejected because defendants opposed it and the
court saw no exigency.  The court never
reached the merits nor did it purport to do so. 
Defendants also contend that the amendment is futile because plaintiff
knew all of the things to be added in the amended complaint when the original
complaint was filed and therefore the new plaintiffs will be time barred.  Maybe; maybe not.  But that can be better tested by demurrer or
summary judgment or trial.  This is not
the stage to do so.  (Plaintiffs disagree
that there will be any statute of limitations issue, but the court is not
reaching that question now.)
 
The fact is that this is an easy motion, and the opposition
to it should never have been filed.  It
might have been a better tactic to keep the powder (and credibility) dry.   
 
Plaintiff has 5 court days to file a conforming amended
complaint.  Defendants will have 5 court
days from filing to answer or otherwise respond.  The short time to answer or respond is
deliberate.
