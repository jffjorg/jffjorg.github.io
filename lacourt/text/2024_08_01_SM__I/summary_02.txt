Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to set aside a dismissal of a case. The plaintiff asserts that they intended to dismiss one defendant (Washington) due to a settlement, but instead dismissed everyone, including the remaining defendant (Fisher). The court finds that the dismissal was likely an honest error, rather than a deliberate decision. The court grants the motion, reinstating the case to the active docket. The court will discuss with counsel a date for a case management conference. The court also orders the plaintiff to pay any fees and costs incurred by defense counsel as a result of the erroneous dismissal, but notes that no such fees or costs have been identified.
