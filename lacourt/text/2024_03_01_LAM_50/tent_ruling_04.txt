[1]The County asserts
that “[a]s to the County, Plaintiff asserts the Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth
through Tenth Causes of Action only.” (Demurrer at p. 12:1-2.) The County cites
to Plaintiff’s opposition to the County’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s Third
Amended Complaint filed in the Federal Action. (County’s RJN, ¶ 3, Ex. C.) This
opposition states, inter alia, that “Causes of Action: 3, 5, 6-10 Belong
to both the City and County of Los Angeles,” and that “Causes of Action: 3, 5,
23-25. Belong to the County of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County Coroner.” (County’s
RJN, ¶ 3, Ex. C, p. 93.) Plaintiff does not oppose the instant demurrer and
thus does not dispute that only the third, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, and
tenth causes of action of the TAC are asserted against the County. 


[2]As set forth
above, the ninth cause of action of
the TAC is untitled, but alleges that “Plaintiff, as DECEDENT’S successor in
interest, seek [sic] all damages accruing to DECEDENT in a survival action,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34.”
(TAC, ¶ 425.)


[3]The City generally
contends that “Plaintiff’s claims arise from an alleged failure to conduct a
homicide investigation, and as such, they…should be dismissed…” (Demurrer at p.
7:16-18.) However, the City does not provide any argument as to how the fifteenth cause of action
“arise[s] from an alleged failure to conduct a homicide investigation,” to the
extent that is what the City contends.
