And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the County and City of Los Angeles, asserting that only certain causes of action in the Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint (TAC) are applicable. The County cites to the Plaintiff's opposition to a motion to dismiss in a related federal action, which states that certain causes of action belong to both the City and County of Los Angeles. The Plaintiff does not oppose the instant demurrer, and therefore does not dispute the applicability of only the third, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action against the County. The ninth cause of action is untitled, but alleges a survival action under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34. The City generally contends that the Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed, but does not provide any argument as to how the fifteenth cause of action arises from an alleged failure to conduct a homicide investigation. The court will consider these issues further at the upcoming hearing.
