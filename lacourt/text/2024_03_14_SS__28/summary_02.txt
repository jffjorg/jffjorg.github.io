And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the petition for expedited approval of the minor's compromise without prejudice. The petition failed to provide a complete and verified petition for approval of the settlement, and did not disclose all information relevant to the reasonableness of the compromise. Specifically, the petition did not provide a copy of the final Medi-Cal demand letter or letter agreement, and did not provide evidence to support the reduction in medical expenses. Additionally, the petition did not provide a breakdown of the costs or evidence supporting the cost request. The judge orders the petitioner to give notice of the ruling and to file proof of service of the ruling with the court within five days.
