 Case Number:  21STCV12888    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  April 5, 2021, Plaintiffs Lorette Benson (“Plaintiff”) and Andrew Benson  filed this action against Defendants Darren Danes (“Danes”), Stafford  Environmental Services, Inc. (“Stafford”), and Does 1-100 for negligence.  On  February 15, 2023, Danes and Stafford ("Defendants") filed an answer.  On  August 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney form  substituting herself as a self-represented litigant in place of her former  attorneys.  On  February 13, 2024, Defendants filed a motion titled in  part, “Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff, Lorette Benson to (1) Answer  Request for Admissions, Set No. One . . . .”   Defendants also requested sanctions.   The motion was set for hearing on March 14, 2024.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition.  Trial  is currently scheduled for August 14, 2024.  LEGAL STANDARD             Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:  “If a party to whom requests for admission are  directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission  are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on  privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing  with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this  waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are  satisfied:   “(1) The party has subsequently served a response  that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and  2033.230.   “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely  response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.   “(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the  truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as  for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010).   “(c) The court shall make this order, unless it  finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has  served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests  for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is  mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to  serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”   (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2033.280.)   DISCUSSION   Defendants’  motion is titled in part, “Motion for Order Compelling  Plaintiff, Lorette Benson to (1) Answer Request for Admissions, Set No. One . .  . .”  While the motion’s title asks  for an order compelling a response, the motion’s text initially asks for “an  order that the truth of each matter specified in the Requests for Admission  served on Plaintiff, Lorette Benson, on November 6, 2023, be deemed admitted  and conclusively established for all purposes in this action.”  (Motion p. 2.)  Yet the motion’s conclusion again “requests  that the Court order Plaintiff to provide responses to Defendants’ Request for  Admission, Set One, fully, verified and without objections.”  (Motion p. 4.)  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 “ensures that litigants receive formal  notice of the need to prepare responses and some additional time to accomplish  that task before the devastating effects of failing to respond to [requests for  admission] are visited upon them.”  (L.  Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial  (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1374.2, p. 8G-25.)  In the Court's tentative ruling, the Court expressed concern that, because of the motion’s conflicting requests for relief, Plaintiff may  not have realized that Defendants were apparently seeking an order that would devastate her  case by deeming admitted the matters specified in Defendants’ requests for  admission.  At the hearing, however, Plaintiff stated that she had served responses to the requests for admission before the hearing.  Defendants' counsel confirmed receipt of Plaintiff's responses, but argued the Court should nonetheless grant the motion because Plaintiff's responses included objections and therefore did not substantially comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.    The Court finds that, for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), objections to requests for admission do not prevent the responses from substantially complying with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.  Therefore, the Court denies the motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission. Nonetheless, the Court is required to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), on a party "whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated [the] motion."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  The Court imposes sanctions of $310.00 on Plaintiff based on one hour of attorney time at a rate of $250.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  CONCLUSION            The Court DENIES the motion titled in part “Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff, Lorette Benson to (1) Answer Request for Admissions, Set No. One . . . .” filed by Defendants  Darren Danes and Stafford Environmental Services, Inc. on February 13, 2024. The Court GRANTS the request for sanctions of Defendants Darren Danes and Stafford Environmental Services, Inc. and orders Plaintiff Lorette Benson to pay Defendants Darren Danes and Stafford Environmental Services, Inc. $310.00 by April 12, 2024. Moving  parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
