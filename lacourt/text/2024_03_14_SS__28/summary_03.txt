And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion filed by Defendants Darren Danes and Stafford Environmental Services, Inc. to compel Plaintiff Lorette Benson to respond to requests for admission and to impose sanctions. The motion was filed after Plaintiff failed to serve a timely response to the requests for admission. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's subsequent responses to the requests for admission, although including objections, substantially comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220. The Judge denies the motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission. However, the Judge imposes sanctions of $310.00 on Plaintiff, which consists of one hour of attorney time at a rate of $250.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee. The Judge orders Plaintiff to pay the sanctions by April 12, 2024.
