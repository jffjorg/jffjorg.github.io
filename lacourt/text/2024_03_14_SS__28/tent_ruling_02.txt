 Case Number:  21STCV04014    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On February
2, 2021, Plaintiff Jmere Bowie (“Plaintiff”), a minor, by and through his guardian
ad litem Tyrana Paker [sic], filed this action against Defendants Los Angeles Unified
School District (“District”), City of Gardena (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”),
and Does 1-50 for premises liability. 
On
May 21, 2021, the County filed an answer. 
On June 10, 2021, the District filed an answer. 
On
July 26, 2021, the Court dismissed the City and the County without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
May 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
January 24, 2024, Petitioner Tyrana Parker (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for
expedited approval of a minor’s compromise. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s pending claims. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
          The petition contains the following information about the
proposed settlement: 
Gross
settlement amount: $47,500.00 Total
medical expenses incurred: $9,863.48 Total
non-medical expenses: $14,425.97 Attorney’s
fees: $11,875.00 Amount
to be paid or reimbursed from settlement proceeds: $293.03 Net
settlement amount: $20,906.00 
Petitioner
has not provided a copy of the final Medi-Cal demand letter or letter agreement
as required by Section 13c(2) of the petition. 
The May 9, 2023 letter from the Department of Health Care Services attached
to the petition is not the final Medi-Cal demand letter or letter agreement and
does not state the amount of benefits provided or the amount of the Medi-Cal
lien. 
Section
13a(3) of the petition states that the total medical expenses incurred were
reduced by $9,570.45 as the result of negotiated, statutory, or contractual
reductions.  However, the petition does
not provide evidence to support this assertion. 
The only evidence of a reduction in medical expenses is a document from
Renaissance Imaging Medical Associates Inc. which shows a $73.73 adjustment to
a bill for $77.00.
 Section 17d of the petition requests that $14,425.97 in costs be paid out of the settlement proceeds.  However, the petition contains no breakdown of those costs or evidence supporting the cost request.
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for expedited approval of Plaintiff
Jmere Bowie’s action filed by Petitioner Tyrana Parker on January 24, 2024. 
          Petitioner is ordered to give notice of the ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of the ruling with the Court within
five days.
