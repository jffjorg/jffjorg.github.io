 Case Number:  21STCV16313    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 30, 2021, Plaintiff Pacis Goffney
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (“Defendant”) and Does 1-3 for negligence. 
On
January 6, 2023, Defendant filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Roes 1-25 for total indemnity, equitable indemnity on a
comparative fault basis, declaratory relief, and motor vehicle negligence. 
On
November 17, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff’s
responses to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents and
ordered Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses without
objections and pay Defendant $750.00 in sanctions by December 18, 2023. 
On
January 10, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint for
failure to comply with the Court’s November 17, 2023 order.  The motion was set to be heard on March 14,
2024.  Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition. 
The
trial is currently set for May 21, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendant
asks the Court to issue terminating sanctions and dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part: 
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: 
                                                            *
* *
 “(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by
one of the following orders: 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
“(2) An order staying further proceedings by that
party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
“(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of
the action, of that party. 
“(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against
that party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (d); see Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories]; Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].) 
A
violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
A
terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with
caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)   
DISCUSSION 
Defendant
asks the Court to impose terminating sanctions on Plaintiff and dismiss the
complaint because Plaintiff has not complied with the Court’s November 17, 2023
order.  However, Defendant has not shown a
history of abuse or willful persistence in disobeying court orders.  Therefore, terminating sanctions are not
warranted. 
Defendant
has not requested any alternative relief. 
The
Court denies the motion without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff Pacis Goffney’s
complaint. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file a proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
