And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Hacienda La Puente Unified School District, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Rocio Gonzalez, on behalf of the estate of her son, Diego Pena Gonzalez, who died by suicide in June 2023. The complaint alleges wrongful death, negligent hiring, supervision, retention, and training, and survival. The demurrer argues that the defendant is immune from liability under Education Code section 44808 because the suicide did not occur on campus or under the supervision of school staff.

The judge has sustained the demurrer in part, overruling it in part. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to the first cause of action for wrongful death, which requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant's negligence caused the death. The demurrer is also sustained as to the second cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision, retention, and training, because all of the alleged damages arise from the plaintiff's death. However, the demurrer is overruled as to the third cause of action for survival, which seeks to recover general damages for all injuries caused to the plaintiff before his death. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the demurrer.
