Summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a hearing date of October 10, 2024, regarding a breach of contract action between W.H. Contractors, Inc. (W.H. Contractors) and Blooming Box, LLC. Blooming Box moves for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that W.H. Contractors' entire action is barred by Business and Professions Code section 7031. The court denies this motion, finding that W.H. Contractors' discovery responses do not contradict the Complaint's allegation that W.H. Contractors was a licensed contractor at all times relevant.

Blooming Box also moves for summary judgment on their Cross-Complaint, alleging that W.H. Contractors lacked a contractor license prior to July 12, 2021. The court denies this motion, finding that Blooming Box failed to establish that W.H. Contractors lacked a contractor license prior to July 12, 2021, and that the possibility of the second inference (that W.H. Contractors was licensed beforehand and merely obtained a new license) prevents Blooming Box from establishing W.H. Contractors lacked a contractor license prior to July 12, 2021.
