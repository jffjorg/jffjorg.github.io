And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case involves a dispute over a construction contract between the plaintiff, Hershel Mangoli, and the defendants, Farshid Mossazadeh and Nahal Moossazadeh. The plaintiff had completed over 90% of the scope of work, but the defendants failed to pay outstanding invoices, leading to a Mechanics' Lien being filed. The case was dismissed due to the plaintiff's failure to appear for trial, but the plaintiff claims that the failure to appear was due to a mistake by their attorney, who was told by the courtroom clerk that the trial date had been continued to July 19, 2024. The judge has found that the plaintiff's attorney's mistake was excusable and that setting aside the dismissal would not cause any unfair prejudice to the defendants. The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion and reinstated the case, with a new trial date set for September 30, 2024.
