And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants, Safelystay, Inc. and On Demand Insurance Agency, LLC, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Sara Catherine Finley. The plaintiff is seeking to sue the defendants for negligence and breach of contract.

The court has found that the plaintiff cannot sue the defendants directly, as there are no recognized exceptions to the general rule that an injured party cannot join an insurer as a party-defendant in the underlying action against the insured/tortfeasor. The court has therefore sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for breach of contract against the defendants.

The court has also found that the plaintiff cannot bring a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against the defendants, as there is no contractual underpinning between the parties. The court has therefore sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against the defendants.

The court has not granted leave to amend the complaint, as the plaintiff has not specified how she could amend her complaint to fall within any recognized exceptions for suing an insurer directly. The court's ruling is final and binding unless one of the parties files a timely appeal.
