And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to seal a four-page complaint alleging battery against him. The defendant argued that the complaint is entirely false and that he will be prejudiced if it is available to the public. The judge found that the defendant's right to privacy is not an overriding interest that justifies sealing the complaint, as the allegations are not embarrassing or defamatory. The judge also found that the defendant did not meet the requirements for bringing a motion to strike the complaint, which must be filed with a declaration detailing the meet and confer efforts. The judge denied the motion to strike as well.
