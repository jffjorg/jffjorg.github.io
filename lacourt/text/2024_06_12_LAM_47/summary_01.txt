And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overturned in its entirety. The defendants had argued that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a claim for breach of contract, but they did not specify which of them is raising each argument with respect to any given cause of action. Additionally, they failed to address the issue of uncertainty in their papers. The judge concludes that the defendants have wholly failed to demonstrate that the complaint is deficient on the grounds asserted in their demurrer. As a result, the demurrer is overruled in its entirety.
