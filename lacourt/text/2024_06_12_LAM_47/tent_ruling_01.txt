CASE:                         Claudia Yareli Paredon Nieto v. The Haas
Building, et al. 
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV21020            
 
DEMURRER
TO COMPLAINT

 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant Broadway Exchange Building, L.P., Boris
Mayzels, and Jose Ortega
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Claudia
Nieto
 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action that was filed on August 31,
2023. Plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to extensive sexual harassment,
assault, and battery, and was wrongfully terminated. 
 
Defendants Broadway Exchange
Building, L.P., Boris Mayzels, and Jose Ortega demur to the Complaint in its
entirety. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants Broadway Exchange
Building, L.P., Boris Mayzels, and Jose Ortega demur to the Complaint in its
entirety.  Although the demurrer purports
to challenge each cause of action, the only claimed basis for those challenges
are that (1) each cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute
a claim for breach of contract, and (2) uncertainty. No cause of action
for breach of contract is asserted in the Complaint, and, further, Defendants’
arguments in the memorandum of points and authorities challenging Plaintiff’s
claims on other grounds are wholly improper because they are not asserted in
the demurrer itself. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1320(a).) Moreover, the moving
Defendants do not specify which of them is raising each argument with respect
to any given cause of action. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1320(e).) Defendants
also entirely neglect the issue of uncertainty in their papers despite raising
uncertainty as a basis for the demurrer. Defendants have thus wholly failed to
demonstrate that the Complaint is deficient on the grounds asserted in their
demurrer. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrer
to the Complaint is OVERRULED in its entirety.
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
