Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Sysco Los Angeles, Inc.’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from a credit agreement. In November
2016, Plaintiff Sysco Los Angeles, Inc. (Sysco) entered into a written credit
agreement with Defendant Byte to Bite (California) LLC (Byte to Bite). In
August 2023, Sysco alleges Byte to Bite breached the agreement by failing to
make invoiced payments.
On March
13, 2024, Sysco filed a complaint against Byte to Bite and Does 1-100, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) breach of written contract, (2) open book
account, and (3) goods sold and delivered. On March 21, 2024, Sysco’s process
server served Byte to Bite with substitute service in Irvine.
On May
1, 2024, the court entered default against Byte to Bite after Byte to Bite
failed to file a timely answer. On July 31, 2024, Sysco submitted the present
application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for August 14, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Sysco
seeks default judgment against Byte to Bite in the total amount of $421,120.18,
including $385,278.64 in damages, $29,574.00 in interest, $5,742.00 in attorney
fees, and $525.54 in costs. Because the court finds Sysco has submitted
sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS Sysco’s application for default
judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Sysco’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
