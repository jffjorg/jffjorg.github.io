And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Vincent Reyes Vargas' motion to strike punitive damages from Jewell Victoria Ramirez's complaint. The motion was filed in response to Ramirez's allegations that Reyes Vargas was under the influence of alcohol when he was involved in a motor vehicle collision with Ramirez on Interstate 10 in West Covina in December 2021. Reyes Vargas argued that the Complaint's allegations of intoxication were insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. However, the judge found that the Complaint adequately established that Reyes Vargas consciously disregarded the risk of subjecting others to significant bodily injury by operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. As a result, the judge denied Reyes Vargas' motion to strike punitive damages from the Complaint.
