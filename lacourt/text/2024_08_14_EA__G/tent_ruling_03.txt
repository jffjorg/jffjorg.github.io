 Case Number:  24PSCV00820    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff US Air Conditioning Distributors LLC’s Application
for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff US Air Conditioning Distributors LLC’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED in the
reduced amount of $62,380.63
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from a credit agreement. In July 2007,
Plaintiff US Air Conditioning Distributors LLC (US Air Conditioning) entered
into a credit account agreement with Defendant Troy Travis Myrick, doing
business as Precision Comfort Heating and Air, in which US Air Conditioning
agreed to lend credit to Myrick. Subsequently, US Air Conditioning alleges
Myrick breached the agreement by failing to pay for goods or services in the
amount of $56,629.96.
On March
15, 2024, US Air Conditioning filed a complaint against Myrick and Does 1-100, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) breach of written agreement, (2) goods sold
and delivered, (3) reasonable value, (4) indebtedness, and (5) open book
account. On March 27, 2024, US Air Conditioning’s process server served Myrick
with substitute service in Paso Robles.
On May
21, 2024, the court entered default against Myrick after Myrick failed to file
a timely answer. On June 4, 2024, US Air Conditioning submitted the present
application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for August 14, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
US
Air Conditioning seeks default judgment against Myrick in the total amount of $63,857.96,
including $56,629.96 in damages, $4,440.41 in interest, $2,022.59 in attorney
fees, and $765.00 in costs. Because the court finds Myrick has submitted
sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS Myrick’s application for default
judgment but reduces the total amount awarded to $62,380.63 for the following
reasons.
First,
while US Air Conditioning requests reasonable attorney fees be awarded pursuant
to Civil Code section 1717.5, the court finds US Air Conditioning’s request for
$2,022.59 in attorney fees exceeds the amount allowed by statute. Although US
Air Conditioning based this request on the court’s attorney fee schedule
pursuant to Local Rule 3.214, Civil Code section 1717.5, subdivision (b) only
allows use of this schedule if the resulting fees are less than the maximum
amount allowed by Civil Code section 1717.5. This provision provides reasonable
attorney fees in open book account actions “shall not exceed the lesser of: (1)
nine hundred sixty dollars ($960) for book accounts based upon an obligation
owing by a natural person for goods, moneys, or services which were primarily
for personal, family, or household purposes; and one thousand two hundred
dollars ($1,200) for all other book accounts to which this section applies; or
(2) 25 percent of the principal obligation owing under the contract.” (Civ.
Code, § 1717.5, subd. (a).) Because $1,200 is the lesser amount than twenty-five
percent of $56,629.96, US Air Conditioning may not obtain fees in excess of
this amount. Thus, the court reduces the award of attorney fees to $1,200.00.
Second,
while US Air Conditioning requests interest calculated at eighteen percent (18%)
per year, the Complaint makes contradictory requests for rates of ten percent (10%)
and eighteen percent (18%). (Complaint, ¶ 9, 15, 18, 20, 23.) Furthermore, US
Air Conditioning failed to point to any legal authority or contractual
provision that allows it to exceed the ten percent (10%) annual rate established
in Civil Code section 3289, subdivision (b). Accordingly, the court calculates
interest at the default annual rate of ten percent (10%) pursuant to Civil Code
section 3289, subdivision (b) for a total of $3,785.67 (10% of $56,629.96
divided by 365 = $15.5150575342 per diem multiplied by 244 days (12/14/2023 –
8/14/2024)).
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, US Air Conditioning’s application for
default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $62,380.63.
