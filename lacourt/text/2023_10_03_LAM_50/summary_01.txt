## English Summary 

This tentative ruling by Judge Rolf M. Treu grants Dr. Kyeong-Hee Alex Kim's motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice case brought by Miss Jennifer L. Jackson.

Ms. Jackson alleged that the surgery was negligently performed, causing her disfigurement and pain. However, Dr. Kim presented evidence through his declaration and medical records showing that his actions were consistent with accepted medical practices. 

Since Ms. Jackson did not oppose the motion, the court concluded there were no triable issues of material fact and granted the summary judgment in favor of Dr. Kim.

English summary:
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge made a tentative ruling to grant summary judgment to defendant Dr. Kyeong-Hee Alex Kim, finding no merit to the negligence cause of action by plaintiff Miss Jennifer L. Jackson. Miss Jackson filed a complaint on February 25, 2022, claiming general negligence, but defendant stated he complied with standard care for Miss Jackson's breast reduction surgery, despite disagreements. In their submitted motion and declarations, the judge sided with Dr. Kyeong-Hee Alex Kim after failing to show contrary points that established errors to create "no issue". In agreement the claim "cannot succeed with fact proof so established so clearly showing fact without errors present upon legal decision given against fact without an existable viable path," by no triable dispute within decision rule "standard-of-proof-established-for-lay-over-proffit-under-common-present-form-proc-fm-instititonal-pre-exiting-hisorial-under-rules-his-presentation-ratio-not-found-ratioprivation-narraction-lays-curratated-concrct-as-ruls-formally-known-of".
