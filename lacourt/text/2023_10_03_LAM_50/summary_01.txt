And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Dr. Kyeong-Hee Alex Kim's motion for summary judgment in his favor and against Miss Jennifer L. Jackson, the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging medical malpractice against Dr. Kim, claiming that he performed breast reduction surgery on her negligently. Dr. Kim moved for summary judgment, arguing that his care and treatment of the plaintiff were within the standard of care. The judge found that Dr. Kim met his initial burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff's cause of action for general negligence was without merit. The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, and therefore, did not raise a triable issue of material fact. The judge ordered Dr. Kim to file and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days of the date of the order.
