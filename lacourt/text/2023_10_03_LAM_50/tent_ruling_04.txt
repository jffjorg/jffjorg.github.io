TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Boss Hoss of California, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) appears to request entry of default
judgment against Defendant Angelia Dimattia (“Defendant”) in the total amount
of $29,422.11, comprising $19,422.11 in damages
and $10,000.00 in punitive damages. 
The Court notes several
defects with the submitted default judgment package. 
First, Plaintiff did not file a Request for
Court Judgment (Form CIV-100). “A party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory¿Request for Entry of Default (Application to
Enter Default)¿(form CIV-100)…” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a).)
Second,
Item
5(a) of the proposed judgment (Form JUD-100) indicates that judgment is for plaintiff
“Boss Hoss of California.” However, the plaintiff named in this action is Boss
Hoss of California, Inc. (Underline added.) 
Third,
Plaintiff submits the Declaration of Victor Vert in support of the request. It
is unclear from the declaration who Mr. Vert is. Mr. Vert does not indicate in
the declaration whether he is an employee of Plaintiff. The Court thus does not
find that Mr. Vert has laid an adequate foundation for introducing the evidence
set forth in his declaration.  
Fourth,
Plaintiff seeks $10,000.00 in punitive damages. In the Complaint, Plaintiff
alleges, inter alia, that “[t]he acts of Defendants, and each of them, were willful, wanton,
malicious and oppressive, and justify the
awarding of punitive damages.” (Compl., ¶ 20.) In Wiley v. Rhodes (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1470, 1474, the Court of Appeal
found that “[a] general allegation of entitlement to punitive damages is not
reasonably calculated to apprise the defendant of potential financial liability
for punitive damages if judgment is taken by default.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.115, subdivision (f),
“[t]he plaintiff shall serve the statement upon the defendant pursuant to this
section before a default may be taken, if the motion for default judgment
includes a request for punitive damages.” It does not appear that
Plaintiff has served any statement pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.115. 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. Plaintiff to resubmit the default judgment package.
