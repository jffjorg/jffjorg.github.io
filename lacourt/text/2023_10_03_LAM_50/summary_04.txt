And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a response to Plaintiff Boss Hoss of California, Inc.'s request for default judgment against Defendant Angelia Dimattia and others. The request is for a total of $29,422.11, comprising $19,422.11 in damages and $10,000.00 in punitive damages. However, the Court has identified several defects with the submitted default judgment package, including the lack of a Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100), an incorrect name on Item 5(a) of the proposed judgment, and an unclear declaration from Victor Vert. Additionally, the Plaintiff has not served a statement as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 425.115 before seeking punitive damages. Therefore, the Court denies the request for default judgment without prejudice and orders the Plaintiff to resubmit the default judgment package.
