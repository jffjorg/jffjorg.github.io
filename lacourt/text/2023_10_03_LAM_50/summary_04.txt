* Inconsistency in naming the Plaintiff in the proposed judgment.
* Lack of clarity regarding Victor Vert's role and connection to Plaintiff.
* Insufficient notice to Defendant regarding the request for punitive damages.

The Judge therefore denies the request without prejudice, allowing Plaintiff to resubmit the default judgment package with corrections.

Here's an English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:
The Judge has tentatively denied the Plaintiff's (Boss Hoss of California, Inc.) request for default judgment against the Defendant (Angelia Dimattia) due to several defects in the submitted default judgment package. The Plaintiff had sought a default judgment of $29,422.11, consisting of $19,422.11 in damages and $10,000.00 in punitive damages. However, the Court noted that the Plaintiff did not file a Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100) as required, and the proposed judgment listed the wrong plaintiff name. Additionally, the Declaration of Victor Vert submitted in support of the request did not provide adequate foundation for introducing the evidence, and the Plaintiff failed to serve a statement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.115 regarding the request for punitive damages. As a result, the Court denies the Plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice and instructs the Plaintiff to resubmit the default judgment package.
