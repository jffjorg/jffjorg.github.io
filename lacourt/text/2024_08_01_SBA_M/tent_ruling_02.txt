1.      The Boeing Company’s Demurrer to Complaint 

COURT RULING
 
The Boeing Company’s Demurrer to Complaint is
sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Background 
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on January 23, 2024.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff and Defendants entered into
employment contract(s). Plaintiff performed the contract(s) but Defendants
breached the contract(s). Plaintiff alleged causes of action for Breach of
Contract and Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
against Defendants Boeing Company and SearchPros Staffing LLC.
 
            Meet and Confer
 
             Defendant set forth
a meet and confer declaration in compliance with CCP § 430.41. (Declaration of Margaret
C. Castaneda, ¶¶ 3-5.)
 
            Demurrer 
 
            A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises
only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the
sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the
properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred
from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.)  Because
a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the plaintiff must show
that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish every element of each
cause of action.  (Rakestraw v.
California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the
demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Defendant demurs to
the first and second causes of action for failure to state sufficient facts and
uncertainty. Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
First Cause of
Action for Breach of Contract
 
Defendant’s demurrer
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiff fails to state sufficient
to constitute a cause of action and the cause of action is uncertain. 
 
“The elements of a
cause of action for breach of contract are: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the
resulting damages to plaintiff.” Coles v. Glaser (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th
384, 391 (internal quotations omitted).
 
Plaintiff alleges the
existence of a written contract and attached it as Exhibit A. However,
Plaintiff has insufficiently alleged the first element of the cause of action –
the existence of a contract. Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the
complaint are given precedence over inconsistent allegations in the complaint. Moran
v. Prime Healthcare Mgmt., Inc. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1131, 1145-46. Exhibit A is an email which simply appears to
acknowledge Plaintiff’s employment with co-Defendant SearchPros Staffing.  Further, the email itself does not even
establish the elements of a contract with SearchPros Staffing but instead sets
forth certain requirements and aspects of the employment.
In addition, Plaintiff alleges
that the terms of the contract were that he was “guaranteed” employment for 12
months. Civ. Code, § 1624 states: “(a) The following contracts are invalid,
unless they, or some note or memorandum thereof, are in writing and subscribed
by the party to be charged or by the party's agent: (1) An agreement that by
its terms is not to be performed within a year from the making thereof.”  Plaintiff failed to attach a written contract
subscribed by the party to be charged which memorializes this purported
agreement which according to Plaintiff could not be fully performed within one
year.
Second Cause of Action for
Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing    
 
Defendant’s demurrer to the second
cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
“Every contract contains an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing providing that no party to the
contract will do anything that would deprive another party of the benefits of
the contract. The implied covenant protects the reasonable expectations of the
contracting parties based on their mutual promises. The scope of conduct
prohibited by the implied covenant depends on the purposes and express terms of
the contract. Although breach of the implied covenant often is pleaded as a
separate count, a breach of the implied covenant is necessarily a breach of
contract.” Digerati Holdings, LLC v.
Young Money Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873, 885 (internal
citations omitted). A breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing
does not give rise to a cause of action separate from a cause of action for
breach of the contract containing the covenant. Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000)
24 Cal.4th 317, 327 (stating that “where breach of an actual term is alleged, a
separate implied covenant claim, based on the same breach, is superfluous.”)
 
The second cause of action
fails with the first cause of action. 
 
Defendant’s Demurrer to
Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
