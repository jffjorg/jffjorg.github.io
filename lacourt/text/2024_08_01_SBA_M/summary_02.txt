```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that The Boeing Company's demurrer to the complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The judge found that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. Specifically, the judge found that the complaint lacks sufficient allegations of a contract and fails to establish the elements of a cause of action for breach of contract. Additionally, the judge found that the second cause of action, for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, is also uncertain and fails to state a cause of action separate from the breach of contract cause of action. The judge has ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
