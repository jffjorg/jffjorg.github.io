I.               
BACKGROUND
 
On
or about February 24, 2020, Defendant Nimrod Atinger (“Atinger”) and Plaintiff
Financial Services Vehicle Trust by and through its servicer, BMW Financial
Services NA, LLC as administered by its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Financial
Services Division (“Plaintiff”) entered a Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement (the
“Lease Agreement”) for the use of a 2020 Rolls Royce Dawn (the “Vehicle”).
(Complaint ¶¶ 1-2, 5.) Atinger defaulted on the Lease Agreement by failing to
make the payment due and by subleasing the Vehicle. (Complaint ¶ 7.) On August
26, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Atinger and Does 1 through 20
alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; and (2) common count.
 
On
October 12, 2021, Atinger filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants
Roadstarr Motor Sports, Inc. and Roes 1 through 30, alleging causes of action
for: (1) implied equitable indemnity; and (2) negligence.
 
On
May 6, 2022, Atinger filed an amended cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants
Roadstarr Motor Sports, Inc., Hussein Iddrissu (“Iddrissu”), and Roes 1 through
30 (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”), alleging causes of action for: (1)
implied equitable indemnity; and (2) negligence.
 
The
amended cross-complaint alleged that, on or about mid-September 2020, Atinger
transferred possession of the Vehicle to Cross-Defendants to sell or lease the
vehicle on Atinger’s behalf. (Amended Cross-Complaint ¶ 8.) On or about
September 26, 2020, Cross-Defendants allowed a customer to test drive the
Vehicle without supervision. (Amended Cross-Complaint ¶ 9.) The customer did
not return the Vehicle. (Amended Cross-Complaint ¶ 9.)
 
On
June 25, 2024, Atinger, Iddrissu, and Farmers Insurance Exchange (“Farmers”)
executed a settlement agreement (the “Agreement”). (Ex. A.)
 
On
October 24, 2024, Atinger filed a motion to enforce a settlement between
Atinger and Iddrissu. On November 21, 2024, this court denied that motion,
without prejudice. (11/21/24 Minute Order p. 5.)
 
On
November 25, 2024, Atinger filed a second motion to enforce the settlement (the
“Motion”). (Atinger filed two motions to
enforce settlement with the court on 11/25/24. They appear to be identical.)
 No opposition has been
filed.
 
II.            
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6, subdivision (a) states: 
 
If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
the parties to the settlement agreement or their counsel stipulate in writing
or orally before the court, the court may dismiss the case as to the settling
parties without prejudice and retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce
the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
“[A] writing is signed by
a party if it is signed by any of the following: (1) The party. [or] (2) An
attorney who represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6(b).)
 
 “[A] judge hearing a section 664.6 motion may
receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter the terms of a settlement
agreement as a judgment,” but may not “create the material terms of a
settlement.” (Weddington Products, Inc., v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th
793, 810.) “Stipulated judgments are interpreted according to contract
principles.” (Estate of Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.)
 
“A contract must
be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as
it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and
lawful.” (Civ. Code, § 1636.) “To interpret a contract, [the court] look[s] to
its language (§ 1638) and ascertain[s] the intent of the parties, if possible,
based solely on the contract's written provisions (§ 1639).” (Hewlett-Packard
Co. v. Oracle Corp. (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 506, 530–31.)
 
“A
‘condition precedent is either an act of a party that must be performed or an
uncertain event that must happen before the contractual right accrues or the
contractual duty arises.’” (Estate of Jones, supra, 82 Cal.App.5th at p.
953.) “Conditions precedent may be created either expressly – by words such as
‘subject to’ or ‘conditioned upon’ – or impliedly.” (Id.) “They are
generally disfavored and are strictly construed against a party arguing the
agreement imposes one.” (Id.) “Courts will not interpret a provision as
a condition precedent absent clear, unambiguous language requiring that
construction.” (Id.)
III.          
DISCUSSION

 
Atinger
seeks an order entering judgment pursuant to the Agreement. (Motion p. 3.)
Atinger also seeks $2,000.00 in attorneys’ fees and interest at a rate of 10%
per annum. (Motion pp. 3-4.) 
 
The
Agreement states:
 
(i)             
Farmers will deliver a check in the amount of
$53,500.00 to Atinger’s attorney, Raviv Netzah, of Netzah & Shem-Tov, Inc.,
and payable to the ‘Netzah & Sham-Tov, Inc.’s Client Trust Account.’ Raviv
Netzah will then immediately deposit said payment into the Netzah and Shem-Tov,
Inc.’s Client Trust Account and hold said sums in trust for the benefit of BMW
FS.
 
(ii)           
Iddrissu will deliver a check in the amount of
$38,000.00 to Atinger’s attorney, Raviv Netzah, of Netzah & Shem-Tov, Inc.,
and payable to the ‘Netzah & Shem-Tov, Inc.’s Client Trust Account.
 
(iii)         
The foregoing Settlement Payments shall be delivered to
Raviv Netzah, Netzah & Shem-Tov, Inc., located at 15260 Ventura Blvd. Suite
1850 Sherman Oaks, CA 91403, within 5 court days of the occurrence of all the
following: (1) the complete execution of this Agreement by all parties; (2)
notification that the BMW FS Settlement has been fully executed; and (3)
notification of entry of the court order as set forth in the Stipulation &
Order.
 
(iv)          
Immediately upon receipt of the Settlement Payment(s),
Raviv Netzah will deposit said payment(s) into the Netzah & Shem-Tov,
Inc.’s Client Trust Account and hold said sums in trust for the benefit of BMW
FS and forward said funds to BMW FS according to the terms of the BMW FS
Settlement and Stipulation & Order.
 
(Ex.
A pp. 2-3.)
Thus, as expressed by the
Agreement, Iddrissu’s obligation to pay Atinger was conditioned upon: “(1) the
complete execution of this Agreement by all parties; (2) notification that the
BMW FS Settlement has been fully executed; and (3) notification of entry of the
court order as set forth in the Stipulation & Order.” (Ex. A p. 2.)
 
The
submitted Agreement is signed by Atinger, Iddrissu, Farmers, and Iddrissu as an
authorized representative of Roadstarr Motor Sports, Inc. (Ex. A pp. 6-9.) Thus,
Atinger submits evidence the Agreement was executed by all parties.
 
Atinger’s
counsel submits a declaration stating: 
 
On August 21, 2024, Rebecca Caley,
counsel for BMW, filed and served a declaration on all parties, including
Cross-Defendant’s counsel and me. In Ms. Caley’s declaration, she declared:
“All parties to the Complaint and FAXC entered into settlement agreements to
fully satisfy the Judgment and FAXC. Both Settlement Agreements have been fully
executed.” Cross-Defendant’s counsel is listed on the Proof of Service attached
to the declaration, which evidences that Cross-Defendant was put on notice of
the execution of the settlement agreements through paragraph six of Ms. Caley’s
declaration.
 
(Netzah
Declaration ¶ 4.) Caley’s declaration is attached to the Motion as an exhibit.
(See Ex. C.) The proof of service shows that Iddrissu’s counsel, Bryan M.
Thomas, was served with the declaration on August 21, 2024. (Ex. C pdf p. 41.) Thus,
Atinger submits evidence that Iddrissu receive notification that the BMW FS
Settlement was fully executed.
 
Finally,
Atinger submits as an exhibit an email thread showing that Iddrissu “was
notified that the required Stipulation and Order was entered on July 2,
2024[.]” (Motion p. 6; Netzah Declaration ¶ 6; Ex. E pdf pp. 53-54.) That email
was sent to Iddrissu’s counsel, Bryan Thomas, on July 10, 2024. (Ex. E pdf pp.53-54.)

 
Thus,
Atinger submits
evidence showing Atinger is entitled to an order enforcing the Agreement.
Atinger
seeks “interest from the date the monies were due at a rate of 10% per annum.”
(Motion p. 3.) Code of Civil Procedure section 3289, subdivision (b) states that
“If a
contract entered into after January 1, 1986, does not stipulate a legal rate of interest, the obligation
shall bear interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum after a breach.” Atinger requests $380.00 in interest. This
appears to the court to be about 36 days’ worth of interest. Assuming Iddrissu
had to pay the $38,000 within 5 court days of when Iddrissu received notice
that the BMW FS Settlement was executed (August 21, 2024) then the amount owed
has accumulated more than 36 days’ worth of interest. Thus, this court grants
Atinger’s request for interest.
 
IV.          
ATTORNEYS’ FEES
 
Atinger
seeks $2,000 in attorneys’ fees for preparing the Motion. (Motion p. 4.) This
includes two hours of attorneys’ fees for reviewing relevant documents,
drafting the Motion and drafting the proposed judgment and one hour for
appearing at the hearing. (Netzah Declaration ¶ 11.) Atinger’s counsel also
seeks one hour of attorneys’ fees for counsel’s anticipated time spent
analyzing the opposition and drafting a reply. (Netzah Declaration ¶ 11.)
 
The
Agreement provides that:
 
In the event any party to this
Agreement files an action or proceeding, including a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 664.6, against another party regarding this Agreement or
any provision herein, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
attorney’s fees and other costs incurred in that action or proceeding, in
addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party may be entitled.
 
 (Ex. A p. 5.)
 
Iddrissu
filed no opposition and Atinger filed no reply. Accordingly, attorneys’ fees
for reviewing the opposition and filing a reply are unnecessary.
 
Thus,
this court grants Atinger’s request for attorneys’ fees in the reduced amount
of $1,500.00, reflecting three hours of attorneys’ fees at $500 per hour.
 
V.             
CONCLUSION
 
For
the foregoing reasons, this court grants the Motion and grants Atinger $380.00
in interest and $1,500.00 in attorneys’ fees.
