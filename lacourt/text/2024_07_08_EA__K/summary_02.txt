Here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff, Chang Shun Zhao, is seeking a default judgment against the defendant, George Chen and Great Chens Inc. The court has denied Zhao's application for default judgment without prejudice, citing several defects in Zhao's application. Specifically, Zhao failed to dismiss the does (unnamed parties) and did not file an application for separate judgment as against any of them, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure, Rule 3.1800. Additionally, Zhao's application is based on an incorrect calculation of the amount of damages owed to him, and he failed to provide evidence of the $223,196.00 in cash he claims to have paid Chen. The court also notes that Zhao failed to provide authority in support of his position that Chen should be treated as an unlicensed contractor, despite the fact that Chen was a licensed contractor who performed work on the property. The court orders an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment as to Chen, setting a hearing date for July 8, 2024.
