Background   
Plaintiff Chang Shun Zhao (“Zhao”) alleges as follows:
Zhao is the owner of the property located at
11310 Frankmont Street in El Monte, California, 91732 (the “Residence”). On or
about March 16, 2020, Zhao entered into one or more agreements with George Chen
aka Chun Hsu Chen (“Chen”) and Great Chens Inc. (“GCI”) wherein Chen and GCI
agreed to provide construction, renovation, and landscaping work on the
Residence. Chen and GCI instead performed substandard and incomplete work,
stole money that was prepaid to them, failed to pay subcontractors and
abandoned personal property at the Residence. 
On December 16, 2021, Zhao filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”),
asserting causes of action against Chen, GCI, Hudson Insurance Company
(“Hudson”) and Does 1-50 for:
1.

Relief 
On August 11, 2022, the court granted Zhao’s motion to strike

2023, Zhao dismissed Hudson, with prejudice.
An Order to Show
Cause Re: Default Judgment as to Chen is set for July 8, 2024.
Discussion
Zhao’s Application for Default Judgment
is DENIED without prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.         Zhao has failed to dismiss Does 1-50, nor has he filed an application
for separate judgment as against any of them, as per CRC rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(7).
2.                 
Zhao identifies
the [d]emand of complaint” in Paragraph 2 of the Request for Court Judgment
(Judicial Council Form CIV-100) as $329,800.00, which amount is comprised of
$310,000.00 (represented to be all money Zhao paid Chen) plus $19,800.00 for
the loss of use of his residence (i.e.., calculated at $1,650.00/month (x) 12
months). In actions for money damages a default judgment is limited to
the amount demanded in the complaint. (See Greenup
v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824.) The amount demanded in the complaint
is determined both from the prayer and from the damage allegations in the
complaint. (National Diversified
Services, Inc. v. Bernstein (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 410, 417-418).In his FAC, Zhao represents that he “prepaid”
Chen and GSI $310,000.00 “as of the date of Defendants’ having walked off the
job” (FAC, ¶ 19); however, he subsequently alleges that he obtained an estimate
of $125,942.00 “to repair, remedy and complete the project that Defendants
abandoned” (Id., ¶ 24), that Defendants were “holding approximately
$63,000-$70,000 of unearned, pre-paid cash for work that was not performed” as
of July 20, 2021 (Id., ¶ 26) and that he “has been damaged to the tune
of at least $248,542, the amount he overpaid the Defendants plus, the cost of
repair, remedy, and completion of the project” (Id., ¶ 35). Zhao reiterates
the figure of $248,542.00 in Paragraphs 40, 44 and 52 of the FAC. Zhao does not
make any allegations of loss of use damages in his FAC. It appears to the
court, then, that “the demand of the complaint” is $248,542.00 and not
$329,800.00.It appears, from the instant
default prove-up application, that Zhao seeks a return of the entire
$310,000.00 based on Zhao’s position that Chen should be treated as an
unlicensed contractor (See Summary of the Case, pp. 5-6). Zhao concedes that
Chen “apparently has a license under the name of ‘George C.I. Chen’” (Id.,
footnote 1), but claims this treatment is warranted because Chen only provided
and tried to use the name of GCI for the subject work even though he had no
authority to do so and because he only provided and tried to use the name of
GCI for the subject work (Id., p. 6). Zhao has failed to provide the
court with any authority in support of its position. The fact remains that work
was, in fact, performed by Chen, who was a licensed contractor.Zhao alternatively seeks a reduced principal
amount of $91,800.00, calculated as follows: $19,800.00 for loss of use of
property, plus $9,000.00 for work he performed, plus $63,000.00 for work that
was paid for but not done by Chen. Again, Zhao did not seek loss of use damages
in his FAC. Zhao does not provide the court with any evidentiary support for
his statement that he expended $11,000.00 of his own time performing repairs.
(See Chao Decl., ¶¶ 15 and 16). Zhao does not provide the court with any information
as to what work remained when Chen purportedly walked off the job.
3.         Zhao contends that he paid Chen
approximately $223,196.00 in cash (See Zhao Decl., ¶¶ 8-10). Zhao has not
provided the court with any evidence of same (i.e., via bank statements).
4.         Zhao references certain exhibits to the
FAC, which is not verified. Zhao must attach any such exhibits to his
declaration and authenticate same.
