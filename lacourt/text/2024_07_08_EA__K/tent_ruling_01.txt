Common Count

of all parties “pursuant to CCP Section 664.6,” without prejudice.

Legal Standard
“When jurisdiction is, by the Constitution or this Code, or
by any other statute, conferred on a Court or judicial officer, all the means
necessary to carry it into effect are also given; and in the exercise of this
jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be not specifically pointed out by
this Code or the statute, any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be
adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this Code.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 187).
“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own
motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as
to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either
party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473(d).)
Discussion
Plaintiff
moves the court for an order, per Code of Civil Procedure §§ 187 and 473(d), to
amend the order granting Plaintiff’s “Motion to Set
Aside and Vacate Dismissal” heard April 30, 2024.
On April 30,
2024; the court granted Plaintiff’s “Motion to Set Aside and Vacate Dismissal,”
“to the extent that the court will set aside the dismissal entered
February 13, 2020 against Sein and enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff, and
against Sein, in the amount of $27,577.10, consistent with the terms of the
‘Agreement for Compromise and Stipulation for Entry of Judgment in the Event of
Default’ set forth in paragraph v.”
Plaintiff
asserts that the amount of $27,577.10 constitutes a “clerical error” which
should be amended “to the correct balance of $57,577.10.” (Notice, 2:3-7).
Plaintiff, however, does not provide any argument or authority for its position.
Plaintiff’s
counsel was present at the time of the April 30, 2024 hearing and the amount of
$27,577.10 was plainly stated in the court’s posted tentative ruling, which was
subsequently adopted by the court on April 30, 2024. Finally, Plaintiff has
failed to comply with Code of Civil Procedure § 1008 requirements in the event it
is seeking reconsideration of the court’s April 30, 2024 ruling.
