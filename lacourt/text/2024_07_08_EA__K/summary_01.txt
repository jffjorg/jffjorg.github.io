And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Chang Shun Zhao's application for a default judgment against Defendant George Chen without prejudice. The judge noted several defects in Zhao's application, including his failure to dismiss Does 1-50, his failure to file an application for separate judgment as against any of them, and his failure to provide evidence of the $310,000.00 he allegedly paid to Chen. The judge also noted that Zhao's damages are limited to the amount demanded in the complaint, which is $248,542.00, and that Zhao's allegations of loss of use damages are not supported. The judge set an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment as to Chen for July 8, 2024.
