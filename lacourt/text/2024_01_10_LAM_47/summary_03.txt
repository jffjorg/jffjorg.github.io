  - "The ultimate facts alleged in the [cross-]complaint must be deemed true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged."
  - "This rule of liberal construction means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the defendant."
  - "The Court finds these allegations sufficient to plead a unity of interest between the Cross-Defendants at this stage."
  - "A document which the Cross-Complaint explicitly disavows as not reflecting the agreement of the parties and bearing forged signatures cannot establish a remedy at law."
