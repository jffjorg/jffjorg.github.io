And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in limine filed by the defendant (County of Los Angeles et al.) in the case of Williams v. County of Los Angeles et al.

The first motion seeks to exclude evidence of alleged disciplinary actions, confirmation of conferences, and affidavits from the client, as well as to bar the plaintiff's former supervisors from testifying. The judge denied this motion, finding that the evidence is relevant to the litigation of the plaintiff's retaliation claim.

The second motion seeks to exclude all evidence, argument, and discussion regarding the plaintiff's prior settlements with the defendant. The judge denied this motion, finding that the evidence is admissible to prove protected conduct, which is one of the elements of the plaintiff's retaliation claim.

The third motion seeks to exclude all evidence related to the "Walking Wounded Memo", which the plaintiff claims was written by her supervisors to justify her termination. The judge needs more information to rule on this motion, as the memo may have been written to provoke the defendant to retaliate against the plaintiff.

The fourth motion seeks to exclude all evidence that is violative of Welfare and Institutions Code section 827, which involves the confidentiality of a DSS case file. The judge denied this motion, finding that the defendant has not identified any specific evidence to be excluded.

The fifth motion seeks to exclude all evidence related to any alleged wrongful conduct by the County prior to January 21, 2017. The judge granted this motion, finding that the settlement agreement precludes any administrative complaints or lawsuits based on the allegations set forth in the plaintiff's May 2016 EEOC/DFEH complaint.

The sixth motion seeks to exclude all evidence related to the court's ruling on the defendant's motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication. The judge granted this motion, finding that the evidence is not relevant to the litigation.

The judge will hear argument on the motions at the final status conference.
