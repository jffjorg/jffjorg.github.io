And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's Motions in Limine Nos. 1 and 2, which sought to preclude defendants' expert testimony by Robert Griswold and Brian Daly, respectively. The judge found that the plaintiff has failed to provide an expert report or deposition testimony by these experts, and therefore, the court cannot evaluate whether their opinions improperly usurp the court's responsibility for instructing the jury on the applicable law or invade the province of the jury by offering opinions about how to apply the legal standards to the facts in the case.

The judge has also denied Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 3, which sought to exclude evidence of medical expenses beyond those actually incurred. The judge found that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient information to determine whether there is a specific basis for excluding the evidence, and therefore, the court cannot grant the motion.

The judge has granted Plaintiff's Motion in Limine No. 3, which sought to preclude the introduction of any evidence regarding Medical Board actions against Plaintiff's expert, Robin Bernhoft, M.D. The judge found that the evidence is irrelevant to the causation opinions Dr. Bernhoft will offer in this action and, even if there is any marginal relevance, is so prejudicial and time-consuming that the evidence should be excluded under Evidence Code § 352.

The judge has denied Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 5, which sought to exclude all opinions not testified to at the depositions of Plaintiff's experts. The judge found that the motion lacks specific information about the challenged expert testimony and therefore cannot be ruled on.
