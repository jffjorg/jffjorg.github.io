And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to stay the action pending the resolution of constitutional issues related to AB 218. The defendant, Montebello Unified School District, argues that the law retroactively strips statutory governmental immunity from public entities and violates the California Constitution, and therefore cannot settle the case until the constitutionality is resolved. The judge disagrees, citing the possibility of conflicting court rulings or Supreme Court review, and finds that going forward with the litigation is in the best interest of judicial economy. The parties can proceed with discovery and motion work if settlement discussions are unsuccessful.
