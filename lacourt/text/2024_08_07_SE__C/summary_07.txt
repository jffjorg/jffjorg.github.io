And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains Defendant Benito Valdez's demurrer to the complaint with 20 days leave to amend. The complaint alleges negligence against all four named defendants, but fails to specify which defendant is responsible for the alleged negligence. The court agrees with the demurrer, ruling that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action as to Defendant Benito Valdez. The court notes that the burden is on the complainant to show that a pleading can be amended successfully, and that leave to amend should be denied where the facts are not in dispute and the nature of the claim is clear, but no liability exists under substantive law. The court also notes that the complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts pleaded, and that a party may demur to an entire complaint or to any causes of action stated therein.
