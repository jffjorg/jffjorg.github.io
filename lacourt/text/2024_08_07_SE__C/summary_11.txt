And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Chavez v. Adecco USA, Inc., et al. (Case No. 23NWCV03813). The Defendant, Adecco USA, Inc., has moved to compel arbitration, and the Judge has granted this motion. The proceedings are stayed pending arbitration.

The Judge found that the Defendant has met its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, which was signed by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff argued that the agreement is procedurally and substantively unconscionable, but the Judge found that the agreement is not procedurally unconscionable because it was signed voluntarily, and it is not substantively unconscionable because it does not contain overly harsh or one-sided terms.

The Judge also found that the agreement's waiver of jury trial is not substantively unconscionable, and that the requirement for the Plaintiff to pay his own attorney fees if he prevails is not substantively unconscionable. Finally, the Judge found that the agreement's requirement for claims against third-party beneficiaries to be resolved through arbitration is not substantively unconscionable because it does not allocate the risks in an unreasonable manner.

Therefore, the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration is granted, and the proceedings are stayed pending arbitration.
