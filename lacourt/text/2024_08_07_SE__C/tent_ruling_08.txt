TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendants’ motion to
strike is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. 
 
Moving party to give
notice. 
 
This motion is
unopposed as of August 5, 2024. 
 
 
On
September 19, 2023, Defendant Anthony Holguin prevailed in an unlawful detainer
action against Plaintiff Kristen Michelle Lee Joseph regarding possession of
the premises located at 5434 Premiere Avenue, Lakewood, California 90712. 
 
Plaintiff
sues defendants Anthony Holguin, Claudia Holguin, and Louis Corrado for the
following: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of covenant of good faith and
fair dealing; (3) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; (4) trespass; (5)
nuisance; (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (7) negligent
infliction of emotional distress; (8) negligence; (9) wrongful eviction; (10)
constructive eviction; (11) uncured building violations; (12) fraud; and (13)
malicious prosecution regarding her possession of the premises located at 5434
Premiere Avenue, Lakewood, California 90712. 
 
Defendants
move to strike the wrongful eviction, malicious
prosecution, fraud, perjury, and failure to notice and improper service causes
of action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16. They also move to strike the second to last paragraph on page 6; last
paragraph on page 6; the last paragraph on page 8; and “the retaliatory
unlawful detainer action and lawsuit” on page 10. 
 
Requests for Judicial
Notice
 
Defendants request
judicial notice of the following: (1) complaint in case number 23NWCV03216; (2)
complaint in case number 23NWUD00203; (3) September 19, 2023, minute order in
case number 23NWUD00203; (4) notice of entry of judgment filed September 19,
2023 in case number 23NWUD00203; and (5) judgment in unlawful detainer filed on
September 19, 2023 in case number 23NWUD00203. 
 
A
court may take judicial notice that certain documents were filed in prior
litigation, or that certain factual findings were made, but generally may not
take judicial notice of the contents of those filings, or of the factual
findings themselves. (See, e.g., Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.
(2010) 181 Cal. App.4th 471, 483-484.) 
 
Thus,
the Court grants the requests. 
 
Timeliness
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.16 provides that a special motion to strike may
be filed within 60 days of the service of the complaint, “or, in the Court’s
discretion, at any later time upon terms it deems proper.”
 
Here,
the motion was filed on October 30, 2023, while the complaint was filed on
October 10, 2023. Thus, Defendants are timely. 
 
Defendants’ Burden of
Proof
The
moving party bears the initial burden of showing that the action falls within
the class of suits subject to the special motion to strike. (Matson v. Dvorak
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539, 548.) 
A
defendant may meet this burden by showing that the act which forms the basis
for the plaintiff’s suit was (1) any written or oral statement made before a
legislative, executive or judicial proceeding; (2) a statement or writing made
in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,
executive, or judicial body or “any other official
proceeding authorized by law;” (3) any written or oral statement made in a
place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public
interest; or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the
constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in
connection with an issue of public interest. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (e);
Equilon Enterprises, supra, 29 Cal.4th at 66.) 
Whether
the anti-SLAPP statute applies is determined by the “principal thrust or
gravamen” of Plaintiff’s claim. It cannot be invoked where allegations of
protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based on
nonprotected activity. (Martinez v. Metabolife Int’l, Inc. (2003) 113
Cal.App.4th 181, 187.)
Here, Defendants argue that
all aspects of an unlawful detainer action arise from the right to petition and
are therefore subject to the anti-SLAPP statute. (Mot., pg. 9.) Defendants also
argue that the malicious prosecution action predicates on the service of notice
and institution of the unlawful detainer action. (Mot., pg. 11.) The Court
agrees. (Birkner v. Lam (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 275, 282; Jarrow
Formulas, Inc. v. LaMarche (2003) 31 Cal.4th 728, 734-735.) A landlord’s
service of notice to terminate tenancy of tenants is an act in furtherance of
the landlord’s free speech or petitioning rights under Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16. (Birkner v. Lam, supra, 156 Cal.App.4th at pg. 282.) An
action for malicious prosecution based on a party’s statements or writings in
an earlier judicial proceeding is subject to being stricken as a SLAPP suit. (Jarrow
Formulas, Inc. v. LaMarche, supra, 31 Cal.4th at pgs. 734-735.) 
 
The Court determines that
Defendants have made a prima facie showing that the wrongful
eviction, malicious prosecution, fraud, perjury, and failure to notice and
improper service causes of action arise from the right to petition.  
 
Defendants also do not argue why the
other portions of the complaint should be stricken. A judge in a civil case is not
"'obligated to seek out theories [a party] might have advanced, or to
articulate … that which … [a party] has left unspoken.'"  (Mesecher v. County of San Diego (1992)
9 Cal.App.4th 1677, 1686.)
 
Plaintiff’s Burden of Proof 
 
Plaintiff now has the burden of proof to
establish a probability that he will prevail on whatever claims are asserted
against Defendants. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b).) The plaintiff must
demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a
sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment. (Premier
Med. Mgmt. Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guar. Ass’n (2006) 136
Cal.App.4th 4464, 476.) 
 
Plaintiff has not opposed the
motion. 
 
Thus, the motion to strike the
wrongful eviction, malicious prosecution, fraud, perjury, and failure to notice
and improper service causes of action is GRANTED.  The motion to strike the second to last paragraph on page 6; last
paragraph on page 6; the last paragraph on page 8; and “the retaliatory
unlawful detainer action and lawsuit” on page 10 is DENIED.  
 
Request for Attorney’s
Fees
 
As a prevailing
defendant in this motion to strike, defendant is entitled to attorney’s fees.
(CCP § 425.16, subd. (c)(2).)  Defendant
requests attorney’s fees in the amount of $3660.00.  Because the motion is unopposed and
non-complex compared to other anti-SLAPP motions, the Court awards attorney’s
fees in the amount of $1860.00.
