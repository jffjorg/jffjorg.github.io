TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint
is OVERRULED.  Defendant to answer in 5
days.  
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Background
 
The operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed on November 15, 2023, by Linda Ikeda
(“Plaintiff”) against The Jen & Mi Lu Family, LLC (“Defendant”). The FAC
alleges that on February 8, 2017, Plaintiff entered a commercial lease on
behalf of her LLC, Jumpstart Bodyfuel. (FAC, ¶ 4.) Several months later, she
dissolved the corporation and formed a new LLC called Way Beyond Cake Bakery.
(FAC, ¶ 6.) In 2021, she started to feel ill while she was on the premises.
(FAC, ¶ 7.) She had occupied the premises during workdays from February 8, 2017
until 2021. (FAC, ¶ 7.) Plaintiff sought medical treatment, which revealed that
she had contracted lead poisoning. (FAC, ¶ 11.) She hired a lead contamination
company to inspect the leased premises, and the inspection revealed that there
was lead emanating from the interior of the leased premises and had probably
been there for many years. (FAC, ¶¶ 12 and 13.) In May 2021, she realized she
had contracted lead poisoning from the Defendant’s leased premises as the
result of her continued occupation of the premises from February 2017 until she
vacated in June 2021. (FAC, ¶19.) She filed a lawsuit on March 20, 2023,
alleging causes of action for breach of contract and premises liability. She
filed her first amended complaint on November 15, 2023. She sues for negligence
and premises liability. 
 
Defendant demurs to all
causes of action in the complaint on the grounds that they do not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The party against whom
a complaint has been filed may object to the pleading, by demurrer, on several
grounds, including that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A party
may demur to an entire complaint, or to any causes of action stated therein. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.50, subd. (a).) The complaint must be construed liberally by drawing
reasonable inferences from the facts pleaded. (Flynn v. Higham
(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 677, 679.)
 
The burden is on the
complainant to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully, to
obtain an order allowing leave to amend. 
(McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co.  (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 78.) “Leave to
amend should be denied where
the facts are not in dispute and the nature of the claim is clear, but no
liability exists under substantive law.” (Lawrence
v. Bank of America (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 431, 436.) 
 
Meet-and-Confer
Defendant
satisfied the meet-and-confer requirements. (Decl. Lewis, ¶ 1; Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.41, subd. (a)(3).) 
First Cause of Action – Negligence 
 

To state a claim
for negligence, Plaintiff must allege the elements of (1) “the existence of a legal
duty of care,” (2) “breach of that duty,” and (3) “proximate cause resulting in
an injury.” (McIntyre v. Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th
664, 671.) 
 
Defendant demurs to the
negligence cause of action on the grounds that Plaintiff does not allege any
duty; Plaintiff is not a named party to the agreement; California does not
recognize a warranty of habitability for commercial leases; any duty is
contractual; and Jumpstart Bodyfuel, LLC lacks capacity to sue. 
 
Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant had a duty to “rent a habitable, safe, work environment and they
failed to do so.  They either knew, or
should have known, that the leasehold premises was contaminated with lead,
which ultimately lead to the sickness of the Plaintiff.” (FAC, ¶ 17.) Defendant argues that
California does not recognize a warranty of habitability for commercial leases,
and any such duty is contractual. 
Assuming that is true, the parties to the lease, as Defendant points
out, were Defendant and Jumpstart. 
Plaintiff is suing as an individual. 
Thus, the Court cannot determine, at this stage of the proceedings, that
the lease agreement bars Defendant’s liability. 

 
As noted in the Court’s
October 19, 2023 ruling on the previous demurrer, the issue of whether
Jumpstart Bodyfuel has standing/capacity to institute this lawsuit is not before
this Court. Jumpstart Bodyfuel is not a party to this action, and Plaintiff
Ikeda does not allege that she is bringing derivative claims on behalf of the
corporate entity.
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the first cause of action is OVERRULED.  
 
Second Cause of Action –
Premises Liability 
 
“The elements of a
cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for negligence:
duty, breach, causation, and damages.” (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013)
220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)
 
Defendants
argue that the statute of limitations bars the premises liability claim because
Plaintiff entered the lease on or about February 8, 2017. 
 
Because the premises liability claim is a
negligence claim, the two-year statute of limitations applies.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1; Castellon v.
U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) A limitations period does not begin until a cause
of action accrues, i.e. all essential elements are present, and a claim becomes
legally actionable. (Glue-Fold, Inc. v. Slautterback Corp. (2000) 82
Cal.App.4th, 1018, 1029.) This does not occur until the last element essential
to the cause of action happens. (Choi v. Sagemark Consulting (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 308, 323.) The running of the statute must appear “clearly and
affirmatively” from the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the
complaint might be time-barred. (Stueve Bros. Farms, LLC v.
Berger Kahn (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 303, 321.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff states that in May 2021, she realized she had contracted lead
poisoning from the Defendant’s leased premises as the result of her continued
occupation of the premises from February 2017 until she vacated in June 2021.
(FAC, ¶19.) She does not state when she sustained the harm. To the extent it
can be determined, the date Plaintiff sustained the harm determines when the
cause of action accrued and when the statute of limitations began to run.  Because the running of the statute of
limitations does not appear clearly and affirmatively from the face of the FAC, the statute
of limitations does not bar the action. 
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.
