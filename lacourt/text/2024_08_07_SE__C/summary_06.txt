Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the complaint filed by Plaintiff Linda Ikeda against Defendant The Jen & Mi Lu Family, LLC, and has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant's demurrer to the complaint.

The court has overruled Defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action for negligence, finding that Plaintiff has alleged a duty on the part of Defendant to provide a safe and habitable work environment, and that Defendant breached that duty by failing to do so. The court has also overruled Defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action for premises liability, finding that Plaintiff has alleged the necessary elements of a premises liability claim, including a duty to provide a safe and habitable environment, breach of that duty, and causation.

The court has also addressed Defendant's argument that the statute of limitations bars the premises liability claim, finding that the running of the statute of limitations does not appear clearly and affirmatively from the face of the complaint, and that the claim is therefore not time-barred.

The court has ordered Defendant to answer the complaint within 5 days, and has granted Plaintiff permission to move forward with its claims for negligence and premises liability.
