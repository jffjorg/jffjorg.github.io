And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Joe A. Nunez, Kevin D. Poush, and Jason E. Barth to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Bellator Roofing, Inc. without prejudice. This means that the motion is denied, but the parties can re-file the motion at a later time. The judge also ordered the moving party to give notice. The motion was unopposed as of August 5, 2024. The reason for the denial is that counsel has not yet filed proof of service for Defendant Martiza Tay, despite being ordered to do so at a previous hearing.
