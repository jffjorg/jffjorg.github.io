TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant Benito Valdez’s demurrer to
plaintiff’s complaint is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend. 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Background
 
This is about a car
collision between two automobiles. Plaintiff Aileen Nashelly Valencia (“Plaintiff”)
was a passenger in Defendant Francisco Echeverria’s motor vehicle when he
collided with a vehicle driven by Defendant Christopher Valdez. (Compl., pp. 4
and 5.)  Plaintiff alleges negligence against
Defendants Francisco Echeverria, Grimaldo Leticia Garcia, Christopher Valdez
and Benito Valdez.  
 
Defendant Benito Valdez
demurs to the complaint on the grounds that it does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action as to him. 

 
Legal Standard
 
The party against whom
a complaint has been filed may object to the pleading, by demurrer, on several
grounds, including that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A party
may demur to an entire complaint, or to any causes of action stated therein. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.50, subd. (a).) The complaint must be construed liberally by drawing
reasonable inferences from the facts pleaded. (Flynn v. Higham
(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 677, 679.)
 
The burden is on the
complainant to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully, to
obtain an order allowing leave to amend. 
(McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co.  (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 78.) “Leave to
amend should be denied where
the facts are not in dispute and the nature of the claim is clear, but no
liability exists under substantive law.” (Lawrence
v. Bank of America (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 431, 436.) 
 
Meet-and-Confer
Defendant
satisfied the meet-and-confer requirements. (Decl. Nguyen, ¶ 3-5; Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).) 
First Cause of Action – Negligence 
 

To state a claim
for negligence, Plaintiff must allege the elements of (1) “the existence of a legal
duty of care,” (2) “breach of that duty,” and (3) “proximate cause resulting in
an injury.” (McIntyre v. Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th
664, 671.) 
 
Defendant Benito Valdez (“Defendant”) demurs to
the negligence cause of action on the grounds that Plaintiff does not allege
any facts as to him. Instead, she has pleaded that all four named defendants
operated the motor vehicle, owned the vehicle which was operated with their
permission, and entrusted the motor vehicle. (Compl., pg. 4.) The Court
agrees.  A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the
failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing
defendant cannot tell what defendant is supposed to respond to. (Williams
v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) 
 
Thus, the demurrer is SUSTAINED
with 20 days leave to amend.
