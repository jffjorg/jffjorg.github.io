TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff
William Saylor’s motion to compel the deposition of Defendant American Honda
Motor Company, Inc.’s Person Most Qualified is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered
to produce its Person Most Qualified for deposition within 60 days of the
issuance of this order.  This time period
may be extended by agreement of the parties. 
No sanctions are imposed.  
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiff William Saylor moves to compel Defendant’s Person Most Qualified
(PMQ) deposition according to Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450.  
 
Legal
Standards
 
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a
party under Section 2025.230 does not appear for deposition after service of a
deposition notice and the party has not validly objected, the noticing party
may move to compel the deponent’s attendance and testimony. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
Article 2, commencing with Section 2025.210, sets forth
the grounds for objection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd.
(a).) A party served with a deposition notice waives any error or irregularity
unless that party serves a written objection specifying that error or
irregularity at least three calendar days before the deposition. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) 
 
Further, the motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration, or, when the deponent fails to attend
the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) The
declaration shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
For purposes of
determining whether there was a reasonable and good faith effort to meet and
confer, such an attempt at informal resolution requires something more than
bickering with opposing counsel; rather, the law requires that counsel attempt
to talk the matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate. (Clement
v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) 
Discussion
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff noticed the
deposition of Defendant’s person most qualified for February 20, 2024. (Lupinek
Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) On January 30, 2024, Plaintiff requested alternative dates for
the deposition if the February 20, 2024 date would not work for Defendant. (Hancox
Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. B.)  
 
On February 10,
2024, Defendant objected to the requests for production of documents
accompanying the deposition notice. (Lupinek Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. C.) 
 
On February 16,
2024, Plaintiff met and conferred with Defendant about Defendant’s objections.
(Lupinek Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. D.)
 
On February 27,
2024, Defendant’s counsel responded and stated that they are working to coordinate
various deposition dates. (Hancox Decl., ¶12, Ex. H.) 
 
The motion to
compel the deposition of Defendant’s Person Most Qualified is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to produce its Person
Most Qualified for deposition within 60 days of the issuance of this
order.  This time period may be extended
by agreement of the parties.  
 
Sanctions
 
“To the extent
authorized by this chapter governing any particular discovery method or any
other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party,
person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose [sanctions]
against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process …”
(CCP §2023.030.) Failing to respond to an authorized method of discovery and
disobeying a court order to provide discovery are both misuses of the discovery
process.” (CCP §§2023.010 (d) and (g).)
 
It is widely
understood that the availability of Defendant’s PMQ’s for deposition is
limited.  The Court finds that Defendant
acted with substantial justification in failing to appear for Plaintiff’s
unilaterally noticed deposition subpoena. 
Therefore, no sanctions are ordered.
