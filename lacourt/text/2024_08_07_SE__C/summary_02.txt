```

And here is an English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's Person Most Qualified (PMQ). The defendant is ordered to produce its PMQ for deposition within 60 days of the issuance of this order, and this time period may be extended by agreement of the parties. The court finds that the defendant acted with substantial justification in failing to appear for the plaintiff's unilaterally noticed deposition subpoena, and therefore no sanctions are imposed.
