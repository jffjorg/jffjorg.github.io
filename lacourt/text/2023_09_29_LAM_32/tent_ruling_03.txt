  Case No.:  22STCV09767
  Hearing Date:  September 29, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Dominique Peatry filed
this action against Toluca Lake Collective, Inc. on September 29, 2022. Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint on March 24, 2023, various wage and
hour violations.   
            On August 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production. Defendant
filed a late opposition on September 19, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
“On receipt of a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an
order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems
that any of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand
is incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or
too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a).) 
 
MEET AND CONFER
Motions to compel further responses must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to resolve
the issue informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2031.310(b)(2), 2033.290(b)(1).)
The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirement. (See
Gutierrez Decl.) 
DISCUSSION
            In response to the subject RFPs,
Defendant stated: “Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections,
Responding Party will comply with this request and produce all responsive and
non-privileged documents in its possession, custody, or control to which no
objection is being made. Produced herewith are documents identified by Bates
numbers TLC00001 through TLC00210.” (Plntf.’s Separate Statement.) 
            A statement of compliance must indicate
whether the production “will be allowed either in whole or in part.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.220.) Additionally, if Defendant withholds any documents based on
its objections, it must specify which objection and identify the documents to
which the objection applies. (Id., § 2031.240(b).) If Defendant
withholds documents based on privilege, it shall provide a privilege log. (Id.,
§ 2031.240(c)(1).) 
            Defendant argues that it has
provided supplemental responses and that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer
before filing the motion. However, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter
regarding the RFPs on August 11, 2023. (Hodge Decl., Ex. C.) Defendant
responded to this letter on August 23, 2023, but only addressed form
interrogatories and not the RFPs. (Id., Ex. E.) Plaintiff sent her reply
letter on August 24, 2023, indicating her intent to file a motion to compel because
Defendant did not address the RFPs. (Id., Ex. G.) Plaintiff filed
this motion one week later. Within that week, there is no indication that
Defendant responded to Plaintiff’s contentions regarding the RFPs or indicated
any intent to comply with the RFPs. Plaintiff is not required to wait indefinitely.
Thus, Plaintiff has discharged her obligation to meet and confer, and Defendant
is the one that failed to address the RFPs. 
            Defendant eventually served
supplemental responses on September 19, 2023, after this motion was filed and on
the same day as its late opposition. This does not moot the motion, and the unjustified
delay still warrants sanctions. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
is GRANTED. Defendant shall provide further responses to the subject RFPs
within 15 days. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant and its counsel in the
amount of $900, to be paid within 30 days.
