     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant city of los angeles’ motion
  for judgment on the pleadings 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 22, 2021, Plaintiff Randall
Stewart initiated this action against Defendants Los Angeles Police Department,
City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, and Bryan Dameworth. The operative Second
Amended Complaint, filed January 18, 2023, alleges (1) battery, (2) assault,
(3) battery by peace officer, (4) negligent hiring, (5) negligence, (6)
negligent use of deadly force, (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress,
and (8) violation of the Bane Act. Plaintiff alleges that he was attending a protest
on May 30, 2020, in Los Angeles when Officer Dameworth fired a rubber bullet,
striking him. (SAC ¶¶ 10-12.) The incident allegedly left Plaintiff with severe
injuries and continued pain and suffering (Id., ¶ 30.) 
            On September 1, 2023, Defendant City
of Los Angeles (City) filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings
against the fourth cause of action for negligent hiring. Plaintiff filed a
notice of non-opposition on September 18, 2023. 
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 A
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made on the same grounds as those
supporting a general demurrer, i.e., that the pleading fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a legally cognizable claim or defense. (Stoops v.
Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.) A motion for judgment on the
pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks
only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1999) 67 Cal.App.4th
995, 999.) Judgment on the pleadings must be denied where there are material
factual issues that require evidentiary resolution. (Schabarum v. Calif.
Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.) 
DISCUSSION
“Except as otherwise provided by statute .
. . [a] public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises
out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any
other person.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 815(a).) “[S]ection 815 abolishes common law
tort liability for public entities.” (Miklosy v. Regents of University of
California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 899.) “In other words, direct tort
liability of public entities must be based on a specific statute declaring them
to be liable . . . .” (Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority
(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.) 
Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action for
negligent hiring is a common law tort claim. The allegations do not set forth
any statutory basis for liability. (See SAC ¶¶ 33-39.) “[A] direct claim
against a governmental entity asserting negligent hiring and supervision, when
not grounded in the breach of a statutorily imposed duty owed by the entity to
the injured party, may not be maintained.” (de Villers v. County of San
Diego (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 238, 255-56.) Therefore, the fourth cause of
action fails as a matter of law. Plaintiff does not oppose striking the fourth
cause of action. 
 
CONCLUSION
Defendant City of Los Angeles’ motion for
judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED.
