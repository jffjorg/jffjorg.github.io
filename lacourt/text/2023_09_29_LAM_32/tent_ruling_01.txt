  order RE:
defendants dean avedon’s motion to
  compel responses to discovery 




 


 



BACKGROUND
On November 9, 2018, Plaintiffs Hero Dogs
Season One LLC (HDS1) and Nuriya Entertainment LLC (Nuriya) commenced this
action against Defendants Dean A. Avedon, Bemel, Ross & Avedon, LLP, David
Beitchman, and Beitchman & Zekian, a Professional Law Corporation. The
operative First Amended Complaint was filed June 11, 2019. The matter came on
for a bench trial on October 31, 2022. The Court found in favor of Defendants and
entered judgment accordingly on December 6, 2022. Plaintiffs then appealed the
judgment, but the appeal has since been dismissed.  
            On September 1, 2023, Defendant Dean
Avedon, as judgment creditor, filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiffs
(judgment debtors) to respond to post-judgment demands for inspection. Plaintiffs
have not filed an opposition.  
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a responding
party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).)  
DISCUSSION
            The RFPs were served on Plaintiffs
on May 10, 2023. (Dean Decl. ¶ 6.) The responses were due by June 14, 2023, and
no extension was requested or agreed upon. (Id., ¶ 8.) To date,
Plaintiffs have not responded to the subject RFPs. (Id., ¶ 9.) 
            No substantial justification has
been provided for Plaintiffs’ failure to respond to discovery. Sanctions are
warranted in the amount of $765, representing 3 hours at $235 per hour, plus a
$60 filing fee. (See Dean Decl. ¶ 12.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Avedon’s motion to compel
responses is GRANTED. Plaintiffs shall serve responses to the subject demands
for inspection within 15 days. Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiffs in the
total amount of $765, to be paid within 30 days.
