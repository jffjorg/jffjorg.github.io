## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production from the Defendant. The Defendant's initial document production was deemed insufficient because it did not adequately specify which documents were withheld and the reasons for withholding them.  The Judge found that the Plaintiff had properly fulfilled their obligation to meet and confer with the Defendant, while the Defendant failed to adequately address the requests. Due to the Defendant's late and incomplete responses, the Judge has awarded sanctions in the amount of $900 against the Defendant and their counsel.
