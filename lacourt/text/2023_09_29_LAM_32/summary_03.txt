(2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general." (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a))

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The defendant, Toluca Lake Collective, Inc., failed to adequately respond to the requests and did not provide sufficient information about the documents it has produced. The judge finds that the defendant's objections to the requests were without merit and that it failed to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing its opposition. The judge awards sanctions against the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $900, to be paid within 30 days. The defendant is ordered to provide further responses to the requests for production within 15 days.
