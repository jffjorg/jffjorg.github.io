And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling taking the demurrer and motion to strike the original complaint off calendar. The complaint alleged claims for rescission of contract, unfair competition, and negligence per se regarding four loans issued by the defendants to the plaintiffs, in which the defendants allegedly charged usurious interest rates. The defendants filed the demurrer and motion to strike on October 9, 2024, and the opposition was due on November 12, 2024. However, the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on October 29, 2024, which supersedes the original complaint. As a result, the demurrer and motion to strike the original complaint are no longer relevant and are taken off calendar.
