Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the original cross-complaint filed by Mediterranean Shipping Company, USA (Cross-Defendant) is taken off calendar. This is because Cross-Defendant filed a first amended cross-complaint on the same date that its opposition to the demurrer was due, which supersedes the original cross-complaint and renders the demurrer moot. The hearing date for the demurrer has been removed from the calendar.
