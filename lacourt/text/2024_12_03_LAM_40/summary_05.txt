And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to intervene in the case. The Defendant, Law Offices of Steven R. Young, APC, sought to intervene in the action to recover fees allegedly owed to it from the Plaintiffs, Gary R. Carlin, et al. The Plaintiffs argue that the Defendant's motion is untimely and that the Defendant should have raised its claim for fees as a defense in its answer. The Judge found that the Defendant is already a party to the action and has the ability to protect its interests through the litigation, making intervention unnecessary. The Judge also noted that the Defendant's claim for fees is a related cause of action that can be raised by cross-complaint, rather than through intervention.
