And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to take the demurrer to the cross-complaint off the calendar. The demurrer was filed by the cross-defendant, Mediterranean Shipping Company USA, Inc., and was based on claims for breach of contract and related claims against the plaintiff, 26 Center Distribution, LLC,dba Dura Trucking. The plaintiff had filed a cross-complaint alleging breach of contract, open book account, account stated, and unjust enrichment against the defendant. The defendant had failed to pay for containers, which led to the plaintiff's claims. The judge has determined that the demurrer should be taken off the calendar because the defendant filed a first amended cross-complaint on the date its opposition was due, which supersedes the original cross-complaint and makes it moot.
