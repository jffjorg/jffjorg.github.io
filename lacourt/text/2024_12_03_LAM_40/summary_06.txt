As for the summary in English text, here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories and request for production of documents filed by the plaintiffs. The court finds that the defendant's responses were deficient, non-responsive, and evasive, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to discover the identity of the older student and related information. The court grants the motions to compel, ordering the defendant to provide further, verified, code-compliant responses within 10 days. The court also denies the plaintiffs' request for imposition of sanctions against the defendant, finding that the defendant is precluded from disclosing information about a student or former student absent consent or without a court order.
