allegation of fraud shall be considered credible if it exhibits indicia of
reliability as recognized by state or federal courts or by other law sufficient
to meet the constitutional prerequisite to a law enforcement search or seizure
of comparable business assets. The department shall carefully consider the
allegations, facts, data, and evidence with the same thoroughness as a state or
federal court would use in approving a warrant for a search or seizure." (Welf.
& Inst. Code, ยง 14107.11 subd. (d).)
