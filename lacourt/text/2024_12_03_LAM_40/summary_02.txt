And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer and motion to strike the original complaint are taken off calendar. The complaint alleges claims for rescission of contract based on four loans issued by the defendants to the plaintiffs, in which the defendants allegedly charged usurious interest rates. The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on October 29, 2024, before the opposition was due on November 12, 2024. As a result, the original complaint is no longer operative and the demurrer and motion to strike are moot.
