And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to take the demurrer and motion to strike the original complaint off the calendar. The demurrer and motion were filed by the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., arguing that the original complaint was insufficient. However, the plaintiffs, Francisco Javier Saucedo Cazares, et al., filed a first amended complaint on November 18, 2024, which supersedes the original complaint. As a result, the demurrer and motion to strike the original complaint are no longer relevant. The judge's decision does not address the merits of the case, but rather allows the parties to proceed with the amended complaint. The hearing date, which was previously set for December 3, 2024, is cancelled.
