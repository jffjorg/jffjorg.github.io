* "A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law."
* "Plaintiff can prevail on this claim by showing the existence of a fiduciary relationship, breach of that duty, causation, and damages caused by the breach."
* "A fiduciary relationship is one 'existing between parties to a transaction wherein one of the parties is duty bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the other party.'"
* "If a substantial relationship is established, a conflict is presumed and disqualification will be ordered as '[t]he rights and interest of the former client will prevail.'"
* "The SAC does not allege facts to show how Lee breached a fiduciary duty toward Plaintiff, where the duty of loyalty and confidentiality was owed to the Clark defendants, Lee's former clients."
* "As the claims remain defective, demurrer to the ninth and 10th causes of action are SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND."
