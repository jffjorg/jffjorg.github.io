And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to intervene in the case. The defendant, Law Offices of Steven R. Young, APC, sought to intervene in the case because it claims that the plaintiffs owe it fees arising from its handling of an underlying case. However, the judge determined that the defendant's motion was untimely and that the defendant's interests could be protected through other means, such as filing a cross-complaint. The judge also noted that the defendant was not a "third party" entitled to intervene under California Code of Civil Procedure section 387.
