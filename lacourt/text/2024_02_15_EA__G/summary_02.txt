```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Cynthia Shepard's motion to consolidate the present action with an unlawful detainer action brought by Ellen Shepard O'Connor. The two actions involve common questions of law and fact regarding Cynthia Shepard's ownership of a property in Claremont. The unlawful detainer action alleges Cynthia Shepard occupies the property through a tenancy-at-will, while the present action alleges she occupies it as a joint tenant. The judge finds that consolidating the actions will eliminate unnecessary costs and delays and will allow for more efficient resolution of the complex title dispute between the parties. The judge cites precedent from Martin-Bragg v. Moore, which held that consolidating an action to quiet title with an unlawful detainer action is appropriate when complex title issues are involved.
