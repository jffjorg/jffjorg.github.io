(Defendants) for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud related to a joint venture in the beauty supply and spa business.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Avraham Bibi v. Roey Burg, et al. (Case Number: 21STCV11739). The case involves a dispute over the breakdown of a joint venture between the parties in the beauty supply and spa business. The Defendants, Revital Agi and Eydan Berger, moved to compel further responses to interrogatories propounded to the Plaintiff. The Judge has denied both motions for lack of jurisdiction.

The Judge ruled that the notices of motion were fatally defective because they did not state the statutory authority for the motion, did not explain the deficiency with the interrogatories, and did not identify the specific interrogatories at issue. The Judge also noted that the parties did not agree to provide supplemental responses to the specific interrogatories identified.

The Judge concluded that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the motion and therefore denied both motions to compel further responses to interrogatories. The Judge ordered the moving parties to give notice of the ruling.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling, written by Judge Theresa M. Traber, denies the motions of Defendants Revital Agi and Eydan Berger to compel further responses to interrogatories. The court finds that the notices of motion filed by the defendants are defective and do not provide sufficient information to the plaintiff, Avraham Bibi. The defendants served their special interrogatories on January 24, 2023, and the plaintiff responded on March 21, 2023, and supplemented their responses on June 23, 2023. The defendants filed their notices of motion on August 9, 2023, but did not file their moving papers until August 30, 2023. The court concludes that the notices of motion are fatally defective and that the defendants did not provide timely notice to the plaintiff. Therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the motions and denies them. The plaintiff may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email, but the court may still conduct a hearing if any party appears.
