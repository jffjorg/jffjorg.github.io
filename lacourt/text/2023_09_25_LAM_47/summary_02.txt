English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories filed by defendants Revital Agi and Eydan Berger against plaintiff Avraham Bibi. The motion was filed on August 30, 2023, but the notice of motion was served on August 8, 2023, which is outside the 45-day time limit. The court finds that the notice of motion is defective and lacks jurisdiction to hear the motion. Therefore, the motion is denied. The court also finds that the defendants failed to provide sufficient information about the specific interrogatories at issue and failed to state the statutory authority for the motion. The court concludes that the defendants' notices of motion are fatally defective and lack jurisdiction. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
