Statement of Material Facts and/or Proceedings:

  - Plaintiffs' Motions to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production (Set Three) are DENIED for lack of jurisdiction
  - Defendant's Motion to Conduct Trial in Phases is GRANTED IN PART

Key Issues:

  - Whether the Additional Living Expenses provision of the policy requires Defendant to include not only the dwelling structure itself, but also the grounds of the property and other structures in its calculations

Laws and Statutes:
  - Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(c)

  - Code of Civil Procedure section 1048(b)
  - Civil Code section 3294
  - Civil Code section 3295(d)

Significant Statements:
  - "The Court concludes that the Additional Living Expenses of the Policy required Defendant, when calculating the 'necessary increase in cost' to maintain Plaintiffs' standard of living, to include not only the dwelling structure itself, but also the grounds of the property and other structures, subject to the exclusions in the definition of Dwelling Extension in Coverage Provision A section 2."
  - "Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production (Set Three) are DENIED for lack of jurisdiction."
  - "Defendant's Motion to Conduct Trial in Phases is GRANTED IN PART. Trial on the issue of Defendant's liability will be conducted first. Should Plaintiffs prove malice, oppression, or fraud by clear and convincing evidence during the liability phase, the Court will then proceed to trial on the issue of the proper amount of punitive damages. Evidence of Defendant's profits and financial condition may not be introduced until the second phase of trial."
```
