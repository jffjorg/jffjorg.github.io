The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint.

The plaintiff seeks to add new allegations to the complaint, including claims of further retaliation that occurred in June and July 2023. The defendant argued that the motion should be denied because the plaintiff delayed seeking leave to amend and because the defendant would be prejudiced by the new allegations. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's delay was reasonable and that the defendant would not be unfairly prejudiced by the amendment. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file a clean, stand-alone copy of the First Amended Complaint within five days of the order.
