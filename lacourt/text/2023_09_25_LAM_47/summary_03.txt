* **Defendant:** Los Angeles Unified School District

**Summary:**

This case involves a motion by Plaintiff Nada Shaath for leave to file a First Amended Complaint against the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).  Shaath alleges employment discrimination, harassment, and retaliation based on her race, religion, and national origin.

* **Defendant's Arguments:** LAUSD argued against the amendment, claiming:
    * Delay in seeking amendment
    * Unfair prejudice due to the timing of the amendment close to trial
    * Lack of sufficient evidence to support the new allegations
* **Judge's Reasoning:** The judge rejected LAUSD's arguments, stating that:
    * The delay was reasonable given the new events occurred recently
    *  The amendment does not introduce radically different claims
    *  Plaintiff is not required to provide all evidence at this stage
    *  While some prejudice exists, it is not enough to deny the amendment.

**Legal Standards:**

* California Code of Civil Procedure § 473(a)(1) allows for amendments to pleadings "in the discretion of the court."
* California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324 outlines specific requirements for motions to amend pleadings, including the content of the motion and supporting declaration.

**Case Number:** 21STCV22706

**Plaintiff:** Nada Shaath

**Defendant:** Los Angeles Unified School District

**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023

**Tentative Ruling:**

Judge Theresa M. Traber has granted Plaintiff Nada Shaath's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint against Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District. Plaintiff is ordered to file a clean, stand-alone copy of the First Amended Complaint within five days of this order.

**Discussion:**

Plaintiff Nada Shaath filed an action for employment discrimination, harassment, and retaliation on June 17, 2021. She alleges that Defendant discriminated against her based on race, religion, and national origin, retaliated against her for complaining about discrimination and reporting unlawful activity, and failed to prevent others from discriminating against and harassing her.

Plaintiff has moved for leave to file a First Amended Complaint, which includes a clean copy of the proposed amended pleading, identifies the allegations to be added and deleted, and contains a redlined copy of the proposed pleading that identifies each addition and deletion as it occurs relative to the original Complaint.

Plaintiff's supporting declaration states that the amendments are necessary and proper to correct errors and omissions in the original Complaint and to allege facts supporting a claim for further retaliation arising from events that occurred in June and July 2023. The facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered during the relevant period, and amendment was not sought earlier because the facts were not known before that time.

Defendant argues that leave to amend should be denied because Plaintiff unjustifiably delayed seeking leave to amend and because Defendant will be prejudiced by amending the Complaint to add new material allegations at this late date. However, the Court is not persuaded by these arguments.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above discussion, Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint is granted, and Plaintiff is ordered to file a clean, stand-alone copy of the First Amended Complaint within five days of this order.
