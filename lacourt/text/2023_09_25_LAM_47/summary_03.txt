Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff Nada Shaath's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The motion seeks to add new allegations of retaliation and correct errors and omissions in the original Complaint. The judge finds that Plaintiff has complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1324 and that the proposed amendments are necessary and proper. The judge also rejects Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District's arguments that the motion should be denied due to unjustified delay, lack of sufficient evidence, and unfair prejudice. The judge orders Plaintiff to file a clean, stand-alone copy of the First Amended Complaint within five days of this order.
