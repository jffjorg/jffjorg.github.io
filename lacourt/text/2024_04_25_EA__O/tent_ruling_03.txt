The court will not engage in the merits of the petition until proper service
has been provided. Briefly, however, the petition indicates that copies of the
agreements are attached as Exhibits 2 and 3. (Petition p. 8:23-24.) Those
agreements, however, are not between Wallace Y. Fu Architect. Instead, they are
between MAP Realty Group, Inc. and California Opportunity Zone Fund, LP and
signed by Dr. Prasad Jeereddi and BaoBao Reeher. Accordingly, the first prong of CCP section
1281.2—that there be a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy—does not
seem to be complied with.
