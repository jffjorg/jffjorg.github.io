English-text summary: The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to bifurcate the issues relating to punitive damages from the liability issues. The court finds that bifurcation is mandatory to protect the jury from the influence of the defendant's financial condition. The court will consider the underlying liability case and determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud before considering punitive damages.
