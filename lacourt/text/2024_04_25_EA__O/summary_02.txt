And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has continued the petition to compel arbitration due to concerns about proper service. The case involves a dispute between MAP REALTY GROUP, INC. (the Plaintiff) and Wallace Y. Fu Architect (the Defendant) arising from a real estate project. The parties entered into two agreements for architectural services, but the Defendant failed to timely seek an extension to the conductural use permits and failed to submit renewed proposals by certain deadlines. The Plaintiff has made nine attempts at service, but it is unclear whether the Defendant has been properly served with notice of the motion. The Judge has continued the petition to a date to be determined, citing the need to ensure due process and prevent a violation of the Defendant's rights.
