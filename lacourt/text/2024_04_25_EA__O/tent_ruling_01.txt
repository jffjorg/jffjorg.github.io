DEFENDANT TROY-CSL LIGHTING, INC.’S MOTION TO BIFURCATE
RE PUNITIVE DAMAGES is GRANTED. 
 
Background
 
This is a wrongful termination case. Plaintiff Raymond
Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) alleges the following against Defendant TROY-CSL Lighting,
Inc. (“Defendant” or “Troy”): Plaintiff was hired by Defendant in 2012.
Plaintiff was terminated for violating Defendant’s sexual harassment policy,
which was an excuse to terminate Plaintiff for making various complaints to
Human Resources (HR) about workplace harassment. 
 
On March 25, 2021, Plaintiff filed suit for: 1.    
Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy 2.    
Breach Of Contract and Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing 3.    
Retaliation In Violation of Labor Code §§ 98.6 &
1102.5
 
On July 26, 2022, Defendant filed an MSJ. The hearing was on
6/20/23, after which the court took the MSJ under submission. 
 
On June 21, 2023, the court issued its final ruling denying
the motion. In its minute order, the court provided as follows: 
 
The matter set on October 19, 2023, at
the Pomona Courthouse in Department G at 10:30 a.m. for a Mandatory Settlement
Conference, the matter set on December 5, 2023, at the Pomona Courthouse in
Department O at 10:00 a.m. for a Final Status Conference, and the matter set on
January 9, 2024, at the Pomona Courthouse in Department O at 1:30 p.m. for Jury
Trial, are to remain as previously set.
 
On March 26, 2024, the instant motion was filed.
 
On April 18, 2024, the parties appeared for a final status
conference. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Defendant brings forth the motion pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure (CCP) section 3295. 
 
In turn, the statute, in relevant part, provides the
following:
 
The court shall, on application of any
defendant, preclude the admission of evidence of that defendant’s profits or
financial condition until after the trier of fact returns a
verdict for plaintiff awarding actual damages and finds that
a defendant is guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud in accordance with
Section 3294. Evidence of profit and financial condition shall be
admissible only as to the defendant or defendants found to be liable to the
plaintiff and to be guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud. Evidence of profit
and financial condition shall be presented to the same trier of fact that found
for the plaintiff and found one or more defendants guilty of malice,
oppression, or fraud. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 3295, subd. (d), emphasis
and underline added.) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant
requests to bifurcate on the issues relating to punitive damages until after
the liability issues have been decided and the jury has awarded actual damages
and made a finding of malice, oppression, or fraud. 
 
Here, according to the statute, bifurcation is mandatory. This avoids the
risk that defendant's financial condition might taint the jury's determination
of the underlying liability case and the issues of “oppression, fraud or
malice.” (Medo v. Superior court (Raymark Indus., Inc. (1988) 205
Cal.App.3d 64, 67-68.) Effectively, phase one of the trial determines whether
punitive damages are even warranted by considering the underlying liability
case and whether there is clear and convincing evidence that defendant is
guilty of malice, oppression or fraud. (Westrec Marina Mgmt., Inc. v.
Jardine Ins. Brokers Orange County, Inc. (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1050.)
Then, in phase two, once a jury returns a verdict in plaintiff’s favor
and a determination that punitive damages is warranted, the jury will be
presented with evidence of the defendant’s financial condition. (Adams v.
Murakami (1991) 54 Cal.3d 105, 115-116.) 
 
Thus, abiding by
the clear language of the statute and well-established law governing the issue,
the motion is GRANTED. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is granted.
