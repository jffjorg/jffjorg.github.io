And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and motion for new trial filed by the defendants, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. The defendants sought to vacate the entire award of punitive damages, arguing that there was no substantial evidence to support the verdict.

The judge denied the motion for JNOV, finding that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict on punitive damages. The judge also denied the defendants' request for a new trial on the grounds that the punitive damages award was excessive, finding that the award of $30 million was unconstitutional and that the reduced award of $10 million was proportionate to the actual harm and to the conduct of the defendants.

The judge also found that the defendants' claims of pretextual termination and lack of evidence of retaliation were without merit. The judge rejected the defendants' argument that the jury's verdict was influenced by improper evidence and found that the award of noneconomic damages was reasonable and supported by the evidence.

The judge conditionally denied the defendants' motion for new trial, providing that the plaintiff accepts the reduced punitive damages award of $10 million within 21 days. If the plaintiff declines the offer, the motion for new trial will be granted in part, allowing a new trial on punitive damages only.
