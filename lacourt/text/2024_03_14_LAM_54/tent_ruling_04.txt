T/R:     THE PETITION IS GRANTED.
 
PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please email the
courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
            The Court considers the moving
papers. No opposition has been received.
 
Compromises of disputed claims brought by minors are governed in part by
CCP § 372. The statute allows a guardian ad litem to appear in court on behalf
of a minor claimant and gives the guardian ad litem the power to compromise the
minor’s claim “with the approval of the court in which the action or proceeding
is pending.” A petition for court approval of a compromise must be verified by
the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has
any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise or covenant. (CRC Rule
7.950.)
 
CRC Rule 7.952(a) requires the attendance of the petitioner and claimant
at the hearing on the compromise of the claim unless the court for good causes
dispenses with their personal appearance.
 
Petitioner Kevin Cargill moves on behalf of claimant Mike’ia Canance for
approval of a settlement with Defendants Farcoh 126 LLC, Joseph Cohen, and
Rescap Securities Holdings, Co. in which minor claimant would receive $5,000.00
out of a total settlement of $295,000.00. No attorney’s fees or costs will be
deducted from the minor claimant’s settlement amounts. Minor claimant’s net
proceeds are $5,000.00. The proceeds will be placed in a blocked account.
 
This is a landlord-tenant action. The individual settlement is fair in
light of the alleged injuries sustained by claimant.
 
The petition is GRANTED.
