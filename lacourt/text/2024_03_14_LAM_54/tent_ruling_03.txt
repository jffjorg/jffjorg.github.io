counsel for Defendants Brian & Natalie Cronin, ARC-IV, LLC, ARC-V, Inc.,
Orthop. 
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:      THE MOTION IS GRANTED. COUNSEL TO FILE
PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER ON DEFENDANT WITHIN 5 DAYS OF NOTICE OF RULING.

COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please email the
courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers. No
opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue
an order allowing an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to
the client.  (CCP § 284.)  The attorney may withdraw from representation
as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client’s
interest—i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in the
litigation.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see
California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Attorney Jay M.
Spillane of Spillane Trial Group PLC, counsel of record for Defendants ARC-IV,
LLC, ARC-V, Inc., Natalie Gonzalez Cronin, Briaan M. Cronin, and Orthopros, seeks
to withdraw from representation of Defendants.  Counsel states that several invoices remain
outstanding and unpaid, there has been a serious breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship, and the clients have not executed and returned
substitutions of counsel.  (Spillane
Decl. ¶ 2.)  
 
Trial is not for five
months; no prejudice will result from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel has
complied with CRC 3.1362.
 
There is good cause
for counsel’s withdrawal. The motion is GRANTED.  
 
Since ARC-V, Inc. and
Orthopros, Inc. are corporations, they must retain legal counsel.  (See Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic
Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  An OSC re: ARC-V, Inc. and Orthopros, Inc.’s Representation
will be scheduled for April 17, 2024 at 9:00 am.
