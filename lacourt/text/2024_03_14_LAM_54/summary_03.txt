And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Jay M. Spillane, attorney for the defendants. The motion is granted because there is good cause for counsel's withdrawal, as several invoices remain outstanding and unpaid, there has been a serious breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, and the clients have not executed and returned substitutions of counsel. The judge notes that counsel has complied with the requirements of California Rule of Professional Conduct 3.1362 and that no prejudice will result from counsel's withdrawal, as trial is not for five months. The judge orders counsel to file proof of service of the order within five days of notice of the ruling and to be relieved from representation upon filing of the proof of service. Additionally, the judge schedules an Order to Show Cause re: representation of ARC-V, Inc. and Orthopros, Inc. for April 17, 2024, as these corporations must retain legal counsel.
