BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Alexander Flamer IV alleges that he and others were non-exempt
employees of Defendant Advertise Purple. Plaintiff claims that Defendant
violated the Labor Code, Industrial Welfare Commission wage orders, and the
Business and Professions Code. 
 
Before the Court is Plaintiff’s motion to approve PAGA settlement.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.    Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Plaintiff’s request for
judicial notice of LWDA Comments of LWDA Regarding Proposed PAGA Settlement and
the Court’s December 4, 2023 Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Approval of
PAGA Settlement and Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, Costs, and Service Awards is
GRANTED.
 
B.    PAGA Settlement
 
Defendants have agreed to pay a Gross Settlement Amount of $82,500.00 to
settle the action.
 
1.    The Settlement Falls Within
the Range of Possible Approval
 
“The PAGA is limited to the recovery of civil penalties.” (Villacres
v. ABM Industries Inc. (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 562, 579.) “Under the PAGA,
the civil penalty for an initial violation is $100 per employee per pay period,
and the penalty for each subsequent violation is $200 per employee per pay
period.” (Villacres, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at 580.)
 
Plaintiff contends that approximately 50 aggrieved employees during the
PAGA period worked a total of approximately 1,000 pay periods from May 2021 to
July 2022. (Curtis Decl. ¶¶ 20, 48.) Using that data, and assuming a 100%
violation rate where Plaintiff could obtain the initial civil penalties
available under the PAGA, Plaintiff predicted Advertise Purple’s total exposure
for civil penalties would be approximately $100,000 (1,000 pay periods x $100
civil penalty) without stacking; and $828,300 with stacking (i.e., the
tabulating and aggregating of all potential penalties). (Custis Decl., ¶¶ 49,
71.) Plaintiff argues a gross settlement amount (“GSA”) of $82,500.00 or 19
percent of the predicted realistic total recovery of $438,650.00 with stacking,
and 82.5 percent of the maximum recovery without staking, is reasonable. 
 
2.    The Settlement Is Fair,
Reasonable, and Adequate
 
The Court finds that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  It was reached through arm’s-length
bargaining, based on sufficient discovery and investigation to allow counsel
and the court to act intelligently, and counsel is experienced in similar
litigation. 
 
The general release
is fair and reasonable under the statute. The GSA is sufficient to remediate
the LWDA and aggrieved employees. 
 
3.    The Service Award is Fair
and Reasonable
 
Plaintiff seeks the Court’s approval of a $1,000 Service Payment for his
service to the State of California and the other Aggrieved Employees and the
risks incurred in serving as Plaintiff in a PAGA action. This payment is
appropriate.
 
C. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs 
 
Plaintiff requests $27,497.25 in attorneys’
fees, which is 33.33% of the GSA. Plaintiff also seeks an award of $7,886.88
for reasonably incurred costs, including filing fees, mediation fees, and
postage. 
 
The Court finds the requested attorneys’ fees
and costs to be reasonable. Plaintiff’s Counsel shall receive $27,497.25 and $7,886.88
in costs. 
 
D. Appointment of the Administrator and
Approval of the Settlement Administration Costs
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court appoint Ilym
as the Administrator and approve Settlement Administration Costs in the amount
of $3,995.00. (Custis Decl., ¶ 94.) The parties agreed to use Ilym to
administer the settlement, and Ilym agreed to conduct the administration for
the capped costs of $3,995.00. 
 
            The Court finds this is reasonable.
 
E. Approval of the PAGA Payment Letter
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court approve the
PAGA Payment Letter even though PAGA does not require notice to the Aggrieved
Employees of the Settlement, which advises the Aggrieved Employees about this action
and the Settlement. (Custis Decl., Ex. B, Ex.1.) 
 
            The Court grants Plaintiff’s
request.
 
F. Conclusion
 
The Settlement
Agreement is approved, and the motion is GRANTED.
