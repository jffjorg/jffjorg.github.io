And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"On May 2, 2024, a motion was filed and set for hearing on May 30, 2024. However, the motion was not accompanied by a proof of service, which must be filed at least 5 court days before the hearing. The court will inquire of the Plaintiff on the day of the hearing whether service was made. If the court is not satisfied that service has been made, it will continue the hearing. Additionally, the court notes that VVS has agreed to settle Villagrana's individual claims alleged in arbitration, which is set forth in a separate individual settlement agreement."
