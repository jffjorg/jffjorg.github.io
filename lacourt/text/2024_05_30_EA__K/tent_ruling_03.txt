 Case Number:  23PSCV00785    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff
Continental Casualty Company’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff Continental Casualty Company
(“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On May 5,
2020, William Kellenberg (“Kellenberg”) was a guest at Springhill Suites by
Marriot (“Hotel”) in Arcadia, which is owned by Plaintiff’s insured. Kellenberg
caused a fire as a result of smoking in bed and leaving a candle unattended,
which caused extensive damage to the Hotel.
On March 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint, asserting a cause of action against Kellenberg and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
General
Negligence
On May 9, 2024, Kellenberg’s default was
entered.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment is set for May 30, 2024.
Discussion
Plaintiffs’ Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff has failed to provide the court with a
summary of the case, as per California Rules of Court (“CRC”) rule 3.1800,
subdivision (a)(1).
2.                 
Plaintiff’s calculation of interest declaration
erroneously references a “loan principal.” This case does not involve a loan.
It appears to the court that prejudgment interest should be calculated pursuant
to Civil Code § 3287 at 7%/annum. Plaintiff is to provide the court with any
authority to the contrary. 
3.                 
Plaintiff has not provided any incident and/or police
reports and/or photographic 
evidence regarding the incident,
nor has it provided the court with any documentary evidence reflecting how
damages were calculated.
