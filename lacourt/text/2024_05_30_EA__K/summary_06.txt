And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denied Ferreira's "Ex Parte Application for Determination of Good Faith Settlement" and set a hearing for May 30, 2024. Lindsay filed a "Notice of Non-Opposition" on May 16, 2024. A supplemental declaration from Ulloa was filed, revealing that prior to the January 24, 2024 mediation with Sarmiento, this matter has been mediated on three prior occasions with the Products Defendants participating. Ulloa informed the Products Defendants' counsel in December 2023 and January 2024 of the Construction Defendants' plans to mediate with Sarmiento and advised them to participate.
