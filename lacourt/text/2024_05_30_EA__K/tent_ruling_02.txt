[1]              The motion was filed May 2, 2024
and set for hearing on May 30, 2024. The motion was not accompanied by a proof
of service. Plaintiff has not filed a proof of service, to date (i.e., as of
May 24, 2024, 4:01 p.m.) California Rules of Court rule 3.1300, subdivision (c)
provides that proof of service of moving papers must be filed no later than 5
court days before the hearing. Article III, Paragraph 8 of the parties’
“Private Attorneys General Act Settlement Agreement” provides, in relevant
part, that “Plaintiff’s Counsel shall be responsible for preparing a Joint
Stipulation for Court Approval of PAGA Settlement, or if the Court requires, a
Motion for Approval of the Settlement (‘Motion’) and providing Defense
Counsel with an opportunity to propose revisions to the Motion prior to filing.
. . Plaintiff’s Counsel will serve the Motion on Defendant’s Counsel. .
.” (emphasis added). The court will inquire of Plaintiff on the day of the
hearing whether service was made. To the extent the court is not satisfied that
service has been made, it will continue the hearing.

Villagrana’s individual claims alleged in arbitration, which is set forth in a
separate individual settlement agreement. (Adams Decl., ¶ 46).
