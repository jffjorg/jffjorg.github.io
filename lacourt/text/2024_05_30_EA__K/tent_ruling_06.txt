[1]              On March 29, 2024, Ferreira filed
an “Ex Parte Application for Determination of Good Faith Settlement” (“Ex
Parte”); on April 2, 2024 the court denied the Ex Parte Application and set a “Hearing on Motion—Other Re: Termination of Good Faith
Settlement” for May 30, 2024. [Note: The reference to “Hearing on
Motion—Other Re: Termination of Good Faith Settlement” appears to be a clerical
error and should be styled as a “Motion for Determination of Good Faith
Settlement”]. Notice was waived.

Non-Opposition” on May 16, 2024.
