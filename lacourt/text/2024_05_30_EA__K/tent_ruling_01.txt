Legal Standard
Labor Code § 2699, subdivision (l)(2) states: “The superior
court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed
pursuant to this part [Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004
(“PAGA”)].  The proposed settlement shall
be submitted to the [Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”)] at the
same time that it is submitted to the court.”
Any settlement of any civil action filed under PAGA must be
“fair and adequate in view of the purposes and policies of the statute.”  (O’Connor
v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2016) 201 F.Supp.3d 1110, 1135.)
Seventy-five
percent of all PAGA penalties must be paid to the LWDA.  (See Lab. Code § 2699(i) [“Except as provided
in subdivision (j), civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees shall be
distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce Development
Agency for enforcement of labor laws, including the administration of this
part, and for education of
employers and
employees about their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be
continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the
agency for those purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees.”].) 
 
Labor Code §
2699(g)(1) provides, in relevant part: “Any employee who prevails in any action
shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs . . .
.”  (Lab. Code § 2699(g)(1).)
Discussion
Villagrana requests entry of an order granting of the
parties’ “Private Attorneys General Act Settlement Agreement” (“Agreement”).
Terms of the
Settlement Agreement
The Agreement is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of
Christopher Adams (“Adams”). Citations herein are to provisions of the
Agreement unless otherwise noted. The essential terms of the Agreement are as
follows:
•           Definition of Aggrieved Employees: “Aggrieved
Employees” means “all 
current and former hourly-paid or
non-exempt employees who worked at least 
one pay period for Defendant in the
State of California during the PAGA Period, 
i.e., from September 14, 2021,
through Court Approval of the Settlement 
Agreement.” (Section I, ¶ 2).
•  
        Definition of PAGA Period: “PAGA Period” means “the time period
from 
September 14, 2021
through Court Approval of the Settlement Agreement.” 
(Section I, ¶ 20).

•  
        Definition of PAGA Pay Period: “PAGA Pay Period” means “any Pay
Period 
which an Aggrieved
Employee worked for Defendant for at least one day during 
the PAGA Period. (Section
I, ¶ 18).
•  
        Definition of Gross Settlement Amount (“GSA”): The GSA is $275,000.00 
(Section I, ¶ 10), which includes the
following:
º           Attorney
Fees and Costs: Attorney’s fees to
be paid to Plaintiff’s 
counsel are not to exceed 1/3 of the GSA (i.e., $91,667.67. (Section
I, ¶ 10). Costs are $13,137.41. (Id.) 
º           Employee PAGA Portion: The
“Employee PAGA Portion” (i.e., 
$38,673.98) is the “amount to be
distributed to Aggrieved Employees, on a pro rata basis,” consisting of 25% of
the PAGA Penalties Amount (Id.; Section III, ¶ 3(d).)
º           Calculation:
Each Employee Payment (i.e., “the
PAGA Penalty Payment that will be distributed to Aggrieved Employees as per
Article IV.3) will 
be calculated by Administrator (defined below) by
dividing $38,673.98 by the total number of PAGA Period Pay Periods worked by all Aggrieved Employees during the PAGA Period and multiplying the result
by each Aggrieved Employee’s PAGA Period Pay Periods. (Section III, ¶ 3(d)(i).)
º           Plaintiff’s
Service Award: Villagrana will receive
$10,000.00 as an 
enhancement award. (Section I, ¶ 22). The Service Award
is in addition to any Individual PAGA Payment to which Villagrana is entitled.
(Id.) Administrator (defined below) will issue Villagrana an IRS
Form 1099 in connection with this payment. (Id.)[2]
º           Settlement
Administration Fee: Settlement administration fees are not to exceed $5,550.00
(Section I, ¶ 10).
º           LWDA
Payment: Seventy-five percent (75%) of the PAGA Penalties (i.e.,
$116,021.98) will be distributed to the LDWA. (Section I, ¶ 12; Section III, ¶ 3(d).
•  
        Definition of Net Settlement Amount (“NSA”): The NSA is $154,695.92 
(Section III, ¶ 3(d)), which includes the
Employee PAGA Portion and the LWDA 
Payment.
•           Claims Process: There is no claims process.
•           Settlement Administrator: ILYM Group,
Inc. (“ILYM”) is the third-party 
settlement administrator. (Art. I,
¶ 25.) ILYM will be responsible for establishing a Qualified Settlement Fund for
purposes of administering the Agreement (Section IV, ¶ 1) and for calculating
and distributing all settlement checks. (Section III, ¶ 3.)
 
No later than 21 business days
after the “Effective Date” (i.e., “the date by when 
both of the following have
occurred: (a) the Court enters a Judgment on its Order 
Approving the PAGA Settlement and
(b) the Judgment is final. The Judgment is 
final as of the day the Court
enters Judgment”), VVS will provide ILYM with a list 
of the Aggrieved Employees in a
computer-readable format, which will include 
each Aggrieved Employee's full
name, last known mailing address, start and end 
date(s) of employment or total pay
periods worked for VVS in California during 
the PAGA Period, and social
security number, to the extent available from VVS’s records. (Section IV, ¶ 2).
 
No later than 30 business days
from the Effective Date, VVS will fund the GSA 
into an account established by
ILYM for administration and distribution. (Section
IV,
¶ 3). No later than 21 calendar days after receipt of the GSA from VVS,
ILYM 
will mail the Employee Payments
under cover letter to each of the identified 
Aggrieved Employees. The cover
letter will be provided to the Aggrieved 
Employees in both English and
Spanish. Prior to mailing the cover letter, ILYM 
will check the addresses provided
in the Aggrieved Employees List using the 
United States Postal Service's
National Change of Address database and update 
the addresses for known address
changes. If any of the mailings to the 
Aggrieved Employees of their cover
letter and Employee Payments are returned 
as undeliverable within 30
calendar days of mailing, ILYM will have 5 calendar 
days after it receives the
returned undeliverable mail to search for a more current 
address for the Aggrieved Employee
(via a skip trace or other reasonable method) and re-mail the cover letter and
Employee Payments to any alternative or updated 
address obtained. (Section IV, ¶
2).
 
ILYM will also distribute the LWDA
Payment, attorney’s fees and costs and administration costs within 21 calendar
days after receipt of the GSA from VVS. 
(Section IV, ¶ 3).
•           Uncashed Funds: Each Aggrieved Employee will be issued
one check for his 
or her Employee
Payment which will expire 180 calendar days from the date the 
checks are issued by ILYM. After
the 180 day-period, ILYM will cancel all checks that have not been cashed or
deposited and remit funds associated with such canceled checks to the State
Controller's Office, Unclaimed Property Division in the name associated with
each Aggrieved Employee whose Employee Payment checks are canceled. (Id.)
•           Notice to LWDA: Concurrently with this motion, Villagrana
provided a copy 
of the Agreement
to the LAWDA and informed the LWDA of the May 30, 2024 
hearing. (Adams
Decl., ¶ 32, Exh. D.)
•           Release: “PAGA Released Claims” means “any and all claims, rights, demands,
liabilities and causes of action for civil penalties under the PAGA asserted,
or that 
could have been asserted in the
Complaint, including, but not limited to, those under California Labor Code §§
1197, 1197.1, 1198, 510, 558, 1194, 1197.1, 1198, 226.7, 512(a), 226, 201, 202,
203, 2802, 1198, 2698 et seq., the applicable IWC Wage Order and California
Civil Code § 1542 release as to those sections, that arose during the PAGA
Period.” (Section I, ¶ 21). 
 
“Released Parties”
means “Valley Vista Services, Inc., and each of its former, 
present, and
future parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and related entities, and each of 
their former, present, and future
owners, directors, officers, employees, shareholders, members, attorneys,
insurers, predecessors, successors, assigns or subsidiaries.” (Section I, ¶
23).
•           Escalator Clause: VVS estimates, based on a review of its records to date, that 
there are 13,000 PAGA Pay Periods. If the
total number of PAGA Pay Periods 
increases by more than 10%, VVS has the option to either (1) increase the
GSA on a pro-rata basis equal to the increase in the number of Pay Periods
worked by 
Aggrieved Employees above 14,300 or (2) have
the PAGA Period end on the date 
when 14,300 Pay Periods is reached. (Section
I, ¶ 12). 
Fairness and Adequacy of
Settlement
“Despite the fact that a representative action under PAGA is
not a class action and is instead a type of qui tam action, a standard
requiring the trial court to determine independently whether a PAGA settlement
is fair and reasonable is appropriate.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 76 [internal quotations and citations omitted].) “[A] trial court
should evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable,
and adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law
violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.
(Id. at 77.)
Arm’s
Length Bargaining Process
On March 29, 2024, the parties participated in a full-day
mediation conducted by Michael D. Young, who is “well-respected and
knowledgeable in wage-and-hour actions and has additional specific expertise in
PAGA actions.” (Adams Decl., ¶ 16). The parties discussed the claims and
defenses at-length, and each side provided the other with several settlement
proposals before the agreement was reached, with Young’s assistance. (Id.,
¶ 19). The parties only reached a settlement after months of negotiations and
additional informal discovery. (Id.)
            Sufficiency of Investigation and
Discovery
On September 14, 2022, Villagrana served a written PAGA
Notice to both the LWDA and VVS. (Adams Decl.,
¶ 12, Exh. E). The LWDA did not respond to the letter. (Id., ¶ 13.) The
parties conducted “extensive formal discovery,” including initial disclosures,
written discovery, and Villagrana’s deposition. (Id., ¶ 16). Prior to
litigation, VVS produced Villagrana’s personnel file and wage statements. (Id.,
¶ 17). In addition to formal discovery and in anticipation to mediation,
Villagrana’s counsel informally requested that VVS produce its relevant
policies, procedures, and practices and data demonstrating estimated
representative size, hours worked, workweeks (pay periods), hourly-rates, and
total compensation of non-exempt employees. (Id.) In response, VVS
produced: (1) the written policies and practices related to meal periods, rest
periods, overtime, wage statements, payment of final wages, and any other
wage-and-hour issues; (2) sample time records and wage statements; and (3) data
demonstrating the total number of aggrieved employees and total number of pay
periods (i.e., approximately 330 employees and approximately 13,000 PAGA pay
periods). (Id.)
            Experience of Counsel
Adams has satisfactorily attested as to his experience in
employment representative and class actions involving wage-and-hour claims. (See
Adams Decl.). Adams submits that the
Settlement fulfills the purpose of the PAGA statute, is within the accepted
range of recoveries for this types of litigation, is fair and reasonable under
the circumstances, and in the best interests of Plaintiff, the State of
California and other Allegedly Aggrieved Employees. (Id., ¶ 44-45.)
            Strengths and Weaknesses of Plaintiff’s Case
Adams has set forth the strengths and weaknesses of Villagrana’s
case in Paragraphs 37-40 of his declaration. Adams opines that the total
exposure in this case is $390,000.00 (i.e., 3,900 pay periods x $100 penalty
per pay period). (Adams Decl., ¶ 40). Adams notes that, had the case not
settled, there would be costs of further litigation and risks to recovery. (Id.,
¶ 44).
Further, Adams represents that, from the inception of the
litigation, VSS indicated that it would aggressively litigate this matter. (Id.).
VSS “vehemently denied” Villagrana’s allegations. (Id., ¶ 41). VSS argued that
that each employee received a full thirty-minute meal period and all of their
rest period. And claimed that the timecards evidenced all employees who worked
shifts longer than six hours clocked in and out for lunches of at least 30
minutes or longer. (Id.) VSS attempted to demonstrate its method to calculate
the overtime pay complied with the method approved by the DLSE and also argued
that its policies and procedures with regards to meal and rest breaks complied
with California wage-and-hour law. (Id.) VSS also argued that it would
be unmanageable to try the instant action as a representative action. (Id.,
¶ 42). Villagrana also considered VVS’s position that PAGA penalties are
discretionary in nature and that, even if she were successful at trial, the
court has discretion to significantly decrease the amount of damages awarded in
a PAGA action. (Id., ¶ 43).
The court finds that the settlement is “fair, reasonable,
and adequate in view of PAGA’s purposes,” based on the foregoing. The
distribution of PAGA penalties complies with Labor Code section 2699,
subdivision (i).
Scope of the Release
“PAGA Released
Claims” means “any and all claims, rights, demands, liabilities and
causes of action for civil penalties under the PAGA asserted, or that could
have been asserted in the Complaint, including, but not limited to, those under
California Labor Code §§ 1197, 1197.1, 1198, 510, 558, 1194, 1197.1, 1198,
226.7, 512(a), 226, 201, 202, 203, 2802, 1198, 2698 et seq., the applicable IWC
Wage Order and California Civil Code § 1542 release as to those sections, that
arose during the PAGA Period.” (Adams Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A, Section I, ¶ 21).
“Released Parties” means “Valley Vista Services, Inc., and each of its former,
present, and future parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and related entities,
and each of their former, present, and future owners, directors, officers,
employees, shareholders, members, attorneys, insurers, predecessors,
successors, assigns or subsidiaries.” (Id., ¶ 2, Exh. A, Section I, ¶
23).
“Because an aggrieved employee’s action under the Labor Code
Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 functions as a substitute for an action
brought by the government itself, a judgment in that action binds all those,
including nonparty aggrieved employees, who would be bound by a judgment in an
action brought by the government. The act authorizes a representative action
only for the purpose of seeking statutory penalties for Labor Code violations .
. .” (Arias v. Superior Court (2009)
46 Cal.4th 969, 986.)
The court finds that the release is fair, reasonable and
adequate under the statute.
Notice
“PAGA has no notice requirements for unnamed aggrieved
employees, nor may such employees opt out of a PAGA action.” (Baumann v. Chase Inv. Services Corp. (9th
Cir. 2014) 747 F.3d 1117, 1122.)
Again, no later than 21 business days after the “Effective
Date,” VVS will provide ILYM with a list of the Aggrieved Employees in a
computer-readable format, which will include each Aggrieved Employee's full
name, last known mailing address, start and end date(s) of employment or total
pay periods worked for VVS in California during the PAGA Period, and social
security number, to the extent available from VVS’s records. (Id., ¶ 2,
Exh. A, Section IV, ¶ 2).
No later than 21 calendar days after receipt of the GSA from
VVS, ILYM will mail the Employee Payments under cover letter to each of the
identified Aggrieved Employees. The cover letter will be provided to the
Aggrieved Employees in both English and Spanish. Prior to mailing the cover
letter, ILYM will check the addresses provided in the Aggrieved Employees List
using the United States Postal Service's National Change of Address database
and update the addresses for known address changes. If any of the mailings to
the Aggrieved Employees of their cover letter and Employee Payments are
returned as undeliverable within 30 calendar days of mailing, ILYM will have 5
calendar days after it receives the returned undeliverable mail to search for a
more current address for the Aggrieved Employee (via a skip trace or other
reasonable method) and re-mail the cover letter and Employee Payments to any
alternative or updated address obtained. (Id.). Each Aggrieved Employee
will be issued one check for his or her Employee Payment which will expire 180
calendar days from the date the checks are issued by ILYM. After the 180
day-period, ILYM will cancel all checks that have not been cashed or deposited
and remit funds associated with such canceled checks to the State Controller's
Office, Unclaimed Property Division in the name associated with each Aggrieved
Employee whose Employee Payment checks are canceled. (Id.) (Id.,
¶ 2, Exh. A, Section IV, ¶ 3).
The court finds that the foregoing procedure is appropriate.
Attorney Fees and
Costs
The Agreement provides that attorney’s fees to be paid to Villagrana’s counsel are not to exceed 1/3 (i.e.,
$91,666.67) of the GSA. (Adams Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A, Section III, ¶ 3).
The court finds the requested attorney’s fees and costs to
be reasonable pursuant to the “common fund” method. (Lafitte v. Robert Half
Intern. Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 486.).
Enhancement
Award 
Villagrana’s will receive $10,000.00 as an enhancement payment. (Adams Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A,
Section I, ¶ 22). The court finds this award to be reasonable and adequately
supported by Villagrana’s declaration.
Administration
Costs 
Settlement Administration Costs are $5,500.00. (Id.,
¶ 2, Exh. A, Section I, ¶ 10). The court finds these costs to be reasonable.
Conclusion
The motion is granted.
