And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is a lawsuit filed by Betty Nottoli's estate against Sunwest Bank, alleging that the bank was negligent and breached its contract with Nottoli. The court has sustained the bank's demurrer, which means that the court has ruled that the complaint does not state a valid cause of action. The court has also denied the bank's motion to strike portions of the complaint as moot. The court will hear from the plaintiffs' counsel as to whether they wish to amend their complaint and which causes of action they intend to pursue.
