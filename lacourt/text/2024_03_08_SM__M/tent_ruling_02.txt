CASE NO.:                23SMCV01492
MOTION:                  Motion
for Leave to Amend
HEARING DATE:   3/8/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party
wishes to amend a pleading after an answer has been filed, or after a demurrer
has been filed and after the hearing on the demurrer, or if he or she has
already amended the pleading as a matter of course, the party must obtain permission
from the court before amendment. (CCP §§ 473(a)(1), 576.) 
 
Motions
for leave to amend the pleadings are directed to the sound discretion of the
court. “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading . . ..” (CCP § 473(a)(1); see CCP §
576.) Policy favors liberally granting leave to amend so that all disputed
matters between the parties may be resolved. (See Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) Absent prejudice to the adverse party, the court may permit amendments
to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.”
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761 [internal quotes omitted].) Where leave is
sought to add entirely new claims, the court may grant leave to amend if the
new claims are based on the same general set of facts, and the amendment will
not prejudice the opposing party. (Austin
v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-602; Glaser v. Meyers (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, 777 [holding
trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting amendment of complaint,
which originally alleged constructive eviction, to allege retaliatory eviction
where the new claim was based on the same general set of facts].)
 
Although
denial is rarely justified, a judge has discretion to deny leave to amend if
the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced
the opposing party. (Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490). An opposing party is prejudiced where the
amendment would necessitate a trial delay along with a loss of critical
evidence, added preparation expense, increased burden of discovery, etc. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 [leave properly
denied where plaintiff sought leave on the eve of trial, nearly two years after
the complaint was originally filed and gave no explanation for the delay which
prejudiced defendant who did not discover or depose many of the witnesses who would
support the new allegations and had not marshaled evidence in opposition of the
new allegations].)
 
Procedurally,
a motion for leave to amend must state with particularity what allegations are
to be amended. Namely, it must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and/or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) The motion must be accompanied
by a declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b).) The motion must also be
accompanied by the proposed amended pleading, numbered to differentiate it from
the prior pleadings or amendments. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1).) It is within the
court’s discretion to require compliance with Rule 3.1324 before granting leave
to amend. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.)
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiff Devlin Ricardo Andrino
(Molina) moves for leave to file a proposed First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). (Topchyan
Decl., Exs. 5, 6.) Plaintiffs seek to amend the complaint to add further
information on the named Defendants listed on the causes of actions (including
the recently identified doe defendants), correct the name of the Plaintiff, and
add facts regarding the incident. Counsel provided, in detail, the effect and
specific changes of the proposed FAC. (Id., ¶¶ 8-41.) The amendments seek to
clarify and amend allegations regarding the dangerous condition, theories of
Defendant’s liability. 
 
Counsel explains that these facts
were not alleged earlier because of prior counsel’s failure. On January 18,
2024, current counsel substituted into the case. (Topchyan Decl., ¶4.) Counsel
noticed that the complaint had errors, among other things improperly joined parties
and missing parties. Counsel seeks to correct these errors with this amendment.
The Court notes that counsel does not present when these facts were discovered.
That said, the Court agrees that the proposed amendments will better frame the
legal and factual basis of the action and clarify the parties to the action. 
 
The Court further does not find any
significant prejudice to Defendant City of Santa Monica. The amendments against
the City do not alter or expand the nature of the legal or factual issues
presented by the initial complaint. Defendant’s contentions on the sufficiency
of the pleadings should be addressed in the context of a procedurally proper
challenge to the pleadings, such as a demurrer, motion to strike or summary
judgment. Further, much of the amendments are mere housekeeping, such as adding
the doe defendants’ names, clarifying the actions against them, and correcting
Plaintiff’s name. The Court observes no prejudice at all to the present
Defendant from such amendments. 
 
Additionally, this action is less
than one year old, only one Defendant has answered, and no trial is set. Therefore,
amendment is favored here. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
