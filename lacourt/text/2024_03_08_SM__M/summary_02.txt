Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add further information on the named defendants, correct the name of the plaintiff, and add facts regarding the incident. The amendments will better frame the legal and factual basis of the action and clarify the parties to the action. The judge does not find any significant prejudice to the defendant, as the amendments do not alter or expand the nature of the legal or factual issues presented by the initial complaint. The judge notes that the plaintiff's current counsel substituted into the case and noticed errors in the complaint, and that the amendments are mere housekeeping, such as adding the names of doe defendants and clarifying the actions against them. The court agrees that the proposed amendments are necessary and proper and that the delay in seeking the amendments was not unreasonable.
