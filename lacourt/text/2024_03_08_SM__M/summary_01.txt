And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the judge considers a motion by plaintiff Eliyahu Cohen to compel defendant Eymun Talasazan to provide further verified responses to special interrogatories regarding Talasazan's contact information. The court finds that Talasazan's previous responses were evasive and incomplete, and that he has failed to provide a valid mailing address as required by a prior court order. The judge grants the motion and orders Talasazan to provide further responses within 10 days. The court also imposes sanctions on Talasazan in the amount of $3,310.00, payable within 30 days, in favor of plaintiff Cohen.
