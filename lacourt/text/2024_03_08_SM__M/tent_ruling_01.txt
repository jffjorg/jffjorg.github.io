to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories

Legal
Standard
 
            In
the absence of contrary court order, a civil litigant’s right to discovery is
broad. “[A]ny party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged,
that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action . . . if
the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (CCP § 2017.010;
see Davies v. Superior Court
(1984) 36 Cal.3d 291, 301.) “For discovery purposes, information is relevant if
it ‘might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for
trial, or facilitating settlement.’ [Citation] Admissibility is not the test
and information, unless privileged, is discoverable if it might reasonably lead
to admissible evidence. [Citation] These rules are applied liberally in favor
of discovery.” (Gonzales v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539,
1546.) 
 
A motion to compel further responses to form (FI) or
specially prepared interrogatories (SI) may be brought if the responses
contain: (1) answers that are evasive or incomplete; (2) an unwarranted or
insufficiently specific exercise of an option to produce documents in lieu of a
substantive response; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(CCP § 2030.300(a).)   
 
            A motion to compel further must be
noticed within 45 days of the
service of a response, or any supplemental response, or on or before any
specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party
have agreed in writing. Otherwise, the propounding party waives any right
to compel further response to the demand. (See, e.g., CCP § 2031.310(c).)
 
            Motions to compel further responses
must always be accompanied by a meet-and confer-declaration (per CCP §
2016.040) demonstrating a “reasonable and good faith attempt an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (CCP §§ 2030.300(b),
2031.310(b)(2), 2033.290(b).) They must also be accompanied by a separate
statement containing the requests and the responses, verbatim, as well as
reasons why a further response is warranted. (CRC, rule 3.1345(a).) The
separate statement must also be complete in itself; no extrinsic materials may
be incorporated by reference. (CRC rule 3.1345(c).)
 
            If a timely motion to compel has
been filed, the¿burden is on the responding party¿to justify any objection or
failure fully to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220–221 [addressing a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories];
see also¿Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245,
255.) 
 
Analysis
 
Judgment Creditor Eliyahu Cohen
moves for an order compelling Judgment Debtor Eymun Talasazan to provide
further verified responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s post-judgment
Special Interrogatories, Set One (SROGs), Numbers 27, 34, 36, and 37. Plaintiff
requests sanctions in the amount of $6,277.66 against Defendant and his counsel
of record, John Sullivan.
 
SROG nos. 27, 34, 36, and 37 pertain
to Talasazan’s contact information. Cohen explains that Talasazan has claimed
his parents as creditors, but refused to provide their contact information,
citing privacy concerns. The Court overruled his objections and ordered him to
provide their contact information, including their address. (4/21/23 Minute
Order.) Talasazan still refuses to answer the question. The only address Talasazan
provided for them is a wrong address, namely, address to the middle of the
intersection between Doheny Dr. and Santa Monica Blvd. in West Hollywood.
(Moghadam Decl., ¶¶ 13-16.) Talasazan does not oppose the motion. Furthermore, Talasazan’s
counsel disclaims responsibility, stating that he has been unable to obtain an
address from Talasazan. Per the prior court order, Talasazan is required to
provide a valid mailing address. Given the unrebutted evidence that the
proffered address is invalid, Talasazan’s court-ordered responses are evasive
and incomplete. Thus, Talasazan must provide a further response to the above
SROGs.
 
Sanctions are mandatory against Talasazan. The Court must
sanction any party that unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response, “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (See, e.g., CCP, § 2030.300(d).) JD does not justify
his evasive response. 
 
Plaintiff claims $6,027.66 in reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs in connection with these proceedings. (Moghadam Decl.
¶¶ 17-18.) This represents 2.4 hours of reviewing Defendant’s supplemental and
further supplemental responses, and meeting and conferring with defense counsel
about those responses; 5.5 hours preparing the instant motion; an estimated 3.0
hours reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply; and an estimated 1.0 hour
preparing for and arguing at the hearing, all at a rate of $500 per hour.
(Moghadam Decl. ¶¶ 19-22.) The Court finds the hours expended somewhat
inflated. Further, there was no opposition, and therefore no need to reply. Using
the lodestar method, the Court finds that a reasonable fee in this matter would
be $3,250.00, plus costs. Therefore, sanctions are imposed against Talasazan in the amount
of $3,310.00 in favor of Plaintiff.  Sanctions
are payable within 30 days.


Further responses are ordered within 10
days.
