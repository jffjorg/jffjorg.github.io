And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants in part the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions or, alternatively, lesser sanctions. The court denies the plaintiff's request for terminating sanctions. The court grants in part the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,650.00, representing 3 hours of work on the motion at the rate of $550/hour. The court orders that defendants comply with their discovery obligations under the court's October 30, 2023, and February 1, 2024, orders forthwith. The court sustains the plaintiff's evidentiary objections to the declarations of Paul Marks and Nazrin Yazdi in opposition to the motion for terminating sanctions on the grounds of hearsay. The court finds that defendants have failed to comply with discovery orders issued by the court and that such failure was willful. However, the court does not find that terminating sanctions are appropriate. The court takes an incremental approach to discovery sanctions under Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.
