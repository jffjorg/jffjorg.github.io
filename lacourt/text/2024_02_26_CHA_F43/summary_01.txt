```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for summary judgment is denied in its entirety. The court finds triable issues of material fact regarding the basis of a special duty of care as a matter of law based on deposition testimony, declarations, and evidence submitted. The court also finds that the defendant was at least potentially aware of potentially wrongful activity on the premises and chose to allow Adamakis to remain associated with the Northridge parish and at a minimum implicitly consent to unfettered access to private portions of the facility.
