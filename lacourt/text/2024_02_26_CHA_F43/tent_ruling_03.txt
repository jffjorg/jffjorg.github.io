3rd Cause of Action: Breach of the
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
RULING: Sustained without leave to amend
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION 
This action arises from a commercial industrial lease
signed by the parties on July 22, 2021. The parties to the lease were
Defendants Selective San Fernando Partners LLC and Selective 1111 Harris LLC as
the Lessor and Plaintiff Welding Evolution, Inc. as the Lessee. The CEO of
Welding Evolution, Mario Alvara, is also a Plaintiff to the case.
 
Plaintiffs allege that pre-lease negotiations, Defendants
allegedly overstated the power capacity of the subject premises. Plaintiffs
allege that Defendants represented that it had a capacity of 1200 AMPS, whereas
it only had a capacity of 200 AMPS. As a result, Welding Evolution had to rent
portable generators and install additional permanent capacity at an alleged
cost of $700,000, plus ongoing damages.
 
The Court previously sustained a demurrer to Plaintiffs’
Third Cause of Action for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing on the basis that Plaintiffs had not sufficiently alleged that the
guarantee of a certain power supply was a term of the lease. Plaintiffs filed
their Second Amended Complaint on September 28, 2023. 
 
Defendants filed their demurer on October 31, 2023. Plaintiffs
filed their opposition on February 9, 2024. Defendants filed their reply on February
15, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants bring a demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for
Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. Defendants argue
that this cause of action fails to set forth facts sufficient to state this
cause of action.
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (CCP
§ 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law…”
’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally
construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated.
(Picton v. Anderson Union High School
Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
For the Third Cause of Action, the covenant of good faith
and fair dealing rests upon the existence of some specific contractual
obligation and is read into contracts “as a supplement to the express
contractual covenants, to prevent a contracting party from engaging in conduct
which (while not technically transgressing the express covenants) frustrates
the other party’s rights to the benefits of the contract.” (Racine &
Laramie, Ltd. v. Department of Parks & Recreation (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th
1026, 1031-1032; see also McClain v. Octagon Plaza, LLC (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th
784, 805-806.) “[T]he implied covenant is limited to assuring compliance with
the express terms of the contract, and cannot be extended to create obligations
not contemplated in the contract.” (Racine (1992) at 1032.)
 
Further, “Breach of the covenant of good faith and fair
dealing rests on the existence of a specific contractual obligation. The
implied covenant does not impose substantive terms and conditions beyond those
to which the parties actually agreed. … An action alleging a breach of the
implied covenant cannot be used to extend existing, or create new,
obligations.” (1 Witkin, Summary 11th Contracts § 822 (2022).)
 
There are no provisions in the parties’ lease guaranteeing a
certain amount of power supply, yet Plaintiffs’ Third Cause of Action for
Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing is entirely
premised on the insufficient power supply. (SAC, ¶¶ 66-68.) As discussed above,
a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant is limited to compliance
with the express terms of the contract. A party cannot allege a breach of the
covenant for things that are not in the contract, and the covenant cannot be
used to extend existing obligations or create new obligations.
 
As part of their allegations for this cause of action that
more power was included in the lease, Plaintiffs point to section 1.7 of the
lease which states that the agreed use of the premises is “Metal cutting,
welding, manufacturing and related legal uses acceptable to Landlord.” (SAC, ¶¶
65-66.) However, this does not explicitly state that a greater power was a term
of the lease, and Plaintiffs cannot extend this existing obligation to include
a greater power supply.
 
Plaintiffs cite several cases in their opposition which they
claim support their cause of action. However, as Defendants argue in their
reply, most of these cases are inapplicable to a breach of the implied covenant
cause of action, or they do not stand for the premise for which Plaintiffs
argue.
 
The Court finds
the demurrer presents sufficient argument establishing grounds to sustain the
demurrer to the cause of action. The demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Third Cause of
Action is sustained without leave to amend, as Plaintiffs have had several
chances to amend the cause of action, but have been unable to provide
sufficient facts to maintain the cause of action.
