SUMMARY
OF ACTION AND ANALYSIS
On August 19, 2022, Plaintiff Alma Vargas (Plaintiff) filed
this lemon law case against Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant). 
 
Plaintiff
propounded discovery on Defendant on August 17, 2023. On September 18, 2023, Defendant
served responses to Plaintiff’s requests for production. On December 5, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to the requests for
production. Plaintiff argues that Defendant responses to Request Nos. 1, 2, 3,
7, 8, 9, 12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, 40, 41, 48, 53, 55, 56, 65, 73, 75,
76, and 79 were inadequate, and Defendant’s objections were without merit.
 
There
is a dispute between the parties over the sufficiency of the meet and confer.
Defendant argues in its opposition that Plaintiff failed to conduct a good
faith meet and confer because all Plaintiff did was send Defendant something
declaring her requests valid and Defendant’s objections invalid, and demanding
that Defendant supplement its previous production. Plaintiff argues in her
reply that the letters and emails that were sent by her counsel were sufficient
to satisfy the meet and confer requirements. The parties also stipulated to a
protective order. However, it appears that there was never direct communication
between the parties regarding the sufficiency of Defendant’s responses to the
requests for production at issue.
 
The
Court has reviewed the documents related to this motion and will not decide the
motion on the merits at this time. The Court orders the parties to meet and
confer directly, not by email. Additionally, the parties are ordered to file a
joint statement of remaining issues by a date to be set by the Court. The joint
statement should briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by Plaintiff’s
arguments, then Defendant’s arguments. 
 
ORDER

1.
The parties are ordered to conduct a meaningful meet and confer.
 
2.
The parties shall submit a joint statement of the remaining issues as described
above. The format should be as follows: the parties should recite the specific discovery
request at issue, followed by the moving party’s statement of why it should be
compelled, followed by the opposing party’s statement of why it should not be
compelled. To the extent that an argument is repeated for a subsequent request,
the party shall simply refer to the section where the argument was previously
made.
 
3.
The dates for the status report and continued hearings will be set at the hearing
on this motion.
 
4.
Moving party to provide notice.
