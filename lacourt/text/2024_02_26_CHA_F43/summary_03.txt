And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. The demurrer was filed by the defendants, Selective San Fernando Partners LLC and Selective 1111 Harris LLC, and the judge has determined that the plaintiffs, Welding Evolution, Inc. and Mario Alvara, have not sufficiently alleged facts to state this cause of action. The judge has found that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is limited to compliance with the express terms of the contract and cannot be used to extend existing obligations or create new ones. The judge has concluded that the plaintiffs' allegations regarding the insufficient power supply are not supported by the lease agreement, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
