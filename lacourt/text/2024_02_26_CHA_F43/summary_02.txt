And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to order the parties to conduct a meaningful meet and confer to resolve the dispute over the sufficiency of Defendant's responses to Plaintiff's requests for production. The parties are also required to file a joint statement of the remaining issues, which should outline the matters in dispute and the arguments on both sides. The judge will not decide the motion on the merits at this time, but will instead set a hearing date and schedule for the parties to report on the status of their meet and confer efforts.
