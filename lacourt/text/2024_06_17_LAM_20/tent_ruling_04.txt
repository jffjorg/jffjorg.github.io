 This action was filed on August 28, 2019.   On June 7, 2024, Judge Stephanie Bowick granted an ex parte application filed by Defendants Roy Lee and RL Films2, Inc. for an OSC re: dismissal/striking of Plaintiff The John Powers Middleton Companies, LLC from the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).  Defendants contend that Plaintiff The John Powers Middleton Companies, LLC has been a suspended entity with the Franchise Tax Board since at least July 1, 2019; that the statute of limitations continues to run while an entity is suspended; that Plaintiff’s third cause of action for breach of contract and sixth cause of action for an accounting should be stricken from the SAC as time-barred because the statute of limitations for a contract claim is four years and this matter was filed in August 2019 with the limitations period continuing to run. It is undisputed that Plaintiff The John Powers Middleton Companies, LLC has been suspended since at least July 1, 2019.  “A corporation which has its powers suspended pursuant to these sections lacks the legal capacity to prosecute or defend a civil action during its suspension. (See ABA Recovery Services, Inc. v. Konold (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 720, 724 [244 Cal.Rptr. 27];  Schwartz v. Magyar House, Inc. (1959) 168 Cal.App.2d 182, 188 [335 P.2d 487].) Accordingly, when a suspended corporation commences an action during its suspension, the statute of limitations continues to run. . . . If the statute of limitations runs out prior to revival of a corporation's powers, the corporation's action will be time barred even if the complaint would otherwise have been timely.”  (Sade Shoe Co. v. Oschin & Snyder (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1509, 1512-1513.) Plaintiff makes a number of arguments, but first argues that Defendants’ contentions lack merit because they failed to properly plead the affirmative defenses of (1) the statute of limitations and (2) lack of capacity to sue.  “There are two ways to properly plead a statute of limitations: (1) allege facts showing that the action is barred, and indicating that the lateness of the action is being urged as a defense and (2) plead the specific section and subdivision. (Brown v. World Church (1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 684, 691, 77 Cal.Rptr. 669.) . . . The failure to properly plead the statute of limitations waives the defense. (Mysel v. Gross (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d Supp. 10, 15, 138 Cal.Rptr. 873.)”  (Martin v. Van Bergen (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 84, 91.)Here, the Answer asserts the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense, but does not specify any basis for the defense, whether by alleging facts or indicating a specific statute that would apply.  Thus, the Court finds that Defendants waived this argument, particularly as Plaintiff has timely objected within his opposition.  (See Martin, supra, 209 Cal.App.4th at p. 91.)With respect to pleading the underlying capacity defense, "[i]ncapacity is merely a legal disability, such as infancy or insanity, which deprives a party of the right to come into court. The right to relief, on the other hand, goes to the existence of a cause of action. It is not a plea in abatement, as is lack of capacity to sue. [ ] Our Supreme Court has specifically stated that a plea of lack of capacity of a corporation to maintain an action by reason of a suspension of corporate powers for nonpayment of its taxes is a plea in abatement which is not favored in law [and] is to be strictly construed . . . . . The distinction is significant because a plea in abatement such as lack of capacity to sue must be raised by defendant at the earliest opportunity or it is waived…. The proper time to raise a plea in abatement is in the original answer or by demurrer at the time of the answer. [Citation.] It is a technical objection and must be pleaded specifically. Thus an affirmative defense or demurrer which contains a general assertion that plaintiff has not stated a cause of action does not suffice to raise a plea in abatement.”  (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1604 (internal quotes omitted.) Here, the Answer does not raise a plea in abatement or make any reference to the fact that Plaintiff is a suspended entity.  Thus, this defense has also been waived.  “Once a plea in abatement is waived the court will be rarely justified in permitting the defense to be made later.”  (Id. at p. 1605 (internal quotes omitted).) Because Defendants failed to properly plead affirmative defenses relating to the statute of limitations and capacity to sue, the OSC re: Dismissal is discharged.Plaintiffs to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
