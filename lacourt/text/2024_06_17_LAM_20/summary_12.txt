And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the defendant's motion to set aside a default judgment entered against it. The defendant claims it was served with the summons and complaint in July 2023, but the service package was misrouted and never delivered. The defendant argues that it had no knowledge of the lawsuit until February 14, 2024, when it was served a second time. The court finds that the defendant's excuse for its default is not sufficient and that it failed to demonstrate diligence in seeking relief. The court denies the defendant's motion to set aside the default.
