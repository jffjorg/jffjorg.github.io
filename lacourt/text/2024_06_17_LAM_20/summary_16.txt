Summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of the defendants, without leave to amend, in a case where plaintiffs are seeking declaratory relief, writ of mandate, and government waste against the Los Angeles County Assessor and the County of Los Angeles. The case concerns the issue of whether property lines in Portuguese Bend move with the landslide movement of surface improvements. The court takes judicial notice of a statement made by the Assessor at a city council meeting, where he acknowledged that the Assessor's Office has been "pretending" that property lines are not moving. This obviates the need for the court to decide the case, as the Assessor's Office has already confirmed that property lines are not moving, rendering the claims moot.
