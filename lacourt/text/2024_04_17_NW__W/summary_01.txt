And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most qualified (PMQ) and custodian of records. The plaintiffs had sought to compel the deposition of the defendant's PMQ due to the defendant's failure to produce the witness for deposition. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,830.00. The court ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding the availability of the PMQ and set a deposition date no earlier than 60 days and no later than 120 days from the date of the motion. The court will revisit the issue of sanctions if the plaintiff is unable to take the PMQ's deposition within 120 days.
