BACKGROUND
 
On November 23, 2022, Plaintiff Suzanne
M. Curtis filed a complaint against Defendants AIG American General Assurance
Company, American General Assurance Company, American International Group,
Inc., Transamerica Life Insurance Company, Transamerica Premier Life
Insurance Company, L. Dorais, and Brian
Forsyth for breach of contract and fraud. 
 
Plaintiff dismissed AIG American General
Assurance Company on January 17, 2023.  
 
Defendants Transamerica Life Ins. Co and
Transamerica Premier Life Insurance company demurred to the complaint on
statute of limitations grounds and that demurrer was sustained without leave to
amend on March 1, 2024.  By minute order
that same date, both defendants were dismissed.   On March 11, 2024, plaintiff filed an ex
parte application to have a motion for reconsideration heard, which was heard
on March 11 and the motion set for hearing on April 17, 2024.  The court treated the ex parte application as
the moving papers.   Defendants filed a timely
opposition.  Plaintiff filed a document entitled
a Motion for Reconsideration on April 10, 2024, which was in fact a reply
brief.   
 
Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is denied.  
 
discussion
 
Defendants first argue that the motion for reconsideration must be
denied because the order of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer
without leave to amend is a
final judgment. See Desai v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1996) 47
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1115 (order
dismissing defendant following an order sustaining that
defendant’s demurrer without leave to amend is a final judgment); see also Cal
Code of Civ. Proc. § 581(d) (“All dismissals ordered by the court shall be in
the form of a written order signed by the court and filed in the action and
those orders when so filed shall constitute judgments and be effective for all
purposes….”).  Because the court did not
sign the order of dismissal and no judgment was ever entered, the court finds
this motion for reconsideration properly before the court.   
 
Nonetheless, the motion must be denied on its merits.   Code of Civil Procedure § 1008(a) “requires
that a motion for reconsideration be based on new or different facts,
circumstances, or law.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212, citing Civ. Proc. Code § 1008(a).)  A declaration setting forth the new or
different facts, circumstances or law must be filed in support of the motion.
CCP § 1008(a); Branner v. Regents of Univ. of Calif. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th
1043, 1048 (“motion to reconsider was invalid when filed and served because the
motion failed to contain an affidavit or declaration in support of the
motion.”).  Although plaintiff did file a
declaration with her original ex parte application, that declaration did not
set forth any new or different facts, circumstances or law.   Instead, plaintiff merely sought to reargue
the original demurrer and to complain that she believed she had been given
inadequate time to argue her position at the hearing on the demurrer.  A party’s mere disagreement with the court's
order or argument that the court misinterpreted the law or the facts does not
justify a motion for reconsideration:
 
What respondent essentially argues
is that section 1008 does not apply when the litigant disagrees with the trial
court's ruling. Since in almost all instances, the losing party will believe
that the trial court's “different” interpretation of the law or facts was
erroneous, to interpret the statute as the respondent urges would be contrary
to the clear legislative intent to restrict motions to reconsider to circumstances
where a party offers the court some fact or authority that was not previously
considered by it.
 
(Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500, as
modified on denial of reh'g (Apr. 3, 1995). 
 
Accordingly, plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is
denied.  Defendants to submit a judgment
of dismissal within 10 days.
