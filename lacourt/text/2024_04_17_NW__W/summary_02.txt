Here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Suzanne M. Curtis, filed a complaint against the defendants, Transamerica Life Insurance Company and Transamerica Premier Life Insurance Company, alleging breach of contract and fraud. The defendants demurred to the complaint, and the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend. As a result, the defendants were dismissed. The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the court did not give her adequate time to argue her position at the hearing on the demurrer. The court denied the motion for reconsideration, finding that it did not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1008(a), which requires that a motion for reconsideration be based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law. The court also noted that the plaintiff did not provide new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support her motion.
