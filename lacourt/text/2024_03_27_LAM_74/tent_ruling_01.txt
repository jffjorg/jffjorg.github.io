  Case Number:  23STCV19340    Hearing Date:   March 27, 2024    Dept:  74 David
Ferrell, et al. v. Richard Lopez
Defendants’ Demurrer to Complaint
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute over real property.
            On
March 11, 2024, Plaintiffs David Ferrell and Michael Woloz (Plaintiffs) filed a
complaint against Defendant Richard Lopez (Defendant). The complaint alleges
the following causes of action: (1) nondisclosure of material facts, (2)
fraudulent concealment, (3) negligent misrepresentation, and (4) professional
negligence.
            On
September 25, 2023, Defendant filed this demurrer. The demurrer targets the
second cause of action for fraudulent concealment.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (¿¿Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318¿¿.) “¿To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.¿” (¿¿C.A. v. William S. Hart Union
High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872¿¿.) For the purpose of testing
the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (¿Aubry v. Tri-City
Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967¿.) A demurrer “¿does not
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿” (¿¿Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713¿¿.) DISCUSSION 
            Defendant
argues Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded their fraudulent concealment
claim. The elements are as follows: (1) the defendant must have concealed a
material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the
fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed the
fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the
concealed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment, the plaintiff must have
sustained damage. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 748.) In
this context, the plaintiff must plead the supporting facts with particularity.
(Lazar v. Superior Court (12 Cal.4th 631, 645 [holding that a cause of
action for fraud requires the plaintiff to plead facts that show how, when,
where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made].) 
            Here,
Plaintiff alleges Defendant knew about the defective foundation because he
renovated the property. (Complaint, ¶¶ 37, 46.) As the seller, Defendant had a
duty to disclose to Plaintiffs the defective foundation because it affected the
property’s value. (Complaint, ¶¶ 35, 44.) In 2020, though, Defendant concealed
this fact from Plaintiffs and other potential buyers on Multiple Listing
Service. There, Defendant misrepresented that the property’s entire foundation
was new. (Complaint, ¶ 14, 15.) And on July 16, 2021, Defendant issued a Real
Estate Transfer Disclosure Statement, in which Defendant described the
property’s extensive remodeling but failed to disclose to Plaintiffs the
defective foundation. (Complaint, ¶¶ 16, 17.) Under the allegations, Defendant
intentionally concealed the material fact to induce Plaintiffs to purchase the
property. (Complaint, ¶ 47.) Moreover, Plaintiffs were not aware of the
defective foundation. (Complaint, ¶ 48.) Nor would Plaintiffs have purchased
the property if they had known about it. (Complaint, ¶ 49.) Last, Plaintiffs
have suffered damage in the form of repair costs. (Complaint, ¶¶ 33, 50.) Given
the foregoing, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded a fraudulent concealment
claim. (See Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist., supra, 2 Cal.4th at pp. 966-967¿
[demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded].) 
CONCLUSION 
The
court overrules Defendant’s demurer.

BACKGROUND
            This
action arises from a dispute over real property.
            On
March 11, 2024, Plaintiffs David Ferrell and Michael Woloz (Plaintiffs) filed a
complaint against Defendant Richard Lopez (Defendant). The complaint alleges
the following causes of action: (1) nondisclosure of material facts, (2)
fraudulent concealment, (3) negligent misrepresentation, and (4) professional
negligence.
            On
September 25, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to strike portions of the
complaint.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A court may strike any “¿irrelevant,
false or improper matter¿inserted in any pleading¿” or any part of a pleading
“¿not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule,
or an order of the court.¿” (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 436¿.) “¿The grounds for a
motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from
any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.¿” (¿Code
Civ. Proc., § 437¿.)¿            
DISCUSSION 
            Defendant
first aims to strike Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages on page 10,
paragraph 70 of the complaint. Under Civil Code section 3294, punitive damages
are recoverable if the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice. Fraud includes intentional concealment of a material fact known to a
defendant, who intends to cause injury to another person through the
concealment. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(3).) The court has already found
that Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts for their fraudulent concealment
claim, which supports their request for punitive damages. Thus, the court
denies Defendant’s motion to strike the request for punitive damages.
            Next,
Defendant seeks to strike Plaintiffs’ request for general damages on page 10,
paragraph 69. According to Defendant, such damages are not recoverable in this
context. (Channell v. Anthony (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 290, 315.) General
damages are losses that naturally flow from the injury and are not quantifiable
by reference to bills or receipts. (Beeman v Burling (1990) 216
Cal.App.3d 1586, 1600.) Damages for pain, suffering, and emotional distress are
thus examples of general damages. (Ibid.) In their opposition,
Plaintiffs acknowledge they do not seek damages for physical or emotional
suffering. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs contend they are entitled to general
damages. But Plaintiffs do not direct the court to any allegation in the
complaint that they suffered a loss that cannot be quantified by repair bills.
Thus, the court grants Defendants’ motion to strike the request for general
damages with leave to amend.
CONCLUSION 
            The
court grants Defendant’s motion to strike page 10, paragraph 69 of the
complaint with leave to amend. The court denies Defendant’s motion to strike
page 10, paragraph 70 of the complaint.
            Defendant
shall give notice.
