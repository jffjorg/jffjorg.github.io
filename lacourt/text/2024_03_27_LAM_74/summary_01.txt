And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions filed by the defendant, Richard Lopez. The first motion is a demurrer to the complaint, which targets the second cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded a fraudulent concealment claim, as they have alleged that the defendant concealed the defective foundation of the property, which affected its value. The judge overrules the demurrer and allows the complaint to proceed.

The second motion is a motion to strike portions of the complaint, specifically the request for punitive damages and general damages. The judge denies the motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to support their claim. However, the judge grants the motion to strike the request for general damages, as the plaintiffs have not alleged any losses that cannot be quantified by repair bills.
