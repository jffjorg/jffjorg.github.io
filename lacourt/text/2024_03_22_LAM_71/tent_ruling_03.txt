Defendant
Arakelian Enterprises, Inc., dba Athens Services (“Athens”) (“Defendant”) moves
for an order awarding its attorneys’ fees against Plaintiff WasteXperts, Inc. (“WasteXperts”) (“Plaintiff”) in
the total amount of $142,616.40.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §425.16(c).)
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff’s
3/11/24 request for judicial notice of the (1) Notice of Entry of Order
Granting Defendant’s Special Motion to Strike; and (2) Notice of Entry of
Judgment filed and served by Athens in this action is denied, as the Court does
not need to take judicial notice of filings on the instant docket.
 
Background
On July 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed
their operative complaint (“Complaint”) against Defendant and dismissed
defendant The City of Los Angeles (“City”) (collectively, “Defendants”),
alleging a single cause of action for declaratory relief.  On November 16, 2023, this Court granted
Defendant’s special motion to strike (“Anti-SLAPP Motion”) Plaintiff’s
Complaint.  (10/16/23 Minute Order.)  On December 7, 2023, Judgment was entered in
this case, stating Defendant shall recover its fees and costs of suit,
including attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to C.C.P. §425.16(c)(1), following
a noticed motion for attorneys’ fees and costs. 
(12/7/23 Judgment.)
On February 29, 2024,
Defendant filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees.  On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed its
opposition.  On March 15, 2024, Defendant
filed its reply.
Plaintiff objects to
Defendant’s motion as untimely under CRC, Rule 3.1702, on the basis Defendant’s
motion was filed sixteen days past the time for filing based upon the trigger
date of the notice of entry of judgment.
CRC, Rule 3.1702(d) provides:
“For good cause, the trial judge may extend the time for filing a motion for
attorney’s fees in the absence of a stipulation or for a longer period than
allowed by stipulation.” (CRC, Rule 3.1702(d).) 
The time limits under the Rule are not jurisdictional.  (State Farm General Insurance Co. v. Lara
(2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 197, 213; Jones v. Goodman (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th
521, 542.)  “Flexibility is built into
Rule 3.1702 through subdivision (d), which allows a judge ‘[f]or good cause’ to
‘extend the time for filing a motion for attorney’s fees in the absence of a stipulation
or for a longer period than allowed by stipulation.’”  (Robinson v. U-Haul Co. of California (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 304, 326.)
Based on Defendant’s showing
for good cause that it reserved the hearing on the instant motion on November
21, 2023, for earliest possible date for a fee motion, the Court extends
Defendant’s time for filing the instant motion. 
(Motion, pg. 23.)  Therefore, the
Court will consider Defendant’s motion.
 
Discussion
C.C.P.
§425.16(c)(1) provides, in part, “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to
strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.”  California law makes the award of attorneys’
fees and costs to a prevailing anti-SLAPP defendant mandatory.  (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1131 [“[u]nder Code of Civil Procedure §425.16, subdivision (c), any
SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to
mandatory attorney’s fees.”].)  Here,
Defendant was the prevailing party in the Anti-SLAPP Motion.  (See 10/16/23 Minute Order.)  Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for
attorneys’ fees is proper and it is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and
costs.
 
Reasonable Fees
The California Supreme Court has determined
the lodestar method is the proper mechanism to calculate attorneys’ fees under
C.C.P. §425.16(c).  (See Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at pg. 1136.)  To calculate a
lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by Defendant’s counsel.  The “reasonable hourly rate” applicable under
the lodestar method is the rate “prevailing in the community for similar work.”
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  “The trial court makes its determination
after consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the
litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its
handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and
other circumstances in the case.”  (Id. at pg. 1096.)
Defendant’s Counsel declares the following
hourly rates: (1) Ronald B. Turovsky ($1,190.00 per hour); (2) Kishan Barot
($850.00 per hour); and (3) Erin E. Cazares M. Sanzo ($501.50 per hour).  (Decl. of Turovsky ¶¶5-13, Exhs. 1-6.)  Defendant’s Counsel declares Defendant was
invoiced at a 15% discount from Manatt’s standard 2023 rates, and the amounts
sought in this motion reflect the discount given to Defendant.  (Decl. of Turovsky ¶6.)  The Court determines based on its experience
that Defendant’s Counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of
practice.
An anti-SLAPP motion is complex in nature and requires the
submission of declarations and evidence akin to a motion for summary judgment
or a preliminary injunction.  Defendant argues the Anti-SLAPP motion in
the instant case involved an exposition of multiple procedural concepts
prohibiting the relitigation of claims, including in the context of the
anti-SLAPP statute: (1) claim and issue preclusion, (2) the prohibition against
collateral attacks, (3) comity between superior court judges, and (4) a trial
court’s lack of jurisdiction over issues on appeal.  (Motion, pg. 12.)  Defendant’s efforts resulted in the dismissal
of Plaintiff’s Complaint.  Accordingly,
Defendant’s requested attorneys’ fees are reasonable.
 
Billed Hours
The verified time entries of the attorneys
are entitled to a presumption of credibility, which extends to an attorney’s
professional judgment as to whether time spent was reasonably necessary to the
litigation.  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 [“We think
the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of the court are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”].)  “California courts do not
require detailed time records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees
based on declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and the
court’s own view of the number of hours reasonably spent.”  (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.) 
Here, the billing statement of the
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred on the motion and the declarations by
counsel demonstrate the reasonableness of the time spent on this case.  (See Decl. of Turovsky ¶¶5-7, Exhs. 1-2.)  Defendant’s Counsel declares the bulk of the
work on the Anti-SLAPP motion was divided between Ronald Turovsky, the senior
partner on this case who was familiar with the previous complaint and
anti-SLAPP motion, partner Kishan Barot, with the assistance of associate Erin
E. Cazares M. Sanzo.  (See Decl. of Turovsky ¶¶11-13, 16, Exhs. 4-6.)  Defendant’s Counsel declares the following
hours billed: (1) Ronald B. Turovsky (64 hours or $76,160); (2) Kishan Barot
(73.7 hours or $62,645); and (3) Erin E. Cazares M. Sanzo (7.6 hours or
$3,811.40).  (Decl. of Turovsky ¶7, Exh.
2.)
Plaintiff’s arguments in opposition to
Defendant’s motion are unavailing because its objections to Defendant’s request
for fees does not point to the specific items challenged with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence; general arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.  (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Sanctions
In light of the Court’s ruling on the
instant motion, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Defendant is denied.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in the total amount of $142,616.40.
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant is denied.
