And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to vacate and set aside a default judgment entered against Defendant Antonio J. Polanco on May 16, 2023. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Juan Elias Polanco, who claims that he was unaware of the damages caused by Defendant and was surprised that Defendant had retained legal counsel. However, the Judge has denied the motion, finding that it was filed beyond the six-month period allowed by law and that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The Judge has also emphasized that the discretionary provision of California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) §473(b) applies only to the party seeking relief, and not to the party filing the motion.
