The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $142,616.40, and denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The ruling is based on the fact that Defendant was the prevailing party in the Anti-SLAPP Motion and is entitled to mandatory attorneys' fees under C.C.P. ยง425.16(c)(1). The Judge also finds that the hourly rates submitted by Defendant's counsel are reasonable and that the billing statement of the attorneys' fees and costs incurred on the motion demonstrates the reasonableness of the time spent on the case.
