 Case No.:

 Hearing Date:  March 22, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Juan Elias Polanco’s unopposed motion to vacate and set aside the default
judgment entered against Defendant Antonio J. Polanco on May 16, 2023, is denied.
 
Plaintiff
Juan Elias Polanco (“Juan”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed for this Court
to vacate and set aside the default judgment entered against Defendant Antonio
J. Polanco (“Antonio”) (“Defendant”) on May 16, 2023, on the grounds of Plaintiff’s
excusable neglect in filing a default against Defendant without having full
knowledge of the damages Defendant has caused and excusable surprise that
Defendant has finally retained legal counsel to proceed with the matter.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. i-ii; C.C.P. §473(b).)
 
Background
          On June 23, 2022, Plaintiff filed his operative
Complaint against Defendant alleging six causes of action: (1) breach of
contract; (2) quiet title; (3) partition; (4) accounting; (5) constructive
trust; and (6) unjust enrichment, relating to real property located at 1017 W.
45th Street, Los Angeles, California 90037 (“Subject Property”).  (See Complaint.)
          On September 7, 2022, entry of default
was filed against Defendant.  (9/7/22
Entry of Default.)
On May
16, 2023, this Court entered default judgment against Defendant.  (5/16/23 Default Judgment.)  On May 16, 2023, this Court also entered an
interlocutory judgment for partition by sale. 
(5/16/23 Interlocutory Judgment.) 
On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed proof of publication of the notice of
the sale of the Subject Property. 
(6/23/23 Proof of Publication.)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on November 29, 2023. 
As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Motion to Vacate/Set Aside Dismissal
The
court is empowered to relieve a party “upon any terms as may be just . . . from
a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (C.C.P. §473(b).)
C.C.P.
§473(b) consists of two distinct parts: “a discretionary provision, which
applies permissively, and a mandatory provision, which applies as of right.” (Minick
v. City of Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25-26; Bailey v. Citibank,
N.A. (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 335, 348.)
With
regard to the discretionary provision, “[t]he court may, upon any terms
as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”  (C.C.P. §473(b).)
“[W]henever
an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of
judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect, [the court shall] vacate any resulting . . . dismissal entered against his or her client.”  (C.C.P. §473(b).)  The court must set
aside the dismissal “unless the court finds that the . . .  dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (C.C.P. §473(b).)
Plaintiff’s
untimely motion to set aside or vacate default judgment entered against
Defendant is denied.  Default judgment
was entered against Defendant on May 16, 2023. 
The cut-off date to file the instant motion for discretionary relief was
November 16, 2023.  Plaintiff filed the
instant motion on November 29, 2023, beyond the six-month period to set aside
or vacate default judgment.
Further,
Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect; he merely seeks to recover additional damages against Defendant.  (See Decl. of Polanco ¶¶14-15.)  While C.C.P. §473(b) is a mechanism that can
be used for any party, Plaintiff is moving to vacate default judgment on
Defendant’s behalf; Plaintiff is not the party referred to in the applicable
section of the statute.  (See C.C.P.
§473(b) [“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal,
order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.], emphasis added.)
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion to set aside the default judgment entered against
Defendant May 16, 2023, is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
