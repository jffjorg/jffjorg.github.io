And here is the English summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has considered the motion to strike the Complaint and the demurrer to the Complaint. The motion to strike is GRANTED as to Plaintiffs Michael Dennis Drobot and Healthsmart Pacific, Inc. ("Healthsmart") because they had discovered their claims when they filed their Answer in the earlier case. The motion to strike is GRANTED with leave to amend as to Plaintiff International Implants, LLC ("International") because it is currently suspended and therefore legally barred from prosecuting this case. The demurrer is taken off calendar as moot because the motion to strike has been granted. The court has also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 9-10.
