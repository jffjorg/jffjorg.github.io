And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's case without prejudice. The plaintiff has been without counsel for four months, and the defendant has counsel in a related case but not in this case. The court has the inherent authority to dismiss the case under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 128(a)(4)&(8), 581(m), and 583.150. The court also sets an order to show cause (OSC) re: dismissal of the cross-complaint filed by defendant Vast for October 20, 2023, and an OSC re: striking the answer and entering default of Cross-Defendant Vast for the same date. Additionally, the court has taken off-calendar a motion to compel discovery responses from defendant Vast, which was served by a corporate representative who is not a member of the California bar.
