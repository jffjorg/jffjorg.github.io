 Case Number:  20STCV01462    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Motion
 
Attorney Mark Gomez (“Gomez”) now
seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Intervenor Plaintiff.

Governing Rule
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 requires that counsel fill out forms MC-051, MC-052,
and MC-053. These forms serve two basic functions: (1) ensuring that notice is
given to the client and (2) providing the court with an adequate explanation of
why the matter is being handled via motion rather than mutual consent. See Code
of Civil Procedure § 284; California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362.
 
Decision
 
            Counsel Gomez
has completed the required forms. Those forms indicate that the client has been
served by mail at their last known address, which has been confirmed by Counsel
Gomez via telephone conversation. 
 
            Counsel Gomez
indicates that there has been an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship.
 
            Counsel has
complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1362, and relief is appropriate under
the circumstances of this case. The motion is GRANTED, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed
orders upon the client.
