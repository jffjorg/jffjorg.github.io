Roles: 
  - Plaintiff
  - Defendant
  - Judge
Significant Statements: 
  - "The MFAA was first proposed by the Board of Governors of the State Bar of California in 1976... In contrast to the California Arbitration Act, which is governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, the MFAA has its own rules and limitations, as set forth in the Business and Professions Code."
  - "The nature of the obligation to arbitrate under the MFAA differs from that under standard arbitration in two important ways... First, the obligation to arbitrate under the MFAA is based on a statutory directive and not the parties' agreement... Second, section 6200, subdivision (c) provides: 'arbitration under this article shall be voluntary for a client and shall be mandatory for an attorney if commenced by a client.'"
  - "The requirements of Section 6201(a) were fulfilled upon mailing. Section 6201 contains multiple waiver provisions... Had the legislature meant to say that arbitration was only waived where notice was received, they could have done so. In fact, they did, in Subdivision 6201(a)... But in the other subdivisions, they did not."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: a motion to stay the case pending arbitration and a motion to strike the First Amended Answer. The court has denied both motions.

Regarding the motion to stay the case, the court held that the defendant, Drobot, has waived his right to arbitrate the fee dispute under multiple subdivisions of Business and Professions Code § 6201. The court found that Drobot never received the notice of his right to fee arbitration, but the law does not require actual receipt of the notice. The court also found that Drobot has waived arbitration under subdivisions 6201(b) and 6201(d) of the code. Therefore, the court denied the motion to stay the case pending arbitration.

Regarding the motion to strike the First Amended Answer, the court held that the defendant, Drobot, has the right to file a new answer when the plaintiff amends the complaint. The court found that the law places no time limit on this right and that the plaintiff did not seek a stipulation or default judgment. Therefore, the court denied the motion to strike the First Amended Answer.
