 Case Number:  21STCV06550    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  14 (1)       OSC re: Dismissal
 
            On February
16, 2023, Scott R. Carpenter and Edward J. Farrell of Cummins & White LLP
were relieved as counsel for Defendant/Cross-Complainant Vast. Proof of service
of the order relieving them was filed on March 2, 2023.
 
            On April
11, 2023, Jeffrey M. Singletary and Justin F. Mello of Snell & Wilmer LLP
were relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. Proof of service of the order relieving
them was filed on April 13, 2023.
 
            No counsel
has substituted in or appeared on behalf of either Plaintiff or Defendant Vast
in the intervening time.
 
            Corporate
parties are required to have counsel to prosecute cases in California courts. CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th
1141. Both Plaintiff and Defendant Vast have been without counsel now for four
months. Defendant Vast does have counsel in the related case, who has been appearing
in that case only. But Plaintiff has made no effort to appear or communicate
with this court in any fashion. Under these circumstances, the court has the
inherent authority to dismiss Plaintiff’s case. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 128(a)(4)&(8),
581(m), and 583.150.
 
            Plaintiff’s
FAC is DISMISSED, without prejudice.
 
            The court
sets an OSC re: dismissal of the cross-complaint filed by Defendant Vast for October 20, 2023.
 
            The court
also sets an OSC re: striking the answer and entering default of Cross-Defendant
Vast for October 20, 2023.
 
(2)-(3) Motions to
Compel
 
            Cross-Complainant
Mouren-Laurens now moves this court for orders compelling Cross-Defendant Vast
to make further responses to his Form and Special Interrogatories, as well as
his Requests for Production, through legal counsel.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is TAKEN OFF-CALENDAR.
 
Discussion
 
            The
discovery at issue was served on January 13, 2023. Responses were due on March
1, 2023. On February 27, 2023, a corporate representative from Cross-Defendant
Vast served responses. That representative is not a member of the California
bar.
 
            The
discovery responses served by the corporate representative are invalid. See CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th
1141. But this court has no power to compel corporations to hire counsel, let
alone to serve responses through counsel they do not have. The remedy for this
situation is a motion to strike Cross-Defendant Vast’s answer and enter their
default. The court has already set an OSC for that very purpose.
