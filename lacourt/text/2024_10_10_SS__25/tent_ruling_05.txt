STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On July 19, 2024, Plaintiff
Zohrab Steve Haddad (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendant Vardan
Antonyan (Defendant) with three causes of action for: (1) Malicious
Prosecution, (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and (3) Perjury.
Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $8,490 for legal
fees and costs. This case concerns alleged harassment by Defendant related to Plaintiff’s
involvement with the homeowner’s association where both Plaintiff and Defendant
own condominiums.
 
On August 14, 2024, Defendant filed an Answer, denying Plaintiff’s
allegations.
 
On August 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Change Venue
from Spring Street Courthouse to the Burbank Courthouse. On September 9, 2024,
Defendant filed an opposition.
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“Venue is determined based on the
complaint on file at the time the motion to change venue is made. [Citations.]’
[Citation.]”  (Dow AgroSciences, LLC
v. Superior Court (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 1067, 1076.)¿ CCP §
397(a) states: “The court may, on motion, change the place of trial in the
following cases: (a) When the court designated in the complaint is not the
proper court.” 
 
“Except as otherwise provided by law and
subject to the power of the court to transfer actions or proceedings as
provided in this title, the superior court in the county where the defendants
or some of them reside at the commencement of the action is the proper court
for the trial of the action…Subject to subdivision (b), if a defendant has
contracted to perform an obligation in a particular county, the superior court
in the county where the obligation is to be performed, where the contract in
fact was entered into, or where the defendant or any defendant resides at the
commencement of the action is a proper court for the trial of an action founded
on that obligation,¿ and the county where the obligation is incurred is the
county where it is to be performed unless there is a special contract in
writing to the contrary.”  (CCP § 395(a).)¿¿ 
 
The burden is on the moving party to
establish facts justifying the transfer.  (Mission Imports, Inc. v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 921,
928.)  Absent “an affirmative showing to the contrary the presumption is
that the county in which the title of the action shows that it is brought is, prima facie, the proper county for the
commencement and trial of the action.”  (Id.; Fontaine v. Superior
Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 830, 836.)
 
The Code of Civil
Procedure, section 397 also provides: “The court may, on motion, change the
place of trial in the following cases:
 
(a)   When
the court designated in the complaint is not the proper court. 
(b)   When
there is reason to believe that an impartial trial cannot be had therein.
(c)   When
the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the
change. 
(d)   When
from any cause there is no judge of the court qualified to act. 
(e)   When a
proceeding for dissolution of marriage has been filed in the county in which
the petitioner has been a resident for three months next preceding the
commencement of the proceeding, and the respondent at the time of the
commencement of the proceeding is a resident of another county in this state,
to the county of the respondent’s residence when the ends of justice would be
promoted by the change.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
As an initial matter, the Court should note that Plaintiff
did not file or include a memorandum of points and authorities. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.111(a), (b).) Therefore, it is unclear what legal authorities
Petitioner is relying on to support his motion.  
 
Plaintiff cites
to Code of Civil Procedure § 394, but this section applies to an action or
proceeding against a county, city or local agency, which is not applicable in
the instant action against Defendant, an individual.
 
Plaintiff contends that transfer
to Burbank Courthouse is in the interest of justice because (1) the Burbank
Courthouse might provide an earlier hearing date than the current hearing date
of January 1, 2026, and (2) Burbank Courthouse is located more conveniently to
Plaintiff, who resides in Van Nuys, CA, Defendant, who resides in Sylmar, CA,
and witnesses.
 
The court disagrees with
Plaintiff that change of venue is proper. First, Code of Civil Procedure,  § 397, subdivisions (a), (b), (d), and (e) do
not apply because there is no evidence, and Plaintiff does not argue, that (1)
this court is not the proper court, (2) impartial trial cannot be had herein,
(3) there is no judge of the court qualified to act, or (4) that the case involves
a dissolution of marriage proceeding where respondent’s location justifies the
change. With respect to Code of Civil Procedure § 397, subdivision (c),
Plaintiff asserts the Burbank Courthouse offers a more convenient location for
witnesses because an earlier hearing date “might be possible,” and the change
would increase the chances that Plaintiff, Defendant and witnesses can attend
the hearing. (Haddad Decl. ¶ 1.) However, the Court in its discretion finds
this mere possibility and minor change in location within the proper court is unpersuasive
to justify a change of venue in the interest of justice.
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES the motion to change venue.
 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Change Venue is DENIED.
 
Moving party is to give notice.
