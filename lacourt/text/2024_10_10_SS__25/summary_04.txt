And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for civil theft and the third cause of action for fraud and deceit with leave to amend. The demurrer to the fifth cause of action for violations of the Unfair Competition Law is overruled. The motion to strike paragraphs 26 and the prayer for punitive damages is granted. The motion to strike paragraph 48 is denied as moot based on the court's ruling on the demurrer.

The plaintiff's claims for civil theft, fraud and deceit, and punitive damages are dismissed without leave to amend. The plaintiff's claims for violations of the Unfair Competition Law and the Consumers Legal Remedies Act are allowed to proceed.

The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to state a cause of action for civil theft, fraud and deceit, and punitive damages. The court also finds that the punitive damages allegations are not supported by the evidence.

The plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the tentative ruling.
