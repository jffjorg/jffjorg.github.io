And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to change the venue from the Spring Street Courthouse to the Burbank Courthouse. The plaintiff, Zohrab Steve Haddad, filed a complaint against the defendant, Vardan Antonyan, on July 19, 2024, alleging three causes of action, including malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and perjury. The defendant filed an answer on August 14, 2024, and the plaintiff filed a motion to change venue on August 19, 2024, citing the potential for an earlier hearing date and a more convenient location for witnesses.

The judge disagrees with the plaintiff's argument, finding that the burden is on the moving party to establish facts justifying the transfer. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not file a memorandum of points and authorities to support the motion and that the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply in this case. The judge also finds that the potential for an earlier hearing date and a more convenient location for witnesses is not sufficient to justify a change of venue in the interest of justice.

Therefore, the judge denies the plaintiff's motion to change venue.
