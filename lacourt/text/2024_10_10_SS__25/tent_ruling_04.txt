ANALYSIS:
 
 
 
I.                   
Background
 
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiff
Mayra Sandoval (Plaintiff) filed suit against Defendants South Bay Auto Group
Inc. (South Bay); Quality Acceptance, LLC (Quality); and the Western Surety Company
(Western; collectively Defendants). Plaintiff filed the operative first amended
complaint (FAC) on September 11, 2024, wherein she alleged six causes of action
for the violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, civil theft, fraud and
deceit, negligent misrepresentation, violations of the Unfair Competition Law, and
violations of Vehicle Code section 11711. 
 
Plaintiff alleged that, on
September 4, 2023, she purchased a 2016 Ford Explorer (subject vehicle) from
South Bay. (FAC ¶ 9). After the purchase, South Bay assigned the purchase
contract to Quality. (FAC ¶ 10). Upon delivery, the subject vehicle presented
with certain non-conformities including issues with the transmission,
crankshaft, check engine light, and engine control module. Plaintiff reported
the problem to South Bay, but it took no action. (FAC ¶¶12-13) 
 
Plaintiff also alleges that South Bay overcharged her for
the subject vehicles, license fee according to Revenue and Taxation Code
section 10752. (FAC ¶14). Defendants demur to the claim for civil theft (COA
2), fraud and deceit (COA 3), and violation of the Unfair Competition Law (COA
5). Defendants also move to strike the punitive damages allegations and prayer.
 
As a preliminary manner, Plaintiff has alleged that Quality accepted
assignment of Plaintiff’s purchase contract from South Bay. That contract, in
turn, provided that,  
 
ANY HOLDER OF
THIS CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND DEFENSES WHICH THE
DEBTOR COULD ASSERT AGAINST THE SELLER OF GOODS OR SERVICES OBTAINED PURSUANT
HERETO OR WITH THE PROCEEDS HEREOF, RECOVERY HEREUNDER BY THE DEBTOR SHALL NOT
EXCEED AMOUNTS PAID BY THE DEBTOR HEREUNDER. 
 
(FAC, ¶7
[capitalization original].) This is sufficient to permit Plaintiff allege
claims against Quality for South Bay’s conduct. 
 
II.                
Request for Judicial Notice 
 
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of Exhibit 1, Department of Motor Vehicles Vehicle
Industry Registration Procedures Manual, Section 3.035 is GRANTED. (Evidence
Code §§ 451(f) and 453.) 
 
III.             
Legal Standard Demurrer 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747
(Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and
in context. (See Schultz v. Harney (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1622, as
modified on denial of reh’g (Sept. 29, 1994).) The court “take[s] as true all
properly pleaded material facts, but not conclusions of fact or law asserted in
the complaint.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905,
916.)
 
At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against them. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 721.) “The
allegations of the pleading demurred to must be regarded as true.” (South
Shore Land Co. v. Peterson (1964) 266 Cal.App.2d 725, 732.) A “demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts
impossible in law.” (Ibid. [internal citations omitted].)
 
IV.             
Demurrer
 
A.   
Second Cause of Action for Civil Theft under Penal Code
section 496 (Section 496)
 
Section 496, subdivision (a)
defines the criminal offense of what is commonly referred to as receiving
stolen property. It provides in relevant part: “Every person who buys or
receives any property that has been stolen or that has been obtained in any
manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or
obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or
withholding any property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen
or obtained,” is subject to incarceration. Section 496, subdivision (c), in
turn provides civil liability to such persons. 
 
Penal Code section 484 states “[e]very person who shall
feloniously steal, take, carry, lease or drive away the personal property of
another, or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been
entrusted to him or her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or
fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor
or real property. . . is guilty of theft.” (Pen. Code, §484, subd. (a).) 
 
Thus, “the elements required to show a violation of section
496(a) are simply that (i) property was stolen or obtained in a manner
constituting theft, (ii) the defendant knew the property was so stolen or
obtained, and (iii) the defendant received or had possession of the stolen
property.” (Switzer v. Wood (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 116, 126.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has not alleged
conduct which falls under section 496 because she has not alleged South Bay
obtained the money in a manner constituting theft. Plaintiff states South Bay
Obtained money via “theft, and then withheld, converted, kept and otherwise
misappropriated the Plaintiff’s money constituting civil theft.” (FAC, ¶34.)
However, this is a legal conclusion. Plaintiff has not alleged any foundational
facts demonstrating theft of money or putting South Bay on notice of what
conduct constituted theft. The only foundational fact is the general allegation
of South Bay’s alleged overcharging a vehicle license fee. (FAC, ¶23.) However,
Plaintiff fails to allege the prerequisite facts showing an intent to deprive Plaintiff
of the overcharged amount. 
 
The demurrer to second cause of action is SUSTAINED with
leave to amend. 
 
B.    
Third Cause of action for Fraud and Deceit
 
“The elements of
fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation
(false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity
(or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal. 4th 631, 638 (Lazar).)
“[F]raud must be pled specifically; general and
conclusory allegations do not suffice. . . .This particularity requirement
necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered.” (Lazar, supra, 12 Cal. 4th at
645 [internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted].)


The law holds plaintiffs to a higher standard where there
is a corporate defendant. In that case plaintiff must “allege the names of the
persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to
speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or
written.” (Id. at p. 645; See also Wald v. TruSpeed Motorcars, LLC
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 378 [applying the heightened corporate pleading standing
to an LLC].)
 
Here, Plaintiff has not alleged a fraud
claim with sufficient particularity. Plaintiff alleges that South Bay
misrepresented that the subject vehicle had been inspected and had no
mechanical problems. (FAC ¶¶ 11, 37-39). She does not allege who made this misrepresentation,
what form the misrepresentation came in (i.e., written, or oral), or how that
person had the authority to speak upon South Bay’s behalf. Plaintiff also
alleges that both prior to and after the execution of the contract South Bay
made misrepresentations. (FAC, ¶37.) It is unclear when the misrepresentation
occurred. Plaintiff also alleges South Bay misrepresented the vehicle
registration fee. Again, she does not allege who made the misrepresentation, or
the foundational facts demonstrating that South Bay knew the misrepresentation
was false. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the third cause
is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
C.    
Fifth Cause of Action for Unfair Competition
 
“The Unfair Practices Act [the
Act] is found in Business and Professions Code, Section 17000 et seq.” (Framers
Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 383 (Farmers).) An
unfair practice is any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business practices or
acts and unfair, deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising. (Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17200 et seq. (“Section 17200”); see also Podolsky v. First
Healthcare Corp. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 632, 647.) 
 
A claim premised on the unlawful
prong “borrows” violations of other laws and authorizes a separate action
pursuant to unfair competition. (Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012)
202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1383, as modified on denial of reh’g (Feb. 24, 2012).) To
state a claim based on an ‘unlawful’ business practice, plaintiff must allege
specific unlawful conduct, that the conduct is a business practice, and that because
of the practice, defendants has received ill-gotten gains. (Cal. Prac. Guide
Civ. Pro. Trial Claims and Def. Ch. 14(I)-B.) 
 
There is a split of authority on
the unfair prong. (Jolley v. Chase Home Fin., LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th
872, 907, as modified on denial of reh’g (Mar. 7, 2013) [collecting cases].) On
the one hand, some cases hold unfair practice “is one that offends established
public policy, that is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or
substantially injurious to consumers or that has an impact on the victim that
outweighs defendant’s reasons, justifications, and motives for the practice.” (Ibid.)
On the other hand, some cases hold the claim must be “tethered to specific
constitutional, statutory or regulatory provisions.” (Ibid.) As a
statutory cause of action, allegations of unfair business practices must state
with reasonable particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of
the violation. (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 619.) The statutory violations must be delineated and related
to a business activity. (Ibid.)   
 
A theory for unlawful practices
occurs when a person makes, disseminates, or causes to be disseminated to the
public a statement concerning professional services which is untrue, and which
is either known or should reasonably be known to be untrue. (Bus. & Prof.
Code, §17500) “An unlawful business practice or act within the meaning of the
UCL is an act or practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is at
the same time forbidden by law.” (Bernardo v. Planned Parenthood Federation
of America (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322, 351.) A plaintiff needs to identify
statutory, regulatory, or decisional law that the defendant has violated. (Id.
at p. 352.) 
 
Finally, a defendant violates the
fraudulent prong of the UCL by engaging in conduct by which “members of the
public are likely to be deceived.” (Committee on Children's Television, Inc.
v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 211, superseded by statute on
other grounds as stated in Branick v. Downey Sav. & Loan Ass’n
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.)
 
Here, Plaintiff appears to allege
a claim premised on either the fraud or unlawful prong. As already discussed, Plaintiff
has not alleged a claim for fraud, so a claim under the Act premised on fraud
also fails. However, Plaintiff has alleged unlawful conduct sufficient to
justify a claim under the unlawful prong. Plaintiff alleges that South Bay
violated the Consumers Legal Remedies act by misrepresenting the subject vehicle.
(FAC, ¶¶ 21-24.) Plaintiff also alleges that this is at least one basis for her
claim under the Act. (FAC, ¶98.) This is sufficient. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the fifth cause of action is
OVERRULED. 
 
V.               
Legal Standard Motion to Strike
 
The court may strike out any
“irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.” (Code Civ.
Proc., §437) Motions may also target pleadings or parts of pleadings that are
not filed or drawn in conformity with applicable laws, rules, or orders. (Code
Civ. Proc., §437 subd., (b).) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on
the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., §437.)
“When the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the
court should allow leave to amend.” (Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 761, 768.)
 
To succeed on a motion to strike punitive damages
allegations, it must be said as a matter of law that the alleged behavior was
not so vile, base, or contemptible that it would not be looked down upon and
despised by ordinary decent people. (Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995)
37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228-1229.) Punitive damages are available in non-contract
actions where a defendant is guilty of malice, fraud, or oppression. (Civ.
Code, § 3294, subd. (c) [defining each term].) 
 
Regarding a corporation, “[a]
corporation is not deemed to ratify misconduct, and thus become liable for
punitive damages, unless its officer, director, or managing agent actually knew
about the misconduct and its malicious character. A ‘managing agent’ is an
employee with authority to establish corporate policy, that is, the broad
principles and rules of general application which govern corporate conduct.” (Cruz
v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 163.)
 
VI.             
Motion to Strike
 
The issue is whether Plaintiff has allegations supporting her
claim for punitive damages. She does not.
 
Here, as already discussed, Plaintiff has
not alleged fraudulent conduct. Nor has Plaintiff alleged malice or oppression.
Plaintiff has essentially alleged intentional torts, but nothing beyond that
conduct. The mere allegation that an intentional tort was
committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages. (Grieves
v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal. App. 3d 159, 166.) Nor has Plaintiff
alleged any conduct by a specific employee let alone an officer, director, or
managing agent which could support that Defendants had ratified the improper
conduct. 
 
The motion to strike is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
The motion to strike paragraph 26, lines 22-24, and the prayer for punitive
damages is GRANTED. The motion to strike paragraph 48, lines 21-24, is denied
as moot based on the court’s ruling on the demurrer.  The motion to strike paragraph 4 of Prayer,
line 19 is GRANTED. 
 
VII.          
Conclusion & Order
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED in part
and OVERRULED in part, as follows:  
 
The Demurrer to the
second cause of action for civil theft and the third cause of action as for
fraud and deceit is SUSTAINED WITH THIRTY (30) DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND. The
Demurrer to the fifth cause of action for violations of the Unfair Competition
Law is OVERRULED. 
  
The Motion to
Strike is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, as follows:
 
 The Motion to Strike paragraphs 26, and the
prayer for punitive damages is GRANTED. The Motion to Strike paragraph 48 is
DENIED as MOOT based on the court’s ruling on the Demurrer.
