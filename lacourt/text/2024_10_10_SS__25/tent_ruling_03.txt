 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Larry A. Peluso (“Plaintiff”) filed this action in pro se against
defendants American Spine, P.C., Simonmed Imaging, P.C., Carson Orthopedic
Neurological Medical Group, Inc., Carson Chiropractic Office, Inc., and Maurice
Adams on November 17, 2023. Plaintiff, an attorney, alleges he holds $9,000.00
in trust remaining after a personal injury settlement for his former client,
defendant Adams. The $9,000.00 is subject to $14,000.00 in competing claims.
(Compl., ¶ 1.) Plaintiff seeks to interplead the funds.
 
On August 21, 2024, defendant Adams (“Defendant”), also
self-represented, filed a “MOTION TO – Response to Complaint Motion to Claim
Funds in Lawsuit” [sic]. On October 1, 2024, Defendant filed a
“MOTION TO – Dispute Plaintiffs Motion Amended Complaint” [sic]. Defendant
reserved a hearing for a Motion to Enforce Settlement through the Court
Reservation System. 
 
Defendant did not file effective proofs of service for either
motion. Both proofs of service state he served “Defendant James Antonucci’s
Motion to Dispute Memo of Costs”. Neither that person nor that motion is before
the Court. The POS also attests to transmission by fax and “ONLY BY ELECTRONIC
TRANSMISSION”, a contradiction in terms. Moreover, although Plaintiff appears
to be an attorney, he is self-represented here. A self-represented party
may not be served electronically except upon express consent or court order. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6(c); see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(a)
[electronic service rules subject to section 1010.6].)
 
The Court
cannot act on these motions until they are properly served, particularly in the
absence of an opposition. 
 
Furthermore,
the motions are unintelligible, and the Court is unable to determine what
relief is being requested or the grounds for relief.  
 
Defendant’s
Motions are DENIED. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
