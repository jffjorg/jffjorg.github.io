And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to establish specific jurisdiction over the Defendant. The Defendant, PTI Union, LLC, manufactured and packaged Gold Bond powder, which was sold in California, but the Plaintiffs did not show that the Defendant purposefully directed its activities to California or generated substantial gross income from California sales, as required by the law. The Judge notes that the Plaintiffs' evidence is limited to a 2019 certificate of analysis from a lab to Pharma-Tech Industries concerning kaolin testing, which is after the time of the Plaintiff's exposure to the Gold Bond powder. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs did not show that the Defendant's website discusses a partnership with Clorox, which has headquarters in California, and that even if the partnership exists, it does not relate to the claims against the Defendant. As a result, the Judge grants the Defendant's motion and dismisses the complaint against the Defendant without prejudice.
