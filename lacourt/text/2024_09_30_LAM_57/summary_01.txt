```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' motion for pretrial discovery into State Farm's profits generated from allegedly bad acts and financial condition. The Plaintiffs seek to conduct discovery to provide evidence on the amount of punitive damages they may be entitled to if the jury finds that State Farm acted maliciously, fraudulently, or with oppression in denying their claim. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to establish a substantial probability of prevailing on their claim for punitive damages. The Court evaluated the competing affidavits submitted by both sides and weighed the evidence, concluding that there is no substantial probability that the Plaintiffs will prevail on their claim for punitive damages.
