And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Paymen Rahimi, a defendant in the case. The case involves a dispute over a commission agreement between Nader Ghadoushi and Secured Properties, Inc. Ghadoushi claims that he was owed $205,187.50 in commission for the sale of real property at 3251 West 6th Street, but was only paid $97,708.33. Rahimi received $100,000 from Secured Properties, which Ghadoushi alleges was payment for his commission.

The judge has overruled Rahimi's demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action in the complaint, which are for money had and received and conversion, respectively. The judge finds that the complaint adequately alleges the elements of a cause of action for money had and received against Rahimi, and that the elements of conversion are also met.

The judge has also denied Rahimi's motion to strike paragraph 65 of the complaint and paragraph 3 of the prayer for relief, which relate to Ghadoushi's request for punitive damages against Rahimi on his conversion claim. The judge finds that the allegations in the complaint, if true, would support an award of punitive damages against Rahimi.

Rahimi is directed to file an answer to the complaint by October 14, 2024.
