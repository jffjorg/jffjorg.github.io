 Case Number:  23STCV16049    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  57 The unopposed motion of Plaintiff Firestone Plaza, LLC ("Firestone") for an award of $19,740 in attorney's fees it incurred in connection with this action against Defendants George Subrai and Prabhjyoti Subrai (collectively, "the Subrais") is GRANTED.  Firestone prevailed in its breach of contract action against the Subrais.  The parties' contract states that the party who prevails in an action on the contract is entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees.  In light of that provision in the contract, Firestone is entitled to its reasonable attorney's fees under Civil Code 1717.  In the Court's view, the hourly billing rates of Firestone's attorneys Rosalinda V. Amash and Jerid R. Maybaum are reasonable and the amount of time that Ms. Amash and Mr. Maybaum say they billed in this action is reasonable as well.
