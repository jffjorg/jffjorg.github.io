And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is addressing a demurrer filed by Rahimi in response to Ghadoushi's complaint. The complaint alleges that Rahimi received $100,000 of the money owed to Ghadoushi, and also alleges that Rahimi received "up to" $100,000. The judge notes that the lack of certainty in the exact amount of money converted in the second allegation may run counter to the requirement that a claim for conversion of money must allege a specific sum. However, Rahimi does not advance this argument in their demurrer, and the judge finds that the certainty of the sum converted in Paragraph 25 of the complaint seems to satisfy the requirement of specificity.
