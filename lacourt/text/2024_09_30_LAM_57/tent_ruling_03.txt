 Case Number:  24STCV11428    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  57  Plaintiff Nader Ghadoushi (“Ghadoushi”) sued  Defendants Secured Properties, Inc. (“Secured
Properties”), Ryan Yatman (“Ryan”), Sherry Yatman (“Sherry”), and Paymen Rahimi
(“Rahimi”).[1]
Ghadoushi’s Complaint alleges that he entered into an agreement with Secured
Properties in 2017 pursuant to which Ghadoushi, as an associate licensee, was
to receive 70% of all fees or commissions on certain sales or leases of real property
that Secured Properties brokered (“Commission Agreement”).  The Complaint further alleges that in August
2022, Securities Properties, as a broker, closed escrow on the sale of real
property located at 3251 West 6th Street in Los Angeles (“the
Subject Property”) that fell with the ambit of the Commission Agreement.  The total commissions for the sale of the Subject
Property sale were $293,125,000.  Thus, per
the Commission Agreement, Ghadoushi alleges that he was supposed to receive 70%
of that figure, or $205,187.50.  Ghadoushi
alleges, however, that Secured Properties, through its directors, officers,
and  alter egos Ryan and Chu, paid Ghadoushi
only $97,708,33 and distributed the rest to Chu, Sherry, and Rahimi.  As pertinent here, the Complaint alleges that
Secured Properties, Chu, and Ryan paid to Rahimi $100,000 of the amount owed to
Ghadoushi.  
Pending before the Court is the demurrer of Rahimi to the third and
fourth causes of action in the Complaint, which are for money had and received
and conversion, respectively, and are asserted against all of the Defendants.   Rahimi
contends in the demurrer that the Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to
establish those causes of action against him. 
Rahimi also has moved to strike Paragraph 65 of the Complaint and
Paragraph 3 in the Complaint’s Prayer for Relief, which together relate to Ghadoushi’s
request for an award punitive damages against Rahimi on Ghadoushi’s conversion
claim.   Rahimi contends in the motion to strike the
allegations in the Complaint are insufficient to support such an award. 
The Court is overruling the demurrer and denying the motion to strike.  Rahimi is directed to file an answer to the
Complaint by October 14, 2024.
 DEMURRER
    A. Money Had and Received
“A cause of action for money had and received is stated if it is alleged
that the defendant ‘is indebted to the plaintiff in a certain sum ‘for money
had and received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff.’”  (Avidor v. Sutter’s Place, Inc. (2013)
212 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1454, internal citations omitted [“Avidor”].)   The cause of action is “viable” when the
defendant has received money which belongs to the plaintiff, and which  “equity and good conscience” dictate should be
paid by the defendant to the plaintiff. 
(Ibid; Gutierrez v. Girardi (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 925,
937.)  Based on precedent specifying the elements
of a cause of action for money had and received, juries are instructed in CACI
No. 370  that the plaintiff must prove
that the defendant received money “intended to be used for the benefit of [the
plaintiff],” that the money was not used for the plaintiff's benefit, and that
the defendant has not given the money to the plaintiff.”  (Avidor, supra, 212 Cal.App.4th
at p. 1453, internal citations omitted.) 

In the Court’s view, the Complaint adequately alleges the elements of a
cause of action for money had and received against Rahimi.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Rahimi
owes a certain sum of money, $100,000, to Ghadoushi that was intended for Ghadoushi
and that Rahimi has not given to Ghadoushi.

Rahimi argues that the Complaint fails to allege that the Commission
Agreement binds him and therefore he is not indebted to Ghadoushi.   Rahimi’s
argument misses the mark.  Whether Rahimi
is a party to the Commission Agreement is not dispositive.  What matters is whether Rahimi has money that
belongs Ghadoushi and has not given that money to Ghadoushi.  The Complaint alleges as much and thus withstands
Rahimi’s demurrer. 
 Also unavailing is Rahimi’s assertion in the demurrer that the money he
received reflected the payment by Secured Properties, Ryan, and Chu of a debt they
owed on a loan he made to them.  Perhaps
that assertion will prove to be true in due course in this action.  But when ruling on a demurrer, the Court cannot
consider matters based on evidence outside of the complaint.  (Mt. Hawley Ins. Co. v. Lopez (2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1426).  Rahim’s contention
that the money he received was owed to him is such a matter – the Complaint
makes no mention of it -- and thus is beyond the Court’s purview at this time.

B. B   Conversion
 “Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of
another. The elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the plaintiff's ownership
or right to possession of the property; (2) the defendant's conversion by
a wrongful act or disposition of property right; and (3) [resulting] damages.”  (IIG Wireless, Inc. v. Yi (2018)
22 Cal.App.5th 630, 650.)  While a
wrongful intent is not required, the act constituting conversion must be
knowing or intentional.  (Taylor v.
Forte Hotels Int’l (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1119, 1124.) “Money can be the
subject of an action for conversion if a specific sum capable of identification
is involved.” (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445,
452, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 707; see also (PCO, Inc. v. Christensen, Miller, Fink,
Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro, LLP (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 384, 395.)  
 
In the Court’s view, the elements of conversion are met here.  The Complaint alleges that Ghadoushi had a
right to possess property in the form of money under the Commission Agreement, Rahimi
wrongfully and knowingly took possession of $100,000 worth of that money, and Ghadoushi
was damaged because Rahimi has not returned the money to Ghadoushi.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 18-20, 25, 57, 61-63, 65.)  Rahimi’s argument that the Complaint fails to
allege that he did anything wrong is mistaken. 
Paragraphs 57 and 65 accuse him of wrongfully and knowingly taking money
that belongs to Ghadoushi.[2]

 
MOTION TO
STRIKE        
  Punitive damages may be recovered on a successful conversion claim if the
plaintiff proves that the defendant acted with malice, fraud, or oppression in
converting the plaintiff’s property.  (Krusi
v. Bear, Stearns & Co. (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 664, 678.)  In considering a motion to strike allegations
bearing on punitive damages, the court must consider those allegations holistically
and in light of the asserted factual context of the entire complaint.  (Perkins
v. Superior Court (1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 1, 6; Clauson v. Superior Court
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255
 
The allegations in Ghadoushi’s Complaint against Rahimi, if true, would support
an award of punitive damages against Rahimi on the conversion claim.  The Complaint alleges that the Rahimi conspired
with the other Defendants to maliciously and oppressively deprive Ghadoushi of
money that rightfully belonged to Ghadoushi.  
When the allegations directly related to punitive damages are considered
against the backdrop of the Complaint as a whole, there is enough therein on
which a jury could reasonably conclude that punitive damages should be assessed
against Rahimi.
