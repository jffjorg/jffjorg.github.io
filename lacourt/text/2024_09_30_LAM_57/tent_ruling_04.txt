[1] Because Ryan
Yatman and Sherry Yatman have the same last name, the Court will refer to them
herein by the first names to avoid confusion. 
No disrespect is intended. 


[2] Paragraph 25 of
the Complaint alleges that Rahimi received $100,000 of the money that was owed
to Ghadoushi.  Paragraph 57 alleges that Rahimi
received “up to” $100,000 of that money. 
The lack of certainty in the exact amount of money converted by Rahimi in
Paragraph 57 may run counter to the requirement referenced above that a claim
for conversion of money must allege a specific sum.   Rahimi does not advance this argument in the
demurrer, however.  In any event, the certainty
of the sum converted in Paragraph 25 would seemingly satisfy the specificity requirement.
