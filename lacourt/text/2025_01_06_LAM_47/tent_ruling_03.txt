Vanessa Navarro, et al. 
 
CASE NO.:                 24STCV04445            
 
MOTION
FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants Vanessa Navarro and LA Immigration Center
LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff
Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for injunctive relief that was filed on February 22,
2024.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants are
offering immigration consulting services out of compliance with the California
Immigration Consultant Act. 
 
Defendants move for judgment on the
pleadings. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendants move for judgment on the
pleadings. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A motion for judgment on the
pleadings is the functional equivalent to a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic
Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198).  Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the
pleadings challenge the legal sufficiency of the allegations, not their
veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994). Any defects must either appear on the
face of the pleading, or else be taken by judicial notice.  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-22).  The parties’
ability to prove their respective claims is of no concern.  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 99.)  Though
the Court must accept the allegations of the complaint and answer as true (Gerawan
Farming, Inc. v. Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515), it will not do so for
“conclusions of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to
law or [judicially noticed] facts…” (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v.
CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219-20).
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a motion for judgment
on the pleadings, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who has filed the pleading subject to the motion for
judgment on the pleadings and file a declaration detailing their meet and
confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a).) However, an insufficient
meet and confer process is not grounds to grant or deny a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a)(4).)
 
Defendants entirely fail to address
the statutory meet-and-confer requirement in their moving papers. Nevertheless,
the Court will address the merits of the motion so as to expeditiously resolve
this dispute.
 
Analysis
 
            Defendants
move for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that Defendant Navarro
registered as an immigration consultant after this action was filed. Although
Defendants purport to offer a printout of a listing for Defendant Navarro from
the California Secretary of State’s public records showing that registration,
Defendants have not formally requested judicial notice of that document which
is necessary for it to be considered on this motion. Moreover, even if
Defendants had done so, Defendant Navarro’s registration does not moot this
action as Defendants contend. As Plaintiff states in opposition, it is
well-settled that “the voluntary discontinuance of alleged illegal practices
does not remove the pending charges of illegality from the sphere of judicial
power or relieve the court of the duty of determining the validity of such
charges where by the mere volition of a party the challenged practices may be
resumed.” (Marin County Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson (1976) 16
Cal.3d 920, 929; see also Robinson v. U-Haul Co. of California (2016) 4
Cal.App.5th 304, 315 [no firm rule that cessation of unlawful behavior precludes
injunctive relief].) Defendants have not demonstrated that the Complaint is
without merit on this basis. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
