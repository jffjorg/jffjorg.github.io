 Case Number:  21STCV37502    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  57 ZVI'S DISCOVERY MOTIONSMotion to Compel Jacob and Naomi to Produce Documents As reflected in the chart and  text that appears before and after the chart, from page 2, line 19, to page 4, line 6 of Jacob and Naomi's opposition, a portion of the motion is now moot. As to the outstanding disputes, the Court is inclined to deny the motion as it relates to communications between Naomi and Saul Reiss and Naomi and Daniel McCarthy on the ground that those communications are privileged, but to grant the motion as it relates to the other disputed categories of communications.Motions to Compel Further Deposition Testimony of Jacob and NaomiThese two motions are denied.  The motions offer insufficient bases to compel Jacob and Naomi to appear for another round of depositions.    The Court takes no position, however, on whether Jacob and/or Naomi could be compelled to appear for another round of depositions as a result of the Court's ruling today granting in part Zvi's motion to compel Jacob and Naomi to produce documents.Motion to Compel Compliance with Subpoena to Chase Bank for the Production of RecordsThis motion is denied.  The subpoena was procedurally defective for the reasons stated in Jacob and Naomi's opposition to the motion.   In any event, the subpoena seeks information that was the subject of a prior motion of Zvi's that the Court denied based on the mediation privilege.  And the subpoena  would sweep up private financial information of non-party Shelly Sperling.ZVI'S EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER SETTING A HEARING PRIOR TO DECEMBER 2, 2024 ON ZVI'S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTER DEPOSITION OF MAXIM LIGHTING INTERNATIONAL'S PMKThis ex parte application is denied.   The Court has no open days prior to the scheduled start of trial in this case on December 2, 2024 on which the motion to compel a further deposition of Maxim's PMK could be heard.  In any event, as the Court has informed the parties, the Court is presently engaged in a jury trial in another case and almost certainly will be engaged in that same trial on December 2, 2024. This means, of course, that the trial in this case almost certainly will not commence as scheduled on December 2, 2024. And it means that there is no need to set a hearing prior to December 2, 2024 on the motion to compel a further deposition of Maxim's PMK, even if the Court had an open day for that before then.  If the Court is no longer engaged in the trial in the other case on December 2, 2024, thereby allowing the trial in this case to proceed as scheduled on December 2, 2024, Zvi can renew this ex parte application and seek to advance the hearing on the motion in question  If the motion is granted, the deposition of Maxim's PMK could occur during the trial.ZVI'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO TO FILE FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT Subject to Zvi's presentation of an oral reply at the hearing on his motion for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint , the motion is granted in part and denied in part.  It is granted to the extent that Zvi's seeks to eliminate his request for an award of  damages on his claim for breach of contract and state that Zvi's sole remedy on that claim is an orde for specific performance.   It also is granted to the extent that Zvi seeks to make technical corrections to the complaint.   The motion is denied to the extent that Zvi seeks to add a dissolution claim against Architectural Custom Lighting, Inc.  The motion also is denied to the extent that Zvi seeks to add allegations of credit card misuse. MOTIONS IN LIMINE Jacob and Naomi's MILs# `1  2013 Tax Issue   DENIED#  2   Personal Usage of Corporate Credit Cards   GRANTED # 3    Settlement Offer                    GRANTED# 4   Compensatory Damages      GRANTEDZvi's MILs#  1   2024 Sales Process           DENIED#2       Zvi's Subpoenas                  DENIED PRE-TRIAL DOCUMENTS FOR THE FINAL STATUS CONFERENCEThe parties need to meet and confer in connection with the preparation of joint pre-trial documents for the FSC.  The only document that has some semblance of joint work is the witness list that Zvi filed on November 15 that incorporates Zvi's witnesses on to the Defendants' list.  But even as to the joint witness list, the time estimates are incomplete and the total number of hours is not included.The Court is concerned about the lack of a joint exhibit list.  Absent a full meet and confer on the authenticity and admissibility of exhibits, the start of the trial will be delayed.
