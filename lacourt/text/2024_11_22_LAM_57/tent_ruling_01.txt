  Case Number:  20STCV22026    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  57 This case is on calendar on November 22, 2024 for an order to show cause ("the OSC") regarding entry of judgment.  The Court placed the OSC on calendar when it granted the Defendants'  motions for summary judgment..   The Court will not be entering judgment at this time because the Plaintiffs have filed motions for reconsiderations of the Court's summary judgment ruling.   Additionally, in placing the OSC on calendar, the Court overlooked the cross-complaint that the Farmers Defendants' filed against Plaintiff Michael Mann, which was not resolved by the summary judgment ruling and remains pending.  At the hearing on November 22, 2024, the Court will consolidate the hearing date on the motions for reconsideration to just one date.  The Court will discuss with counsel for all parties an appropriate hearing date that works for everyone.  The Court observes here that the January 14, 2025 hearing date that Plaintiffs reserved and obtained for one of the reconsideration motions is a suitable date for the Court to hear all of the motions if that is convenient for all sides.  The same is true for the Court for the January 29, 2025 hearing date that Plaintiffs reserved and obtained for another one of the reconsideration motions.  At the hearing on November 22, 2024, the Court also will discuss with the parties the status of the Farmers Defendants' cross-complaint against Mann.
