And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 20STCV22026. The case is set for an order to show cause (OSC) regarding entry of judgment on November 22, 2024. However, the judge will not enter judgment at this time because the plaintiffs have filed motions for reconsideration of the summary judgment ruling. The judge also notes that a cross-complaint filed by the Farmers Defendants against plaintiff Michael Mann remains pending and has not been resolved by the summary judgment ruling. At the hearing on November 22, 2024, the judge will consolidate the hearing dates for the motions for reconsideration and discuss possible dates with counsel for all parties. The judge also intends to discuss the status of the cross-complaint against Mann with the parties.
