And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions filed by the parties. The judge finds that a portion of Zvi's discovery motion is now moot. The judge is inclined to deny the motion as it relates to communications between Naomi and Saul Reiss and Naomi and Daniel McCarthy, citing the mediation privilege. However, the judge is willing to grant the motion as it relates to other disputed categories of communications.

The judge denies Zvi's motions to compel further deposition testimony of Jacob and Naomi, finding that the motions offer insufficient bases for compulsion. The judge also denies Zvi's motion to compel compliance with a subpoena to Chase Bank, citing procedural defects in the subpoena.

The judge denies Zvi's ex parte application to set a hearing prior to December 2, 2024, on his motion to compel further deposition testimony of Maxim's PMK, citing the scheduling of a jury trial in another case and the likelihood that the trial in this case will be delayed.

The judge grants Zvi's motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint, subject to Zvi's presentation of an oral reply at the hearing on his motion. The judge grants the motion to the extent that Zvi seeks to eliminate his request for damages on his claim for breach of contract and to make technical corrections to the complaint. However, the judge denies the motion to the extent that Zvi seeks to add a dissolution claim against Architectural Custom Lighting, Inc. or to add allegations of credit card misuse.

The judge also rules on several motions in limine, granting some and denying others. Finally, the judge reminds the parties that they need to meet and confer to prepare joint pre-trial documents for the final status conference.
