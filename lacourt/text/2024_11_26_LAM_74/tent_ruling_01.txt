al. v. Kia America, Inc. 
Defendant KIA America, Inc’s Motion
to Strike or Tax Costs
 
BACKGROUND  
            Plaintiffs
Gabriel Barahona and Bertha Barahona (Plaintiffs) filed a breach of contract
and warranty claim against defendant Kia America, Inc (Defendant) under the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. 
            On
September 20, 2024, the Jury reached a verdict for the Plaintiffs. 
            On
October 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Memorandum of Costs.
            On
October 22, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to strike or tax costs. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including attorneys’ fees, as a
matter of right, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute.  (¿¿See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, subd.
(a)(4), 1032, subd. (b), 1033.5¿¿.)  Under
Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (a), “Any buyer of consumer goods who is
damaged by a failure to comply with any obligation under this chapter or under
an implied or express warranty or service contract may bring an action for the
recovery of damages and other legal and equitable relief.” Accordingly, the
prevailing buyer in this context may recover costs and expenses reasonably
incurred in the prosecution of the case.  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)
“A
‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of [the] propriety’ of
the items listed on it, and the burden is on the party challenging these costs
to demonstrate that they were not reasonable or necessary.”  (Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486-1487.) ¿Costs otherwise allowable as a matter of right
may be disallowed if the court determines they were not reasonably necessary,
and the court has power to reduce the amount of any cost item to an amount that
is reasonable.  (See Perko’s
Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245
[finding that¿“the intent and effect of section 1033.5, subdivision¿(c)(2) is
to authorize a trial court to disallow recovery of costs, including filing
fees, when it determines the costs were incurred unnecessarily”].)¿
DISCUSSION
            Defendant seeks to tax $360.71 in
filing fees.  Defendant claims that
several reservations for hearings were unnecessary and duplicative but provides
no evidence they were duplicative.  (See Jones
v. Dumrichob (1998) 3 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266 (“burden is on the party
seeking to tax costs to show they were not reasonable or necessary.)  Additionally, Plaintiffs submit that
Plaintiffs’ motions to compel were granted. 
(Crandall Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4.)  The
filing fees seem proper on their face and Defendant submits no evidence to the
contrary. Thus, the court does not tax those fees.
            Defendant
seeks to strike or tax $3,844.53 in Jury Fees. 
Plaintiffs agree to tax $2,085.45 in jury fees.
            Defendant
seeks to tax $4,200.45 for depositions, which include videotaping and purportedly
unnecessary duplication of transcripts. 
Plaintiff responds that the depositions were not videotaped and that Plaintiff
obtained transcripts to be used to impeach witnesses at trial or to read from
transcripts for unavailable witnesses.  Defendant
additionally claims that some witnesses were not “essential” to depose but does
not refute Plaintiff’s reasons for those depositions. (Crandall Decl., ¶ 5-6.) The
court does not tax those costs. 
            Defendant
seeks to tax $500.00 in service of process costs.  Defendant alleges Plaintiffs served the same
person without justification.  Plaintiff
provides the justification for multiple service attempts because Defendant
refused to accept service on behalf of the witnesses and the trial was continued.
The court finds those costs reasonable and recoverable and does not tax them.  
            Defendant
seeks to strike or tax $10,543.83 in expert witness fees.  Defendant claims that (1) Plaintiffs’ expert
was from Sonoma County, requiring additional travel costs and (2) Plaintiffs unnecessarily
inspected the vehicle twice. Defendant cites no authority that Plaintiff must
choose a local expert, or that Plaintiffs are not entitled to the travel costs
of the expert of their choosing. 
Additionally, Plaintiffs’ expert attended Plaintiffs’ vehicle inspection
and had an employee attend Defendant’s vehicle inspection because Plaintiffs’
expert was unavailable.  (Crandall Decl.,
¶¶ 10, 11.)  Plaintiffs retained only one
expert.  (Crandall Decl., ¶ 9.)  The court finds Plaintiffs’ expert witness
fees reasonable and recoverable and does not tax those costs. 
            Defendant
seeks to strike or tax $14,148.92 in court reporter fees.  Defendant alleges that the court reporter
fees exceed what was reasonably required and that Plaintiffs did not adhere to
unspecified “Court Minute Orders.” 
Defendant attempts to use the Court’s court reporters fee schedule to
indicate that Plaintiffs’ fees are inflated. 
Plaintiff used an independent court reporter service because the Court’s
official court reporters were unavailable. 
Defendant does not submit evidence that Plaintiffs’ independent court
reporter’s charges were unreasonable.  The
court does not tax those costs. 
            Defendant
seeks to strike $5,679.01 for models, enlargements, and photocopies.  Defendant states it is unclear how Plaintiffs’
costs for 3 binders of exhibits and a flash drive grew to $5,679.01 and claims
that Plaintiffs failed to justify the cost. Plaintiffs provide the invoices for
the 4 binders.  (Memo. of Costs, Ex. “F.)  The court finds this item reasonable and the
costs recoverable. 
            Defendant
seeks to strike or tax $10,000.00 in interpreter fees.  Defendant opposed Plaintiffs’ hiring of two
interpreters.  Hiring two interpreters is
reasonable because of the intensity of interpretating.  (Crandall Decl., ¶ 8.)  The court finds this item reasonable and the
costs recoverable. 
            Defendant
seeks to strike or tax $1,628.51 in “other” costs. Defendant challenges costs
for “attorney services, messengers and/or ‘court appearance professionals’” and
travel expenses.  Plaintiffs properly
identify that Civil Code section 1794(d) controls the reasonableness of fees.  Under Song-Beverly, the prevailing plaintiff
is entitled to recover costs and expenses beyond the statute enumerating items
allowable as costs.  (Smalley v.
Subaru of America, Inc (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 450, 457; Warren
v. Kia Motors America, Inc (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 42-43.)  The court finds Plaintiffs’ counsel’s travel
charges reasonable, but not charges for food. 
Regardless of whether Plaintiff’s counsel was engaging in litigation or
not, counsel still needed to eat.  (Ladas
v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 775-76.)  The Court taxes $379.27 for food related
expenses.  Defendant argues that
additional overhead costs are not recoverable as “out-of-pocket” expenses but
does not provide authority that supports a finding that expenses that would not
have been incurred but for the litigation are not recoverable.  Therefore, the court finds the other expenses
recoverable.  
             
CONCLUSION
             The court grants in part and denies in part
Defendant’s motion.  Plaintiffs’ costs
award is taxed by $2,138.35.
            Defendant to give notice.
