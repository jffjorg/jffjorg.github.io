And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Phyllis Gafford, alleges that she developed mesothelioma from exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured by the defendant, Parex USA, Inc. fka LA Habra Products, Inc. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has no evidence that she was exposed to their products, citing the plaintiff's standard interrogatory responses. The plaintiff responded that she was exposed to asbestos-containing products due to her proximity to her husband's home remodeling and construction work, automotive repair and maintenance, and clothing coated with asbestos-containing dust between the 1950s and the 1980s. However, the plaintiff did not identify the products or provide any evidence of exposure to the defendant's products.

The court finds that the plaintiff's discovery responses are factually-devoid and fail to show any disputed issue of material fact. The plaintiff's deposition testimony also failed to provide any evidence of exposure to the defendant's products. Therefore, the defendant has shifted the burden to the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact. Since the plaintiff failed to meet this burden, the court grants the motion for summary judgment.
