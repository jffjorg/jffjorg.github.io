 Case Number:  22STCV40073    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  74 David M. Wolf v. Elias Aziz-Lavi, et
al.
 
Plaintiff David M. Wolf’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) from Defendant Elias
Aziz-Lavi and Request for Sanctions.
 
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply. The court did not
consider Defendant’s surreply.
BACKGROUND
            This action involves a creditor’s
suit.
            On December 23, 2022, Plaintiff
David M. Wolf (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendant Elias Aziz-Lavi
(Defendant) and others. 
            On
March 15, 2023, the court entered Defendant’s default.
            On
April 12, 2023, Plaintiff served on Defendant the form interrogatories (set
one).
            On
May 12, 2023, Defendant responded with objections to each request. One
objection noted that Defendant could not respond to the interrogatories because
he was in default.
            From
May 23, 2023, until June 9, 2023, the parties met and conferred to no avail.
            On
July 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel further responses to the
form interrogatories.
            On
July 28, 2023, the court vacated the default entered against Defendant.
LEGAL STANDARD 
            ¿¿A
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response to interrogatories
if the propounding party deems that an answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete, or that an objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a).) Such a motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks further response to
Form Interrogatory Nos. 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11,
2.12, 4.1, 4.2, 12.1, 12.3, 12.4, 12.6, and 15.1. However, Defendant argues
that he was in default when Plaintiff propounded the interrogatories. (Siry
Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th 333, 343 [holding a
party who is in default is barred from further participating in the
proceedings, unless that party appeals the resulting default judgment or seeks
a new trial]; Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155
Cal.App.3d 381, 385-386 [“A defendant against whom a default has been entered
is out of court and is not entitled to take any further steps in the cause
affecting plaintiff's right of action […].”].) Because Defendant was still in
default when Plaintiff propounded the interrogatories, throughout the
meet-and-confer process, and even when Plaintiff filed this motion, Defendant
was not required to respond to the discovery. The court notes that Defendant addressed
this issue in his general objections to the form interrogatories. 
            Plaintiff
contends that entry of default in no way limits Defendant’s obligation to
respond to discovery. (Wolf Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. 5.) But Plaintiff’s reliance on Armstrong
v. Gates (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 952 is misplaced. There, the court held that
it was an abuse of discretion to deny the plaintiff’s right to take a
deposition in support of its opposition to the defendant’s motion to set aside
the entry of default and default judgment. (Armstrong v. Gates, supra, 32
Cal.App.3d at pp. 957, 959-960.) Plaintiff does not demonstrate how any of the
interrogatories would have supported his opposition to Defendant’s motion to
set aside the default, which the court heard on July 28, 2023. Nor has
Plaintiff persuaded the court (with applicable authority) that Defendant’s
agreement to provide supplemental responses, while still in default, obligated
Defendant to further respond. (Wolf Decl., ¶¶ 6, 7; Ex. 6; Ex. 7.) Thus, the
court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses and request for
sanctions.
CONCLUSION
                The court denies Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further responses to form interrogatories (set one). The court denies
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.
                 Plaintiff shall give notice.
