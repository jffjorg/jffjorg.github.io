Application for and Renewal of Judgment.
            On
October 16, 2023, the court informed Plaintiff’s counsel that the answer to

listed $30.00 as the fee for filing the application. However, the required fee

the $45.00 as required. (Kousherian Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. C.) 
            On
November 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion.
