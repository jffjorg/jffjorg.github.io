  - "Severe non-monetary sanctions for failure to comply with a court order are allowed only where the failure was willful."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Defendant 511 Rampart, LLC against Plaintiff Martin Quiroz Galvez. The motion was filed on July 20, 2023, and no opposition was timely filed. The court has found that Plaintiff failed to respond to written discovery, including form interrogatories, as ordered by the court on March 21, 2023. However, the court has also found that Plaintiff died in January 2021 and that his next of kin have refused to continue with the case on his behalf. Therefore, the court has determined that Plaintiff's failure to comply with the court order was not willful, and terminating sanctions are not appropriate. Instead, the court has decided to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint against Defendant without prejudice. The court has denied Defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the deceased Plaintiff.
