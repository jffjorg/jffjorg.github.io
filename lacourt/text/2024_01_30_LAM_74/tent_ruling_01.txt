Socorro Amador, et al. v. 511 Rampart, LLC, et al.
 
Defendant
Rampart 36, LLC’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions against Plaintiff Martin
Quiroz Galvez
 
The court considered the moving papers. No opposition was
timely filed.
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a dispute
between a landlord and multiple tenants.
            On April 30, 2020, Plaintiff Martin
Quiroz Galvez (Plaintiff) and others filed a complaint against Defendant
Rampart 36, LLC (Defendant) and others. In the complaint, Plaintiff alleged the
following causes of action: breach of warranty of habitability, breach of
covenant of quiet enjoyment, negligence, breach of contract, nuisance, and
unfair competition.
            Defendant has since reached a
settlement agreement with other plaintiffs in this action.
            On July 20, 2023, Defendant filed
this motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff.
LEGAL STANDARD
            California discovery law
authorizes a range of penalties for a party's refusal to obey a discovery
order, including monetary sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, issue sanctions,
and terminating sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, 2023.030; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) A court has
broad discretion in selecting the appropriate penalty. (Los Defensores,
supra, at p. 390.)
            “The discovery statutes
evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary
sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.) Severe non-monetary sanctions for
failure to comply with a court order are allowed only where the failure was
willful. (See R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The authority which Defendant cites for the proposition
that the discovery violation need not be willful (Ghanooni v Super Shuttle
(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 260) involved imposing attorney’s fees as
discovery sanctions (which are intended to make the moving party whole
regardless of the non-responding party’s wilfullness), not terminating
sanctions.
DISCUSSION
            Defendant seeks terminating sanctions
against Plaintiff because he has not responded to any written discovery. For
example, Plaintiff never provided responses to form interrogatories, as ordered
by the court on March 21, 2023. But Plaintiff’s former counsel has indicated
that Plaintiff died in January 2021. (Volcy Decl., ¶ 3;
Ex. A.) Plaintiff’s former counsel has further indicated that Plaintiff’s
next of kin have refused to continue with the case on Plaintiff’s behalf.
(Volcy Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. A.) Given these circumstances, the court finds that Plaintiff’s
failure to comply with the court order was not willful, meaning terminating
sanctions are not appropriate. However, the court will dismiss Plaintiff’s
complaint against Defendant without prejudice.
CONCLUSION
                The court denies Defendant’s motion for
terminating sanctions. The court instead dismisses Plaintiff’s complaint against
Defendant without prejudice. The court denies Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions against the deceased Plaintiff.
            Defendant shall give notice.
