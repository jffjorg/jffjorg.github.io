And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Bank of Taiwan to amend its application for and renewal of judgment. The application was initially served and filed on October 12, 2023, but the court informed the plaintiff's counsel that the answer to question 5(g) was insufficient, as it listed a fee of $30.00 instead of the required $45.00. Despite this, the counsel paid the required fee of $45.00. The plaintiff then filed the motion to amend the application on November 28, 2023. The judge rules that the error was clerical and grants the motion to amend the application. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
