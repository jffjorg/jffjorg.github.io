English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the motion by Plaintiff David M. Wolf to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents from Defendant Elias Aziz-Lavi and others. The court has also considered the opposition and reply to the motion. The court denies the motion and requests for sanctions, finding that the Defendant was in default when the interrogatories and requests for production of documents were propounded and therefore was not required to respond. The court also notes that the Plaintiff's reliance on prior case law is misplaced and that the Defendant's agreement to provide supplemental responses while still in default does not obligate him to further respond.
