And here is a brief summary in English text:

The City of Santa Clarita has filed a motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication on various issues related to the motor vehicle collision that occurred on September 30, 2021. The City argues that it is not liable for the accident because there is no evidence that its property at the accident location was in a dangerous condition, and there is no evidence of a negligent act by a City employee or actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition. The judge has granted the City's motion and denied the Plaintiffs' opposition. The judge finds that the City's daily inspections of the construction project did not reveal any dangerous conditions, and Lynn's testimony that her view was not obstructed and she saw Popejoy's vehicle at all times before the accident is credible. As a result, the Court finds that the City is not liable for the accident and grants summary judgment in favor of the City.
