And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted in part and denied in part the motion to compel further responses filed by the plaintiff, Roy Paras. The motion was filed in response to the defendant, Franklin Robinson's, incomplete and inadequate responses to requests for production of documents. The judge found that the plaintiff is entitled to further responses and production with regard to requests 1 and 2, which seek all communications and documents exchanged between the defendant and the plaintiff. However, the judge denied the motion as to requests 3-14, which seek the defendant's communications and documents exchanged with unspecified third parties. The judge also denied both parties' requests for sanctions. The hearing date is set for December 15, 2024.
