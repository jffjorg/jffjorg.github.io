The Plaintiff filed a lawsuit alleging various labor code violations, including failure to pay wages, waiting time wage continuation, and unfair business practices. The Defendants demurred and moved to strike portions of the Plaintiff's complaint. However, instead of filing an opposition, the Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC). As a result, the Judge has deemed the Defendants' demurrer and motion to strike moot. The Judge orders that the case proceed based on the FAC.
