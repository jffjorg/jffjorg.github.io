  - "If the parties try to depose one or both of these witnesses, and if the federal prosecutors offer an objection, that issue can be addressed at that time."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Gumruckcu, has moved for an order staying the civil case pending the outcome of a federal criminal trial in the District of Vermont. However, the court finds that the defendant has failed to meet his burden to establish the requisite preconditions for a stay. The court notes that the charges in the criminal case do not necessarily have any overlap with the civil case, and that the 5th Amendment rights invoked by the defendant are not sufficient to justify a stay. The court also finds that the other defendants in the case who are not parties to the criminal matter are entitled to have their claims resolved in a timely fashion. Therefore, the motion is denied, without prejudice to a renewed motion citing new facts or changed circumstances.
