And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to file a Second Amended Complaint to update his allegations. The court has ruled that it is more likely than not that the delay in filing the Second Amended Complaint is not unwarranted, and that the amendment will not cause additional cost for trial preparation, witness depositions, and other discovery. The plaintiff is ordered to file the Second Amended Complaint within 30 days, and to serve the defendant within 30 days of filing the Second Amended Complaint. The court has also set an Order to Show Cause re: filing Proof of Service for February 23, 2024, at 8:30 am, and has continued the case management conference to the same date and time.
