 Case Number:  23STCV04138    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  14 Hernandez v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's DepartmentInstant Motion
 
            Plaintiff
now moves this court for an order permitting him to file a Second Amended
Complaint to update his allegations.
 
Governing Standard
 
            “[T]he
court's discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of
the pleadings. [Citations]. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428. It is
an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend based on delay alone; the
amendment must affirmatively prejudice the opposing side. Higgins v. Del
Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565. However, prejudice exists where
the delay is unwarranted and the result will be additional cost for trial
preparation, witness depositions, and other discovery. See Doe v. Los
Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th
675, 689 (citing Melican v. Regents of University of California (2007)
151 Cal.App.4th 168, 175); P&D Consultants, Inc. v. City of
Carlsbad (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345 (citing Huff v.
Wilkins (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 732, 746).
