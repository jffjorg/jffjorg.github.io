(Compl., pp. 1, 3, ¶ 10.)    On March 28, 2024, the Court dismissed  the action without prejudice pursuant to the provisions of Code of Civil  Procedure section 581, subdivision (b)(3) following the parties’ failure to  appear at trial. (3/28/24 Order of Dismissal; 3/28/24 Minute Order.)   On September 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed  the instant Notice of Motion and Motion to Set Aside Dismissal (Without  Prejudice) and Reinstate the Complaint Pursuant to California Code of Civil  Procedure Section 473 (the “Motion”).    No Opposition was filed.   II.                  Procedural  Issues   The Court notes Plaintiff failed to  attach a copy of the Complaint to the Motion.    III.               Legal  Standard    The court has broad discretion to  vacate the entry of default, default judgment, or a dismissal where the moving  party timely establishes a proper ground for relief. (Cruz  v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 488,  495.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) contains two  distinct provisions for relief from default.  The first provision is  discretionary and broad in scope, providing: “The court may, upon any terms as  may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a  judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her  through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.   Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or  other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall  not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case  exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was  taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)    The second provision of Code of  Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) is mandatory, providing: “[T]he  court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months  after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s  sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or  neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or  her client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2)  resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client,  unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by  the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The court shall,  whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct  the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing  counsel or parties. However, this section shall not lengthen the time within  which an action shall be brought to trial pursuant to Section 583.310.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)   The  general underlying purpose of Code of Civil Procedure  section 473, subdivision (b) is to promote the determination of actions on  their merits. (Even Zohar Const. & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire  Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 838-839.)     IV.               Discussion   A.     Timeliness   As an initial matter, the Court notes the Motion was  filed on September 30, 2024, which is six months after the dismissal without  prejudice was ordered on March 28, 2024.    Here, Plaintiffs  raise a claim for relief due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect by an attorney, which is a form of mandatory relief  that requires application for relief to be filed no later than six months from  the date of dismissal. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)    Since Plaintiffs filed the Motion at exactly six months  from the dismissal, the Court finds the Motion to be timely.    B.      Motion to Set Aside  Dismissal               Plaintiffs move to set aside the dismissal  on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ counsel, Maryetta C. Marks, (“Counsel”) failed  to appear in court on March 28, 2024 due to Counsel’s mistake, inadvertence,  error and/or excusable neglect. (Motion, p. 3.) In addition to moving for  relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), Plaintiffs  also move pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(5)  to have the “dismissal set aside, complaint reinstated, all pre-trial dates  reset including and not limited to the trial date.” (Motion, Marks Decl., ¶ 8.)    Here, the Court finds there is  sufficient evidence to warrant setting aside the dismissal against Plaintiffs. Counsel’s  declaration established that the March 28, 2024 dismissal was entered due to  Counsel’s mistake, inadvertence, error, and neglect in failing to appear in  court on March 28, 2024. (Motion, Marks Decl.) While Counsel broadly declares  that Counsel failed to appear in court on March 28, 2024 due to Counsel’s  mistake, inadvertence, surprise and/or excusable neglect without providing  further detail, Counsel also states Plaintiffs are “innocent of any wrongdoing,  fault, mistakes and or errors regarding the instant case. In fact, [Plaintiffs]  have always and at all times diligently and consistently inquired about the  status of their cases since the inception of their cases. [Plaintiffs] continue  to be ready, willing, and able to go to trial in this matter.” (Marks Decl., ¶ 5.)  Further, delay in seeking relief and inexcusable neglect are not valid grounds  for denying a motion for mandatory relief (see Metropolitan Service Corp. v.  Casa de Palms, Ltd. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1487-1488), and the instant  dismissal was not a mandatory dismissal. Therefore, pursuant to the mandatory  provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), the Court  finds Plaintiffs have established a right to relief.               Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ unopposed  Motion is GRANTED.   V.                 Conclusion  & Order   Plaintiffs  Manual and Berta Najera’s unopposed Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal  (Without Prejudice) and Reinstate the Complaint is GRANTED. The dismissal  entered on March 28, 2024 is hereby VACATED.   ORDER  TO SHOW CAUSE regarding failure to file proof of service is set for February 26, 2025 at 9:30 a.m., in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.   Trial  is scheduled for June 3, 2025 at 8:30  a.m. in Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse.  Parties are ordered to comply with Third  Amended Standing Order in Civil Limited Jurisdiction Cases, effective as of  February 24, 2020.    Moving party is ordered to  give notice.
