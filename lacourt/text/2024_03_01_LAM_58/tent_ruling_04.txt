Discussion

 
            Plaintiff
moves to amend the judgment identifying Judgment Debtor from “Arnita Brooks” to
“Arnita Charlot.” 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 187 provides that once a court has jurisdiction over a
party, it may employ “all the means necessary to carry [its jurisdiction] into
effect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 187.) “This includes the authority to amend a
judgment to add an alter ego of an original judgment debtor, and thereby make
the additional judgment debtor liable on the judgment. [Citation.] Amending a
judgment to add an alter ego of an original judgment debtor ‘ “is an equitable
procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the judgment to
add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the real
defendant.” ’ ” (Highland Springs Conference & Training Center v. City
of Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 267, 280; NEC
Electronics Inc. v. Hurt (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 772, 778-779.)
 
            To
prevail on a motion to amend a judgment to change a judgment debtor's name, the
moving party must show that the party to be added was in fact an original
defendant in the action. (Burlingame v. Justice's Court (1934) 1 Cal.2d
71, 72–73.) In addition, the moving party must have acted with due diligence in
seeking to amend the judgment. (Alexander v. Abbey of the Chimes (1980)
104 Cal.App.3d 39, 48.) The moving party has the burden of proving the facts
essential to the granting of the motion by a preponderance of the evidence. (Wollersheim
v. Church of Scientology (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1017.) But the
“decision to grant an amendment lies in the sound discretion of the trial
court. [Citation.]” (Relentless Air Racing, LLC v. Airborne Turbine Ltd.
Partnership (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 811, 815.)


            Here,
Plaintiff’s evidence shows that, on November 16, 2017,
Judgment Debtor changed her legal name from “Arnita Brooks” to “Arnita Charlot.”
(Fernandez Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. D.) Despite this name change and the ongoing
litigation in this case, Defendant Arnita Brooks did not inform the Court or Plaintiff
that she had changed her name. (Fernandez Decl., ¶¶9-12, Exs. F, G.) 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff
has met its burden on this motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to amend the judgment is
granted.
