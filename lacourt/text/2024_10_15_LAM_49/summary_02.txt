And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, which means that the defendants are temporarily prohibited from terminating the lease until the case is resolved or until December 31, 2025, whichever comes first. The judge found that the plaintiff has a high likelihood of success on the merits of its breach of contract claim and that the balance of the harms shifts in favor of granting the preliminary injunction. The plaintiff and defendants were former partners in the operation of a charitable health clinic, and the defendants breached the contract by failing to extend the lease term. The plaintiff has complied with its obligations under the contract, and the defendants have not identified any harm that would result from granting the preliminary injunction.
