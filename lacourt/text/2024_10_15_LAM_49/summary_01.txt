Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Jeffrey Riddell, has moved to expunge the lis pendens on the subject property. The lis pendens was filed by the plaintiff, GMG Development, LLC, in connection with a breach of written contract and declaratory relief cause of action. The defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot establish a probability of prevailing on its breach of contract cause of action because the plaintiff failed to perform its obligations under the contract.

The court has found that the evidence shows that the plaintiff did receive the notice to buyer to perform, contrary to the plaintiff's assertions. Additionally, the court has found that any delay due to weather was minimal and not material to the plaintiff's failure to timely complete the transaction.

As a result, the court has granted the defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens. The court has also awarded the defendant attorney's fees in the amount of $2,925.00, as the plaintiff has not acted with substantial justification and there is no evidence that an award of fees would be unjust.
