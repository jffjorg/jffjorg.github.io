Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court rules that Plaintiff Kenneth MacKenzie is entitled to an award of attorney's fees against Defendant General Motors, LLC.

The Court also awards all of the hours expended by the five members of the team who billed more than six hours each, and awards a total lodestar of $32,036.50. The Court does not grant a lodestar enhancement, as the case is not unusually complex or novel.
