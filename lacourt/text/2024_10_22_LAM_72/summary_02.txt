And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion by the plaintiff, George Rahme, to deem admitted the matters contained in the Requests for Admission (Set One) served on the defendants, The Bicycle Casino, L.P. and Hashem Minaiy. The plaintiff is also seeking an order compelling further responses from the defendants and sanctions of $4,000.00 against each defendant.

The court denied the motions to deem the matters in the RFAs admitted, but granted the motion to compel further responses. The defendants are required to provide further responses within 30 days. The court deemed the defendants' opposition to the motions to deem the RFAs admitted to be substantially justified and therefore did not award sanctions.

The case involves an employment dispute, with the plaintiff alleging that he was terminated from his job at The Bicycle Casino, L.P. in April 2022 as part of a sale of the company to Parkwest Bicycle Casino LLC. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against TBC and Hashem Minaiy, raising claims of discrimination, hostile work environment, and wrongful termination, among others.
