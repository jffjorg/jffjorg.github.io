(“Defendant”).
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion as follows.

Background
 
This is a Song-Beverly Action.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on April 7, 2022. Trial was
eventually set for August 5, 2024. On May 7, 2024, the parties reached a
settlement agreement when Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s 998 offer to
compromise for $25,000.00.
 
Plaintiff filed this motion on August 23, 2024. Defendant
filed an opposition and Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
The Court overrules Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice and
takes notice of the proffered public records.
 
Legal Standard
 
A buyer who prevails in an action under the Song-Beverly Act
may recover their reasonable costs and expenses, attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended. (Civ. Code, § 1794.)
 
The lodestar method for calculating attorney fees applies to
any statutory attorney fees award, unless the statute authorizing the award
provides for another method of calculation. (Glaviano v. Sacramento City
Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744, 750-751.) “Under the
lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the lodestar figure—the
reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate—based on a
careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of
each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Id. at p.
751.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted based on factors specific
to the case, which may include, without limitation, “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Warren,
supra, at p. 36 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
 
Discussion
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
Hourly Rate
 
Plaintiff requests the following rates for his attorneys:
 
Shahid Abdul: $350
Mani Arabi: $495
James Carroll: $595
Christian Castro: $475
Tionna Carvalho: $570 in 2023 and $595 in 2024
Tyler Hollingsworth: $595
Timothy Kenney: $410
Elizabeth Larocque: $595
Regina Liou: $525
Jacob Lister: $495
Jami Littles: $595
Ian McCallister: $585
Maro Orte: $495
Matthew Pardo: $435
Michael Raichelson: $595
Steven Rangel (law clerk): $285
Nino Sanaia: $385
Rosy Stoliker: $425
Nadia Thomas: $450
Rabiya Tirmizi: $375
 
The Court finds that these rates are reasonable in light of
each person’s experience.
 
Plaintiff apparently seeks hours billed for Tyson Smith at
the rate of $475 per hour, although Plaintiff does not provide Smith’s
experience. The Court reduces Smith’s rate to $250.
 
Hours
 
Plaintiff requests a total of 95.4 hours across the twenty-one
people staffed on Plaintiff’s case. (Shahian Decl., Ex. 21.)
 
“[J]ust as there can be too many cooks in a kitchen, there
can be too many lawyers on a case.” (Donahue v. Donahue (2010) 182
Cal.App.4th 259, 272 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted].)
“Plainly, it is appropriate for a trial court to reduce a fee award based on
its reasonable determination that a routine, noncomplex case was overstaffed to
a degree that significant inefficiencies and inflated fees resulted.” (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.) As noted by the
trial judge in Morris, “every time that somebody new to the file picks
the file up in order to do whatever the task is, there's a certain amount of
built-in startup [time].” (Id. at p. 33.)
 
Although a significant plurality of the hours were billed by
just five attorneys, with this level of staffing, it is inevitable that
inefficiencies will result. Lemon law cases can involve complex technical
issues, but there is nothing anomalous about this case indicating that it is
substantially more complex than the average lemon law case. 
 
In such a case, a court may appropriately make an
across-the-board percentage cut in the hours claimed or the final lodestar
figure. (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America, supra, 41 Cal.App.5th
at p. 40.)
 
The Court awards all of the hours expended by the five
members of the team who billed more than six hours each (Shahid Abdul, James
Carroll, Maro Orte, Michael Raichelson, and Tyson Smith) and therefore appear
to be the core members of the team. The Court awards $21,036.50 for these team
members. These fees appear generally reasonable, particularly when the rest of
the fees by the expanded team are appropriately reduced. 
 
For the non-core team members, the Court awards a total of
$11,000.  This amount appears to be
reasonable in light of the tasks that these non-core members were able to
perform, taking them off the plate of the core team members.
 
The Court awards a total lodestar of $32,036.50.
 
Lodestar Enhancement
 
There is nothing unusually complex or novel about this case
warranting a lodestar enhancement. The Court therefore does not grant one.
 
Costs
 
Plaintiffs provides evidence of the costs expended, which
the Court deems reasonable. (Shahian Decl., Ex. 21.)
 
The Court awards $2,529.46 in costs.
