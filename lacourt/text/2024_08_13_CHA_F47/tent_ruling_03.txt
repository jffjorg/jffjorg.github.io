SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a fire allegedly caused by an
HVAC system in a rental property owned by Defendant San Fernando Valley
Automotive, LLC (San Fernando) which allegedly caused damage to Plaintiffs’ Ted
Shuzo Sakaida and Pamela A. Sakaida, Trustees of the Ted and Pamela Sakaida
Revocable Trust dated December 31, 1991 (Plaintiffs) property which is located
next door to San Fernando’s property.
 
On 1/22/24, Plaintiffs filed this action for negligence
against San Fernando and its tenant Defendant Rock Time Transport, Inc. (Rock
Time).  On 3/27/24, San Fernando answered
the complaint and on 4/4/24, Rock Time answered the complaint.  On 4/5/24, Rock Time filed a cross-complaint
against Plaintiffs which Plaintiffs answered on 5/6/24.
 
On 5/14/24, San Fernando served Plaintiffs with Special/Contention
Interrogatories, Set 1, making responses due on or before 6/17/24.  (Levine Decl., Ex.A).  Having received no responses, on 6/21/24, San
Fernando’s counsel emailed Plaintiffs’ counsel in an attempt to meet and confer
and requested responses without objections by 6/30/24.  (Id., Ex.B).  Plaintiffs’ counsel did not respond or
provide responses by the deadline.  (Levine
Decl.).  A representative from
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s office contacted San Fernando’s attorney on 7/12/24
indicating responses were being prepared. 
(Robinson Decl.).  
 
On 7/16/24, San Fernando filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiffs to provide answers, without
objections, to Special/Contention Interrogatories, Set 1, served on
5/14/24.  Additionally, Defendant
requests an order imposing sanctions on Plaintiffs and/or their attorney in the
amount of $1,675.00.  Plaintiffs have
opposed the motion and San Fernando has filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS 

 
In the opposition, Plaintiffs’ counsel indicates that the
failure to serve responses to the subject discovery was due to a calendaring
error for the response date.  The
opposition indicates that on 7/12/24, a representative from Plaintiffs’
counsels’ office telephoned San Fernando’s counsel stating that responses were
being prepared and Plaintiffs needed additional time due to health issues their
attorney was experiencing.  (Robinson
Decl.).  On 7/30/24, Plaintiffs served
responses to the subject interrogatories. 
(Kaufman Decl., Ex.1).  Based on
the foregoing, Plaintiffs claim the request to compel responses is moot and ask
that sanctions not be imposed.
 
In the reply, San Fernando requests that, even though
responses to the interrogatories have been provided, the Court still impose
sanctions against Plaintiffs and/or their attorney because Plaintiffs’
counsel’s office did not inform them of the delay in providing responses until 7/12/24
which San Fernando’s counsel claims was after the motion was drafted.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claim that the motion is
moot due to the service of responses on 7/31/24 is without merit.  Due to Plaintiffs’ failure to serve timely
responses to the subject interrogatories, they waived objections to same.  CCP 2030.290(a).  The responses served on 7/31/24 include
objections.  (See Kaufman Decl.,
Ex.1, p.3:5-p.4:4 (pdf 9-10 “General Objections”).  As such, San Fernando is entitled to an order
compelling Plaintiffs to provide responses without objections.
 
Based on Plaintiffs’ failure to comply with their
discovery obligations, San Fernando is entitled to an award of sanctions
against Plaintiffs and their attorney, Jack E. Kaufman.  CCP 2030.290(c).  However, the Court finds that the amount of
time claimed to have been spent preparing the motion to be excessive.  Therefore, sanctions are reduced to $1,000.00
(2 hours to prepare the motion + 2 hours to review the opposition, prepare the
reply and appear at the hearing multiplied by $250/hour).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Plaintiffs are ordered to provide verified responses without objections
to San Fernando’s Special/Contention Interrogatories, Set 1, within 30
days.  Sanctions in the amount of
$1,000.00 are imposed against Plaintiffs and their attorney, Jack E. Kaufman,
payable within 30 days.
