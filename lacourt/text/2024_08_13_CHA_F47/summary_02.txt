And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the claims to determine the distribution of surplus funds on deposit. The property at 12732 Daventry St. in Los Angeles, California was sold at a trustee's sale for $499,000.00, leaving $88,075.24 in surplus funds. The trustee, Entra Default Solutions LLC, received three written claims from potential claimants who claim to be the heirs of the former trustor, Evelyn Butler. However, the claimants failed to provide documentation to establish their heirship. As a result, the trustee filed a petition to deposit the surplus funds with the clerk of the court, and the court ordered the funds to be deposited. Despite notice being sent to potential claimants, no claims have been filed. Therefore, the funds are ordered to be escheated to the State of California as unclaimed property.
