And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Janet Schori, M.D. The motion seeks to grant summary judgment in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiffs on the issue of medical negligence. The judge has granted the request for a continuance of the hearing due to the illness of the plaintiffs' attorney, who was diagnosed with lymphoma. The judge has also noted that the parties must clarify the status of the second cause of action, which was sustained with 30 days leave to amend, but no amended complaint or dismissal has been filed. Additionally, the judge has advised the parties that future requests for continuances should be made by ex parte application or stipulation and order. The hearing will be continued approximately 60 days, and opposition and reply papers are due pursuant to CCP 437c(b).
