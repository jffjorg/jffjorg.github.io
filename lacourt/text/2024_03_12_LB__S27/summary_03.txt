And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling deals with a motion to compel discovery filed by LBUSD and Thomas Maggio, defendants in a sexual assault case against Jane Doe. The defendants seek to conduct discovery to establish that Jane Doe's emotional distress was caused, at least in part, by subsequent events and not by her childhood experience. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, opposes the motion, citing Knoettgen v. Superior Court (1990) and Mendez v. Superior Court (1988), which refused to permit the proposed discovery.

The Court has considered the recent ruling in Doe v. Superior Court (2023), which discussed and distinguished Knoettgen and Mendez. The Court finds that the defendants' motion is not as expansive as they argue, and that the trial court must carefully weigh the probative and prejudicial value of the evidence. The Court orders the parties to meet and confer and discuss the Supreme Court opinion from Doe. The hearing on the motion to conduct discovery is continued to April 23, 2024.
