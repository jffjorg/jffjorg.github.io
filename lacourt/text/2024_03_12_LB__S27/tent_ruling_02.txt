 Case Number:  22LBCV00049    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  S27 Jason M. Stone, attorney for SEJ Properties,
L.P., seeks to be relieved as counsel, contending an irreconcilable breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship has occurred such that further
representation is not possible.  Counsel confirmed
his client’s address by conversation, and filed proof of service of the moving
papers on his client and all parties who have appeared in the action.  
 
No party has filed opposition to
the motion.  Notably, trial is not
scheduled until 9/16/24, and therefore SEJ will not be prejudiced by the
withdrawal.  The motion is granted.  Relief is effective upon filing proof of
service of the final order on SEJ.
 
Counsel is ordered to give notice.
