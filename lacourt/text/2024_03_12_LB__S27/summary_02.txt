And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in case 22LBCV00049, granting Jason M. Stone's motion to be relieved as counsel for SEJ Properties, L.P. Stone claims that an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship has occurred, making further representation impossible. No party has opposed the motion, and since the trial is not scheduled until September 16, 2024, SEJ will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal. The relief is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order on SEJ. The Judge orders counsel to give notice, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must email the court by the deadline. If no one submits, the motion may be placed off calendar, and parties should arrange to appear remotely.
