MOVING
PARTY:  Petitioner Tanisha Glasper
(“Petitioner”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
            Petitioner, individually and as guardian ad litem for
minor claimant Ariana Nicholson (the “Minor”), among others, filed a complaint
against Defendants.  This action arises
out of a landlord/tenant relationship. 
The complaint alleges: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied warranty
of habitability; (3) nuisance; (4) negligence; (5) intentional infliction of
emotional distress; (6) wrongful eviction; (7) violation of Cal. Civ. Code
Section 1950.5(1).
 
Petitioner
filed the instant petition to approve the compromise of disputed claim on
behalf of the Minor (the “Petition”).  
 
DISCUSSION
If
an action is pending and settlement is effected prior to trial, the minor’s
compromise must be approved by the court. 
(CCP § 372.)  A petition to
approve a minor’s compromise is governed by California Rules of Court (“CRC”), rules 7.950, et seq. and Probate Code sections 3500 and 3600 et seq.  The
trial court is authorized to approve and allow payment of reasonable expenses,
costs, and attorney fees in an action concerning the compromise of a minor’s
claim.  (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a); Curtis v. Estate of Fagan (2000) 82
Cal.App.4th 270, 277-79; see also CCP § 373.5.)
 
Attorney’s Fees
Unless
the court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a
reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney's
fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a
minor or a person with a disability. 
(CRC, r. 7.955(a).)  The court
must give consideration to the terms of the agreement between the attorney and
minor’s representative and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and
circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made.  (CRC, r. 7.955(a)(2).)  CRC Rule 7.955(b)(2) sets out nonexclusive
factors the court may consider in determining the reasonableness of attorney’s
fees in connection with a petition for minor’s compromise.  Under CRC Rule 7.955(c), the petition must
include a declaration by the attorney addressing the factors set forth in CRC
Rule 7.955(b)(2) that are applicable to the matter that is before the Court.
 
Here,
the Minor, by and through Petitioner, her guardian ad litem, has agreed to
settle her claims against Defendants in exchange for $2,500.  Upon approval, $625 of this settlement
payment will be allocated towards attorney’s fees, eaving a balance of $1,875.00
to be disbursed to Petitioner for the Minor.
 
            The Court finds that the settlement is fair and
reasonable.  Further, the Court considers
the requested amount in attorney’s fees, which amounts to 25% of the settlement
payment, to be fair and reasonable.  For
these reasons and because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Petitions.  (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
