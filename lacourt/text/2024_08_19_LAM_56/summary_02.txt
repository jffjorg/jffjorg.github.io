And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by Defendant UNITED AIRLINES, INC. to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff KEITH FEDER, M.D., INC. The FAC alleges negligent misrepresentation and promissory estoppel claims against Defendant, asserting that Defendant made false promises and representations regarding the payment rate for medical services. The court previously sustained Defendant's demurrer to the original complaint with leave to amend, finding that the claims were preempted by ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974).

The court finds that the FAC does not cure the defects in the original complaint and that the claims are still preempted by ERISA. The court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that Plaintiff cannot amend the FAC to cure the defects. The court's ruling is based on the finding that the claims are inextricably intertwined with the ERISA plan and are thus preempted by ERISA.
