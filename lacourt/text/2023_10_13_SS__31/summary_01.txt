And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the request for default judgment in the amount of $82,928 against defendants Elani Express, Inc. and Yeghish Manukyan. The plaintiff, Evelia Campuzano, is seeking damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle incident. The judge has awarded the plaintiff $20,732 in special damages, which includes medical expenses of $20,732 and $3,039.51 in property damage. However, the judge has reduced the plaintiff's request for general damages from $100,000 to $62,196 due to the lack of supporting documentation for claims of severe emotional distress and psychological disorders. The court has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
