 Case Number:  BC657226    Hearing Date:   October 13, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  10/13/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  BC657226 MARVIS DAVIS VS SHAUN MICHAEL HUTTAR REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  SHAUN MICHAEL HUTTAR RECOMMENDATION:  DENY for reasons stated below, and dismissal of action.  TENTATIVE  The request for default judgment submitted on June 21, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  The Court previously noted in the previous default judgment denials, on July 27, 2022 and on December 16, 2022, that Plaintiff must submit evidence demonstrating proper service of the Statement of Damages on Defendant Shaun Michael Huttar (“Defendant”) prior to entry of default.   In this fourth default judgment request, Plaintiff’s counsel (“Counsel”) declares that he served the Statement of Damages upon the Defendant prior to entry of default on November 18, 2019. (Wolfson Decl. ¶24; Exh, 6.) This Statement of Damages, dated October 29, 2019, was mailed via USPS to the address 422 Warren Lane, Inglewood, CA 90302 (“Warren Address”) on October 29, 2019. However, there is no indication Defendant received this mail, especially since Plaintiff filed an application for publication thereafter. The application for publication provided that the process server found Defendant no longer lived at the Warren Address, and that a skip trace found a second address in Los Angeles, California, where Defendant only had rented a room and had already moved out. (Appl. Publ., May 23, 2019.) Thereafter, a private investigator was unsuccessful in locating Defendant. (Ibid.)  In personal injury and wrongful death cases, a plaintiff must serve a statement of damages setting forth the nature and amount of damages to be sought before default may be taken. (Code Civ. Proc., section 425.11.) The purpose of the statement of damages is to ensure that a defendant who declines to contest an action does not thereby subject himself to open ended liability. (Schwab v. Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991) 53 Cal.3d 428, 435 (quoting Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826.) The Court finds that Defendant did not receive proper notice of the Statement of Damages served via mail on October 29, 2019 at the Warren Address, because as of March 9, 2018, Plaintiff’s process server already declared that the Warren Address was a “bad address per Joseph Matthew Pare, the current occupant, who moved in March 2018. He believes subject could have been the previous tenant but does not personally know the subject.” (Appl. Publ., May 23, 2019 at p. 9; Canas Decl.) The purported service of the Statement of Damages on October 29, 2019 is invalid.  The Court then turns to Plaintiff’s service of the Statement of Damages by publication. (Wolfson Decl. ¶26; Exh. 8.) However, the affidavit of publication, indicating service on August 14, 2022, August 21, 2022, August 28, 2022, and September 4, 2022, is after Plaintiff obtained Defendant’s entry of default on November 18, 2019. A statement of damages must be served on a defendant before default is entered by the Court Clerk. (Hamm v. Elkin (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1343, 1345-46). A default judgment is void if the required statement of damages was not served on the defendant before the default was taken. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1521, 127 Cal.Rptr.3d 542.) Formal notice “is an essential prerequisite to a valid default judgment.” (Engebretson & Co. v. Harrison (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 436, 443-444, 178 Cal.Rptr. 77 [mail service constituted inadequate notice].) Accordingly, the default against Defendant is VOID.   Aside from the default being void, the Court further notes the Statement of Damages served by publication provide notice of the following special damages: medical expenses ($17,500), prescriptions and walking device ($1,147), future medical expenses (knee replacement) ($53,750), and vehicle personal property damage ($1,502).   However, the special damages sought in Plaintiff’s request for default judgment exceeds the Statement of Damages. The amount sought cannot exceed the amount pled in the operative complaint/cross-complaint or set forth in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., § 580(a); Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1018.) It appears that Plaintiff changed the breakdown of Plaintiff’s damages from the Statement of Damages served by publication. The “future medical expenses (knee replacement)” on the Statement of Damages is now demarcated into two separate items, one for “Surgery and Rehab Right Knee” and the other for “Future Medical Surgery and Rehab Left Knee,” both seeking $50,500 as to each. Plaintiff may not recover an amount in excess of the damages noticed to Defendant. The served Statement of Damages appears to provide notice of only a single knee replacement, and not for a double knee replacement at double the noticed cost.   Lastly, the Court previously remarked on December 16, 2022 that Plaintiff’s counsel does not establish personal knowledge of Plaintiff’s medical bills to be able to authenticate the medical bills. (Min. Order, Dec. 16, 2022.) Plaintiff must authenticate his medical bills. (Ibid.) However, Plaintiff’s counsel again submits unauthenticated medical records in his own declaration. Plaintiff’s counsel is neither an authorized custodian of the records nor a witness with personal knowledge of the damages suffered to attest that the medical bills are true and correct bills and services rendered to Plaintiff as a result of the incident.    Once more, the Court notes the age of this case, which at this point is six years and six months old. CCP § 583.310 requires an action be brought to trial within five years after the action is commenced against the defendant. Otherwise, “[a]n action shall be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on motion of the defendant, after notice to the parties, if the action is not brought to trial within the time prescribed in this article.” (CCP § 583.360(a).) Dismissal of the action is “mandatory and ...not subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as expressly provided by statute.” (CCP § 583.360(b).) “Sections 583.310 and 583.360 subserve the purpose of “encourag[ing] the expeditious disposition of litigation.” [Citation.] The aim of the statutes is not to have trials, but to bring cases to a conclusion, to secure for plaintiffs the relief, and to defendants, the repose, to which the law entitles them, and to free the court's resources for the efficient adjudication of other claims.” (Hughes v. Kimble (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 59, 69-70.)  In the context of a default judgment, courts have held that a reasonable period of time between the defendant's default and the entry of the default judgment should be excluded from the calculation of the five-year period. (See Howard v. Thrifty Drug & Discount Stores (1995) 10 Cal.4th 424, 439-40 [one week between finalization of arbitrator’s award and entry of judgment was indubitably reasonable period]; cf. Hughes v. Kimble, supra, 5 Cal.App.4th at 70 [gap of three years between default and judgment unreasonable and did not toll five-year statute].) “[T]he time between entry of a default and entry of a default judgment should be excluded from the five-year time to bring a case to trial if and only if the court finds that the plaintiff used due diligence to obtain entry of the judgment, and that in spite of such due diligence, it was impossible, impracticable, or futile to obtain a judgment.” (Hughes v. Kimble, 5 Cal.App.4th at 71; see also Vanyek v. Heard (1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 467, 471 [“The fair test is whether the plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity throughout the entire five-year period to bring the action to trial.”].)  The Court previously scheduled an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal for failure to enter default judgment prior to the expiration of the five-year dismissal statute for March 10, 2023. Plaintiff was put on notice that the Court considered dismissing this action pursuant to CCP §583.360, and that Plaintiff must show cause why the action should not be dismissed. (Min. Order, Dec. 16, 2022.) Furthermore, the Court stated that oral argument alone would be insufficient to show reasonable diligence, and required admissible evidence to be submitted at least sixteen (16) court days prior to the March 10th OSC. (Ibid.)  On March 10, 2023, Counsel represented they needed additional time, and the OSC Re: Dismissal was continued to June 22, 2023. (Min. Order, March 10, 2023.) On June 22, 2023, Counsel represented that a new default judgment was in process and the court continued the hearing to October 13, 2023. (Min. Order, June 22, 2023.) In light of the most recent submitted default judgment package with all of the above-noted and uncured defects, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate reasonable diligence in seeking default prior to the expiration of the five-year dismissal statute.   Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s action is hereby DISMISSED. (CCP §583.360.)
