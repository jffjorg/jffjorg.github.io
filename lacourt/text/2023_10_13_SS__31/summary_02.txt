```

Here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the request for default judgment against Shaun Michael Huttar and dismissed the action. The reason for the denial is that the plaintiff failed to provide proper service of the Statement of Damages on the defendant. The defendant did not receive notice of the Statement of Damages, which is required by law, and therefore the default judgment is void. The plaintiff also changed the breakdown of damages from the Statement of Damages, which is not allowed. Additionally, the plaintiff's counsel did not establish personal knowledge of the plaintiff's medical bills. The judge also notes that the action is six years and six months old, and that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate reasonable diligence in seeking default prior to the expiration of the five-year dismissal statute. Therefore, the action is dismissed.
