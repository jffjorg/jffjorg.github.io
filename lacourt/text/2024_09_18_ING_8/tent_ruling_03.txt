¿¿ 
CASE NAME:                        Rosario
Marcela Rivera Santos v. General Motors LLC, et al. 
¿¿ 
MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff,
Rosario Marcela Rivera Santos 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant,
General Motors, LLC
 
TRIAL DATE:                           Not Set. 

¿¿ 
MOTION:¿                                  (1) Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. 
 
Tentative Rulings:                  (1) ARGUE. The Court
understands that since the August 28, 2024 hearing date, that GM has provided
Plaintiff with supplemental responses. However, due to the fact that neither
supplemental declaration indicates which documents correspond with which Bates
numbers, the Court requires clarification.   
 
 
I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff, Rosario Marcela Rivera
Santos (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant General Motors (“GM”)
and DOES 1 through 10. The Complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express
Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; and
(3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act § 1793.2.
 
On May 6, 2024, Plaintiff
propounded Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Defendant seeking
documents: (1) Plaintiff’s own vehicle; (2) Defendant’s warranty and
replacement/repurchase policies, procedures, and practices; and (3) Defendant’s
knowledge of the same or similar defects in other vehicles of the same year,
make, and model as the Subject Vehicle. On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff notes that
Defendant GM responded asserting boilerplate objections that are not
code-compliant. Plaintiff also notes that Defendant GM did not provide
verifications in support of its responses until June 12, 2024. However, at this
time, Plaintiff contends that Defendant nevertheless failed to produce many of
the responsive documents requested. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that
Defendant has failed tp produce the entirety of the emails, memoranda, data or
investigations that could help Plaintiff establish Defendant’s knowledge of the
same or similar defects in other vehicles of the same year, make, and model.
Plaintiff argues that this evidence would establish Defendant GM’s knowledge
and inability to repair the defects.  
 
As such, Plaintiff has brought this Motion to
Compel Further responses to the propounded Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿ 
            On July 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Compel
Further Responses. On August 15, 2024, Defendant GM filed an opposition brief.
On August 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief. 
 
            This motion was originally heard on August 28, 2024, but
was continued to September 13, 2024. Subsequently, on September 13, 2024, this
motion was continued to be heard on September 18, 2024. The Court indicated
that supplemental declarations from counsel by noon of September 12, 2024 as
to: (a) the remaining requests for production of documents at issue after GM’s
belated production; and (b) the parties’ positions given the Court’s indication
of the scope of its typical rulings on discovery of other customers’ complaints
and of technical literature in a Lemon Law case. 
 
            On September 12, 2024, counsel for Plaintiff, Gregory
Sogoyan filed a declaration in support of Plaintiff’s motion. 
 
            On September 13, 2024, counsel for GM, Kyle Roybal, Esq.
filed an untimely declaration that the Court nonetheless considers. 
 
II. ANALYSIS 
¿ 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
“Unless otherwise limited by order
of the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) For discovery purposes, information is regarded as
relevant “if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case,
preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement thereof.” (City of Los
Angeles v. Superior Court (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 272, 288.)  
A motion to compel further
responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be
brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate,
evasive, or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or
overly generalized objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) A
motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing
that there “a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the
discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to
other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.” If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) ¿ 
"The court shall limit the
scope of discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness
of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought
will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." (Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. § 2017.020(a).) Generally, objections on the ground of burden require the
objecting party to produce evidence of (a) the propounding party's subjective
intent to create burden or (b) the amount of time and effort it would take to
respond. (See West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior Court In
and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) However, no such
evidence is necessary where discovery is obviously overbroad on its face. (See Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)
B.    Discussion 
 
Based on the parties’ supplemental declarations, it appears that
on September 6, 2024, GM contends that it provided full and complete
supplemental discovery responses and corresponding document production on
September 12, 2024, thereby addressing all of the issues in Plaintiff’s motion.

 
However, also on September 6, 2024, Plaintiff asserts that
counsel for Plaintiff, Gregory Sogoyan, sent a detailed email to opposing
counsel to attempt to meet and confer pursuant to the Court’s August 28, 2024
order. Plaintiff’s counsel notes that he offered September 6, September 9, and
September 10 to meet and confer telephonically prior to the September 12
deadline, but that to date, Defendant GM’s counsel has refused to meet and
confer. Plaintiff’s counsel also argues that on September 9, 2024, GM served
supplemental responses, but failed to produce a single responsive document,
despite referring to certain documents by Bates Numbers in its responses. 
 
While the Court is able to view GM’s supplemental responses, the
Court is unable to determine which documents correspond with which Bates
numbers. As such, it is impossible for this Court to determine whether the
documents already produced, but supplementally provided with corresponding
Bates numbers, are code-compliant responses and production. Thus, the Court
requires clarification at oral argument as to which documents GM has already
produced, and which documents Plaintiff’s counsel believes should be required
to be produced.
