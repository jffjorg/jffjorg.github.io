And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is setting a tentative ruling for a hearing on September 18, 2024, regarding a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The motion was brought by the plaintiff, Rosario Marcela Rivera Santos, against General Motors LLC, alleging causes of action for Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and Violation of the Song-Beverly Act § 1793.2.

The Judge notes that the defendant, General Motors LLC, has provided supplemental responses to the request for production of documents, but that the responses do not indicate which documents correspond with which Bates numbers. The Judge requires clarification at oral argument to determine which documents have already been produced and which documents the plaintiff's counsel believes should be required to be produced.

The Judge is also setting aside the motion to compel further responses to argue at the hearing, as the parties have not yet had an opportunity to meet and confer to resolve the issues. The Judge will consider the parties' supplemental declarations and will review the documents already produced to determine whether they are code-compliant responses and production.
