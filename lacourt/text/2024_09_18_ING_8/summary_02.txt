And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff, Jiro Koyanagi, shall be granted motions (1), (2), and (3) to compel the City of Redondo Beach to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The City is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections by October 11, 2024. The judge has also ordered the City to admit or deny requests for admission without objections by the same date.

The judge has deferred consideration of the request for sanctions until the City files a motion for relief from waiver of objections.

The judge has noted that the City's counsel, Keaton E. Moore, unexpectedly passed away, but has not found that this excuses the City's failure to timely respond to discovery requests. The judge has expressed sympathy for the City's situation but has not granted further extensions or relief from the discovery deadlines.

The judge has stated that the City's objections to discovery requests are waived as a result of its failure to timely respond, and that the City must provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections. The judge has also stated that the City's failure to timely respond to discovery requests is a misuse of the discovery process and may result in monetary sanctions if the City continues to engage in this behavior.
