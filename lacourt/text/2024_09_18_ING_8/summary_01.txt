And here is a summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling grants the three Petitions for Minor's Compromise filed by the Plaintiffs, Saul Salas-Lopez, Felicia Guzman, Saul Salas-Lopez Jr., Rickee Salas-Lopez, and Sophee Salas-Lopez, against the Defendant, Dean K. Sugano, and Mashcole Property Management, Inc. The Petitions seek court approval of the settlement of the minor's claims and the disposition of the proceeds of the settlement or judgment.

The Court finds that all information provided in the moving papers tends to bear upon the reasonableness of the compromise, and therefore grants the motions. The Court orders that the balance of the proceeds of the settlement or judgment be deposited in insured accounts in one or more financial institutions in this state, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.

The Petitions indicate that the minor plaintiffs have recovered completely from the effects of the injuries and there are no permanent injuries. The Petitioners have made a careful and diligent investigation into the facts and circumstances of the incident or accident, and have agreed to a lump sum payment of $1,000 per Minor Plaintiff. The total amount of attorney's fees for which court approval is requested amounts to $250 per Minor Plaintiff.
