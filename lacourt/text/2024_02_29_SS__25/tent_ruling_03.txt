ANALYSIS
 
I.          Requests
for Admission  
A.               
Legal Standard 
            “Any
party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to
the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of
specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to
fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.010.) “Within 30 days after
service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2033.250(a).) In the discovery context “[u]nsworn responses are tantamount to
no responses at all.” Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632,
636. 
When a party fails to serve a timely response to requests
for admission “[t]he party to whom the request was directed waives any
objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product.” (Code Civ. Proc § 2033.280(a).) “The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this
order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a response in
substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).) “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction . . .
on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated [the] motion.” Ibid. 
Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d) provides that a misuse of
the discovery process is “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery.”  Code Civ. Proc. §
2023.010(h) states that a misuse of the discovery process includes “[m]aking or
opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to
compel or limit discovery.”   “The court
may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct” under Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2023.030(a).  A court has discretion to
fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions.  Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit
Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.
 
B.        Discussion  
Plaintiff’s counsel, Joseph M.
Pleasant (“Pleasant”), declares that on March 21, 2023, his office served
Defendant’s counsel with Set One of Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission through
electronic service. (Pleasant Decl., ¶ 2; Exhibit A.) On August 2, 2023, after numerous
extensions were granted for Defendant to provide responses by such date,
Defendant served unverified responses. (Pleasant Decl., ¶ 2; Exhibit B.)
After meet and confer correspondence, Defendant served further unverified
supplemental responses on October 4, 2023. (Pleasant Decl., ¶¶ 2-3; Exhibits B,
C, and D.) Pleasant declares that “[t]o date, [his] office has not received any
verified response to Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One.” (Pleasant
Decl., ¶ 3.) 
As to monetary
sanctions, Pleasant declares that his hourly rate is $300.00 per hour and a
$60.00 filing fee was incurred for the motion. (Pleasant Decl., ¶ 4.) Pleasant states
that he spent two (2) hours of attorney time to bring the motion. (Pleasant
Decl. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions against Defendant in the
total amount of $660.00. (Pleasant Decl., ¶ 4.) 
The Court
finds that Defendant has failed to provide verifications to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Admission, Set One, and the lack of verifications are tantamount
to no response. Thus, the Court finds that the matters in Set One of
Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission shall be deemed admitted. Moreover, the
motion is unopposed which leads to an inference that the motion has merit. Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410. Plaintiff’s motion for
an order deeming Set One of its Requests for Admission as admitted is GRANTED. 
The Court
finds that the motion is relatively straightforward and not complex in nature.
Thus, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in
the reasonable amount of $360.00. Such an amount represents one (1) hour of
work on the motion plus the $60.00 filing fee. Defendant is ORDERED to pay
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $360.00 within 30 days of the
date of this order. 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for an order deeming Set
One of Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission as admitted is GRANTED. 
 
            Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. Defendant is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in
the amount of $360.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days of the date of this order. 
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
