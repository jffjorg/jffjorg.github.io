And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argues that Plaintiff's complaint for defamation fails to state a cause of action. The Judge finds that the complaint is insufficient to state a cause of action for defamation because it fails to allege that the purported letter claiming Plaintiff was a prostitute was made intentionally and published to a third person, and it does not specifically allege that the statement concerning Plaintiff's being a prostitute is a false statement.

The Judge also finds that Defendant improperly served the motion via electronic service, as Plaintiff, who is representing herself in pro per, did not consent to electronic service.

As a result, the Judge CONTINUES the hearing on Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings to April 11, 2024, for Defendant to serve Plaintiff with the motion through an authorized means. The Judge orders Defendant to file proper proof of service of the motion at least 10 court days prior to the continued hearing date. Failure to do so may result in the motion being placed off calendar or denied.
