And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to quash subpoenas for financial records filed by the defendants, Lisa Yvette Adams Winston and Carl Winston. The defendants seek to quash the subpoenas, arguing that the financial records are irrelevant to the plaintiff's claims and infringe on their privacy rights.

The judge has denied the motion to quash filed by Lisa Winston, finding that her financial records may lead to the discovery of relevant, admissible evidence. In contrast, the judge has granted the motion to quash filed by Carl Winston, finding that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a sufficient connection between Carl Winston and the alleged fraud.

The judge has also denied the parties' requests for sanctions. The hearing is scheduled for December 7, 2023, and the parties are advised to submit any further arguments or evidence by email to the courtroom by 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
