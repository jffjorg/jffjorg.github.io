CCP § 387(d)(1) provides that the court
shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the action or
proceeding if “a provision of law confers an unconditional right to intervene,”
or “[t]he person seeking intervention claims an interest relating to the
property or transaction that is the subject of the action and that person is so
situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede that person’s
ability to protect that interest, unless that person’s interest is adequately
represented by one or more of the existing parties.” 
Third party Deanna Gravillis moves to
intervene in the action on the ground that she is the majority shareholder of
Defendant Gravillis, Inc. Corporations
Code § 1800(c) provides
that any shareholder of a company that is subject to an action for involuntary
dissolution has an unconditional right to intervene in the action. This is an
action for involuntary dissolution of Gravillis, Inc. 
The motion is GRANTED.
