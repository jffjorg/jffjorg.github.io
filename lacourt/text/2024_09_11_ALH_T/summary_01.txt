And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a protective order, which would have prevented the defendant from conducting a mental examination of the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the car crash caused her various physical and mental health issues, including whiplash, neck pain, concussion, and fibromyalgia, and claimed that she is not seeking damages beyond "garden variety" pain and suffering. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's claims involve mental suffering that exceeds the ordinary distress associated with physical injuries, putting her mental state "in controversy" and justifying a mental examination. The judge also found that the Court's previous order granting the defendant's motion for a mental examination was valid, as it specified the diagnostic tests and procedures that would be conducted.
