(California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324)
  - "A party requesting leave to amend must include a copy of the proposed amended pleading and attach a declaration by counsel to show: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) why the request was not made earlier."
  - "The Court treated Cross-Defendant Shabnam Akhoundzadeh's Motion for Summary Judgment and the alternative Motion for Summary Adjudication against the Third Amended Cross-Complaint as a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings."
  - "The elements of malicious prosecution are: ... That defendant was actively involved in bringing or continuing the lawsuit; That the lawsuit ended in plaintiff's favor; That no reasonable person in defendant's circumstances would have believed that there were reasonable grounds to bring the lawsuit against plaintiff; That defendant acted primarily for a purpose other than succeeding on the merits of the claim; That plaintiff was harmed; and That defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff's harm."
