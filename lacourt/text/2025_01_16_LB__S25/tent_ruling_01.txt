On May 23, 2023, Defendant Nikhil Kapoor, M.D., filed an answer. On May 31, 2023, Defendant Youssef Awad, M.D., (“Dr. Awad”) filed an answer. On June 20, 2023, Defendant St. Mary Medical Center (“Defendant”) filed an answer. On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint, substituting Doe 1 with Casey Mosard, N.P. (June 27, 2023 Amendment to Complaint.) On August 30, 2023, Defendant Christopher Hoshino, M.D., and Casey Mosard, N.P., filed an answer.On October 24, 2024, Defendants St. Mary Medical Center and Dignity Health (“Defendants”) filed the instant motion for summary judgment. On January 2, 2025, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On January 9, 2025, Defendants filed a reply.Legal StandardThe purpose of a motion for summary judgment “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.) “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)“The supporting papers shall include a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts which the moving party contends are undisputed. Each of the material facts stated shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence. The failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may in the court's discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denial of the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(1); see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(c)(2) & (d).)“The opposition papers shall include a separate statement that responds to each of the material facts contended by the moving party to be undisputed, indicating if the opposing party agrees or disagrees that those facts are undisputed. The statement also shall set forth plainly and concisely any other material facts the opposing party contends are disputed. Each material fact contended by the opposing party to be disputed shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence. Failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may constitute a sufficient ground, in the court's discretion, for granting the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(3).)“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) The moving party is entitled to summary judgment if they can show that there is no triable issue of material fact or if they have a complete defense thereto. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfiend Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) In analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the Court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers, except evidence to which the Court has sustained an objection, as well as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)Discussion“The elements of a cause of action for medical malpractice are: (1) a duty to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of the profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of the duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury; and (4) resulting loss or damage.” (Chakalis v. Elevator Solutions, Inc. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1557, 1571.)“The standard of care against which the acts of a physician are to be measured is a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of experts; it presents the basic issue in a malpractice action and can only be proved by their testimony.” (Hanson v. Grode (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 601, 603.) “When a defendant moves for summary judgment and supports his motion with expert declarations that his conduct fell within the community standard of care, he is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff comes forward with conflicting expert evidence.' (Citations.)” (Munro v. Regents of University of California (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 984-985.)In the instant motion, Defendants contend that no triable issues of material fact exist. First, Defendants state that they did not breach the applicable standard of care, relying on the declaration of their expert May Nour, M.D., PH.D. (See Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“SSUMF”) Nos. 7-17.) Next, Defendants assert that they did not cause or contribute to Plaintiff’s injuries, relying on Dr. Nour, M.D., PH.D.’s declaration that to a reasonable degree of medical probability no acts or omissions by the nurses or non-physician personal caused or contributed to any of Plaintiff’s alleged injuries. (SSUMF Nos. 15, 18-20.)The Court has reviewed the evidence submitted by Defendants. Defendants have provided evidence that Plaintiff cannot satisfy her medical negligence claim’s necessary elements. (See SSUMF Nos. 7-20.) The Court finds Defendants have met their burden for summary judgment; the burden now shifts to Plaintiff.In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that although Dr. Awad is neither an employee nor an actual agent of the hospital, ostensible agency makes Defendants liable for Dr. Awad’s actions. (See Mejia v. Community Hospital of San Bernardino (2002) 99 Cal. App. 4th 1448, 1453 [the two elements required for ostensible agency are: “(1) conduct by the hospital that would cause a reasonable person to believe that the physician was an agent of the hospital, and (2) reliance on that apparent agency relationship by the plaintiff.”) Plaintiff argues that Defendants have not addressed the issue of ostensible agency in the instant motion and that it is a question of fact as to whether the physician Defendants are ostensible agents of Defendants. Next, Plaintiff submits the declaration of her own expert, Dr. Mark Lazarus, M.D., to demonstrate that Defendants were negligent and caused her injuries. (See Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“PUMF”) Nos. 21 and 22.)In reply, Defendants argue Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Dr. Award was/is an ostensible agent of Defendants. Particularly, Defendants point to transcript excerpts from the depositions of Dr. Awad and Ashraf Shakir wherein both parties testified that Dr. Awad was Plaintiff’s primary care physician and Plaintiff’s son had asked Dr. Awad as Plaintiff’s primary care physician to take over her care after her admission to Defendant St. MaryMedical Center for several days. (See Defendants’ Separate Volume of Documentary Evidence ISO Motion for Summary Judgment Exs. G (Ashraf Shakir’s Deposition Transcript) 16:22-25; J (Dr. Awad’s Deposition Transcript) 8:8-20, 21:1-16.)Relevant case law on ostensible agency provides the following: “Although the existence of an agency relationship is usually a question of fact, it ‘becomes a question of law when the facts can be viewed in only one way.’ In the physician-hospital-patient context, ostensible agency is a factual issue ‘[u]nless the evidence conclusively indicates that the patient should have known that the treating physician was not the hospital's agent, such as when the patient is treated by his or her personal physician’ or received actual notice of the absence of any agency relationship.” (Mejia, supra, 99 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1454, 1458.) Unless the patient had some reason to know of the true relationship between the hospital and the physician—i.e., because the hospital gave the patient actual notice or because the patient was treated by his or her personal physician—ostensible agency is readily inferred. (Markow v. Rosner (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1027, 1038.)Here, the central issue is whether Dr. Awad was an ostensible agent of Defendants. Indeed, Plaintiff’s medical negligence claim against Defendants relies on Dr. Awad’s actions as an agent of Defendants. (See PUMF Nos. 21 and 22.) “Although the existence of an agency relationship is usually a question of fact, it ‘becomes a question of law when the facts can be viewed in only one way.’ Here, the facts can be viewed in only one way. It is undisputed that Dr. Awad was Plaintiff’s primary care physician since 2017 and Plaintiff’s son had asked Dr. Awad as Plaintiff’s primary care physician to take over her care after her admission to Defendant St. Mary Medical Center. Hence, no ostensible agency existed between Dr. Awad and Defendants. (See Mejia v. Community Hospital of San Bernardino (2002) 99 Cal. App. 4th 1448, 1454 [“the patient is generally presumed to have looked to the hospital for care unless he or she was treated by his or her personal physician”]; see Defendants’ Separate Volume of Documentary Evidence ISO Motion for Summary Judgment Exs. G [Ashraf Shakir’s Deposition Transcript] 16:22-25; J [Dr. Awad’s Deposition Transcript] 8:8-20, 21:1-16.)Tentative RulingDefendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
