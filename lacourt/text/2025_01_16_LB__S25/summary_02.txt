The court orders the parties to meet and confer no later than February 21, 2025, and to use the recent discovery guidelines set forth in CCP Section 871.6(h). These guidelines require the defendant or manufacturer to provide specific documents and information related to the motor vehicle, including owner's manuals, warranties, brochures, and repair records. The parties are also ordered to file a joint status report identifying any remaining outstanding discovery by March 4, 2025. The court has advanced and vacated the Case Management Conference set for January 16, 2025, and continued it to February 6, 2025, in conjunction with the defendant's demurrer/motion to strike.
