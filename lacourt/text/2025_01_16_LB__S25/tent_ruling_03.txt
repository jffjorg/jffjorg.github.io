 Case Number:  24LBCV01528    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  S25 Tentative RulingThe Court is “bound to apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial,” absent prejudice to the adverse party. (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) Here, no trial date has been set yet. Given the circumstances and that no opposition has been filed, it seems unlikely that Defendants would suffer undue prejudice.Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint is GRANTED.Case Management Conference remains set for March 13, 2025
