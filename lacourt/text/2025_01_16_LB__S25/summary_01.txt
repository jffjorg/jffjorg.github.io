Summary in English text:

The Court is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants St. Mary Medical Center, Youssef Awad, M.D., Nikhil Kapoor, M.D., Christopher Hoshino, M.D., and Casey Mosard, N.P. The motion is based on the declaration of their expert, May Nour, M.D., PH.D., who asserts that the defendants did not breach the applicable standard of care and did not cause or contribute to the plaintiff's injuries. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that Dr. Awad was an ostensible agent of the defendants and that the defendants are liable for his actions. The Court finds that the evidence submitted by the defendants has met the burden for summary judgment, and the burden now shifts to the plaintiff. The Court grants the motion for summary judgment.
