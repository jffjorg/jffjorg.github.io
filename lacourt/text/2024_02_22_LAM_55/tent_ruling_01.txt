Plaintiff AHANG ZARIN filed suit against Defendants FELDMAN
BERMAN SCHWARTZ, LLP, Gary N. Schwartz, and Deborah Feldman (“Defendants”) for
alleged legal malpractice.  Defendant
FELDMAN BERMAN SCHWARTZ, LLP filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff,
alleging that, in a 2019 Retainer Agreement, Cross-Complainant agreed to
represent Plaintiff in various, specified legal matters, but she has not paid
for the legal services she received.
On 1/4/24, the Court ordered that Plaintiff’s former
counsel of record was allowed to withdraw. Former counsel filed a proof of service
on 1/8/24 showing service of the Court’s order, which listed this hearing as
the next scheduled hearing in the case, on Plaintiff. 
Defendant FELDMAN BERMAN SCHWARTZ, LLP brings a motion
to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to form interrogatories and to impose $2,160.00
in sanctions against Plaintiff. Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s responses to
Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 are evasive because Plaintiff completely failed to
respond or to provide support for her denials of the Requests for Admission
that correspond to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 (RFA Nos. 8, 9, 16-18, 22-24,
27-29, 31, 32, 35, 39, 41-52). 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section
2030.300(a), a party may file a motion to compel further responses to interrogatory
responses that are evasive, incomplete, or inadequate as to specification of
documents. Best Products, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 119 Cal. App. 4th
1181, 1190.
Generally, monetary sanctions are mandatory as to
parties losing discovery motions, unless courts find substantial justification
or other injustice. Foothill Properties v. Lyon/Copley Corona Assocs., L.P.
(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542, 1557-58. “‘[S]ubstantial justification”
has been understood to mean that a justification is clearly reasonable because
it is well-grounded in both law and fact.” Doe v. U.S. Swimming, Inc.
(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1434.  “If
the party seeking a monetary sanction meets its burden of proof, the burden
shifts to the opposing party attempting to avoid a monetary sanction to show
that it acted with ‘substantial justification.’ ”  Ibid., 200 Cal.App.4th at page 1435.
Plaintiff did not respond to Form Interrogatory 17.1 as
it pertains to the RFA that she denied, specifically RFA Nos. 8, 9, 16-18,
22-24, 27-29, 31, 32, 35, 39, 41-52. Plaintiff’s non-response clearly qualifies
as evasive and incomplete because she provided no information.  Additionally, no opposition has been filed in
order to show substantial justification in avoidance of monetary
sanctions.  Therefore, the motion is
granted.
