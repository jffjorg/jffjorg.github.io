And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by the defendant, NORTON ASSOCIATES, LLC, and granted the plaintiffs, LA DUCHESSE, LTD and STEPHANIE JARIN, 20 days to amend their complaint. The judge found that the complaint failed to plead adequately the essential elements of the causes of action, which include breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, private nuisance, violation of Penal Code 496, battery, unfair business practices, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge concluded that the complaint lacked facts to support the claims and that the exhibits did not express interference with use and enjoyment causing substantial damages. The judge also noted that the plaintiffs' claims were conclusory and did not provide ultimate facts to fairly apprise the defendant of the bases of the allegations.
