 Case Number:  23STCV18146    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Petitioner Joaquin Martinez’s Petition For
Approval Of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Minor.
 
 
Petitioner Joaquin Martinez brings a petition for
approval of a minor’s compromise as to Claimant Irina J. Martinez, age 7,
regarding a habitability complaint. The Court finds that Plaintiff provided sufficient
notice of the continuance of this hearing from 2/2/24. 
Courts considering whether to approve a minor’s compromise
determine whether petitioners, such as guardians, are acting in the best
interests of the minor. E.g., CCP §372(a)(3); Scruton v. Korean Air Lines
Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-07. “[T]he protective role the court
generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a role to assure that
whatever is done is in the minor’s best interests….  [I]ts primary concern is whether the
compromise is sufficient to provide for the minor’s injuries, care and
treatment.”  Goldberg v. Sup. Ct.
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.  Judicial
discretion in approving petitions for minors’ compromises, and ordering
distributions, and local court policies, must be applied in the best interests
of minors, in a case-by-case method, tailored to the circumstances.  Christensen v. Sup. Ct. (1987) 193
Cal.App.3d 139, 142-44.
A petition for court approval of a compromise under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court
rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. Also, courts may order that funds to be received
by a minor must be deposited in a financial institution. CRC Rule 7.953(a).
Additionally, courts may consider evidence presented
and determine reasonable amounts to be paid to attorneys representing
minors.  Curtis v. Fagan (2000) 82
Cal. App. 4th 270, 273; Padilla v. McClellan (2001) 93 Cal. App. 4th
1100, 1106.
The settlement amount in this case ($30,000) is in the
best interests of the minor. The circumstances reportedly causing injuries were
as follows: “Plaintiffs have been subjected to deplorable, despicable,
uninhabitable conditions including, but not limited to severe rodent and
cockroach infestations; lack of heating facilities; lack of functional plumbing
facilities; lack of functional kitchen; lack of functional smoke and carbon
monoxide detectors; and lack of functional windows. Plaintiffs notified
Defendants of the uninhabitable conditions and the issues were not resolved.
Plaintiffs have suffered physical, mental and emotional damages.”  (Petition, ¶ 5.) The minor received no
medical treatment and has completely recovered from injuries.  (Petition, ¶¶ 7-8.)  Given that the minor has recovered and does
not need future care related to the alleged habitability issues, the Court
concludes that the settlement for the minor in the sum of $30,000 (Petition, ¶
10), is more than sufficient to provide for the minor in these circumstances.
Furthermore, the requested attorneys’ fees in the
amount of $7,500.00 (Petition, ¶ 13; 
Attachment 13a) are reasonable and represent the typical 25 percent requested
under a contingency fee agreement for like cases involving minors’ compromises.
Finally, the Court has the discretion to order that
the balance of $22,500.00 (Petition, ¶ 15) be deposited in Chase bank in a
blocked account, as requested here.  (Id.
at Attachment, 18b (2).)  That represents
sound practice, so that a minor is required to reach the age of majority before
having access to the funds and making important financial decisions.
The Petition therefore is granted. The Court will sign
and file the form orders received with the petition.
