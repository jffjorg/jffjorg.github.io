And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant FELDMAN BERMAN SCHWARTZ, LLP's motion to compel Plaintiff AHANG ZARIN to serve further responses to form interrogatories and to impose $2,160.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's responses to Form Interrogatory 17.1 are evasive and incomplete because Plaintiff failed to respond or provide supporting evidence for denials of certain Requests for Admission. The Judge concludes that Plaintiff's non-response clearly qualifies as evasive and incomplete and that no opposition has been filed to show substantial justification in avoidance of monetary sanctions. As a result, the motion is granted, and Plaintiff is ordered to serve further responses to form interrogatories and pay $2,160.00 in sanctions to Defendant.
