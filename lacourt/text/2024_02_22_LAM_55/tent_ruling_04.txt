 Case Number:  23STCV18639    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Demurrer of Defendant to Complaint.
 
The demurrer is sustained, with 20 days’ leave to
amend.
 
BACKGROUND
In this case, LA DUCHESSE, LTD and STEPHANIE JARIN (“Plaintiffs”)
seek damages against NORTON ASSOCIATES, LLC (“Defendant”) related to alleged
substandard conditions at the commercial property Plaintiffs leased from
Defendant. The causes of action are: 1) Breach of Contract; 2) Breach of The
Covenant of Good Faith And Fair Dealing; 3) Private Nuisance; 4) Violation of Penal
Code 496; 5) Battery; 6) Unfair Business Practices; and 7) Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress.
Defendant has filed a demurrer to the Complaint.
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer.  
LEGAL STANDARD
Demurrers are to be sustained where a pleading fails
to plead adequately any essential element of the cause of action. Cantu v.
Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal. App. 4th 857, 879-80.  Generally, complaints must contain ultimate
facts.  Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550. A plaintiff is required only to “set forth in his
complaint the essential facts of his case with reasonable precision and with
particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant of the nature,
source, and extent of his cause of action.” Elder v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co.
(2012) 205 Cal. App. 4th 841, 858.
ANALYSIS
1.      First
Cause of Action for Breach of Contract
Defendant argues that the Complaint is devoid of facts
to show Defendant breached the lease documents or the alleged resulting damages
to Plaintiffs, which are required elements of a claim for breach of contract. Wall
Street Network, Ltd. v. N. Y. Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171,
1178. 
The Court concurs that the Complaint lacks facts, and does
not acquaint the Defendant of the nature, source, and extent of the cause of
action. Plaintiffs’ claim only alleges a breach “as set forth” in exhibits D,
E, and F. which are attached to the Court’s copy of the Complaint. (Compl., ¶
8.) But merely attaching exhibits and saying “breach” does not equate with
expressing Plaintiffs’ factual theories about which of the many written lease
provisions Defendant breached. Plaintiffs must state facts showing a
breach.  Levy v. State Farm Mutual
Automobile Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal. App. 4th 1, 5-6. “[A] pleader must
state with certainty the facts constituting a breach of contract.”  Melican v. Regents of Univ. of Cal.
(2007) 151 Cal. App. 4th 168, 174.  Plaintiffs
must also state facts showing Plaintiffs’ alleged resulting damages, rather
than merely alleging the breach was “the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s loss”
without explanation. (Compl., ¶ 10.) 
Thus, the demurrer is sustained as to the contract
claim.
2.      Second
Cause of Action for Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
The Court agrees with Defendants that the claim for
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is subject to
demurrer because it lacks any facts to support the conclusory allegation that Defendant’s
breaches of the covenant were “separate and distinct” from the breaches of the
lease documents. (Compl., ¶ 14.) The Complaint merely parrots the conclusory
elements of this claim without providing any facts whatsoever to fairly apprise
Defendant of the bases of the allegations. 
3.      Third
Cause of Action for Private Nuisance
According to Defendant, Plaintiffs set forth conclusory
statements and failed to allege an interference in the use and enjoyment of the
property that was substantial and unreasonable. 
The elements of the claim are:

Interference
     with plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of plaintiff’s property;
invasion
     of plaintiff's use and enjoyment involves substantial actual damage; and
interference
     is unreasonable as to the nature, duration or amount.

San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Sup.
Ct.  (1996) 13 Cal.4th 893, 938;  CC 3479; 
CACI 2021.  
Again, the Court concurs that facts are completely
missing from this claim. Plaintiffs merely regurgitate the elements of a
nuisance claim in the Complaint. While Plaintiffs’ opposition references the
pictures in Exhibits D, E, and F, pictures of alleged mold do not intelligibly
express interference with use and enjoyment causing substantial damages in an
unreasonable nature, duration or amount. 
Hence, the demurrer is sustained as to this claim.
4.     
Fourth Cause Of Action
for Violation of Penal Code 496
Defendant contends that there was no attempt to
properly allege theft, but instead Plaintiffs allege that Defendant adhered to
the parties’ lease agreement about getting rent.
The elements of the claim are:

Property was
     stolen or obtained in a manner constituting theft;
defendant
     knew the property was so stolen or obtained;  
defendant
     received or had possession of the stolen property.

Switzer v. Wood
(2013) 35 Cal. App. 5th 116, 126, 129.  See
also Siry Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal. 5th 333, 351 (“‘Penal
Code section 484, subdivision (a) describes the acts constituting theft to
include theft by false pretense, which is the consensual but fraudulent
acquisition of property from its owner…. [The defendant] was found liable for
fraud, i.e., for the fraudulent acquisition of property (money) from its
owner….’”); Bell v. Feibush (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1049  (upholding civil liability under Penal Code
Section 496).
The Court agrees that the Complaint fails to allege
Defendant’s knowing receipt of stolen property via theft or fraudulently
induced consent. Instead, the Complaint incorrectly redefines theft as
demanding rent pursuant to a lease, while not performing lease provisions. (Complaint,
¶ 23.)  Further, the exhibits do not
express that taking rent was done by trick with no intent to perform the lease,
but instead more factual context is in order. 

The Bell opinion cited by opposing counsel is
factually distinguishable, as it involved a tenant inducing leased possession
of residential property without intent to pay rent. But in this case, the
tenant accuses a lessor of fraudulently inducing rent payments. People v.
Bell (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 822, 828 (“took possession of the apartment by
false pretenses and was delinquent in rent payments….”).  Moreover, Bell addressed Penal Code
Section 487, not Section 496 that the Complaint addresses.  See ibid. at 824 (“grand theft of
personal property in violation of subdivision (a) of section 487….”).  In sum, reliance on that opinion is hardly
supportive.
Thus, the demurrer is sustained as to this claim.
 
5.     
Fifth Cause of Action for
Battery
Defendant’s argument is that battery requires an
allegation that a defendant touched or caused plaintiff to be touched, as
opposed to the allegations of mold exposure.
The elements of the claim are:

Defendant
     intentionally committed an act resulting in a harmful or offensive contact
     with the plaintiff’s body;
plaintiff
     did not consent to the contact; and
the
     contact caused injury, damage, loss or harm to plaintiff.

Brown v. Ransweiler
(2009) 171 Cal. App. 4th 516, 526; Fluharty v. Fluharty (1997) 59 Cal.
App. 4th 484, 497.
Defendant is correct that the Complaint lacks any
allegation that Defendant committed any act resulting in harmful or offensive
contact with Plaintiffs’ bodies. The Complaint instead incorrectly redefines
battery to include unwanted exposure to accidentally caused mold.  (Complaint, ¶ 28.)  The opposition cites no governing law about
unrepaired mold constituting battery. 
(Opp., pp. 6-7).  Although a
District Court ruling is cited regarding alleged battery for alleged toxic
exposures--   Barth v. Firestone Tire
and Rubber Co. (1987) 661 F.Supp. 193— that case involved product placement
in proximity of a plaintiff, and not an alleged plumbing leak causing
mold.  Moreover, that ruling does not
govern in California courts. People v. Sup. Ct. (2002) 103 Cal. App. 4th
409, 431.
6.     
Sixth Cause of Action for
Unfair Business Practices
Plaintiffs’ UCL claim alleges in conclusory fashion
that “Defendant’s actions were illegal, unfair and fraudulent.” (Compl., ¶ 32.)
 
The elements of the claim are:

A
     business practice;
that
     is unfair, unlawful or fraudulent; 
     and
authorized
     remedy.

Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200; Paulus v. Bob Lynch
Ford, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 659, 676. 
See also People ex rel. Dept. of Motor Vehicles v. Cars 4 Causes
(2006) 139 Cal. App. 4th 1006, 1016 (“An ‘unlawful’ practice requires violation of another statute, and a
business practice may be ‘unfair’ even if not otherwise proscribed by statute
as long as the practice is not expressly authorized by law.”).
To sustain a UCL cause of action based on fraudulent, deceptive
practices, representations or nondisclosures, plaintiffs must
show that members of the public and a reasonable consumer likely would be misled.  Weinstat v. Dentsply Internat., Inc.
(2010) 180 Cal.App.4th 1213, 1223 n. 8.  
The Court determines that the Complaint fails to
support the elements of a UCL claim with ultimate facts, but instead parrots
some conclusory elements of the claim, which leaves one guessing how the
exhibits support the claim as to either unfair business practices or fraud.
7.     
Seventh Cause of Action
for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
7.
The elements of a claim for intentional infliction of
emotional distress are: 

Outrageous
     conduct by defendant;
intentional
     or  reckless causing emotional
     distress;
severe
     emotional distress;  and
causation.

Huntingdon Life Sciences, Inc. v. Stop
Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005) 129 Cal. App.
4th 1228, 1259; Nally v. Grace Community Church (1988) 47 Cal.3d 278,
300.  
The Court’s reading of Plaintiffs’ claim reveals that
claim elements are set forth without ultimate facts, and leave one to merely speculate
how Plaintiffs think the exhibits would support the claim, especially as to how
Defendant caused Plaintiffs’ alleged damages.  
CONCLUSION
Courts generally allow at least one time to amend a
complaint, after sustaining a demurrer.  McDonald
v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.
App. 3d 297, 303; City of Stockton v. Sup.Ct. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 730,
747; Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶7:129.
Therefore, the demurrer is sustained, with leave to
amend.
