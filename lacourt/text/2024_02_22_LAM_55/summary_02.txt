Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The motion to dismiss the petition filed by Dr. Shirley N. Weber, in her official capacity as California Secretary of State, is denied. The petition was filed by a group of senior individuals who claim they are entitled to payment from the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund (the "Fund") after being defrauded by Senior Care Advocates (SCA). The petitioners allege that SCA charged them exorbitant fees for Long Term Care Planning Packages and advised them to misreport their assets to Medi-Cal, resulting in the loss of Medi-Cal coverage.

The respondent argues that the petitioners' fraud claims are time-barred and that the underlying default judgment does not qualify as a judgment that can be used to seek compensation from the Fund. However, the court rejects these arguments and determines that the fraud claims adjudicated by the bankruptcy court were not time-barred and that the default judgment is a qualifying judgment under the Corporations Code.

The court also concludes that the allegations regarding the Nier Action have no effect on the respondent's two arguments for why this case should be dismissed and that the fraud claims at issue in the In Re SCA default judgment were not time-barred. The respondent's arguments about the Nier Action may be asserted at the time of the hearing on the petition.
