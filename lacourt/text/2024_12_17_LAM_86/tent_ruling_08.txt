PROVISIONAL DIRECTOR
 
PLAINTIFF’S EX PARTE APPLICATION RE: (1) OSC Re:
CONTEMPTS; AND (2) TRO AND OSC Re: PRELIMINIARY INJUNCTION
 
 
Date:               12/17/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:                           Elijah Funk v. Alexander Ross et al. (24STCV30176) 
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
            
On 11/26/24, after a hearing, the Court (Hon. James C.
Chalfant) DENIED Plaintiffs’ Ex Parte Application for Temporary Restraining
Order and Order to Show Cause Why Preliminary Injunction Should Not be Issued,
filed 11/22/24 (“11/22/24 Application”). 
During that same hearing, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause re:
Appointment of Receiver or Provisional Director. Judge Chalfant ordered the
parties to meet and confer on the issue prior to filing of their cross-briefs
on the issue. (Clough Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. A at 18:26-28; 19:27-20:1.) 
 
In their cross-briefs, the parties object to appointment of
a receiver at this time. (Pl. Brief at 13:1-14:17; Def. Brief at 10:11-15.) However,
both plaintiff Elijah Funk and defendant Alexander Ross agree to the
appointment of Alexandre Zyngier as provisional director. (Clough Decl. ¶ 6; Seddigh
Decl. ¶ 24.) Nonetheless, the parties have not been able to agree on a
stipulation or proposed Order to effectuate appointment of the agreed upon
provisional director. (Clough Decl. ¶ 6; Seddigh Decl. ¶ 24.)
 
To the extent that the parties wish to insert orders beyond
the scope of the appointment of a provisional director, such as ordering an
accounting of the $500,000 that plaintiff purportedly blocked defendant from
accessing, imposition of a maximum limit for withdrawals from bank accounts, allowance
of $15,000 in monthly distributions to each party, and ratification of a
catch-up distribution (see Def. Brief at 8:23-10:5), this is beyond the
scope of appointment of a provisional director. The appointment of a provisional
director is for the purpose of overcoming the impasse resulting from an “even
number of directors who are equally divided and cannot agree as to the management”
of the business’s affairs. (Corp. Code § 308(a).)  It would appear to the Court that a
straightforward Order appointing Alexander Zyngier as a provisional director
would suffice, as his appointment would break the impasse and allow the company
to proceed with operations, including decisions regarding accounting and
distribution and use of company funds.
 
As for plaintiffs’ Ex Parte Application, filed 12/16/24, it
is DENIED in all respects.  The request
for a TRO and OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction is essentially a request for
reconsideration of the 11/22/24 Application previously denied by Judge
Chalfant.  The only new fact for
consideration by the Court is the 12/4/24 transfer of $50,000 from a Haunted
Wagon Chase Bank account, which defendant Ross claims was a “catch-up
contribution that I am owed.”  (12/16/24
Funk Decl. ¶ 46 & Ex. 31; 12/16/24 Ross Decl. ¶ 15.)  That is insufficient to warrant revisiting
Judge Chalfant’s determination that a TRO and Preliminary Injunction were not
warranted.  Indeed, it is hard to ignore
that plaintiffs previously sought, among other things, to enjoin defendant Ross
from “paying himself any distributions . . . without written prior approval
form the pertinent Board” (11/22/24 Application at 2), which Judge Chalfant declined
to do. Moreover, with the appointment of a provisional director to allow for
operating decisions to be made, the requested injunctive relief seems all the
more unwarranted. 
 
Lastly, insofar as plaintiffs wish to pursue their
contention that the 12/4/24 transfer of $50,000 should be found by this Court
to constitute contempt of the Court’s 11/26/24 Order, there appears to be no
good reason why such relief should not be obtained by way of a Noticed
Motion.  To initiate contempt proceedings
on an ex parte basis, plaintiffs must make an affirmative factual
showing of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other basis warranting a
finding of contempt on such expedited basis. 
(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)  Plaintiffs fail to do so here.
