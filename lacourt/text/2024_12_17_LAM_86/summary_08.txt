And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Elijah Funk v. Alexander Ross et al. The Court denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and order to show cause re: preliminary injunction, as well as the request for appointment of a receiver or provisional director. The parties had previously met and conferred on the issue but were unable to agree on a stipulation or proposed Order. However, they did agree to the appointment of Alexandre Zyngier as provisional director. The Court finds that a straightforward Order appointing Zyngier as provisional director would suffice, as his appointment would break the impasse and allow the company to proceed with operations.

The Court also denied the plaintiff's request for a TRO and preliminary injunction, finding that the requested relief was not warranted. The Court notes that the plaintiff previously sought to enjoin the defendant from making certain distributions without prior approval, which the Court declined to do. With the appointment of a provisional director, the requested injunctive relief seems even less necessary.

Finally, the Court denied the plaintiff's request to pursue contempt proceedings on an ex parte basis, finding that the plaintiff failed to make an affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other basis warranting a finding of contempt. The Court instead recommends that the plaintiff initiate contempt proceedings by way of a noticed motion.
