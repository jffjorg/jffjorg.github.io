[1]           Petitioner testified during the
hearing that he only spoke with Barnett over the phone and did not submit to an
interview in Barnett’s office. (AR 329 [HT 133:3-10].) However, this is
contradicted by Barnett’s notes of the interview. (AR 74-75.)


[2]           The transcript of the hearing
indicates that the second part of the hearing took place on July 30, 2021 (AR
306), but the recommended decision of the Hearing Officer stated that the
second part of the hearing was on June 30, 2021 (AR 183). Regardless of the
date of the second part of the hearing, the Hearing Officer did not issue a
written recommended decision within 30 calendar days of completion.
