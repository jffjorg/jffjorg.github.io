REQUEST FOR FEES

Case:                           Sound Equity High Income Debt
Fund, LLC v. Top Flight Investments LLC et al. (21STCV13141)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:      
 
Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC’s UNOPPOSED
Motion for Approval of Receiver’s Twelfth Interim Request for Fees is GRANTED. 
 
Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC moves for
approval of its interim fees incurred in the performance of its duties.
Pursuant to the Order Appointing Equity Receiver and Preliminary Injunction
entered on 3/17/22, Receiver is authorized to prepare “periodic interim
statements reflecting the Receiver’s fees and administration of the
Receivership Estate.” (3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 11.) Receiver is obligated to
submit its fees and expenses to the Court for approval and confirmation by way
of a noticed interim request for fees, a stipulation among the parties, or the
Receiver’s final account and report. (Ibid.) 
 
Receiver seeks approval of $13,546.00 incurred in July 2024.
“Interim fees are subject to final review and approval by the court. The court
retains jurisdiction to award a greater or lesser amount as the full, fair, and
final value of the services rendered.” (Cal. Rule of Court 3.1183(a).) “Unless
good cause is shown, objections to a receiver’s interim report and accounting
must be made within 10 days of notice of the report and accounting, must be
specific, and must be delivered to the receiver and all parties entitled to
service of the interim report and accounting.” (Id. Rule 3.1183(b).) No
objections were received. 
 
A review of the invoice received in support of the motion
reveals that Receiver paid vendor invoices; tended to security cameras; prepared
monthly financial statements and accounting; handled lien disputes; worked with
counsel with respect to litigation related to the property located at 3500 W
Manchester Blvd #421; and tended to motion to terminate lease and related
eviction process for property located at 816-818 North Mansfield, as well as tended
to rehabilitation of Mansfield property for sale. (Constantinescu Decl. Ex. C;
3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 3(b) [“The Receiver is granted the following powers
and duties…[t]o operate, manage, maintain, preserve, market, and sell the
Property….”].) Receiver billed $295 per hour for Sidney Constantinescu, $160
per hour for accounting tasks, and $50 per hour for administrative tasks—rates which
are permitted in the March 17, 2022 order appointing Receiver. (3/17/22
Receiver Order ¶ 2(d).) Having reviewed the supporting declaration and invoice,
the Court finds that the fees claimed by Receiver are reasonably related to the
administration of the Receivership Estate. 
 
The motion is GRANTED. The Court signs the proposed order
lodged on 10/24/24.
