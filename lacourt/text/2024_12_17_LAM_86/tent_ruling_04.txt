 Case Number:  23STCP00264    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  86 ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE: WHY THE COURT SHOULD NOT ISSUE
ORDERS AS TO RESPONDENTS CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND LOS ANGELES WORLD AIRPORTS
 
Date:               12/17/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:                           Tiffany Abraham v. City of Los Angeles et al.
(23STCP00264) 
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner Tiffany Abraham’s evidentiary objections to the
declaration of Tiffany B. Hunter are OVERRULED. As respondents’ attorney, Hunter
is authorized to declare whether production in compliance with the
Amended Ruling on Petition for Writ of Mandate, Judgment, Writ of Mandate,
and order enforcing the writ has occurred.  
 
On
12/19/23, the Court issued its Amended Ruling on Petition for Writ of Mandate,
which GRANTED IN PART petitioner’s requests that respondents City of Los
Angeles (“COLA”) and
Los
Angeles World Airports (“LAWA”) produce certain documents pursuant to
petitioner’s 11/14/22 request under the California Public Records Act (“CPRA”).
The Court ordered with respect to the COLA and LAWA: “Respondent shall produce
the 1,000 to 1,900 emails it is withholding. In addition, within 30 days
hereof, respondent must use the search terms provided by petitioner in her
March 31, 2023 letter and produce the documents found pursuant to such search
terms.” (12/19/23 Amended Ruling at 11; see also 12/19/23 Minute Order.)
 
On 5/23/24, the Court entered Judgment, which, among other
things, adjudged and decreed as follows: “Respondent COLA and LAWA shall
produce the 1,000 to 1,900 emails it is withholding. In addition, within 30
days hereof, respondent must use the search terms provided by petitioner in her
March 31, 2023 letter and produce the documents found pursuant to such
search terms.”
 
On 6/24/24, the Clerk of the Court issued the Writ of
Mandate, which, among other things “COMMANDED” the following: “Respondent COLA
and LAWA shall produce the 1,000 to 1,900 emails it is withholding. In
addition, within 30 days hereof, respondent must use the search terms provided
by petitioner in her March 31, 2023 letter and produce the documents found pursuant
to such search terms.” Further, the Writ “COMMANDED” COLA and LAWA to comply by
7/25/24.
 
On 10/10/24, during the hearing on petitioner’s Motion to
Enforce Writ of Mandate Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure § 1097, the Court ordered as
follows: “By no later than 10/24/24, respondents City of Los Angeles and Los
Angeles World Airports shall make and file a return of the writ of mandate,
produce a list detailing the number of documents and emails located using the
search terms provided by petitioner in her March 31, 2023 letter, and state the
basis upon which respondents are withholding any documents.” (10/10/24 Minute
Order at 4.) The Court also ordered respondents to produce a privilege log listing
any documents withheld based on privilege at the same time a return was filed.
(10/10/24 Minute Order at 4.) Respondents were present at the hearing and
waived notice of the ruling. (10/10/24 Minute Order at 4.)
 
Respondents did not file any return on 10/24/24 indicating
that petitioner was provided with any documents or emails. 
 
On 11/5/24, petitioner filed an Ex Parte Application for
“Orders to Enforce this Court’s Order of October 10, 2024 and the Writ of
Mandate Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1097.”  In response, on 11/7/24, this Court issued an
Order to Show Cause as to Why the Court Should Not Issue the Following Orders
as to Respondents City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles World Airports:
 

Impose a fine of $1,000 as
     to both respondents

 

Find waiver of any
     objection, exemption, or privilege with respect to petitioner’s 11/14/22
     CPRA request, in light of respondents’ failure to assert any objections,
     exemptions, or privilege by 10/24/24, per the Court’s 10/10/24 Order

 

Produce within seven (7)
     calendar days every document and email identified using the search terms
     provided by petitioner in her March 31, 2023, letter, and provide a sworn
     declaration by a qualified witness detailing the process used to search,
     identify, and produce such documents and emails

 

Find that respondents have
     been persistent in their refusal to obey the writ and impose a $1,000 fine
     as to each respondent for each day of non-compliance after the seven (7)
     calendar days within which to produce every document and email identified
     using the search terms provided by petitioner in her March 31, 2023

 

Order respondents to pay
     petitioner’s reasonable costs and fees incurred to compel compliance with
     and to enforce the writ of mandate, including the Motion to Enforce Writ
     of Mandate, the instant ex parte application, responses to the Order to
     Show Cause, and all related work.

 
(11/7/24 Minute Order at 3.) The Court ordered responses to
the Order to Show Cause to be filed and served by no later than 11/27/24. The
Court ordered replies to the responses to be filed and served by no later than
12/9/24. 
 
Petitioner Tiffany Abraham and respondent City of Los
Angeles, through its division Los Angeles World Airports (collectively
“respondents”), filed and served responses on 11/27/24. On 12/9/24, petitioner
filed a reply to respondents’ response. 
 
Respondents’ counsel declares that a return was filed on
11/27/24 indicating all production that has been made pursuant to petitioner’s
CPRA request and search terms provided by petitioner in her 3/31/23 letter.
(Hunter Decl. ¶ 3.)  The Hunter
Declaration is inaccurate.  The court
file reflects that no return has been filed. Nevertheless, respondents maintain
that they “performed a search for responsive documents using the search terms provided
by petitioner in the March 31, 2023 letter” and that they have “produced all
responsive documents obtained through the search of the required search terms
as identified below and is not withholding documents on the basis of
privilege.” (Hunter Decl. ¶ 4; see also Hunter Decl. ¶ 10 [“All responsive
documents and emails have been produced”].) Below the averment was a table
identifying the responsive documents by date of production, Bates numbers, and whether
respondent City of Los Angeles or its counsel produced the documents. (Hunter
Decl. ¶ 4.) Respondents’ counsel also declared that no documents were withheld
based on privilege. (Hunter Decl. ¶¶ 4, 10.) In reply, petitioner provided an
email dated 11/27/24 indicating that she was received by email a link and
password for a folder containing documents. (Gutierrez Reply Decl. ¶ 2 &
Ex. 1.) 
 
The declarations in connection with the instant Order to
Show Cause indicate that petitioner was served with the documents and emails as
ordered by the Amended Ruling on Petition for Writ of
Mandate, Judgment, Writ of Mandate, or order enforcing the writ. 
 
Petitioner contends that respondents did not provide a list
detailing the number of documents and emails located using the search terms
provided in the 3/31/23 letter. However, the table provided by counsel
suffices. (See Hunter Decl. ¶ 4.) The Court notes that it is unclear why
respondents listed the Bates stamps for production occurring on 9/11/23, 1/5/24,
1/26/24, and 2/9/24 as “None.” Nevertheless, the table also lists production as
having occurred on 12/19/22, 1/5/23, 1/17/23, 2/8/23, 2/15/23, 7/10/23, 1/18/24,
2/21/24, 4/24/24, and 11/27/24. From the range of the Bates stamps, one can
determine how many pages were in the production. For the 11/27/24 production, the
Bates stamp range of CityofLA_0004998-9541 indicates that production consisted
of 4,544 pages (9541 – 4998 + 1 = 4,544.) Indeed, petitioner declares that the
11/27/24 production consisted of 4,543 pages. (Gutierrez Reply Decl. ¶ 4.) Considering
counsel for respondents averred that respondents “produced all responsive
documents obtained through the search of the required search terms as
identified below,” and below the averment was the table described above, the
Court finds the table is sufficient to list the production which corresponded
to documents retrieved using the search terms from the 3/31/23 letter. 
 
Citing the 11/7/24 Order to Show Cause, petitioner argues
that respondents did not provide a declaration from a qualified witness
detailing the process used to search, identify and produce the documents and
emails. The Order to Show Cause never contained such an order. Rather, it
ordered respondents to show cause why the Court should not issue an order
requiring respondents to “provide a sworn declaration by a qualified witness
detailing the process used to search, identify, and produce such documents and
emails.” (11/7/24 Minute Order at 3.) As counsel for respondents’ declaration
sufficiently demonstrates that all documents obtained using the search terms
contained in petitioner’s 3/31/23 letter have been produced, the Court will not
order any further declaration to be filed. 
 
The declaration in support of petitioner’s reply contains
other averments pointing out purported defects in production. Counsel argues
that “almost all, if not all” of the documents in the 11/27/24 production have
been previously produced before. (Gutierrez Reply Decl. ¶ 4.) Even if the
documents have been produced before, this does not necessarily preclude the
same documents from having been retrieved pursuant to the search terms in the
3/31/23 letter. 
 
Counsel also argues that the 11/27/24 production contains
documents that are unlikely to have been located using the search terms
contained in the 3/31/23 letter. (Gutierrez Reply Decl. ¶ 5.) Even if true,
this does not mean that all the documents produced on 11/27/24 were located without
using the search terms contained in the 3/31/23 letter. Put another way,
counsel for respondents’ averment that all documents obtained using the search
terms contained in petitioner’s 3/31/23 order have been produced (Hunter Decl.
¶¶ 4, 10)—the critical question as to whether the Court should issue further
orders concerning production—can still be true. 
 
Counsel also asserts that respondents’ production prior to
11/27/24 used Bates stamps with a prefix of “LAWA,” whereas the Bates stamp
prefix for the 11/27/24 production was “CityofLA.” (Gutierrez Reply Decl. ¶ 6.)
The Bates stamp prefix is not probative of whether all documents retrieved
using the search terms in the 3/31/23 letter have been produced. 
 
Counsel also avers that some of the documents in the
11/27/24 production state that documents have been produced in “native” format,
but no documents were produced in native format. (Gutierrez Reply Decl. ¶ 7.) Counsel
does not state what “native format” means. In any event, even if native format
documents were not produced, it is possible that the search terms in the
3/31/23 letter did not yield native format documents as results. Petitioner
fails to explain why native format documents that were not produced would have
necessarily been retrieved using petitioner’s search terms. Under the Amended
Ruling on Petition for Writ of Mandate, Judgment, Writ of Mandate, and
order enforcing the writ, respondents were under no obligation to produce
documents other than those obtained using the search terms set forth in the
3/31/23 letter. 
 
Counsel also contains that the 1/5/23 production never
occurred, that the Bates stamp number set forth for 1/5/23 corresponds to a
California Public Records Act (“CPRA”) request different from the one at issue
in this proceeding, and that the 9/11/23, 1/5/24, 1/26/24, and 2/9/24
productions all correspond to a different CPRA request. (Gutierrez Reply Decl.
¶¶ 8, 9.) With respect to 9/11/23, 1/5/24, 1/26/24, and 2/9/24, as noted above,
the Bates stamps listed for these dates was “None.” (Hunter Decl. ¶ 4.) With
respect to 1/5/23, even if the listed Bates stamp number corresponds to a
different request, this would not necessarily mean that respondents did not
produce all documents obtained using the search terms contained in petitioner’s
3/31/23 letter. 
 
Because respondents sufficiently demonstrate that they
served petitioner with documents and emails identified using the search terms
provided by petitioner in her 3/31/23 letter and are not withholding any
documents based on privilege, the Court will not issue the following
orders:
 

Find waiver of any
     objection, exemption, or privilege with respect to petitioner’s 11/14/22
     CPRA request, in light of respondents’ failure to assert any objections,
     exemptions, or privilege by 10/24/24, per the Court’s 10/10/24 Order

 

Produce within seven (7)
     calendar days every document and email identified using the search terms
     provided by petitioner in her March 31, 2023, letter, and provide a sworn
     declaration by a qualified witness detailing the process used to search,
     identify, and produce such documents and emails

 

Find that respondents have
     been persistent in their refusal to obey the writ and impose a $1,000 fine
     as to each respondent for each day of non-compliance after the seven (7)
     calendar days within which to produce every document and email identified
     using the search terms provided by petitioner in her March 31, 2023

 
The Court is now left to decide whether to issue the
following orders: 
 

Impose a fine of $1,000 as
     to both respondents

 

Order respondents to pay
     petitioner’s reasonable costs and fees incurred to compel compliance with
     and to enforce the writ of mandate, including the Motion to Enforce Writ
     of Mandate, the instant ex parte application, responses to the Order to
     Show Cause, and all related work.

 
Respondents contend that they did not file the return to the
Writ of Mandate earlier because they believed that they “had thirty days to do
so and had calendared the response deadline as November 8, 2024.” (Hunter Decl.
¶ 4.) As stated above, no return has been filed. Even if the return had been filed
on 11/27/24 as falsely stated by respondents’ counsel (Hunter Decl. ¶ 4), respondents
were ordered on 10/10/24 to “make and file a return of the writ of mandate”
“[b]y no later than 10/24/24.” (10/10/24 Minute Order at 4.) Respondents’
counsel was present at the 10/10/24 hearing when the order was made and waived
notice. (10/10/24 Minute Order at 4.) Accordingly, respondents’ counsel
presents no good reason to have delayed in filing a return. 
 
Respondents do not present any other reason why a $1,000 fine
should not be imposed as to both of them or why petitioner should not recover reasonable
costs and fees incurred to compel compliance with and to enforce the writ of
mandate, including the Motion to Enforce Writ of Mandate, the instant ex parte
application, responses to the Order to Show Cause, and all related work. As
recounted in the ruling on the 11/7/24 hearing on petitioner’s ex parte
application for an order to enforce writ of mandate or order shortening time, on
6/24/24, the Court issued a Writ of Mandate directing respondents to comply
with the writ by 7/25/24. (11/7/24 Minute Order at 2.) Petitioner served the
writ of mandate on 8/14/24. (10/10/24 Minute Order at 3.) Despite having been
on notice since 8/14/24 about the writ of mandate, respondents had not complied
by the time the Court issued its order enforcing the writ on 10/10/24. Respondents
do not explain why they failed to file a return in a timely manner after having
received notice of the writ. Thus, petitioner was entitled to file a motion to
enforce the writ. 
 
Further, on 10/10/24, in connection with petitioner’s motion
to enforce the writ, the Court ordered respondents to “make and file a return
of the writ of mandate” and “produce a list detailing the number of documents
and emails located using the search terms provided by petitioner in her March
31, 2023 letter” “[b]y no later than 10/24/24.” (10/10/24 Minute Order at 4.) Respondents
did not comply with the Court’s orders by the stated deadline. (11/7/24 Minute
Order at 2.) Thus, petitioner was entitled to file an ex parte application to
enforce the writ on 11/5/24, which led to the instant Order to Show Cause.  
 
Petitioner claims a total of $22,242 in fees and costs in
connection with enforcement of the writ. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 3.)
Having reviewed counsel for petitioner’s invoices, the Court reduces this
amount by $4,620, the total fees incurred from 3/20/24 to 6/17/24, because
these fees were incurred in connection with preparation of the writ, not
enforcement of the writ. Otherwise, respondents did not object to the amount of
fees and costs claimed by petitioner. The Court finds $17,622 ($22,242 -
$4,620) to be a reasonable amount of fees and costs incurred to enforce the
writ. 
 
By no later than 12/31/24, the Court orders respondents City
of Los Angeles and Los Angeles World Airports each to pay $1,000 to petitioner
Tiffany Abraham as a fine for not having timely complied with the Writ of
Mandate, thereby forcing petitioner twice to seek to enforce the writ. The
Court notes that, although respondents contend that LAWA is a division of City
of Los Angeles, LAWA separately responded to petitioner’s Petition for Writ of
Mandate and did not otherwise object to its inclusion to this case as a
separately named respondent. (See 5/31/23 Response to Petition.)
Accordingly, a fine as to LAWA is appropriate. 

 
The Court also orders respondents City of Los Angeles and
Los Angeles World Airports to pay petitioner, by no later 12/31/24, $17,622 in reasonable
fees and costs incurred in connection with enforcement of the writ. Both respondents
are jointly and severally liable for these fees and costs.
 
By no later than 12/20/24, respondents shall file the return
to the Writ of Mandate their counsel incorrectly represented was filed on 11/27/24.  Lastly, counsel Tiffany Hunter is cautioned to
verify the accuracy of statements she makes under penalty of perjury to the
Court.  (Compare also 11/27/24
Hunter Decl. ¶ 6 [“[P]etitioner failed to provide my office with proper notice
of the Ex Parte Application”] with 12/9/24 Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 10 &
Ex. 3 [11/5/24 email from Hunter acknowledging notice of ex parte application
was “Received”]; see also 11/27/24 Hunter Decl. ¶ 7 [claim that
Hunter appeared on November 7, 2024 in “Department 82,” despite notice that ex
parte would be heard in Department 86] .)
