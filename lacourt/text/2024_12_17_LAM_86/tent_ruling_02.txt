  (CCP § 1085)
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Mallcollms Ramirez petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent County
of Los Angeles to either (1) change its finding of “substantiated” child abuse
to “inconclusive” or “unfounded” or (2) contact the California Department of
Justice and have petitioner’s name removed from the Child Abuse Central Index. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Statutory
and Regulatory Framework
 
Under
the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (“CANRA”), codified in Penal Code §§
11165-11174.3, agencies designed as mandated reporters under Penal Code §
11165.9 “shall forward to the Department of Justice a report in writing of
every case it investigates of known or suspected child abuse or severe neglect
that is determined to be substantiated….” (Pen. Code § 11169(a).) Only
substantiated reports shall be forwarded to the Department of Justice. (Pen.
Code § 11169(a).) “Substantiated report” is defined “as a report that is
determined by the investigator who conducted the investigation to constitute child
abuse or neglect, as defined in Section 11165.6, based upon evidence that makes
it more likely than not that child abuse or neglect, as defined, occurred.”
(Pen. Code § 11165.12(b).) 
 
            The Department of Justice is
required to maintain an index, the Child Abuse Central Index (“CACI”), of all
substantiated reports of child abuse and severe neglect submitted pursuant to
Penal Code § 11169. (Pen. Code § 11170(a)(1-3).) Responsibility for the
accuracy, completeness, and retention of the reports lies with the submitting
agencies. (Pen. Code § 11170(a)(2).) Submitting agencies shall, at the same
time of forwarding to the Department of Justice, send written notice to known
or suspected child abusers that they have been reported to the CACI. (Pen. Code
§ 11169(c).)
 
As
pertinent to this case, “child abuse or neglect” includes “sexual abuse” as
defined in Penal Code § 11165.1. Section 11165.1 defines “sexual abuse” to mean
sexual assault, which includes the “intentional touching of the genitals or
intimate parts, including the breasts, genital area, groin, inner thighs, and
buttocks, or the clothing covering them, of a child…for purposes of sexual
arousal or gratification, except that it does not include acts which may
reasonably be construed to be normal caretaker responsibilities; interactions
with, or demonstrations of affection for, the child; or acts performed for a
valid medical purpose.” (Pen. Code § 11165.1(b)(4).) 
 
            Persons listed in CACI may challenge
their listing and have the right to a hearing before the agency that requested
their inclusion in the index. (Pen. Code § 11169(d).) The hearing must
comport with due process. (Pen. Code § 11169(d).) The procedures for the
hearing are set forth in the Manual of Policies and Procedures issued by the
California Department of Social Services (“MPP”). (MPP § 31-021 [CACI Grievance
Procedures].) The county employee who conducted the investigation leading to
the CACI listing must be present at the hearing. (MPP § 31-021.67.) Parties may
call witnesses and question witnesses called by the other party. (MPP § 31-021.66.)
However, the grievance review officer does not have subpoena power. (MPP §
31-021.66.)
 
After
the hearing, the grievance review officer shall issue a written recommended
decision concerning whether the allegation of child abuse or severe neglect is
substantiated within 30 days of the completion of the hearing. (MPP §§ 31-021.81-31-021.82.)
Within 10 days of issuance of the recommended decision, the county director
shall issue a final written decision adopting, rejecting, or modifying the
recommended decision. (MPP § 31-021.83.) If the listing is determined to be
based on a report that was not substantiated, the agency shall notify the
Department of Justice of the determination, after which the department shall
remove the listing from CACI. (Pen. Code § 11169(h).)  
 
B.          
Factual
Background
 
In
2008, after petitioner and Christine Wong had dated for six months, Wong moved
into petitioner’s home with her twin daughters, minors SW and LW. (AR 316 [HT
120:2-11], 317 [HT 121:1-9], 333 [HT 137:9-10].) The girls would live with their
mother and petitioner on weekdays and with their father, Peter Wong, on
weekends. (AR 58, 316-17 [HT 120:25-121:2].) 
 
When
the mother and her twins lived with petitioner, petitioner worked outside the
home as a retail store manager, anywhere from 50 to 54 hours per week. (AR 322-23
[HT 126:27-127:7, 127:24-25].) He worked six days a week, with Sundays off. (AR
324 [HT 128:1-4].) He arrived home from work between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. every
workday. (AR 323 [HT 127:19-23].) The mother worked Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday nights as a nurse. (AR 323 [HT 127:8-14].) The girls stayed with their
father essentially every weekend, until October 2009. (AR 218 [HT 22:15-16],
323 [HT 127:13-15], 327 [HT 131:1-11].)
 
The
father would get the assistance of his brother’s significant other, Cindy Liang,
to babysit the girls when they were at his home. (AR 21, 58, 97, 219 [HT 23:1-9].)
Near the end of 2009, the mother accused Liang of abusing LW after LW was
burned by a cigarette. (AR 21 [Decl. 4:7-11], 323 [HT 127:15-18].) The girls
were removed from the father’s care for three months. (AR 21 [Decl. 4:10-11].)
They recommenced their normal weekend visits with him in January 2010. (AR 326
[HT 130:9-10].)
 
During
those three months when the twins stayed at petitioner’s house on weekends, if
the mother was working, then the mother’s mother, petitioner’s sister, or petitioner’s
mother would stay at the house to take care of the twins. (AR 324 [HT 128:6-13],
327 [HT 131:1-6].) Due to the father having been extremely aggressive towards the
mother in October 2009 and his fear of being in the same position, petitioner
did not want to care for the girls in his home unless their mother was there. (AR
338-39. [HT 142:8-15, 142:23-143:4].) During the entire time that the twins
lived with petitioner, which was approximately three years, petitioner maintains
that he was not left alone with the girls, except maybe a few times. (AR 217
[HT 21:5-18], 324 [HT 128:19-28].)
 
C.          
Referral
to Department of Children and Family Services and Investigation
 
On
June 27, 2010, the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family
Services (“DCFS”) received a call through its Child Protection Hotline
reporting acts of sexual abuse by petitioner against minors SW and LW when they
were five years old. (AR 183.) SW allegedly told her babysitter, Cindy Liang,
that petitioner kissed her on the lips, butt, and private area under her
clothing in the bathroom at her mother’s home, and that he also touched SW’s
private area with his thumb but did not penetrate. (AR 58.)
 
On
June 28, 2010, Children’s Social Worker Maya Barnett (“CSW Barnett”)
interviewed the mother. (AR 70.) The mother appeared calm, looked with a blank
stare and a flat affect when informed of the allegations. (AR 70-71.) When
she was asked if she had anything to say about the allegations, the mother
stated that petitioner “stopped bathing the girls a couple of months ago”
because they were growing, and he could not bathe them anymore.” (AR 71.) When
asked whether she left the children alone with the petitioner, the mother
stated, “No….not really,” then “No.” (AR 71.)
 
CSW
Barnett asked the mother approximately five times if she believed her children
were lying. (AR 71.) The mother had no response the first four times. On the
fifth time, the mother stated, “They lie sometimes.” The mother then said, that
at times LW lies but SW does not. (AR 71.) 
CSW Barnett observed that the mother did not appear to be surprised or
alarmed that her children stated her live-in boyfriend, i.e., petitioner,
sexually abused her children. (AR 71.) When CSW Barnett asked whether
the children told her about the sexual abuse, the mother stated that the
children would not tell her but would tell someone else. (AR 71.)
 
On
June 28, 2020, CSW Barnett interviewed SW and LW individually in the home of the
father. While alone with SW in the living room, Barnett asked SW what she had told
Cindy Liang on Saturday. While pointing at her vagina, SW stated that, while in
the bathroom and not during bathtime, petitioner touched her private area. (AR
72, 243-44 [HT 47:20-48:4].) SW indicated that she was touched “more than one
time.” (AR 72-73.) Barnett asked SW if she was taking a bath and she said “no”
and that they were just in the bathroom and that he touched her in her private
area with her clothes on. (AR 72, 243-44 [HT 48:15-21].) SW demonstrated
how petitioner touched her by touching and squeezing CSW Barnett’s upper arm. (AR
72.) CSW Barnett asked SW whether it hurt when petitioner squeezed her
in her private part. SW said “yes” and that she started to cry. (AR 72.) Petitioner
then told her to go to her room and be quiet. When asked whether petitioner put
his finger inside of her private area, SW said “no.” (AR 72.) SW told
Barnett that no one else touched her in her private area the way petitioner
did. (AR 73.)
 
SW
also told Barnett that her father, mother, and petitioner all use a hammer to
hit her on the hand when physically disciplining her. (AR 73, 255.) When Barnett
repeated “hammer,” SW responded that maybe she was just hit on the hand by her
parents’ hand. (AR 73.) SW’s comments to Barnett and law enforcement about the
use of a hammer did not cause any concern for Barnett; she believed SW’s
statements. (AR 255-56 [HT 59:4-60:6].)
 
CSW
Barnett interviewed LW, while alone in the living room. (AR 73.) LW stated that
petitioner “touched [her] private and [SW’s] too.” (AR 73.) When asked
to demonstrate what petitioner did to her, LW placed her hand on CSW Barnett’s
arm, squeezed, released, and then squeezed again. (AR 74.) When asked if
petitioner put any of his fingers inside LW’s private area, LW said “no.” (AR
74.) When asked if it hurt when petitioner squeezed her private area, LW said
“yes.” LW also stated that no one else touched her in the way petitioner had
touched her. (AR 74.)
 
CSW
Barnett did not ask the girls if the alleged incidents happened while they were
using the toilet. (AR 264 [HT 68:24-27].) Barnett did not test the ability of
either of the girls to discern the difference between a truth and a lie. (AR 241-42
[HT 45:25-46:8].) 
 
On
June 28, 2010, at 4:30 pm, petitioner arrived at Barnett’s office for an
interview. (AR 74.) CSW Barnett asked whether the mother explained the
situation. Petitioner started off by saying, “I stopped bathing the girls 6
months ago.” (AR 74.) CSW Barnett thought the response was strange because they
had not discussed anything about the bathroom incident. (AR 75, 223 [HT 27:1-27].)
CSW Barnett documented that, during the interview, as she started asking more
detailed questions about his relationship with the girls, petitioner started to
cry and asked, “Am I going to jail for something?” (AR 75, 224 [HT 28:1-11].)
Barnett does not recall petitioner denying that he touched the girls. (AR
224 [HT 28:19-23].) Petitioner stated that, in the past, he gave the girls”
time outs” and had yelled and screamed at the children to the point where they were
afraid of him. (AR 75, 225 [HT 29:18-24].) Petitioner told CSW Barnett
that he took on the role of primary caregiver for the girls when their mother
was at work. (AR 75, 224 [HT 28:12-16].) 
 
On
June 28, 2010, CSW Barnett contacted informant Cindy Liang, who stated that,
while babysitting the children, her sister Kathy went to kiss SW. (AR 76.) SW
told Kathy, “Don’t kiss me on my lips.” (AR 76.) When asked who kisses her on
the lips, SW referred to petitioner. (AR 76.) SW stated that petitioner kisses
her on the lips and touched her private area and her butt under her clothes
while they were in the bathroom, but not at bathtime. (AR 76.) SW told Liang
that this happened when her mother was not at home and that her mother
sometimes leaves them with petitioner. (AR 76.) Liang stated that SW’s sister,
LW, verified the incident. (AR 76.) Liang did not state how many times
petitioner touched SW. (AR 240 [HT 44:21-23].)
 
CSW
Barnett also reviewed a Baldwin Park police report, dated June 26, 2010. (AR
225 [HT 29:28].) On that date, Officer Serrano spoke with the children’s
father, who reported that, on June 26, 2010, he went to pick up his children—identified
as “Doe #1” and “Doe #2”—from Cindy Liang. Liang recounted to the father Doe
#1’s (presumed to be minor SW) statements that petitioner had kissed her on the
mouth and touched her “down there” with his thumb. (AR 97.)
 
Officer
Serrano spoke to Liang, who recounted Doe #1’s statement that petitioner kisses
her on the mouth and touched her private part, while pointing to her vagina. (AR
97.) Doe #1 told Liang that she did not like it when petitioner touched her,
and she was crying. (AR 97.) Liang asked Doe #2 if she saw what had
occurred. Doe #2 told Liang that petitioner was touching Doe #1 in her private
part. Doe #2 told Liang that she put petitioner on “time-out” because he was
being a bad boy. (AR 97.) 
 
Officer
Serrano spoke to “Doe #1,” who confirmed that she knew the difference between
the telling a lie and the truth. (AR 98.) Officer Serrano asked Doe #1
questions from the Gladys R. questionnaire but did not believe that she
understood the questions that were being asked. (AR 98.) When asked to show
where her private part was, Doe #1 pointed to her vagina. (AR 98.) When
asked what she calls her private part, Doe #1 stated, “I don’t know the word, I
just call it private part.” (AR 98.) Doe #1 said that petitioner touched
her private parts “two times” and that petitioner touched her underneath her
clothes. (AR 98.)
 
Doe
#1 indicated that petitioner touched her using a hammer. (AR 98.) Doe #1 said petitioner “has fun
everyday with [her]” “[be][c]ause he keeps hurting [her] head.” (AR 98.)
Serrano asked what petitioner tells her when he touches her and she replied,
“Like letters.” (AR 98.) Doe #1 said petitioner also touches her sister, Doe #2.
(AR 98.)
 
Officer
Serrano also spoke with “Doe #2,” who also stated that she knew the difference
between telling a lie and telling the truth. (AR 98.) Officer Serrano asked Doe
#2 questions from the Gladys R. questionnaire but did not believe that she
understood some of the questions that were being asked. (AR 98.) Doe #2 denied
that petitioner touched her. (AR 98.) Doe #2 said petitioner touches Doe #1 “[i]n
the head, in the butt, in the legs, in the lips” and under her clothes. (AR
98.) Doe #2 confirmed that petitioner touched Doe #1 in the bathroom and that
Doe #1 was crying and telling him, “Don’t touch me.” (AR 98.) Doe #2 stated
that she put petitioner on a “time out” “[b]ecause he was trying to be bad.” (AR
98.) Doe #2 said the last time petitioner touched Doe #1 was “last week.” (AR 98.)
 
Officer
Serrano noted both girls were physically examined by a registered nurse, who
saw no lacerations, redness, or abrasions caused by penetration. (AR 99.)
The nurse also spoke with the girls and neither girl disclosed abuse to her. (AR 64, 99.)
However, the nurse noted that SW said that petitioner “hurt my leg with a
hammer and he scratched my face.” (AR 89.)
 
            On July 13, 2010, CSW Barnett spoke
with LAPD Detective Larriva, who stated that each of the girls had a forensic
interview, but that they did not interview well because they did not answer
many questions. (AR 79.) Detective Larriva stated that she believed something
happened with the girls and the mother’s boyfriend. (AR 79.) When the
girls were asked about petitioner, they would look straight down and did not
want to speak anymore. (AR 79.)
 
The
Baldwin Park police report, dated July 20, 2010, also indicated that Detective
Larriva spoke with the mother. (AR 103.) The mother said that both girls lie
sometimes and that she does not believe that petitioner sexually abused her
daughters because she has never seen him “do anything to harm” either of them. (AR 103.)
Detective Larriva also spoke with petitioner, who denied the allegations and
indicated that he did not know why they would accuse him of touching them in an
inappropriate manner. (AR 103.)
 
On
July 22, 2010, the referral of petitioner to DCFS was closed. (AR 7.) The
allegations as to SW were deemed substantiated but not the allegations as to
LW. (AR 117, 264 [HT 68:7-12], 268 [HT 72:21-28]). Petitioner’s name was listed
in the CACI. (AR 117.)
 
D.          
Notification
of Listing on CACI 
 
After
the mother and the girls moved out of petitioner’s home, petitioner’s parents,
brother, sister, brother-in-law, and nephew moved in, and none of them ever saw
any notice from DCFS informing petitioner that his name had been placed in the
CACI. (AR 20 [Decl. at 3:10-21]; see also AR 25, 29, 34, 37, 40.)
 
In
March 2019, petitioner received a letter from the California Department of
Justice informing him that his name came up due to an issue from 2010. (AR 42.)
Prior to that, he was not aware of the CACI listing. (AR 42.) He made several
inquiries to find out what actions he could take to resolve the issue. (AR 43.)
On March 29, 2019, respondent issued a Notice of Child Abuse Central Index
Listing to petitioner. (AR 117.) 
 
On
April 12, 2019, petitioner requested a CACI grievance hearing to dispute his
listing in the CACI. (AR 8.) On April 17, 2019, DCFS denied petitioner’s
request for a CACI grievance hearing on the ground that the request was
untimely. (AR 10.) On December 16, 2019, petitioner renewed his request for a
grievance hearing and explained that he never received any prior notice of CACI
listing. (AR 11-45.) DCFS granted petitioner’s request. (AR 46-47.)
 
E.          
Hearing
 
Petitioner’s
CACI review hearing was held in two parts on April 22, 2021 and July 30, 2021,
before hearing officer Melanie Pelayo. (AR 197, 306.) Despite respondent’s
objections to petitioner’s exhibits, the Hearing Officer admitted them into
evidence but indicated it would be given appropriate weight. (AR 205-06 [HT
9:25-10:15.) 
 
CSW
Barnett testified that she substantiated sexual abuse of both LW and SW by petitioner
under Penal Code § 11165.1. (AR 208.) Barnett admitted that, with respect to kissing
the girls on the lips and squeezing their vagina, Barnett “d[idn]’t know what [petitioner]
was thinking, if that was sexual gratification or not.” (AR 265 [HT 69:6-13].)
 
Petitioner
testified under oath and denied ever touching either of the girls in any way
that was inappropriate, including sexually inappropriate. (AR 332 [HT 136:7-14].)
He denied ever kissing SW. (AR 332 [HT 136:15-21].) Petitioner testified that he
told the girls not to kiss people on the lips, just as he told his own daughter
that. (AR 332 [HT 136:16-21].) Petitioner also testified that, when he kissed
their mother, the girls would say that they did not like him and that they
wanted their mother to get back together with their father. (AR 321 [HT
125:23-27].)
 
Petitioner
also offered the testimony of Dr. Veronica Thomas, a clinical and forensic
psychologist, as his expert witness. (AR 270 [HT 74:10-11].) She reviewed the
county’s evidence in the matter and conducted a psychosexual evaluation of petitioner
in 2021. (AR 154, 272 [HT 76:1-12].) She testified that sexual interest in
children does not change over time. (AR 280-81 [HT 84:22-85:9].) According to
Dr. Thomas, sexual interest is fairly well established by puberty. (AR 311 [HT
115:18-19].) She testified that there was no finding that he had deviant sexual
interests over his lifespan since adolescence. (AR 292 [HT 96:17-22].)  She also testified that petitioner had no
deviant arousal to children, issues with impulse control, or any other
paraphilic problem areas. (AR 297 [HT 101:1-10], 312-13 [HT 116:27-117:2].)
 
F.          
Decision
 
On
February 25, 2022, the Hearing Officer issued a written recommended decision. (AR
183.) In the “Basis of Recommended Decision” section, the Hearing Officer
concluded that the substantiated allegation of sexual abuse as to both girls
was supported. (AR 192.) The Hearing Officer noted that petitioner “did not
provide evidence that showed that [the girls] were lying” and “did not provide
an alternative explanation of what was going on in the bathroom during this
incident.” (AR 192.) She further concluded that petitioner’s “efforts to show
himself in a positive light came at the expense of him appearing to be a
truthful witness.” (AR 192.)
             
On
February 25, 2022, DCFS adopted the Hearing Officer’s recommendation as its
final decision. (AR 195.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
May 20, 2022, petitioner filed a verified petition for writ of mandamus. On
July 12, 2022, respondent filed an Answer.
 
            On
October 9, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On November 18, 2024, respondent
filed an opposition. On December 3, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. The Court
has received a hard copy of the administrative record. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Review of administrative
decisions made pursuant to required hearings is governed by CCP § 1094.5. (CCP
§ 1094.5(a).) Under CCP § 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the
respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial,
and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion
is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law,
the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not
supported by the evidence. (CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
The Court exercises its
independent judgment in reviewing whether a report of child abuse is substantiated
“[b]ecause recordation in CACI as a probable child abuser impinges upon
fundamental rights.” (Gonzalez v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social
Services (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 72, 84.) Under the independent judgment
test, “the trial court not only examines the administrative record for errors
of law, but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed
in a limited trial de novo.” (Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.) The court must draw its own
reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility
determinations. (Morrison v. Housing
Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003) 107 Cal.
App. 4th 860, 868.)  
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal
quotations omitted.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either
party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a
search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in
the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950)
99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) 
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Preliminary
Comments
 
            As a preliminary matter, the Hearing
Officer found that the allegations of sexual abuse as to both SW and LW were
substantiated. (AR 192.) However, the notices of CACI listing issued to
petitioner listed SW as the alleged victim. (AR 5, 117.) During the hearing,
the Hearing Officer indicated that only the allegations against SW were listed
as substantiated in the state case management system. (AR 264 [HT
68:7-12], 268 [HT 72:21-28].) Nevertheless, for the reasons stated below, the
allegations of sexual abuse as to SW are sufficient to affirm the
administrative decision.
 
B.          
The
Weight of the Evidence Supports the Administrative Decision 
 
The
Court finds that the weight of the evidence supports a finding that the report
of sexual abuse of SW by petitioner is substantiated. 
 
According
to CSW Barnett’s service log, on June 28, 2010, Barnett interviewed SW alone.
(AR 72.) During the interview, SW indicated that, while she was in the
bathroom, but not while she was taking a bath, petitioner touched her in her
private area while she had her clothes on. (AR 72.) SW also indicated to
Officer Serrano that petitioner touched her private part two times underneath
her clothes. (AR 98.) LW also told Officer Serrano that petitioner touched SW “[i]n
the head, in the butt, in the legs, in the lips” and that LW put petitioner on a
“time out” “[b]ecause he was trying to be bad.” (AR 98.)
 
During
the hearing, Barnett confirmed SW’s account and indicated that SW had pointed
to her vagina in explaining that petitioner touched her in her private area. (AR
243-44 [HT 47:20-48:4, 48:15-21].) In demonstrating how petitioner touched her,
SW squeezed Barnett’s upper arm. (AR 72.) When asked whether it hurt when
petitioner squeezed her private area, SW responded “yes” and started to cry. (AR
72.)
 
Cindy
Liang, the girls’ babysitter, also indicated to Officer Serrano that SW told
her about petitioner’s touching and how SW did not like the touching and cried.
(AR 97.) Liang also told Officer Serrano that LW told her that petitioner touched
SW in her private part and that she placed petitioner on time out because he
was being a “bad boy.” (AR 97.) When Detective Larriva spoke with the girls,
they would not answer questions, but they would look straight down and did not
want to speak anymore when asked about petitioner. (AR 97.) Detective Larriva
believed that something happened between petitioner and the girls. (AR 79.)
 
Based
on the foregoing, the weight of the evidence supports a finding that petitioner
sexually abused SW, warranting his listing in the CACI. “Sexual abuse” includes
the “intentional touching of the genitals or intimate parts, including the
breasts, genital area, groin, inner thighs, and buttocks, or the clothing
covering them, of a child…for purposes of sexual arousal or gratification,
except that it does not include acts which may reasonably be construed to be
normal caretaker responsibilities; interactions with, or demonstrations of
affection for, the child; or acts performed for a valid medical purpose.” (Pen.
Code § 11165.1(b).) SW was consistent in her accounts to Liang, CSW Barnett,
and Officer Serrano that petitioner had touched her on her vagina in the
bathroom.  
 
The
Court notes certain inconsistencies and claims that could cast doubt on
credibility. For example, SW indicated to Barnett that her parents and
petitioner hit her on the hand with a hammer when they were disciplining her.
(AR 73.) When Barnett repeated the work “hammer,” SW explained that perhaps her
mother or father would use their hand to hit her hand. (AR 73.) LW also
indicated to Officer Serrano that petitioner had not touched her (AR 98) but
later told Barnett that petitioner did touch her. (AR 73.)
 
The
Court also notes that SW and LW’s mother told Barnett that her children
sometimes lie. (AR 71.) The Court also notes petitioner contention as to why SW
would misrepresent that sexual abuse had occurred, claiming that, when he
kissed the girls’ mother, they would say that they did not like him and that
they wanted their mother to get back together with their father. (AR 321 [HT
125:23-27].) Petitioner and the mother also told Barnett that petitioner would
yell at the girls a lot and that they would be afraid of him. (AR 75, 225 [HT
29:18-24], 216 [HT 20:23-21:2].)
 
Nonetheless,
a “substantiated report” is defined “as a report that is determined by the
investigator who conducted the investigation to constitute child abuse or
neglect, as defined in Section 11165.6, based upon evidence that makes it more
likely than not that child abuse or neglect, as defined, occurred.” (Pen. Code
§ 11165.12(b).) When the evidence is looked at as a whole, the Court finds
that it is more likely than not that petitioner sexually abused SW. As stated
above, SW was consistent in asserting that petitioner had touched her on her
vagina. The Court also credits CSW Barnett conclusion that SW and LW’s corroboration
of SW’s account was credible based on the girls’ demeanor, body language, and
statements. (AR 255-56 [HT 59:21-60:15].)
 
While
their mother told Barnett that the girls lie sometimes, the mother then
clarified that LW lies, but not SW. (AR 71.) Even assuming LW may have some
tendency to lie, her sister SW separately gave the same account of what
petitioner did to SW. In any event, Barnett found the mother to be defensive,
not surprised, at the allegation that petitioner was sexually abusing her
daughters. (AR 215 [HT 19:17-27].) Barnett stated it is not a good sign when a
parent states that their children lie. (AR 215 [HT 19:24-27].) Indeed, Barnett found
it suspicious that, after she explained the allegation that petitioner touched
SW in the private area, unprompted, the mother stated that petitioner stopped
bathing the girls six months ago, even though Barnett had not brought up the
topic of bathing. (AR 73, 214-15 [HT 18:21-19:12], 216 [HT 20:6-20].) Barnett
also noted that she had asked the mother four times if the children were lying
before receiving any response. (AR 71.)
 
Similarly,
when Barnett asked petitioner at the outset of their interview whether the mother
had explained the situation to him, petitioner curiously brought up the topic
of bathing, which Barnett found to be suspicious for lack of prompting about
the bathroom incident. (AR 74-75, 223 [HT 27:1-27].)[1]
Barnett noted that, as she started asking more detailed questions about his
relationship with the girls, petitioner started to cry and asked, “Am I going
to jail for something?” (AR 75, 224 [HT 28:1-11].)
 
The
Court finds that mother’s unnatural reaction to reports of sexual abuse to her
daughters, petitioner’s nervousness during his interview, and the mother and
petitioner’s unprompted assertion that petitioner had stopped bathing the girls
are all consistent with a consciousness of petitioner’s wrongdoing, thereby
bolstering the Court’s finding that SW and LW’s version of events is more
likely true than not. 
 
Furthermore,
petitioner’s proffered reason for the girls’ purported misrepresentations is
unavailing. The Court agrees with the Hearing Officer’s finding that “the girls
were toddlers when their parents split, and they would not have remembered a
time they were together, nor is there evidence that they fabricated the
allegation in hopes of making that happen.” (AR 193.) Petitioner’s speculation
concerning the girls’ motivations does not outweigh SW and LW’s account of
events, as found credible by CSW Barnett. 
 
Lastly,
even though Dr. Thomas testified that petitioner had no inclination to be sexually
aroused by children or problematic around children (AR 297 [HT 101:1-10], 312-13
[HT 116:27-117:2]), the doctor also testified that she could not be sure what happened
10 years ago during the incident or whether some external factor occurring
after the incident could account for the doctor’s conclusions about petitioner
today. (AR 312-13 [HT 116:23-117:27].) 
 
            Accordingly, for the reasons stated
above, the Court finds that the weight of the evidence supports the finding that
petitioner engaged in sexual abuse of SW, which warrants his continued
inclusion in the CACI. 
 
C.          
Petitioner’s
Unavailing Arguments
 
1.           
Delay
in Notification of CACI Listing
 
Petitioner
argues that respondent failed to give timely notice of the CACI listing.
Agencies referring suspected child abusers to the CACI are required to send
notice of their CACI listing at the same time the report is sent to the
Department of Justice. (Pen. Code § 11169(c); see also MPP 31-021.1
[notice of CACI listing, grievance procedures, and request for hearing to be
sent to individual within five business days of submission of individual’s name
to DOJ].) 
 
On
July 22, 2010, CSW Barnett deemed the allegations of child abuse against
petitioner substantiated. (AR 7.) Petitioner’s name was placed in the CACI in
October 2010. (AR 42.) Respondent does not deny that the placement occurred in
2010. Petitioner contends that he did not receive the notice of the CACI
listing under March 2019, which prohibited him from calling the mother and
obtaining a psychosexual evaluation closer to the time of the incident. (AR 42,
117.) 
 
However,
petitioner did not raise the issue of untimely notice in the administrative
proceeding. “In general, a party must exhaust administrative remedies before
resorting to the courts.” (Coachella Valley Mosquito & Vector Control
Dist. v. California Public Employment Relations Bd. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1072,
1080.) The exhaustion doctrine “requires that a party must not only initially
raise the issue in the administrative forum, but he must proceed through the
entire proceeding to a final decision on the merits of the entire controversy.”
(McHugh v. County of Santa Cruz (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 533, 539.)
“[E]xhaustion of the administrative remedy is a jurisdictional prerequisite to
resort to the courts.” (Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal, Third Dist.
(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 293.) “The exhaustion doctrine is principally grounded on
concerns favoring administrative autonomy (i.e., courts should not interfere
with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision) and
judicial efficiency (i.e., overworked courts should decline to intervene in an
administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary).” (Farmers Ins. Exchange
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 391.) Petitioner bears the burden
to establish that it exhausted administrative remedies. (Westinghouse Elec.
Corp. v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 32, 37.) 
 
The
MPPs imposed on petitioner the burden of “provid[ing] evidence supporting his
or her claim that the county's decision should be withdrawn or changed.” (MPP §
31-021.68.) As such, the CACI proceeding was akin to an adversarial proceeding
subject to the requirement of exhaustion of issues and not, as petitioner
contends, an informal, inquisitorial proceeding to which exhaustion does not
apply. (See Carr
v. Saul (2021)
593 U.S. 83, 89 [“The critical feature that distinguishes adversarial
proceedings from inquisitorial ones is whether claimants bear the
responsibility to develop issues for adjudicators' consideration”].)
 
Petitioner
did not meaningfully raise or pursue his claim of untimely notice during the
CACI hearing.  Nor does he demonstrate he
should be excused from so doing because he was barred or because it was futile
for him to argue that he was prejudiced by receiving notice of the CACI listing
nine years later. Accordingly, petitioner fails to show that he is entitled to
writ relief based on untimely notice of the CACI listing. 
 
2.           
Sufficiency
of Notice of CACI Listing
 
Petitioner
argues that the notice of CACI listing did not provide him adequate notice of
the acts he was alleged to have committed. “The primary purpose of procedural
due process is to provide affected parties with the right to be heard at a
meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. Consequently, due process is a
flexible concept, as the characteristic of elasticity is required in order to
tailor the process to the particular need.” (Ryan v. California
Interscholastic Federation-San Diego Section (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1048,
1072.)
 
Petitioner
did not argue the adequacy of the notice during the hearing. For the reasons
stated above with respect to untimely notice, petitioner is now barred from
raising the adequacy of notice due to failure to exhaust.  Even if petitioner was not barred from arguing
that the notice was inadequate, the Court would find that the notice satisfies
due process. 
 
Under
“THE SPECIFIC ACT(S) OF ABUSE OR SEVERE NEGLECT ALLEGED AGAINST YOU IS/ARE AS
FOLLOWS,” the notice stated: “Substantiated: Sexual Abuse, Assault.
Exploitation ([SW]). (AR 117.) The notice provided the alleged victim’s full
name and the address where the alleged abuse occurred. (AR 117.) Further, the
notice notified petitioner that reports may be disclosed to statutorily authorized
parties pursuant to Penal Code § 11167.5. (AR 117.) As the person reported to
the Department of Justice for listing in the CACI, petitioner is a statutorily
authorized party to whom reports of the abuse may be disclosed. (Pen. Code §
11167.5(b)(11).) The notice provides petitioner with sufficient notice to
ascertain the allegations against him. 
 
Moreover,
to the extent that the notice was deficient, petitioner must also show actual
prejudice. (Krontz v. City of San Diego (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1126,
1141.) Procedural errors, “even if proved, are subject to a harmless error
analysis.” (Hinrichs v. County of Orange (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 921,
928.) “The question is whether the violation resulted in unfairness, in some
way depriving [petitioner] of adequate notice or an opportunity to be heard
before impartial judges.” (Rhee v. El Camino Hosp. Dist. (1988) 201
Cal.App.3d 477, 497; see also Thornbrough v. Western Placer Unified School
Dist. (2013) 223 Cal.App.4th 169, 200.) Here, petitioner interviewed with
the Baldwin Park Police Department and CSW Barnett concerning the allegations
of sexual abuse from the minors. (AR 75, 103.) Further, during the hearing,
petitioner testified that, on June 29, 2010, Barnett informed him about the
allegations of sexual molestation toward the kids, which prompted him to hire
an attorney. (AR 327-28 [HT 131:22-132:19].) Under the circumstances here,
notwithstanding any deficiencies in the notice of CACI listing, petitioner was
adequately notified of the allegations against him.
 
3.           
Timeliness
of Decisions After Hearing
 
Petitioner
contends that the recommended and final decisions were untimely rendered. MPP
31-021.82 states that the hearing officer shall issue a written recommended
decision within 30 calendar days after completion of the hearing. The hearing
was completed at the latest on July 30, 2021.[2]
(AR 306, 350.) Accordingly, the Hearing Officer had until August 29, 2021 to
issue a recommended decision. The recommended decision was issued on February
25, 2022. (AR 183-94.) 
 
Under
MPP 31-021.83, “[t]he county director shall issue a final written decision
adopting, rejecting, or modifying the recommended decision within ten (10)
business days after the recommended decision is rendered.” Based on the August
29, 2021 due date of the recommended decision, the final decision was due by September
8, 2021. The final decision was issued on February 25, 2022. (AR 195.) Although
the decision was untimely, however, “requirements relating to the time within
which an act must be done are directory rather than mandatory or
jurisdictional, unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed.” (Edwards v.
Steele (1979) 25 Cal.3d 406, 410.) The MPPs do not state the effect of an
untimely decision, such as removal of a complainant from the CACI.
 
Accordingly,
the untimeliness of the decision does not entitle petitioner to removal from
the CACI. 
 
4.           
Witnesses
Not Subject to Cross-Examination
 
Petitioner
contends that he was deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine SW, LW, the
father, Liang, Officer Serrano, and the nurse who conducted the physical
examinations. However, “there is no absolute right to a live hearing with
cross-examination in administrative proceedings, even where constitutional due
process applies.” (Boermeester v. Carry (2023) 15 Cal.5th 72, 93.) While
the accused is entitled to a meaningful opportunity to respond, there is also
an interest in encouraging witnesses to report sexual assault and ensuring that
accusers alleging sexual assault are not retraumatized. (Id. at 93
[sexual misconduct hearings at universities].) Indeed, the MPP provides that
the hearing officer may prevent a child from being examined to protect the
child from trauma. (MPP 31-021.662.) Entities lacking subpoena power, like the
hearing officer in a CACI proceeding (MPP 31-021.66), are “ill-equipped to
function as courts” because they cannot “force key witnesses to attend a
hearing and be subject to cross-examination.” (Id. at 94.) So long as
petitioner was provided with adequate notice of the charges and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard, this is sufficient. (Id. at 90.)
 
Here,
petitioner was provided sufficient notice of the CACI listing, presented himself
and Dr. Thomas as witnesses, cross-examined DCFS’s witness, CSW Barnett (AR
229), and presented closing argument (AR 340-45). Petitioner was provided with
fair procedure. 
 
5.           
Reference
to Dependency Petition
 
Petitioner
contends that the Hearing Officer relied on a petition filed in dependency
court to which he was not a party and which he never received. (AR 193.) Even
though the allegations of the dependency petition were set forth under the
“Basis of Recommended Decision,” it is clear the Hearing Officer did not rely
on the dependency petition as evidence to reach a final decision that the
claims of sexual abuse were substantiated. 
Indeed, the opposite is true.  The
decision of the hearing officer merely notes that “[a]s a result of the
investigation in this matter, a petitioner was filed in Juvenile Dependency
Court” and proceeds to quote some of the allegations of that petition.  (See AR 193 [“Malcollms Ramirez
sexually abused the children [SW] and [LW] by fondling the children’s vagina…inflicting
pain to the children.” Notably, the decision does not even disclose what, if
anything, the juvenile dependency court.
 
Accordingly,
the dependency petition was not improperly used as evidence to conclude that petitioner
engaged in sexual abuse.  As discussed
above, that conclusion was instead supported by, among other things, CSW
Barnett’s testimony concerning her interviews with SW and Ms. Liang. (AR
186-87)
6.           
Category
of Sexual Abuse
 
Petitioner
argues that the Hearing Officer failed to apply the evidence to any category of
sexual abuse. “[I]mplicit in [Code of Civil Procedure] section
1094.5 is a requirement that the agency which renders the challenged decision
must set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and
ultimate decision or order.” (Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County
of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515.) The Court explained that “among
other functions, … findings enable the reviewing court to trace and examine the
agency's mode of analysis.” (Id. at 516.)
 
Here, the Hearing Officer set forth the categories
of sexual assault, which constitutes sexual abuse. (AR 192.) One of those
categories is Penal Code § 11165.1(b)(4), “intentional touching of the genitals or intimate
parts, including the breasts, genital area, groin, inner thighs, and buttocks,
or the clothing covering them, of a child…for purposes of sexual arousal or
gratification, except that it does not include acts which may reasonably be
construed to be normal caretaker responsibilities; interactions with, or
demonstrations of affection for, the child; or acts performed for a valid
medical purpose.” (Pen. Code § 11165.1(b)(4).) In the basis for the recommended
decision, the Hearing Officer stated that SW told Liang that petitioner touched
her private parts and that it was clear to law enforcement that SW was
referring to her vagina. (AR 192.) Although the Hearing Officer noted Barnett’s
testimony that she did not know if petitioner had sexual gratification when he
touched the girls (AR 188), the Hearing Officer found that petitioner provided
no alternative explanation for his being in the bathroom with the girls. (AR
192.) Further, SW indicated that she was not taking a bath when petitioner
touched her. (AR 72, 186.) Absent any other reason for petitioner having been
in the bathroom with SW, the evidence supports the implicit finding that petitioner
touched SW for sexual gratification, an element of sexual assault as defined in
Penal Code § 11165.1(b)(4). 
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), respondent shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed
judgment.
