And here is a summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the judge denies the ex parte application of Defendant William Hernandez, which sought to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Ashley Williams and award $560 in monetary sanctions. The judge finds that the defendant's request is premature and that the correct procedure is to file a noticed motion. The judge also denies the defendant's request for sanctions, citing the requirement that sanctions requests be made via a fully noticed motion and the constitutional due process principles that govern discovery sanctions. The denial of the ex parte application is without prejudice to relief sought by noticed motion.
