MUHAMMAD UMAIR NABEEL,  
  
         vs.
 
SELENA MARIE GOMEZ, et al.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV28506
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  May 21, 2024



 
Specially
Appearing Defendants Selena Marie Gomez’s and July Moon Productions’ unopposed
motion to quash service of summons is granted. 
 
Specially
Appearing Defendants Selena Marie Gomez (“Gomez”) and July Moon Productions
(“July Moon”) (collectively, “specially Appearing Defendants”) make a special
appearance for this Court to quash service of the summons and complaint in this
action on the grounds Plaintiff Muhammed Umair Nabeel (“Nabeel”) (“Plaintiff”) has
failed to properly serve Specially Appearing Defendants, and the Court
accordingly lacks personal jurisdiction over them.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §418.10(a)(1).)
 
Background
On
November 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Complaint.  On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff mailed the
summons and complaint from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to Richard H. Feldstein (“Feldstein”)
at 10960 Wilshire Blvd, 5th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90024.  (12/20/23 Proof of Service.)  Plaintiff filed a proof of service for the
Complaint on December 20, 2023, indicating that he served Feldstein by mail.
On
January 12, 2024, Specially Appearing Defendants filed the instant motion.  As of the date of this hearing Plaintiff has
not filed an opposition.  Specially
Appearing Defendant filed a reply, which is effectively a notice of
non-opposition, on May 14, 2024.
 
Motion
to Quash
“A defendant, on or before
the day of his or her time to plead . . . may serve and file a notice of motion
. . . [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of
the court over him or her.”  (C.C.P.
§418.10(a)(1).)  By filing such motion,
“a defendant makes a special appearance for the narrow purpose of contesting
personal jurisdiction where the summons is defective.”  (Stancil v. Superior Court (2021) 11
Cal.5th 381, 393.)
“California is a jurisdiction
which in general requires strict statutory compliance with requirements for
service of original process.”  (In re
Abrams (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 685, 693-694.) 
“Until statutory requirements are satisfied, the Court lacks
jurisdiction over a defendant.”  (Ruttenberg
v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801, 809.)
“In the absence of a
voluntary submission to the authority of the court, compliance with the
statutes governing service of process is essential to establish that court’s
personal jurisdiction over a defendant.”  (Floveyer International, Ltd. v. Superior
Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 793; see also Calvert v. Al Binali
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 954, 961 [“To establish personal jurisdiction, it is essential
to comply with the statutory procedures for service of process.”].) “When a
defendant challenges that jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving,
inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.”  (Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th
1154, 1160, internal quotations omitted.)
California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.110(b) provide that a summons and complaint must be served on each
defendant and a proof of service on each defendant must be filed with the court
within 60 days after the complaint is filed. Proof of such service must be made
by affidavit of the person making the service “showing the time, place, and
manner of service” and including facts showing service was made in accordance
with California law.  (C.C.P. §§417.10(a),
417.30.)  Proof of personal service must
be made on a form adopted by the Judicial Counsel.  (Id. § 417.10(f).)
“A summons may be served by personal
delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be
served.”  (C.C.P. §415.10.)  “‘[P]ersonal service,’ generally speaking,
means the actual delivery of the process to the defendant in person . . . .”  (Wilson v. Eddy (1969) 2 Cal.App.3d
613, 617.)  Personal delivery is the
“preferred way to serve a defendant” because it “is the most likely to ensure
actual notice to the defendant.”  (Board
of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University v. Ham (2013) 216
Cal.App.4th 330, 336.)
To effectuate service by mail
under C.C.P. §415.30, the summons and complaint must be mailed to the person to
be served along with a prepaid return envelope and two copies of the notice and
acknowledgment provided for under the same rule.  The notice must inform the defendant that
unless she signs and returns the acknowledgment within 20 days, she will be
liable for further expenses incurred in completing service by some other method.
 (C.C.P. §415.30(b).)  Even when this method is used correctly, the
plaintiff’s mailing of the required papers alone does not accomplish service;
service is not deemed complete until the defendant signs the acknowledgment
form and thereby consents to service in this manner.  (C.C.P. §415.30(c).)  Therefore, even if the requisite notice and acknowledgment
copies are duly provided, a defendant who refuses or otherwise fails to sign
the provided acknowledgment form still has not been served. (C.C.P. §415.30(d).)
Here, Plaintiff failed to
meet his burden to demonstrate he served the summons and complaint in the mail
to the named Defendants with the required notice and acknowledgment, and that
such forms were signed by Defendants or anyone on their behalf.  (Decl. of Feldstein ¶3.) Therefore,
Plaintiff’s purported service is ineffectual as to both Specially Appearing
Defendants. 
Plaintiff has also violated
even the most basic rule of service of process by attempting to serve the
papers himself.  C.C.P. §414.10 provides:
“A summons may be served by any person who is at least 18 years of age and not
a party to the action.”  Under penalty of
perjury, Plaintiff signed the filed proof of service declaring that he
conducted the mailing and that he is “at least 18 years of age, not a party to
this action, and . . . a resident of or employed in the county where the
mailing took place.” (12/20/23 Proof of Service.)  Because Plaintiff is a party to this action,
cannot have effected service himself.
Further, there is no filing
on the docket for the instant matter demonstrating Plaintiff attempted to serve
Specially Appearing Defendants by substituted service.  The pleadings sent to the address indicated
on the proof of service were mailed, not left by a process server as required
under C.C.P. §415.20.  Further, as to
substituted service under §415.20(b), the only filing Plaintiff has made
regarding attempts to serve Defendant Gomez by sheriff service on December 27,
2023, at 4600 Encino Avenue, Encino, CA 91316, where Defendant Gomez was not
found, and the documents to be served were the civil case cover sheet addendum
and a statement of location, not the Complaint or Summons.  (1/16/24 Proof of Service – No Service.)
Accordingly, Specially
Appearing Defendants’ motion to quash is granted.
 
Conclusion
Specially Appearing Defendants’
motion to quash service of summons is granted.
Moving Party to give
notice.
