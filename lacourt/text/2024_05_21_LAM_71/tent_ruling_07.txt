[1] The Court notes Plaintiff’s FAC caption indicates
there are five causes of action, listing a cause of action for whistleblower
retaliation.  However, Plaintiff does not
substantively allege a cause of action for whistleblower retaliation in her
FAC.  Therefore, the Court notes there
are only four causes of action at issue, and therefore regards the FAC caption
as erroneous.


[2] The Court notes Defendant does not substantively
demur to Plaintiff’s causes of action on the basis of uncertainty.  Therefore, the Court’s ruling does not
address this issue.
