Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to approve the settlement and Stipulated Consent Judgment between CALSAFE RESEARCH CENTER, INC. (plaintiff) and MERCADO LATINO, INC. (defendant). The settlement resolves plaintiff's allegations that defendant exposed individuals to lead from its products without providing clear and reasonable exposure warnings under Proposition 65.

The court finds that the warning required by the settlement complies with Proposition 65, that the requested attorney's fees and costs are reasonable, and that the proposed penalty of $3,000 is reasonable. The court also finds that the settlement is in the public interest, as it will reduce or eliminate the exposure to lead from the defendant's products.

The motion is granted, and the settlement and Stipulated Consent Judgment are approved. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
