Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Wine Warehouse's second motion for issue and monetary sanctions against Golden State Cider. The motion is based on Wine Warehouse's attempt to conduct discovery from Golden State Cider's most knowledgeable person (PMK) concerning the acquisition of Golden State Cider by Sonoma Craft Holdings. The Judge finds that the motion should have been heard by the referee first, and that the proposed issue sanctions are too severe. The Judge denies the motion and orders that the parties should not be awarded issue sanctions or monetary sanctions.
