And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has been considering a motion to dismiss a claim brought by CAG under California Proposition 65, alleging that the defendants failed to provide adequate warning of the presence of lead in their turmeric products. The key issue is whether the notice of violation (NOV) issued by the California Attorney General's office is sufficient to establish standing for CAG to bring the claim.

The judge has concluded that the NOV is inherently inconsistent and does not provide sufficient information for the defendants to reasonably assess which of their products are alleged to be in violation of Prop 65. The judge has also determined that the plaintiff's reliance on the declaration of counsel and an attached report of Nicole Avena is permissible, and that the motion to dismiss is not equivalent to a motion for judgment on the pleadings under California Code of Civil Procedure section 631.8.

The judge has not decided whether the defendants met their burden of proof, as there are numerous disputed factual issues that turn on competing expert opinions. The judge has, however, concluded that the pending motions in limine are moot and are taken off calendar.
