[1] “When discovery has produced an admission or
concession on the part of the party opposing summary judgment which
demonstrates that there is no factual issue to be tried,” controverting
affidavits submitted by that party may be disregarded.  (D’Amico v. Board of Med. Examiners (1974)
11 Cal.3d 1, 20-22.)  “Admissions or
concessions made during the course of [deposition testimony] govern and control
over contrary declarations lodged at a hearing on a motion for summary
judgment.”  (Visueta v. General Motors
Corp. (1991) 234 Cal.3d 1609, 1613.) 
“[A]bsent a credible explanation,” a court may disregard a self-serving,
conclusory declaration that clearly contradicts deposition testimony, filed in
opposition to summary judgment.  (Vulk
v. State Farm Gen. Ins. Co. (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 243, 258.)   Here,
Plaintiff has not proffered a credible explanation regarding the discrepancy
between Cyrus Azarmy’s deposition testimony and declaration regarding the
location of the subject Ficus tree. 
Accordingly, the Court disregards Cyrus Azarmy’s statement as set forth
in paragraph 7 of his declaration:  “are partially
located in each property.”  


[2] The Court notes that Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Judgment is based upon Issues 1 -3 and 7-9 only.  (See Defendants’ Notice of Motion and Motion
for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, for Summary Adjudication.)
