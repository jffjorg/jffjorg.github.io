And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment from the defendants and has reviewed the deposition testimony and declarations submitted by the parties. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not provided a credible explanation for the discrepancy between Cyrus Azarmy's deposition testimony and declaration regarding the location of a Ficus tree. As a result, the judge will disregard Azarmy's statement regarding the location of the tree. The defendants' motion for summary judgment is based on specific issues, and the judge will consider those issues only.
