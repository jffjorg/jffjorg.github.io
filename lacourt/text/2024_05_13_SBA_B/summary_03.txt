English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to transfer venue filed by the defendant, American Honda Motor Company, in a lawsuit brought by plaintiffs Alicia Camarena Millan and Arturo Camarena Sibrian. The defendant requests that the court transfer the case to San Bernardino County, where the vehicle was purchased and primarily repaired. The court finds that the motion is untimely, but will consider it since the complaint did not reveal where the vehicle was purchased and repaired. The court finds that Los Angeles County is a proper venue because that is where the defendant's principal place of business is located. The court denies the motion to transfer venue.
