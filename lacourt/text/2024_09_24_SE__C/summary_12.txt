And here is a brief summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling from a judge regarding a breach of contract action between Shamika Harris and Rabi Mouton. The plaintiff, Harris, entered into an agreement with Mouton to purchase real property for investment purposes. After the property was sold, Mouton refused to reimburse Harris for her initial investment of $276,893.33 or provide her with her share of the profits. Harris applied for a Temporary Restraining Order to direct the escrow company to pay her initial investment, but the judge denied the application. The judge found that Harris failed to demonstrate irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte, and that she may not use the temporary restraining order as a substitute for litigating the discovery matters at issue.
