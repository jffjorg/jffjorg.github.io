And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Defendant, 24 Hour Fitness USA, LLC, and granted its motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiff, Cornelia Muntean, had sued the Defendant for personal injuries she sustained after slipping and falling in the pool area at one of the Defendant's facilities. The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant was negligent and failed to maintain the pool area in a safe condition.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff had signed a Release of Liability and Assumption of Risk clause in the Club Membership Agreement, which may relieve the Defendant of liability. The Judge also found that the Defendant had presented prima facie evidence that the Plaintiff had assumed the risk of injury by signing the Release clause.

The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant had committed statutory violations, including failure to comply with building and health and safety codes, which would render the Release clause invalid. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff's Complaint did not mention the statutory violations and therefore the Release clause was not invalid.

Finally, the Judge found that the Plaintiff had failed to present evidence that the Defendant's conduct was grossly negligent, and therefore the Release clause was enforceable.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after a hearing on September 24, 2024.
