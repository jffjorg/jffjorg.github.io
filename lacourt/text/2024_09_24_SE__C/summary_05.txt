And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash the subpoena filed by Dane Medley, the plaintiff in this employment discrimination lawsuit. The subpoena was served by Pacific Office Automation, Inc. (POA), the defendant, to obtain business records from Medley's current employer, Flex Technology Group C/O Oval Partners, LLC (FTG).

The judge grants the motion to quash the subpoena in part, limiting the scope of the subpoena to documents that contain confidential information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement signed by the parties) that Medley obtained from POA, disclosed to FTG, or used during the course of his employment with FTG. The judge also orders that the subpoena be narrowed to electronically stored information (ESI) that was stored on or before the date Medley was terminated by POA.

The judge denies the motion to quash the subpoena in part, finding that POA is entitled to obtain documents that contain confidential information that Medley obtained during his employment with POA, whether that confidential information is now in Medley's possession or FTG's.

The judge also denies Medley's request for sanctions, finding that Medley acted with substantial justification in moving to quash the subpoena. The judge orders that FTG shall serve response documents within 45 days subject to a protective order.
