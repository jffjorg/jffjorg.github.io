 Case Number:  23NWCV04054    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  C SHAMIKA LASHAWN HARRIS vs RABI JAMIL MOUTON, Case No.:
23NWCV04054 
This is a breach of contract action.  The Complaint alleges that on or about August
2021, Plaintiff Shamika Harris and Defendant Rabi Mouton entered into an
agreement to purchase real property for investment purposes. Defendant made an initial
investment of $10,000 and Plaintiff made an initial investment of $276,
892.33.  The property later sold, and
Defendant now refuses to reimburse Plaintiff for her investment monies and to provide
Plaintiff with her share of the profits. 
Plaintiff applies ex parte for a Temporary Restraining Order to direct
the escrow company to pay Plaintiff her initial investment of $276,893.33.  Plaintiff argues that Defendant has refused to
engage in discovery or settlement negotiations. The ex parte application is
DENIED.  Plaintiff has failed to
demonstrate irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis
for granting relief ex parte. (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)  Under the circumstances here, Plaintiff may
not obtain a temporary restraining order as a substitute for litigating the discovery
matters at issue.  Moving party to give
notice.
