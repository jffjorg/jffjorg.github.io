 Case Number:  22NWCV00389    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  C Alfredo Duarte vs. General Motors, LLC Case No.: 22NWCV00389 Hearing Date: September 24, 2024 @ 9:30 a.m.  #2 Tentative Ruling  Plaintiff Alredo Duarte’s Motion to Compel Compliance with the Court’s December 7, 2023, Discovery Order is GRANTED. The deposition of Defendant’s PMQ is ordered within 20 days, absent an agreement by the parties to a later date.  No sanctions are ordered. Plaintiff to give notice.    Background This “lemon law” case was filed on May 20, 2022, by Plaintiff Alfredo Duarte (“Plaintiff”) regarding the purchase of a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 manufactured by Defendant General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”). On December 5, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant’s PMQ in part and ordered Defendant to produce its PMQ for deposition on categories 7-8, 10-13, 16-17, 18-19, 21-22, and 23-24, within 45 days of the Court’s Order, or by January 19, 2024.  The deposition has not taken place.   Plaintiff now moves to compel compliance with the December 5, 2023, order.   Legal Standard  “If that party or party-affiliated deponent then fails to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and production, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction…against that party deponent or against the party with whom the deponent is affiliated…” and the court may instead or additionally impose a monetary sanction against the deponent or party with whom the deponent is affiliated.¿ CCP § 2025.450(h).¿ Discussion  Defendant asserts that it did not receive notice of the Court’s December 5, 2023, order (Kay Decl., ¶ 3), and it inadvertently miscalendared the Court’s 45-day compliance deadline (Id. at ¶ 4). Since then, it has attempted to comply with the order in good faith by offering two deposition dates for its PMQ witness (Id. at ¶ 5), but Plaintiff has not met and conferred in good faith.   Plaintiff contends that on June 3, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent correspondence to Defendant’s counsel to request deposition dates for this matter. (Rogers Decl., ¶ 8, Ex 3.) On June 12, 2023, Defendant’s counsel offered a single witness on one date for this matter. (Id. at ¶ 9, Ex 4.) Defendant also offered that same witness and date for multiple other matters between Defendant’s counsel’s firm and Plaintiff’s counsel’s firm, making Plaintiff’s counsel choose which case to depose the PMQ for. (Ibid.) On June 14, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to accept the deposition date for this matter, but she was informed that the date had already been taken for another matter with Plaintiff’s counsel’s firm. (Id. at ¶¶ 10-11.) The same day, Defendant again offered a single deposition for multiple matters. (Id. at ¶ 12.) This time, Defendant indicated the witness would only have knowledge as to Defendant’s policies and procedures, and the witness would not be able to testify as to the other requested categories. (Ibid.)  Trial in this matter is scheduled for November 24, 2024. Trial has already been continued once to allow for the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ.  Although Plaintiff failed to give notice of the December 5, 2023, order, Defendant’s counsel was aware of the Court’s ruling because he participated in the hearing telephonically. (12/5/23 Minute Order.)  Plaintiff is entitled to the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ. The Court orders the deposition of the PMQ to take place within 20 days, absent an agreement by the parties to extend the period.   Sanctions  “If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ CCP § 2025.450(g)(1).¿ “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”¿ California Rules of Court Rule 3.1348(a).¿ Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $500 for each day after a ten-day compliance period that Defendant does not comply with the Court’s discovery order. (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 605 (noting that among the numerous tools at the Court’s disposal to compel compliance, “the court could have imposed a significant monetary penalty for every day [defendant] did not search for the documents and/or for each day the responsive documents were not produced”).)  Here, trial is 60 days away, and trial has already been continued once to allow Plaintiff to depose the PMQ.  However, the Court does not find prospective sanctions warranted at this juncture because Defendant has made some attempts to comply with the Court’s December 5, 2023 order.  These attempts were inadequate, and the Court would consider additional monetary sanctions, but none have been requested.
