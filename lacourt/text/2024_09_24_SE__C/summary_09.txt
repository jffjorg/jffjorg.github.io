And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendants David G. Coronado and Elaine Coronado. The defendants had demurred to the second and fifth causes of action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC), arguing that they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the second cause of action for general negligence is overruled, finding that the FAC sufficiently pleads a cause of action for general negligence as to the defendants. The judge has also ruled that the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for premises liability is overruled, finding that the FAC sufficiently pleads a cause of action for premises liability as to the defendants. However, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the survivor action brought by minor Plaintiff Maria Jose Galvez, finding that she fails to establish herself as a beneficiary of the decedent's estate or other successor in interest. The defendants are given 20 days to amend their answer.
