And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion to require the defendant to open a box and account for its contents is denied, except in limited circumstances. The Judge finds that everything has been settled between the parties, including the division of jewelry, and that the prior arbitration award has been confirmed in a judgment. The Judge notes that the settlement agreement does not mention the box or any rights to it, and that the petition to compel arbitration was resolved in favor of the defendant. The Judge concludes that there is no point in opening the box unless it is to ensure that specific property awarded to the plaintiff in the arbitration or settlement agreement has been turned over. If such property is found in the box, the motion will be denied, but if not, the motion will be granted and the defendant will prepare an order of dismissal.
