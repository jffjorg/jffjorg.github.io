And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the facts and legal arguments presented in the case. The plaintiff sued the defendant, a former business associate, for breaching a management agreement. The defendant demurred, arguing that the plaintiff's claims were without merit. The judge sustained the demurrer in part, ruling that the plaintiff's claims for fraud, unjust enrichment, and declaratory relief were without merit. However, the judge overruled the demurrer as to fraud, finding that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged promissory fraud. The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff has 30 days to amend its complaint, but can only do so through counsel. If the plaintiff does not amend its complaint, the defendant will have 30 days to answer.
