Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer is sustained without leave as to the breach of fiduciary duty claim unless the plaintiff can suggest how an amendment might cure the problem. The demurrer is overruled in all other respects. The motion to strike is moot as to punitive damages and denied as to fees. The court did not rely on the untimely opposition or the reply filed later that day when ruling on the motion to strike.

The case involves a quiet title action filed by Reith against West Pointe Homes (WPH) and others. WPH sold Lot 7 to Reith in 2016, but Reith alleges that WPH concealed the deed restriction. Reith's brokers, Nona Green and Lisa Cataldo, are also defendants in the case.

The Judge found that the cross-complaint is not uncertain, but the demurrer as to breach of fiduciary duty is sustained. The court found that WPH's brokers had some duties set by statute, but those duties are not here at issue and are not fiduciary in nature. The court also found that the court has no idea what fiduciary duties were owed to the seller by the buyer's broker.

The court is inclined to overrule the demurrer as to negligence. The court noted that cross-defendants contend that WPH's claim is based on a statutory duty of care, which has a two-year statute of repose. However, the court found that there also allegedly exists a common law duty of care, which can be tolled. The court noted that the demurring parties did not demur on the theory that there was no common law negligence alleged.

The motion to strike the request for punitive damages is moot in light of the demurrer. The motion to strike the request for fees is denied. The court will not award fees absent a basis to do so. The court will wait to see if there is a viable theory under which fees can be recovered.
