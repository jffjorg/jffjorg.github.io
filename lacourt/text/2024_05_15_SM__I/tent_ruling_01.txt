  Case Number:  19STCV22546    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  I The court is in receipt of the parties' request to continue the status conference.  The court finds good cause to continue.  The request is therefore GRANTED.  The court will set the new date by separate order, but understands that this is not a typical status conference and that a number of more complicated issues will need to be addressed.  The court is not certain that May 22, 2024 will work due to the court's trial schedule.  There will be no hearing today, however.
