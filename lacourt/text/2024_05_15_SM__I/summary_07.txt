And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff has filed a personal injury case and is seeking a preference in the trial schedule due to their advanced age (over 70) and various health issues. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice. The plaintiff's motion relies on a hearsay declaration from counsel, but the declaration does not provide a prognosis, which is required to demonstrate the necessity of the preference. The judge suggests that the plaintiff may be able to show the required prognosis by another attempt or that the court can exercise its discretion under subdivision (e) of the statute. The judge will discuss the alternative approach with the parties.
