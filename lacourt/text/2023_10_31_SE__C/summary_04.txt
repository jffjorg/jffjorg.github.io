Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's Motion to Strike the portions of the Complaint seeking punitive damages against National Polytechnic College, Inc. ("NP"). The Court finds that the Plaintiff's Complaint does not sufficiently allege facts supporting an award of punitive damages against NP. Specifically, the Plaintiff has not alleged which corporate employee of NP had advance knowledge of the believed history of Defendant Garzon's sexually inappropriate behavior or acted with conscious disregard, authorization, ratification, or act of oppression, fraud, or malice. The Court grants the Motion to Strike with 20 days leave to amend.
