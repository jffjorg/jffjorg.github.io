  Case Number:  22CHCV00559    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  F51  APRIL 22,  2024    MOTION FOR  ATTORNEY FEES  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 22CHCV00559      Motion Filed: 2/20/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff  Oswaldo Barrera Rivera (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING  PARTY: Defendants Second Motor Group of  Valencia, LLC; Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC; and Mercedes-Benz Financial Services  USA, LLC (collectively, “Defendants”)  NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: An order awarding Plaintiff attorney fees  and costs in the amount of $20,074.29.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is granted. Plaintiff is  awarded $20,074.29 in attorney fees and costs.   BACKGROUND   Plaintiff brings this action under the Song-Beverly Consumer  Warranty Act (Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a vehicle he purchased from  defendant Second Motor Group of Valencia, LLC on or around 4/2/22, financed by defendant Mercedes-Benz  Financial Services USA, LLC,  and for which defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC issued the manufacturer’s express warranty. (Compl. ¶¶ 1,  6.)   On 7/26/22, Plaintiff filed his complaint, alleging against  Defendants a sole cause of action for Violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer  Warranty Act. On 8/25/22, Defendants filed their answers.   On 8/10/23, the parties executed a settlement offer  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998, settling entire lawsuit  by Defendants paying Plaintiff $62,321.35, plus attorney fees, costs, and  expenses under Civil Code section 1974, subdivision (d), either by agreement or  by noticed motion. (Ex. B to Decl. Of Robert B. Mobasseri.) On 4/4/24, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Conditional  Settlement of the entire case.    On 2/20/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. On 4/10/24,  Defendant filed its opposition. On 2/13/24, Plaintiffs filed their reply.   ANALYSIS   A.     Right to Recovery   An award of  attorney fees is proper when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code  Civ. Proc. §§ 1032, subd. (b); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Here, the Song-Beverly Act  authorizes a buyer “to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the  aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on  actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred  by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such  action.” (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).)   Additionally,  here, the parties stipulated that “attorney fees, costs and expenses as allowed  by California Civil Code Section 1794(d) will either be agreed upon or by  motion. For the purposes of attorney’s fees, costs and expenses as outlined in  Section 1794(d) Defendant agrees that Plaintiff is the prevailing party.” (Ex. B  to Mobasseri Decl., 1:28–2:3.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled  to recover reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses as authorized by both  statute and contract.   B.      Attorney Fees Incurred   A buyer prevailing  under the Song-Beverly Act may recover “reasonable” attorney fees and costs as  determined by the Court. (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) “The burden is on the  party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are reasonable.” (Gonzalez  v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162,  169.) In determining a reasonable fee award, the Court begins with the lodestar  method of calculation, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied  by the reasonable hourly rate.¿(Karton v. Ari Design & Construction,  Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler  (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095–1096.)    Here, Plaintiff  seeks to recover $17,627.00 in attorney fees, encompassing 42.8 hours of his  attorneys’ time, billed at the following rates:      Name   Title   Hourly    Rate   Hours   Total     Robert B. Mobasseri   Attorney   $595.00   4.6   $2,737.00     David Alan Cooper   Attorney   $550.00   17.2   $9,460.00     Barbara A. Rohr   Attorney   $450.00   0.9   $405.00     Steven Berkowitz, J.D.   Paralegal   $250.00   11.4   $2,850.00     James D. Stone   Paralegal   $250.00   8.7   $2,175.00     Total   42.8   $40,517.50    (Ex. A to Mobasseri Decl.,  p. 3.) // // 1.      Counsel’s  Hourly Rate   When  determining a reasonable hourly rate, courts consider whether the stated rates  “are within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded  [to] comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children's Hosp. & Med.  Ctr. v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.) Lawyers who work on a  contingency fee basis may seek heightened attorney fees because of the inherent  contingent risk associated with their cases. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24  Cal.4th 1122, 1132 [“a contingent fee contract, since it involves a gamble on  the result, may properly provide for a larger compensation than would otherwise  be reasonable.”].)   Here,  Plaintiff asserts that counsel’s hourly rates are commensurate with The United  States Consumer Law Practice & Attorney Fee Survey Report 2023, California  Metro Edition, and attorney rates in similar cases in various Southern  California districts, which Plaintiff attaches as exhibits to the instant  motion. (Exs. C–D to Mobasseri Decl.)   In  opposition, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rates are  unreasonably high, and that such “types of rates claimed by Plaintiff in  Song-Beverly actions have recently been reduced by courts, because they do not  reflect the reasonable rates for attorneys in the field.” (Def.’s Opp. 2:22–23,  citing Exs. A–C to Decl. of Phil J. Montoya.) However, the Court notes that the  relevant cases proffered by both parties are “not certified for publication or  ordered published,” and therefore “must not be cited or relied on by a court or  a party in any other action.” (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 8.1115(a).)   Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently shown that his  attorneys’ and paralegals’ hourly billing rates are commensurate with their experience  and fall within the range of reasonable rates charged by similar attorneys and  judicially awarded in similar cases.   2.      Hours  Expended   Plaintiff  seeks to recover attorney fees for the 42.8 hours expended by his attorneys on  this matter and proffer an itemized list of time entries detailing his  attorneys’ work on the matter. (Ex. A to Mobasseri Decl.)   In addition  to the attorney hourly billing rate, Defendants challenge the following  specific entries in Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ proffered time log: (1) block-billed  entries; and (2) time entries Defendants find excessive and unreasonable.  (Def.’s Opp. 3:9–4:20.)   a.                   Block-billed Entries   Defendants  argue that Plaintiff’s counsel’s following time entries were impermissibly  block-billed, thereby rendering them “vague and ambiguous as it is unclear how  long each task took and what was billed:” (Id. at 3:11–12.) ·          7/18/22: “Review client's file; conference with  client; research vehicle-model defects on Alldata and NHTSA; draft Complaint.”  (5.60 hours) ·          10/25/22: “Review defendants' responses to  initial written discovery; notes to file for meet-and-confer letter.” (1.80  hours) ·          8/10/23: “Telephone call with client, Receipt  and Review propose settlement agreement, draft edits.” (1.00 hours)   Plaintiff  argues in opposition that “‘block-billing’ is not merely combining related  tasks within one entry. It is doing so in a manner which leaves the court  unable to reasonably determine the time spent on particular items and the  relevance of the tasks performed. (Pl.’s Opp. 2:3–5, citing Lunada  Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 487.) Plaintiff further  argues that here, the Court is able to determine what tasks were performed for  the time entries at issue. The Court agrees.   Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds no basis to conclude that Plaintiff’s counsel’s  time entries for 7/18/22, 10/25/22, and 8/10/23 are impermissibly block-billed.  Therefore, the Court declines to grant Defendants’ request to reduce the fee  demand for these tasks.   b.                   Remaining Time Entries   Defendants  further argue that the fees for the aforementioned time entries, as well as the  following time entries, should be reduced because “the time it took this  experienced attorney to complete this task is excessive and unreasonable:”  (Def.’s Opp. 3:23–24.) ·          11/4/22: “Review file and determine witnesses to  depose.” (0.60 hours.) ·          4/10/23: “Finalize motion to compel depositions  of defense witnesses.” (0.80 hours) ·          5/5/23: “Prepare for and take two  dealer-employee depositions of Derek Google (Service Advisor) and Derek Beltran  (Technician #4210); conference with client after depositions.” (4.20 hours) ·          10/17/23, 10/19/23, 11/2/23, 12/8/23: “Follow up  e-mail to opposing counsel regarding settlement.” (0.30 hours each) ·          11/7/23: “Receipt and Review correspondence from  opposing counsel regarding settlement and surrender.” (0.30 hours) ·          11/9/23: “Draft Motion to Enforce CCP 998  settlement, including file review, exhibits, draft notice and memorandum of  points and authorities; declaration of counsel.” (4.20 hours) ·          2/15/24: “Draft motion for attorney's fees and  costs after settlement.” (2.80 hours) ·          2/19/24: “Review and final edits to fee motion.”  (0.80 hours)   The Court  notes that Defendants do not provide further explanation or argument as to how  or why the time incurred by Plaintiff’s counsel for these items is excessive  and/or unreasonable. In opposition, Plaintiff maintains that the time billed  was reasonable based on the circumstances of the case. (Pl.’s Reply 2:12–3:24.)   Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds no basis to conclude that the subject time  entries are unreasonable or excessive. Therefore, the Court declines to grant  Defendants’ request to reduce the fee demand for these tasks.   C.    Costs   Plaintiff asserts that he incurred costs and expenses  totaling $2,447.29, which encompass: (1) $649.67 in filing fees; (2) $140.00 in  process server fees; (3) $167.62 in jury deposit fees; and (4) $1,490.00 in  deposition costs. (Ex. A to Mobasseri Decl., p. 3.) The Court notes that  Defendants do not object to any of the costs claimed. Accordingly, the Court  grants Plaintiff’s motion to recover $2,447.29 in costs and expenses.   CONCLUSION   The motion is granted. Plaintiff is awarded $20,074.29.in  attorney fees and costs.
