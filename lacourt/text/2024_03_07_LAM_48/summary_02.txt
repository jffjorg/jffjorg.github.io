And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court is continuing the motions filed by the Plaintiff, Mocha Holdings LLC, to compel further responses to request for admissions, form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for inspection, as well as the motion to impose monetary sanctions. The motions were filed on May 5, 2023, and the opposition was filed by the Defendant, AD.Com Interactive Media, Inc., on December 14, 2023. The reply was due on February 29, 2024, but none was filed. The Court notes that the Plaintiff improperly filed several motions to compel further discovery in one singular motion, and the Defendant's opposition raises issues concerning the Plaintiff's representation in the case. The Court is unsure whether the Plaintiff has a new counsel and whether the discovery issues are moot. Therefore, the motion is continued to March 2024 to confirm the appearance of new counsel for the Plaintiff and to determine whether the discovery issues are moot.
