And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of Defendant SCLARC to the second, third, and fourth causes of action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The demurrer argues that the FAC does not state sufficient causes of action for breach of contract, intentional tort, and general negligence against Defendant SCLARC. The court finds that the FAC lacks sufficient allegations to state a cause of action for breach of contract, intentional tort, and general negligence against Defendant SCLARC. The court also grants the motion to strike the FAC's claims for attorneys' fees and permanent and mandatory injunctions against Defendant SCLARC, finding that these claims are not supported by the FAC. The court orders Plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint within 20 days, with the option to amend the pleading to correct the deficiencies identified in the demurrer and motion to strike.
