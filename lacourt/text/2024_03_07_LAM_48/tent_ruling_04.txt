[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
  TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS SET ONE
  AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 7, 2024



 
On May 30, 2023, Plaintiff Luis
E. Penaloza filed this action against Defendant General Motors LLC arising from
Plaintiff’s purchase of an allegedly defective vehicle.
On
November 2, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant General Motors LLC with a Request
for Production of Documents, Set One.  (Yashar
Decl. ¶ 4; Exhibit 1.)  Plaintiff seeks
information regarding Plaintiff’s vehicle, recalls and technical service
bulletins for the Subject Vehicle, and similar complaints from consumers of the
same year, make, and model as Plaintiff’s vehicle.  (Yashar Decl. ¶ 5.)  Defendant provided responses on December 4,
2023, which Plaintiff deemed insufficient.  (Yashar Decl. ¶ 6; Exhibit 2.)  After meeting
and conferring with Defendant, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further
responses on January 12, 2024.  (Yashar
Decl. ¶¶ 7-9; Exhibits 3-4.)  Plaintiff
also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,004.15 against Defendant
and Erskine Law Group, PC. 
MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
On
receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response
to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1)
a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation
of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an
objection to the response is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)-(3).)
 A motion brought pursuant to CCP §
2031.310 “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)  
“The
court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance with
a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.320, subd. (d).) A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions.  (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.)
Plaintiff
seeks further responses to RFP Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 34, and 35.
RFP
No. 13 requests all documents identifying Defendant’s repurchases of other vehicles
of the same make and model that contained the same alleged defects.  RFP No. 14 requests all documents related to similar
complaints about defects by owners of those vehicles, and RFP No. 16 requests all
documents showing the number of owners with complaints.  RFP No. 15 requests all documents in which owners
of similar vehicles reported the same defects. 
Defendant asserted only objections to such discovery. 
RFP
Nos. 34 and 35 request all documents related to technical service bulletins and
recalls issued for the same vehicle.  For
RFP No. 34, although interposing objections, Defendant agreed to produce “a
list of technical service bulletins (‘TSBs’) and information service bulletins
(‘ISBs’) for vehicles of the same year, make and mode as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.  After it has produced a list of TSBs and ISBs,
GM will—at Plaintiff’s request—search for and produce, if located, copies of a
reasonable number of TSBs and ISBs, if any, that Plaintiff has identified as
relevant to the conditions alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint.”  As to RFP No. 35, besides asserting
objections, Defendant stated “that the SUBJECT VEHICLE has no current record of
required field actions, including recalls, as shown in the image below from the
Global Warranty History Report.” 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff shown good cause to compel further responses. Counsel
declares that the discovery at issue is necessary for Plaintiff’s preparation
in this matter and the discovery is needed “[i]n order to best serve the
Plaintiff and inquire information about the defects of the subject vehicle.”
(Yashar Decl. ¶¶ 9-10.) The information sought pursuant to Plaintiff’s request
for production of documents is relevant because each request relates to the
allegedly defective vehicle purchased by Plaintiff. 
The
Court notes that Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents are not verified.  (Yashar
Decl. ¶ 6; Exhibit 2.)  “Unsworn
responses are tantamount to no responses at all.”  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Given that the motion is unopposed, however, Defendant
has conceded to the motion. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) Also, the Court finds that granting the motion despite
the procedural irregularity will not result in any prejudice to Defendant. 
Counsel
states that her hourly rate is $425.00 per hour, and she spent two (2) hours
drafting the instant motion, anticipates spending one (1) hour reviewing the
opposition and drafting a reply, and anticipates spending 1.5 hours preparing
for and attending the hearing on the motion. (Yashar Decl., ¶ 14.) Counsel
states that in all her attorney fees will total $1,912.50. (Yashar Decl., ¶
14.) Plaintiff incurred a filing fee of $61.65 in filing the instant motion and
counsel anticipates the cost of $30.00 to e-file the motion and reply fee for a
total sum of $91.95. (Yashar Decl., ¶ 15.) In sum, Plaintiff seeks total monetary
sanctions of $2,004.15 against Defendant and Erskine Law Group, PC. (Yashar
Decl., ¶ 15.) 
The
Court exercises its discretion and awards Plaintiff reasonable monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00 given the straightforward nature of the
motion and the lack of opposition to the motion. Such amount includes the
$61.65 filing fee incurred by Plaintiff.  
The
Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to RFPs
No. 13, 14, 15, 16, 34, and 35. Defendant is ORDERED to provide verified,
complete, and code-compliant responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s RFPs
No. 13, 14, 15, 16, 34, and 35 within 30 days of the date of this order. Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record is
GRANTED IN PART. Defendant and Defendant’s counsel, Erskine Law Group, PC are
ordered to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,000.00,
jointly and severally, within 30 days of the date of this order. 
 
CONCLUSION
Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED as set forth above. 

The
request for sanctions is GRANTED IN PART as set forth above.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
