MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
            On May 10, 2023, Plaintiff served Special Interrogatories
(Set One) on Defendant Community Care Rehab Center, LLC via electronic service.
(Joint Discovery Dispute Statement 2:1-2.) Plaintiff contends on June 8, 2023,
defense counsel requested and was granted a two-week extension of time to
respond to the discovery, making them due June 26, 2023. (Id. at 2:2-4.)
Plaintiff received unverified, deficient responses on June 19, 2023. (Id.
at 2:4-5.) Plaintiff further contends her counsel sent a meet and confer letter
and email to defense counsel on June 20, 2023. (Id. at 2:6-26.) The
parties met and conferred on June 23, 2023 via telephone, wherein Plaintiff
contends defense agreed to provide verified supplemental responses to Special
Interrogatory Nos. 1-4, 8, 13-16, 18-31, 35-42, 45, 46, and 49 no later than
July 28, 2023, which would include the contact information for all responsive
current and former employees. (Id. at 2:27-28; 3:1-2.) Plaintiff further
asserts with respect to Special Interrogatory Nos. 32, 33, and 34, Defendant
Community’s response was limited to responsive individuals who provided care to
Plaintiff, however, defense advised he would consider providing a further
response to the full scope of the inquiry as asked but would not agree to do so
at the time of the conference. (Id. at 3:3-6.) Moreover, Plaintiff
asserts with respect to Special Interrogatory Nos. 47-48, defense confirmed
that Defendant Community would stand on the objections and the parties
confirmed an impasse as to these inquiries. (Id. at 3:6-8.) Plaintiff
received Defendant Community’s supplemental responses on July 28, 2023, which
did not include the contact information for current employees. (Id. at
3:11-13.) Plaintiff contends her counsel attempted to meet and confer on August
1, 2023 and an impasse was confirmed with respect to Defendant Community’s
refusal to agree to Plaintiff’s third party letter process. (Id. at
3:15-19.) Plaintiff also argues her counsel pursuant to Department 48 rules,
provided defense with the Joint Discovery Dispute Statement, exhibits, and
declarations for their portion of the statement on August 21, 2023 and
requested Defendant Community’s portion by August 28, 2023. (Id. at
3:20-23.) Plaintiff asserts as of the filing of this motion, defense has failed
to provide their portion of this Joint Discovery Dispute Statement. (Id.
at 4:7-9; Garcia Decl., ¶ 18.)
            Defendant Community Care Rehab Center, LLC provided
unverified, insufficient responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 15-16, 25, 27,
32-34, and 46-48. 
A
party may move to compel a further response to interrogatories if the demanding
party deems an answer to be evasive or incomplete, if an exercise of the option
to produce documents is unwarranted or inadequate, or if objection is without
merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.300, subd. (a).)  The court shall
impose a monetary sanction against any party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
Defendant
Community contends Plaintiff only filed the Notice of Motion and Separate
Statement, which are not a Motion to Compel. Furthermore, Defendant Community
argues Plaintiff does not have a compelling reason for needing the personal
information of every resident of the facility because information on the
operation of the facility is not relevant to this matter. Defendant Community
also argues Plaintiff does not address how every resident in the facility would
have knowledge of any care or treatment she received, so the likelihood that
any information could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence from every
resident at the facility is none. Moreover, Defendant Community contends the
resident have an expectation of privacy in this matter and have no notice of
the proceedings in which their information is being requested. Defendant
Community further asserts disclosure of patients identities violate the
physician-patient privilege, HIPAA, and CMIA since their identities are only
located within each individual resident’s medical record. Additionally,
Defendant Community contends Plaintiff’s requests are not reasonably
calculated, vague, ambiguous, overbroad, and unduly burdensome because
Plaintiff requests information of every person employed as a Nursing Aide,
Registered Nurse, and Vocational Nurse at the facility during the time
Plaintiff was a resident of the facility. Defendant Community argues it
responded to this request by providing everyone employed at the facility that
had any contact with Plaintiff, but Plaintiff’s counsel did not believe this
was responsive. Defendant Community further asserts the names and contact
information requested for every individual who provided services to the
facility is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence, too broad, and meant to increase cost and time. Lastly, Defendant
Community argues Plaintiff’s requests are unintelligible. Defendant Community
also contends Plaintiff never requested sanctions in her Notice of Motion or
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) but
rather in Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration. 
Defendant
Community’s supplemental responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 15-16, 25, 27
are insufficient and evasive. Defendant Community does not specify whether the individuals
listed in supplemental response to Special Interrogatory No. 13 actually
notified Plaintiff’s physician when a decubitus ulcer on the sacrococcyx was
first noticed, Plaintiff clarified the meaning of Special Interrogatory No. 15,
and Special Interrogatory Nos. 25 and 27 are not ambiguous or unduly
burdensome. 
Defendant
Community’s supplemental responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 32-34, and
46-48 are sufficient and substantive. Plaintiff has not shown that it cannot
obtain information concerning the understaffing from the individuals who
provided treatment and care to Plaintiff during her residency at the facility.
Defendant Community, however, has shown these requests are overbroad and unduly
burdensome. Defendant Community has also responded “If requesting party cannot
discern the signature and identity of an individual who made an entry in
Plaintiff’s medical records, counsel for Responding Party will respond to a
letter request for the name of the individual who made that entry.”
Accordingly,
the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories (set one) is GRANTED
IN PART as to special interrogatory Nos. 15, 16, 25, and 27, and DENIED IN PART
as to special interrogatory Nos. 32, 33, 34, 46, 47, and 48. Defendant
Community Care Rehab  Center is ordered
to provide further responses within 10 days of this order.
SANCTIONS
            Plaintiff’s counsel requests monetary sanctions in the
amount of $4,110.00 for (1) 2.0hours of paralegal time spent on preparing draft
of this motion, separate statement, and supporting declaration at a billing
rate of $150.00 per hour; (2) 1.0 hour preparing and finalizing these papers; (3)
2.0 hours considering the opposition, researching and preparing a reply, and
attending the hearing on this motion for a billing rate of $1000.00 per hour;
(4) $750.00 for a court reporter; and (5) $60.00 filing fee. 
            Furthermore, no reply brief was filed in response to the
opposition. Moreover, the billing rate of $1000.00 per hour is excessive.
Additionally, the parties met and conferred on this matter in good faith before
the filing of this motion to resolve the remaining discovery issues. Also,
Plaintiff did not formally request monetary sanctions in the Notice of Motion
nor in a Memorandum of Points and Authorities Lastly, Plaintiff was only
partially successful on this motion. 
            Accordingly, the request for monetary sanctions is
DENIED. 
Moving
party to give notice.
