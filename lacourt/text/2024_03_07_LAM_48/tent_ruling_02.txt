On September 20, 2022,
Plaintiff Mocha Holdings LLC filed this action against Defendant AD.Com
Interactive Media, Inc., for (1) breach of contract and (2) quantum meruit. 
On
May 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel further responses to request
for admissions (set one), form interrogatories (set one), special
interrogatories (set one), and demand for inspection (set one). Plaintiff
separately filed a motion to impose monetary sanctions. On December 14, 2023,
Defendant filed an opposition. On February 23, 2024, Defendant filed a
supplemental opposition. The reply was due on February 29, 2024, none has been
filed.
As
a preliminary matter, the Court notes Plaintiff improperly filed several
motions to compel further discovery in one singular motion as opposed to
separate motions to compel further discovery. Furthermore, Defendant’s
opposition raises issues concerning whether Plaintiff has formal representation
in this case and their inability to successfully meet and confer with purported
new counsel for Plaintiff. Moreover, the Court’s record does not indicate that
a new counsel has appeared in this matter for Plaintiff. Therefore, it is
unclear whether Plaintiff is still unpresented as a business entity and these
motions are moot given the representations of Defendant that supplemental
responses were produced to the purported new counsel for Plaintiff. 
Accordingly,
the motion for ______ is CONTINUED to ____________________ _____, 2024 to
confirm appearance of new counsel for Plaintiff and whether these discovery
issues are moot.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit.  If all parties in the case submit on the
tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are required unless a
companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference) is also on
calendar.
