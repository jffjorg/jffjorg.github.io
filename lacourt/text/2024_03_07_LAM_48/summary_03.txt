And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Thomas D. Long in the case of Tracyne Restrepo, by and through her Successor in Interest, Catalina Szetela, versus Sun Mar Management Services, et al. The case is related to elder abuse and negligence.

The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories (set one), which was opposed by the Defendant Community Care Rehab Center, LLC. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant's responses were unverified, deficient, and insufficient, and that the Defendant has failed to provide certain information, such as the contact information for current employees.

The Judge grants the motion in part, ordering the Defendant to provide further responses to certain special interrogatories, including Nos. 15, 16, 25, and 27. However, the Judge denies the motion in part, finding that the Plaintiff's requests for information are overbroad and unduly burdensome.

The Plaintiff had requested monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,110.00, but the Judge denies this request, finding that the Plaintiff was only partially successful on the motion and that the parties had met and conferred in good faith before the filing of the motion.
