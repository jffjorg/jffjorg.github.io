And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to vacate a dismissal and enter judgment in a case between Roswell Properties, LLC, LTD (Plaintiff) and Deals 4 All Seasons, Inc., Shiri Taylor Dangor (Defendants). The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants failed to make timely payments under a Settlement Agreement and is seeking entry of judgment. The judge notes that the Settlement Agreement provides for periodic payments and that the Defendants are in default. However, the judge cannot enter the proposed judgment because the moving papers fail to provide admissible evidence of the remaining balance due and of the partial payments made before this motion was filed. Therefore, the judge tentatively continues the hearing to allow the Plaintiff to supply additional evidence and to give adequate notice to the Defendants of the continued hearing.
