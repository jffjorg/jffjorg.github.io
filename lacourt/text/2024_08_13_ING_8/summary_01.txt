And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Doe's motion to quash or modify the deposition subpoena issued by Defendant Mark J. Rispler, M.D. The subpoena seeks medical records and documents related to Plaintiff's treatment with Brandy Stewart, MSW, after an alleged incident involving Dr. Rispler's inappropriate use of a vaginal ultrasound wand during a medical appointment.

The court finds that the subpoena is relevant to the case and necessary for discovery, and that Plaintiff's privacy rights have been waived to the extent that they relate to the medical conditions she has put in issue in this case. The court notes that Plaintiff has placed her therapeutic visits with Ms. Stewart "at issue" in this case by answering interrogatories and deposition questions that identified Ms. Stewart as a health care professional from whom Plaintiff sought treatment after the incident.

The court will entertain oral argument from Plaintiff as to any specific scope limitations she would like to have the court consider, but ultimately denies the motion to quash or modify the subpoena.
