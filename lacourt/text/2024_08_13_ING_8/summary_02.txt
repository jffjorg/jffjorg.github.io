Summary:

The Judge is considering a Motion to Sever the individual Plaintiffs' claims into separate actions. The Plaintiffs allege childhood sexual assault by Garry Poe, a former employee of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, and the District argues that the allegations lack sufficient commonality for permissive joinder of Plaintiffs under Code of Civil Procedure section 378. The Judge is leaning towards denial of the Motion without prejudice, pending the presentation of more evidence and offers of proof. The Court will hear argument on whether the cases should be kept together for discovery and trial preparation, but bifurcated as to liability and damages issues.
