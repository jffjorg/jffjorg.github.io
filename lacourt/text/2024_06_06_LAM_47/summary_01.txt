The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to the Defendant's motion to strike portions of the Complaint. The Defendant, Caesarstone LTD, is seeking to strike paragraphs 380, 396, and 481 of the Complaint, which relate to punitive damages. The Defendant argues that the Complaint does not adequately allege a basis for punitive damages. The Judge rules that the Defendant's motion to strike is GRANTED without leave to amend as to "other stone products to be identified during the course of discovery" and otherwise DENIED. The Judge also rules that the Plaintiffs are entitled to seek punitive damages. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a claim for fraudulent concealment against the Defendant.
