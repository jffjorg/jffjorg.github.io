Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer of Defendant Priority Property Group Inc. to the First and Second Causes of Action of the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. This means that the Plaintiffs' claims for wrongful death and survival are dismissed.

The Judge found that the Plaintiffs' pleading failed to allege facts describing what the unsafe and dangerous condition was, or any facts connecting the alleged negligent driving to any duty Priority Property Group Inc. owed to the Plaintiffs or the decedent. The Judge also found that the Plaintiffs' lack of opposition to the demurrer was a tacit admission that Priority Property Group Inc.'s arguments were meritorious.

The Judge ordered Priority Property Group Inc. to submit a proposed order of dismissal for the Court's review and signature, and to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days.
