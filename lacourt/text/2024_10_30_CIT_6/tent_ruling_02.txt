 Case Number:  23PSCV03140    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Manuel  Valdez, et al. v. Chedraui USA, Inc., dba El Super, et al.  Defendant  Priority Property Group Inc.’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer of Defendant Priority Property  Group Inc. to the First and Second Causes of Action of Plaintiffs’ First  Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The Court directs Priority Property  Group Inc. to submit a proposed order of dismissal for the Court’s review and  signature.  Priority Property Group Inc. is ordered to give notice of the  Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a wrongful death case. On October 10, 2023, plaintiffs  Manuel Valdez, Chelsea Valdez-Gutierrez, Manuel Alexander Valdez, Daisy Valdez,  Yvette Gutierrez Valdez, Maria Gutierrez, Estate of Rosalva Valdez, by and through  its administrator, Manuel Valdez (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this action.  On September 9, 2024, after the Court sustained a demurrer to the complaint, Plaintiffs  filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC) against defendants Chedraui  USA, Inc., dba El Super, HB Property Management, Inc., Priority Property Group  Inc. (Priority), Oscar Gonzalez, George Gonzalez, and Does 1 through 50,  alleging causes of action for wrongful death (negligence) and survival.  On March 1, 2024, Defendant Chedraui USA, Inc., dba El Super (El  Super) filed a cross-complaint. On September 11, 2024, after the Court  sustained in part a demurrer to the cross-complaint, El Super filed its  operative First Amended Cross-Complaint against cross-defendants Oscar  Gonzalez, George Gonzalez, Covina Marketplace, LLC, Priority Property Group  Inc., and Roes 4 through 20, alleging causes of action for express indemnity, equitable indemnity, comparative indemnity, and declaratory relief. On May 29, 2024, defendant Covina Marketplace, LLC (Covina  Marketplace) filed a cross-complaint. On August 9, 2024, Covina Marketplace  filed its operative First Amended Cross-Complaint against El Super, Oscar  Gonzalez, George Gonzalez, and Roes 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for  express written indemnity, full or partial equitable indemnification,  declaratory relief, and apportionment.  On October 1, 2024, Priority[1] demurred to the FAC. On October 22, 2024, El Super joined Priority’s demurrer.  The demurrer is unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD  A demurrer is  a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It  raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing  party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., §  422.10; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,  994.) It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of  the complaint; and for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in  the complaint are assumed to be true. (Id., at pp. 993-994.)  A  demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially  noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,  supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be  considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,  881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting  demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].)  A  demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete  or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.  v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of  the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are  incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.  Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s  Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as  surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”])  A  demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire pleading, cause of  action, or affirmative defense. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd.  (a); Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong  v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency  (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046-1047.)  PRELIMINARY ISSUE              For  a notice of joinder to be effective, it must be timely, establish the necessary  factual foundation to support the motion, and request affirmative relief on  behalf of the joining party. (Barak v. The Quisenberry L.  Firm (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 654, 661; Commonwealth Energy Corp. v. Inv. Data Exch., Inc.  (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 26, 31, fn. 3; Frazee v. Seely  (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 627, 636-637.) El Super’s  joinder to the demurrer is untimely, as it was filed on October 22, 2024, i.e.,  three weeks after Priority demurred to the FAC and well after the demurrer  deadline. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) Therefore, the Court declines  to consider El Super’s joinder.  DISCUSSION  Meet and  Confer              Per Code of  Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), Priority was required to meet  and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference before bringing this  demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court finds Priority’s  efforts to meet and confer sufficient. (Motooka Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)              First Cause of Action – Wrongful  Death              To  state a cause of action for wrongful death, the plaintiff must allege facts  demonstrating a wrongful act or neglect on the part of one or more persons that  caused the death of another person. (Musgrove  v. Silver (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 694, 705.)              Priority demurs to the First Cause of Action of the FAC for  wrongful death on the grounds that it fails to state a claim and is uncertain. Priority  contends the new allegations in the FAC still do not allege facts describing  what the unsafe and dangerous condition was, or any facts to support a causal  connection between the alleged negligent driving and any duty or act on the  part of Priority to prevent such negligent driving. Priority also contends that  the FAC is vague and ambiguous as to prior notice. Priority contends that  Plaintiffs allege they are the husband, daughters, son, and mother of decedent  Rosalva Valdez (Decedent), and that it is unclear whether Priority failed to  warn Plaintiffs or the Decedent. Priority further contends that because the FAC  does not allege any facts defining what the dangerous condition was, it is  unclear what warning was supposed to be given that would have prevented Oscar  Gonzalez’s negligent driving.              The Court agrees with Priority that  the FAC still fails to allege facts describing what the unsafe and dangerous  condition was or any facts connecting the alleged negligent driving to any duty  Priority owed to Plaintiffs or the Decedent. (FAC, ¶¶ 18-19.) The FAC is  otherwise devoid of allegations demonstrating Priority owed a duty to  Plaintiffs or the Decedent. The Court further construes Plaintiff’s lack of  opposition as a tacit admission that Priority’s arguments are meritorious. (Sexton  v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; C. Opposing the Motion—and  Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C,  ¶ 9:105.10; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.  Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived  when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to  authority. [Citation.]”])              Additionally,  Plaintiffs have not proffered any facts that could correct these pleading  defects. Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the First Cause of Action in  Plaintiffs’ FAC without leave to amend.            Second Cause  of Action – Survival  Unlike a cause of action for wrongful death, a  survivor cause of action is not a new cause of action that vests in the heirs  on the death of the decedent. It is instead a separate and distinct cause of action  which belonged to the decedent before death but, by statute, survives that  event. (Grant  v. McAuliffe, supra, 41 Cal.2d at p. 864, 264 P.2d 944.) The  survival statutes do not create a cause of action. Rather, “[t]hey merely  prevent the abatement of the cause of action of the injured person, and provide  for its enforcement by or against the personal representative of the deceased.”  (Ibid.)  (Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Ctr. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1264-1265 (Quiroz),  italics in original.)  A cause of action that survives the death of a person  passes to the decedent's successor in interest and is enforceable by the  “decedent's personal representative or, if none, by the decedent's successor in  interest.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.30.) In the typical survivor action, the  damages recoverable by a personal representative or successor in interest on a  decedent's cause of action are limited by statute to “the loss or damage that  the decedent sustained or incurred before death, including any penalties or  punitive or exemplary damages that the decedent would have been entitled to  recover had the decedent lived, and do not include damages for pain, suffering, or  disfigurement,” unless the action was filed on or after January 1, 2022, and  before January 1, 2026. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.34(a), (b), italics  added.)              Priority  demurs to the Second Cause of Action of the FAC for survival on the grounds  that it fails to state a claim and is uncertain. Priority’s arguments here are  the same as those above with respect to the First Cause of Action, so the Court  will not restate them here. The Court finds the same issues apply here, namely  that the FAC does not allege facts describing what the unsafe and dangerous  condition at the subject property was, or what Priority did or did not do which  lead to the allegedly unsafe and dangerous condition. (FAC, ¶¶ 18-19.)  The  Court further construes Plaintiffs’ lack of opposition to this demurrer as a  tacit admission that Priority’s arguments are meritorious. (Sexton  v. Superior Court, supra, 58 Cal.App.4th at p. 1410; C. Opposing the  Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial  Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.  Colombo, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at p. 1215.)  Additionally,  Plaintiffs have not proffered any facts that could correct these pleading  defects. Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the  Second Cause of Action in Plaintiffs’ FAC without leave to amend.         CONCLUSION  The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer of Defendant Priority Property  Group Inc. to the First and Second Causes of Action of Plaintiffs’ First  Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The Court directs Priority Property  Group Inc. to submit a proposed order of dismissal for the Court’s review and  signature.  Priority Property Group Inc. is ordered to give notice of the  Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
