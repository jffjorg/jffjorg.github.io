And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the petition to compel David Ohana to join the arbitration action between Shimon Ben-Shushan and M&D Development & Construction, Inc. as the alter ego of M&D. The Judge found that Petitioner lacks proof that Respondent is the alter ego of M&D and that Respondent did not sign the arbitration agreement in his individual capacity. The Judge applied the alter ego doctrine and held that the doctrine would only be invoked if there is a unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner, and an inequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation alone. The Judge noted that Petitioner relied on the declaration of his counsel, Christopher L. Mass, which acknowledged that Petitioner lacks proof that Respondent is the alter ego of M&D, but stated that Petitioner will make such a showing at trial. The Judge also cited Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2, which applies when a party is engaged in arbitration with a corporation and seeks to hold another party liable for the same transaction. The Judge held that Section 1281.2 does not give the Court the power to require Respondent to arbitrate when he did not agree to do so.
