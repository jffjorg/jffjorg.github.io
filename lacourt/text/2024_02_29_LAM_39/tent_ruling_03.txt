Case No.
23STCV18363
Motion to Strike
 
            Plaintiffs
filed this habitability case against Defendants Michael Lutomski (“Defendant Lutomski”)
and Legit Painting, Inc. (“Defendant LP”) (collectively, “Defendants”).  Defendant Lutomski now moves to strike the
prayer for punitive damages and all related allegations.  
 
Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a motion to strike the whole
pleading or any part thereof.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).)  On a motion to strike, the court may: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading;
or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the
court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd.
(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42
Cal.2d 767, 782. 
 
In ruling on a motion to strike
punitive damages, “judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to
strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth.”  (Clauson
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)  To state a prima facie claim for punitive
damages, a plaintiff must allege the elements set forth in the punitive damages
statute, Civil Code section 3294.  (Coll. Hosp., Inc. v. Superior Court (1994)
8 Cal.4th 704, 721.)  Per Civil Code
section 3294, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud or malice.  (Civ. Code,
§ 3294, subd. (a).)  “Malice is defined
in the statute as conduct intended by the defendant to cause injury to the
plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a
willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”  (Coll.
Hosp., Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 725.)  “The mere allegation an intentional tort was
committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages.  Not only must there be circumstances of
oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to
support such a claim.”  (Grieves v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157
Cal.App.3d 159, 166, internal citations and footnotes omitted.)
 
Plaintiff alleges as follows:  Defendant Lutomski purchased the property on
or about July 26, 2017.  (Complaint, ¶
20.)  Over two years later, in or about
November 2022, the Los Angeles Housing Department issued a Notice of SCEP
inspection for the property.  (Id., ¶
22.)  Then, on or about January 25, 2023,
the Housing Department issued a Notice and Order to Comply for a series of
violations.  (Id., ¶ 23.)  One of the plaintiffs gave Defendant Lutomski
the names of several licensed and bonded painters to address the issues.  (Id., ¶ 25.) 
Defendant Lutomski ignored her and instead hired Defendant Legit
Painting.  (Id., ¶ 25.)  Defendant Lutomski did not timely address
most of the violations, as they began work on or about March 1, 2023.  (Id., ¶ 28.) 
Legit Painting caused a fire at the property.  (Id., ¶¶ 28-32.)  As a result, the ceilings in Plaintiffs’
units collapsed or were compromised as a result of the fire and/or water from
extinguishing the fires.  (Id., ¶¶
33-34.)  Defendant Lutomski “failed to
adequately secure the Property to protect Plaintiffs’ belongings.”  (Id., ¶ 40.) 
Defendant Lutomski evicted Plaintiffs because “the repairs would take
too long” and did not offer to pay relocation fees.  (Id., ¶¶ 42-43.)  Plaintiffs allege that “Defendant Lutomski’s
refusal to pay Plaintiffs their relocation fees and his forceful termination of
their tenancies was unlawful.”  (Id., ¶
43.)  These allegations do not evidence
malice, oppression, fraud, or recklessness. 

 
Plaintiffs’ counsel argues that
there is malice because Defendant Lutomski “allow[ed] his agents to use direct
flames on the surface of the Property.” 
Plaintiff’s counsel also argues that Defendant Lutomski failed to repair
the uninhabitable conditions for long periods of time and failed to secure the
property.  These allegations sound in
negligence.  Finally, Plaintiff’s counsel
argues that Defendant Lutomski terminated Plaintiffs’ tenancy without engaging
the Los Angeles Housing Department.  Without
more, this is not sufficient to establish a claim for punitive damages.  Otherwise, every violation of law would
support a claim of punitive damages.
