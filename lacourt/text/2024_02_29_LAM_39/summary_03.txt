And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Lutomski's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and all related allegations. The judge has found that the allegations made by the Plaintiff do not evidence malice, oppression, fraud, or recklessness. The judge has also denied the Plaintiff's request to amend their complaint, as the Plaintiff's counsel has not identified any additional facts that would correct the deficiencies. The judge has set a schedule for the case, including a final status conference and trial dates. The parties are required to comply with all pretrial procedures for Department #39 and to provide notice of their intention to call witnesses and produce exhibits.
