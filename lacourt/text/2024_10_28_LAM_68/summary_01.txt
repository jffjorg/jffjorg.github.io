And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a plaintiff who purchased a 2022 Honda HR-V vehicle with unspecified defects. The plaintiff filed a complaint for breach of express and implied warranty, and the defendant opposed the complaint. The plaintiff then filed a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, which the defendant opposed.

The court has granted the motion, subject to agreed upon production and further refinement for certain items. The court has also directed the parties to further meet and confer to establish a scope of applicable parts or system issues. The court has not imposed sanctions at this time, given the nature of the dispute and the lack of any actual deposition non-appearance and incurrence of costs.

The court's ruling is based on established practice standards and case law, including the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The court has considered the defendant's challenges to the discovery requests, including the contention that the requests are overbroad, and has ruled that the plaintiff is entitled to conduct discovery on systemic issues specifically present in the subject vehicle. The court has also noted that the defendant's failure to establish applicability of the information relative to available statutory relief will not lead to the court making qualitative determinations on the validity of sought-after information on the actual alleged defect(s) plaguing the vehicle.
