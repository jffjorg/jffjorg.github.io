(Moore v. Regents of University of California (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 216)

```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Visual Edge's motion for summary judgment or adjudication as to the second, third, and ninth causes of action for failure to accommodate, failure to engage in the interactive process, and wrongful termination. The ruling denies the motion as to the first cause of action for discrimination. The judge finds that there are no triable issues as to whether Plaintiff was laid off for discriminatory animus and that Plaintiff's claims do not arise from her layoff in April 2020, but from the failure to recall her at some later point. The judge also finds that Defendant is entitled to summary adjudication of Plaintiff's claims for failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process.
