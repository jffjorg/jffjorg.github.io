And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Plaintiff Susan C. Morinaga's motion to vacate the order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants City of Torrance and Torrance School District. The motion was based on alleged attorney error and excusable neglect due to Plaintiff's illness with COVID-19. However, the court found that Plaintiff's illness did not prevent her from responding to the motion for summary judgment, and that her failure to provide timely discovery responses was the result of inexcusable neglect and a consistent pattern of dilatory response to the litigation. The court also found that Plaintiff's claims of abandonment by her former counsel were unfounded, and that the counsel who specially appeared for her at the summary judgment hearing did not abandon her.
