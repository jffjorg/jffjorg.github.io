The court has found that the Plaintiff has not established probable validity of the claim, as the Plaintiff's breach of contract was material and excused Defendant's obligation to pay the remaining balance. The court has denied the application for a writ of attachment and ordered Plaintiff's counsel to provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
