And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Texmark Land, Inc.'s (Plaintiff) application for a writ of attachment against Eloges, Inc. (Defendant) in the amount of $48,953.70. The court found that Plaintiff has satisfied all statutory requirements, including establishing the probable validity of its claim for breach of contract. Defendant argued that 12 of the 13 invoices are defective, that the claim is not fixed or readily ascertainable, and that an attachment order would cause irreparable harm. The court rejected these arguments, finding that the discrepancies in the invoices are minor and do not defeat Plaintiff's claim. The court also found that the damages are readily ascertainable by reference to the contracts at issue. Finally, the court ordered Plaintiff to post an undertaking of $10,000 and to provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
