[TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING
 THE PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
      Petitioner, Valeria Citlalli Leyva, a minor, by and through her
 mother, Gabriela C. Huitzil, filed this Petition for an Order for
Change of Name to Valeria Citlalli Barrera.  
      The Court first heard this petition on October 24, 2023, and
continued it to December 7, 2023, since Petitioner did not comply with the
requirements for publication of the order to show cause and only one parent
consented to the name change. Petitioner was ordered to serve the other parent
with the Order to Show Cause at least 30 days before the continued hearing
date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1277(a)(4).) The hearing was again continued to this
date for Petitioner to comply with the Court’s order. As Petitioner has not
complied with the Court’s October 24, 2023 order, the Petition is DENIED.
