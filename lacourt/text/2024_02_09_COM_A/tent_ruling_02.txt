[TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING
 THE PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
Petitioner, Aurmani
 Jerrel, by and through his mother, Dominique Oliver, filed this
Petition to change Petitioner’s name to
 Aurmani Oliver as mother named the child after the wrong person. 
            The Court first
heard this matter on October 26, 2023, and continued it to December 5, 2023, to
permit Petitioner to comply with the requirements for publication and to serve
the other parent with the Order to Show Cause at least 30 days before the
hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1277(a)(4).) The Court continued the hearing again
to permit additional time to comply with the Court’s order.
            The Court’s file
does not reflect that Petitioner complied with the Court’s October 26, 2023,
order. Accordingly, the petition is DENIED.
