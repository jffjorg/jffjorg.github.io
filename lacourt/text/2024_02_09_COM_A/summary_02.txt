And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied a petition to change the name of Aurmani Jerrel, a minor, from Aurmani Jerrel to Aurmani Oliver. The petition was filed by the minor's mother, Dominique Oliver, after the minor was given the name Aurmani after the wrong person. The court had previously ordered the petitioner to comply with certain requirements, including publication and service of an Order to Show Cause, but the court's file does not reflect that these requirements were met. As a result, the petition is denied.
