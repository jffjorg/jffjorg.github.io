Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for determination of good faith settlement and the motion to seal documents. The motion for determination of good faith settlement is granted because the settlement amount is reasonable and the settling parties have provided sufficient evidence to support their proportionate liability. The judge finds that the settlement is not grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person would estimate the settlor's liability to be. The motion to seal documents is granted because the parties have agreed to seal the settlement amount and there is no overriding public interest in the settlement amount. The judge finds that the parties' willingness to settle and their interest in maintaining the settlement's confidentiality can only be served by the very limited redactions of the papers.
