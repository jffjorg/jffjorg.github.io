Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's decision on the discovery motions. The plaintiff alleged that new facts and circumstances warrant modification, amendment, or revocation of the present discovery order. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the new facts or circumstances warrant such modification. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not explained why the information that is now being sought was not produced at an earlier time. The court further finds that the plaintiff's evidence does not support that the dashboard data is reliable and/or accurate and that the plaintiff's CFO has admitted as much in his declaration.
