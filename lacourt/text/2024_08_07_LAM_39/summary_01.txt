The Judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Paligroup Management, LLC (Defendant) to set aside a default and default judgment taken against it. The default and default judgment were entered in favor of Assignee Asset Liquidation Group (Plaintiff), the assignee of Rusty Rendon (Plaintiff), who opposes the motion. Paligroup Management, LLC claims it was served with process by Silvia Zamora, a hotel manager, who mistakenly forwarded the process to its Human Resources Department. However, the Judge finds that the declaration of Jorgan von Stiening, Paligroup Management, LLC's president, lacks evidentiary support and is therefore inadmissible. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice, and Paligroup Management, LLC is required to give notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
