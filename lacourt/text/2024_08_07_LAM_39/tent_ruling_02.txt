Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment




MOVING PARTY

OPPOSING PARTY


Assignee Asset Liquidation Group



 
MOTION
            Defendant
Paligroup Management, LLC (“Defendant”) moves to set aside the default and
default judgment taken against it in this action.  Asset Liquidation Group, the assignee of
Plaintiff Rusty Rendon (“Plaintiff”), opposes the motion.  
ANALYSIS
Defendant bases its motion on Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).  Pursuant
to that provision, a court may “relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”  The party must seek
such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after
the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b).)
Defendant bases this motion on the
declaration of Jorgan von Stiening (“Stiening”), who is its president.  Stiening states Plaintiff served Defendant by
delivering the complaint on a hotel manager, Silvia Zamora (“Zamora”), and Zamora
mistakenly forwarded the process to Defendant’s Human Resources Department.  (Declaration of Jorgan von Stiening, ¶5.)  However, Stiening has provided no foundation establishing
he has personal knowledge of the service of process on Zamora and what Zamora
did with the process she received.  As
such, his testimony is inadmissible.  (Evid.
Code, § 702.)  Accordingly, the motion is
denied without prejudice as it lacks evidentiary support.  
Defendant is to
give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
