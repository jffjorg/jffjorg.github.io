And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default and default judgment taken against Paligroup Management, LLC. The defendant claims that it was served with the complaint via a hotel manager, Silvia Zamora, who mistakenly forwarded the process to the defendant's Human Resources Department. However, the President of Paligroup Management, LLC, Jorgan von Stiening, provides no foundation for his testimony, which is thus inadmissible. The Judge denies the motion without prejudice, meaning that the defendant can re-file the motion with additional evidence. The defendant is required to provide notice of this order and proof of service.
