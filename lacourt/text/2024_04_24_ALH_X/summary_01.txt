The judge ruled that the demurrers filed by Comprehensive Care Providers Corporation and Pallickal, Mallik, Ponnezhan Medical Corporation were overruled. The judge also ruled that the motion to strike filed by Comprehensive Care Providers Corporation was denied.

The judge also ruled that the motion for an order requiring Dr. Mallick to furnish a bond was denied. The judge concluded that there was no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action would benefit the corporation or its shareholders.

The judge noted that the parties had failed to establish the necessary grounds for the motion for an order requiring a bond.
