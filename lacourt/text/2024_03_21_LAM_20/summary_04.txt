And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by a judge regarding a case brought by Plaintiff Jasson Reyes Lopez against multiple defendants, including Jobsource, Inc., Jobsource Holdings, Inc., Jobsource Downey, Farwest Corrosion Control Company, and Reliant Immediate Care Medical Group, Inc. The Plaintiff is seeking leave to file a second amended complaint, which would add Reliant to the eighth cause of action and a claim for FEHA discrimination. The Court previously sustained a demurrer to the eighth cause of action against Reliant, but new case law has changed the landscape. The Court finds that Reliant may be held directly liable as an employer for employment discrimination in violation of FEHA, given the allegations that Reliant intentionally aided Plaintiff's employer in FEHA violations. The motion for leave to amend is thus granted.
