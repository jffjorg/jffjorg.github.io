The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a lemon law case involving Sandy Wormald and Nissan North America, Inc. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to her requests for production, set one, and the motion was initially noticed for January 9, 2024. However, there is no indication that the defendant was made aware of the rescheduling to March 21, 2024. If proof of notice is provided, the court will grant the motion and require the defendant to provide further responses within 30 days. The judge encourages counsel to submit on the tentative ruling, but notes that if they do not, they are strongly encouraged to appear remotely through LACourtConnect due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
