Significant Statements:
- "A terminating sanction is a 'drastic measure which should be employed with caution.'" (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978))
- "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005))
- "Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting from the lack of information." (Midwife v. Bernal (1988))

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing the defendant (YMCA of Hollywood, California) from the complaint. The judge has also scheduled an order to show cause for March 25, 2025, to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed as to the remaining defendant. The judge has denied the request for monetary sanctions, finding that the plaintiff has been litigating the case in propria persona since May 22, 2023, and that monetary sanctions would not be appropriate. The judge has found that the plaintiff has failed to comply with court orders, including serving discovery responses, and has repeatedly chosen not to respond to motions. The judge has determined that terminating sanctions, including striking pleadings or entering default judgment, are warranted in this case.
