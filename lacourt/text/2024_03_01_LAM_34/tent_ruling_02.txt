ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 gives
the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. A court may impose terminating sanctions by
striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering
default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a
discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating
sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's
orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795–796.)
 
A terminating sanction is a "drastic
measure which should be employed with caution." (Deyo, supra,
at p. 793.) 
 
"A decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v.
Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279–280.)
 
While the court has discretion to impose terminating
sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the dereliction and
should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party
entitled to but denied discovery." (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations." (Id.) Discovery sanctions are not to be
imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of
discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See Midwife
v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as
stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971.)
 
"A trial court has broad discretion to
impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions . . . (1) absent unusual circumstances,
there must be a failure to comply with a court order, and (2) the failure must
be willful." (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1327; but see Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1291
["willfulness is no longer a requirement for the imposition of discovery
sanctions."].)
 
II.       Discussion
 
Defendant moves the Court to issue
terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. (Motion, p.
7:23–27.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not complied with the Court’s
Orders and sanctions are warranted. (Id. at pp. 5:1–3, 5:17–19, 7:10.)
 
There is no evidence before the
Court that indicates Plaintiff has served discovery responses or otherwise
complied with the Court’s Minute Order dated October 30, 2023. There is also no
indication that any sanction would result in Plaintiff serving responses to
Defendant’s outstanding discovery requests. Rather, considering that Plaintiff
has repeatedly failed to serve timely responses, has repeatedly chosen not to
respond to motions, and has not even responded to this motion for terminating
sanctions, it appears that Plaintiff has ceased participating in this case. 
 
        The Court GRANTS in part the motion and
ISSUES terminating sanctions. However, given that Plaintiff has been litigating
this matter in propria persona since May 22, 2023, monetary sanctions
would not be appropriate here. The Court DENIES the request for monetary
sanctions. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion for Terminating Sanctions [and] Request for
Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED in part. 
 
Defendant YMCA of Hollywood, California is DISMISSED from the
Complaint. 
 
An order to show cause is scheduled for March 25, 2024 as to
why the Complaint should not be dismissed as to the remaining defendant.
