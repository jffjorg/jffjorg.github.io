Summary in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a Motion to Compel Deposition and to Compel the Production of Documents Pursuant to Notice of Deposition, as well as a Request for Sanctions. The Motion is GRANTED, and James Harden is ordered to make himself available to sit for a deposition within 20 days of the issuance of this Order. The Request for Sanctions is DENIED. The Court finds that the amount of attorney time expended by George Santopietro's counsel was unreasonable and that the Request for Sanctions was made in bad faith. The Court encourages counsel to participate in informal discovery conferences in the future.
