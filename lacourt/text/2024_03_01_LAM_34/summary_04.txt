  - Defendant: YMCA of Hollywood, California (Doe 1)
Significant Statements:
  - "A terminating sanction is a 'drastic measure which should be employed with caution.'"
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
  - "Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions in part. The defendant, YMCA of Hollywood, California, is dismissed from the complaint. The plaintiff, M. R., has failed to comply with discovery orders and has repeatedly failed to serve timely responses. The judge finds that the plaintiff has ceased participating in the case and has not responded to motions. As a result, the judge grants terminating sanctions, dismissing the defendant from the complaint. However, the judge denies the request for monetary sanctions due to the plaintiff's status as a pro se litigant. An order to show cause is scheduled for March 25, 2024, to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed as to the remaining defendant.
