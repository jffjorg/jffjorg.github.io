And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants George Santopietro's motion to compel James Harden to attend a deposition and to produce documents. The judge also denies George Santopietro's request for sanctions, finding that the delays in the case were not caused by James Harden's actions and that George Santopietro's counsel's incivility and excessive billing did not justify a sanction. The judge encourages informal discovery conferences to resolve disputes in the future.
