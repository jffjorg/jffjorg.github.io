MOTION:  


Motion for Attorney’s Fees




MOVING PARTIES:


Plaintiff Qinghua Chen




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant BMW of North America, LLC



 
MOTIONS
            Plaintiff
Qinghua Chen (“Plaintiff”) settled claims against Defendant BMW of North
America, LLC (“Defendant”).  Now, Plaintiff
seeks attorney fees and costs Plaintiff incurred.  Defendant opposes the motion.  
ANALYSIS
The prevailing
party must seek an award of attorney fees by way of a noticed motion and bears
the burden of proof to justify the amount sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(5)(A).)  
In the instant
case, Plaintiff contends Plaintiff’s Counsel (“Counsel”) billed $41,407.50 in
fees.  This lodestar figure is based on
billing at hourly rates of $550, $600, $625, and $650 per hour during the
course of the litigation.  “The
reasonable market value of the attorney's services is the measure of a
reasonable hourly rate.  This standard
applies regardless of whether the attorneys claiming fees charge nothing for
their services, charge at below-market or discounted rates, represent the
client on a straight contingent fee basis, or are in-house counsel.”  (Chacon v. Litke (2010) 181
Cal.App.4th 1234, 1260, internal quotations and citations omitted.)  Based on the Court’s experience in reviewing
requests for attorney fees in similar litigation and the evidence before the
Court, the Court concludes Counsel’s billing rates of  $550 per hour in 2021, $600 in 2022, $625 in
2023, and $650 in 2024 are reasonable rates for attorneys engaged in similar
litigation in the Los Angeles area.  (PCLM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  The Court, therefore, concludes the lodestar amount
of $41,407.50 amply compensates Counsel for work on this case and declines to
award a multiplier.  
In opposition,
Defendant argues the Court should “strike the litigation costs Plaintiff claims
to have incurred after the January 12, 2022, billing entry . . . .”  (Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion, p.
5.)   Defendant filed its motion to compel
arbitration of this matter on January 12, 2022. 
However, Defendant cites no authority as to why Plaintiff is not
entitled to recover attorney fees after Defendant filed that motion.  As such, this argument is unsupported.  Further, even though, as Defendant states, the
case did not present complex or unique issues and did not go to trial, in
reviewing the descriptions of the tasks Counsel performed, the Court notes they
involved communications with Plaintiff and opposing counsel and work related to
the removal and remand of the case, the vehicle’s inspection, attendance at
court hearings (including motion practice concerning the arbitration), the
arbitration process itself, and settlement of the case.  Given the posture of the case, an automatic
fee reduction is not warranted because it appears Counsel’s work was necessary
and reasonable.  (See Civ. Code, § 1794,
subd. (d) [under the Song-Beverly Act, a prevailing party is entitled to
recover costs and expenses, including attorney fees, based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred].)  
Defendant then argues
Counsel billed for “tasks that by their description appear to be administrative
in nature . . . .”  (Opposition to
Plaintiff’s Motion, p. 7.)  The Court
reviewed each of the entries Defendant identified, which include research and
review of court and courtroom rules, preparing and sending notices, communications
with opposing counsel, and involvement in the arbitration process.  The Court concludes these entries do reflect
attorney work, and   Plaintiff is
entitled to recover attorney fees for such work.
Defendant further
contends Counsel’s invoices include substantial block billing and duplicative
entries.  “Block billing occurs when a
block of time is assigned to multiple tasks rather than itemizing the time
spent on each task.”  (Mountjoy v.
Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 279, internal quotations
and citations omitted.)  The invoices at
issue are detailed, and few entries include more than one task.  Where an entry includes more than one task,
those tasks are closely related.  (See,
e.g., Declaration of Nicholas Bravo (attached to Plaintiff’s motion), Exhibit B,
8/3/2021entry[Counsel bills 0.5 hours for communications with Plaintiff covering
several matters, including litigation strategy]; 10/21/2021, 10/29/2021 entries
[same].)  As such, the Court concludes the
entries to which Defendant directed the Court do not include substantial block
billing, which would justify the application of a negative multiplier.  
With respect to
Defendant’s contention the invoices include duplicative entries amounting to
double billing, the Court also reviewed those entries Defendant identified.  Although the two entries for January 4, 2022
appear to be duplicative, the Court cannot conclude the cumulative 0.35 hours of
time spent amounts to duplication and double billing.  (Bravo Decl., Exhibit B, 1/4/2022 entries.) The
same applies to the two entries noted for July 25, 2022.  (Id., Exhibit B, 7/25/2022 entries].)  However, Defendant’s contention concerning the
entries made on January 20, 2022, is well taken because they are duplicative in
the amount of time expended for what appears to be the exact same tasks performed
relating to Counsel’s attendance at a case management conference.  In that respect, there appears to be double
billing.  Therefore, 1.5 hours of Counsel’s
time, amounting to a charge of $900 will be deducted from the amount of attorney
fees Plaintiff seeks.  
The Court,
therefore, grants Plaintiff’s motion and award Plaintiff attorney fees in the
amount of $41,407.50 minus $900, for a total amount of $40,507.50.  Additionally, pursuant to Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d), Plaintiff is entitled through this motion to seek its
costs.  Defendant has not challenged Plaintiff’s
assertion of entitlement to costs.  Plaintiff
has provided evidence it incurred $2,128.84 in costs, and the Court awards that
amount.  As for its expenses incurred in
bringing this motion, the Court awards Plaintiff $1,950, which reflects three
hours of attorney time at $650 per hour (this includes 1 hour for appearing at
the hearing on the motion, but no time for preparing and filing a reply brief,
as none was filed).  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
For the reasons
noted above, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees and costs
and orders Defendant to pay Plaintiff a total amount of $44,586.34, which
consists of $40,507.50 in attorney fees, $1,950 associated with the filing of
this motion, and $2,128.84 in costs. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this order and to
file proof of service of same.
