The judge has sustained the demurrer, ruling that the plaintiff's allegations do not demonstrate that the defendants discriminated against them based on any protected characteristics. The plaintiff is given 10 days to file an amended complaint. The defendants are ordered to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
