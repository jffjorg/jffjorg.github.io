And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for attorney fees and costs filed by Plaintiff Qinghua Chen, who settled a case against Defendant BMW of North America, LLC. The judge notes that the prevailing party must seek an award of attorney fees by way of a noticed motion and bears the burden of proof to justify the amount sought.

The judge concludes that Plaintiff's Counsel's billing rates of $550, $600, $625, and $650 per hour are reasonable rates for attorneys engaged in similar litigation in the Los Angeles area. The judge also finds that the lodestar amount of $41,407.50 amply compensates Counsel for work on the case.

The judge rejects Defendant's arguments that the Court should "strike the litigation costs Plaintiff claims to have incurred after the January 12, 2022, billing entry" and that Counsel's invoices include substantial block billing and duplicative entries. The judge also deducts 1.5 hours of Counsel's time, amounting to a charge of $900, from the amount of attorney fees Plaintiff seeks due to double billing.

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion and awards Plaintiff attorney fees in the amount of $40,507.50, minus $900, for a total amount of $40,507.50, as well as costs and expenses. The total amount awarded is $44,586.34.
