 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant’s
  Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint 



 
I. Background
A.   
Pleadings
Plaintiffs Joshua Coffman and
Sunnybyte, LLC (Sunnybyte) sue Defendants Ross Legal Corporation, Inc. (Ross
Legal), Polina L. Ross, and Does 1 through 20 pursuant to a May 4, 2024, Second
Amended Complaint (SAC) alleging claims of (1) Legal Malpractice, (2) Breach of
Contract, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4) Fraud, (5) Conversion, (6)
Violation of Cal. Civ. Code Section 1770(a)(5), and (7) Violation of Cal. Bus.
& Prof. Code Section 17200. The claims arise from the following
allegations. Based on a July 30, 2018 legal agreement, Defendants represented
Plaintiffs in relation to Coffman, et al. v. Shor, et al., Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 18SMCP00096 (the Shor Litigation) and in relation to
Sunnybyte, LLC v. Levy, et al., Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 21STCV01387
(the Kindra Litigation). In the course of representation on those cases,
Plaintiffs informed Defendants of Plaintiffs’ willingness to settle, desire to
keep legal expenses low, and intent to pay legal fees from settlement proceeds.

Defendants advised Plaintiffs to
enter a settlement in the Shor Litigation in May 2021, with Plaintiffs
entering the settlement on May 8, 2021. Defendants also advised Plaintiffs to
enter a settlement in the Kindra Litigation in December 2021, with
Plaintiffs entering the settlement on December 12, 2021. Defendant Ross,
through Ross Legal, allegedly incurred fees for unnecessary work and billed
additional fees that were not contemplated by the parties’ agreement in
relation to the Shor Litigation settlement, incurred between May 4,
2019, and January 18, 2022 (the Additional Fees). Defendants concealed their
intent to bill the Additional Fees until after Plaintiff entered settlements in
the Shor and Kindra Litigations to profit from the legal fees to
be paid from those settlements, including the Additional Fees. 
Plaintiffs disputed the Additional
Fees with Defendants and requested a full disbursement of the settlement funds
from the Kindra Litigation, which had by that time been paid to
Defendants. Defendants responded by terminating representation based on breach
of the legal agreement through nonpayment of fees and mailing Plaintiffs the
balance of the Kindra Litigation settlement ($4,779.84) in a check. That
figure subtracted $13,146.83 for outstanding fees incurred prior to the
Additional Fees and $27,073.33 to be placed “in trust pending the resolution of
th[e] fee dispute,” seemingly the Additional Fees. Plaintiffs subsequently
attempted to cash the $4,779.84 check mailed by Defendants, but the check
bounced because Ross Corp.’s trust account—from which payment would be
forthcoming—had been closed. Defendants are alleged to have converted the
$4,779.84
B.   
Motions Before the Court
On June 21, 2024, Defendants filed
a demurrer to the SAC’s sixth cause of action for violation of California Civil
Code section 1770 subdivision (a)(5). They also filed a motion to strike
challenging portions of the SAC based on a statute of limitations issue as well
as the SAC’s prayers for punitive damages and attorney fees. 
On August 30, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed an opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike.
On September 6, 2024, Defendants
filed replies to the opposition. 
Defendants’ demurrer and motions to
strike are now before the Court. 
 
II. Requests for Judicial Notice 
Per Defendants’ request, the Court
takes judicial notice of: (1) the case summary for the Shor Litigation;
(2) the case summary and pleading for the Kindra Litigation; (3) the
Complaint in this action; (4) the Complaint in the Shor Litigation; and
(5) the Complaint in the Kindra Litigation. (Demurrer &
MTS, Request for Judicial Notice (RJN), Exs. 1-5; Evid. Code, §§ 452, subds. (d), (h), 453,
subds. (a)-(b).)
Per Plaintiffs’ request, the Court
takes judicial notice of: (1) the case summary for the action entitled Bank
of America, N.A., a National Banking Association vs Placements Media LLC, a
California Corporation, et al., Los Angeles Superior Court Case No.
24SMCV00364; and (2) the Complaint in the Bank of America, N.A., a National
Banking Association vs Placements Media LLC, a California Corporation, et al.,
litigation. (Opp., Request for Judicial Notice (RJN), Exs. 1-5; Evid. Code, §§
452, subds. (d), (h), 453, subds. (a)-(b).)
The Court notes that Defendants’
request for judicial notice is equally applicable to the discussion for the
motion to strike because Defendants requested notice in relation to both
motions. (Demurrer & MTS, RJN, pp. 1-3.)
 
III. Demurrer
A.   
Meet and Confer
The Court notes that Defendants
have met the meet and confer requirement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3)(B). (Kajo Decl., ¶ 2.)
B.   
Legal Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a
[general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face
of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)
C.   
Analysis SUSTAINED, with leave to amend 
The Consumer Legal Remedies Act
(CLRA) makes unlawful certain “unfair methods of competition and unfair or
deceptive acts or practices” “by any person in a transaction intended to result
or that results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer,”
which include “[r]epresenting that goods or services have sponsorship,
approval, characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities that they
do not have or that a person has a sponsorship, approval, status, affiliation,
or connection that the person does not have.” (Civ. Code, § 1770, subd.
(a)(5).) 
The sixth cause of action alleges
violation of subdivision (a)(5) of Civil Code section 1770. (SAC, ¶¶ 67-74.) 
In their demurrer, Defendants argue
that the legal services at issue do not qualify as the types of “services”
contemplated by the CLRA because the actions in which Defendants represented
the Plaintiffs involved prosecuting Plaintiff’s interests in civil business
disputes. Civil Code section 1761, subdivision (b) specifies that “services” as
used in section 1770 subdivision (a)(5) means services “other than a commercial
or business use.” (Civ. Code § 1770 subd. (a)(5).) 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that
while the Shor Litigation and Kindra Litigation arose from
business purposes, the Defendants’ representation of Coffman was not limited to
those matters. They argue that in the Shor Litigation, the Defendants’
services involved protecting Coffman from personal liability arising from a “personal
guarantee” on a Bank of America loan to Placements Media. (Opp. pp. 9-10; SAC ¶¶
68-69.)
The Court has taken judicial notice
of the pleadings in the Shor Litigation (Demurrer & MTS, RJN, Ex. 4
[pleading in Shor Litigation showing that the litigation involved a
business dispute].) While it is true that part of the Shor Litigation
involved Coffman’s potential personal liability on the Bank of American loan, the
credit line was for business purposes. (Demurrer & MTS, RJN, Ex. 4) Coffman
and his business partner obtained the loan for their business, Placements Media.
Coffman’s personal guarantee of the Bank of America credit line resulted from
his role as a partner in the business. Thus, the Plaintiffs have not alleged
sufficient facts showing that the legal services the Defendants provided to
Coffman arose from personal or family matters as opposed to commercial or
business matters. 
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend. 
 
IV. Motion to Strike 
A.   
Legal Standard 
The court may, upon a motion or at
any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (a) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (b) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. §
436, subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782
[“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
For the purposes of a motion to
strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the term
“pleading” generally means a demurrer, answer, complaint, or cross-complaint,
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)), and an immaterial allegation or irrelevant
matter in a pleading entails (1) an allegation that is not essential to the
statement of a claim or defense, (2) an allegation that is neither pertinent to
nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or
cross-complaint (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)).
B.   
Analysis
1.    
Statute of Limitations
Unless a complaint affirmatively
discloses on its face that the statute of limitations has run, the general
demurrer on these grounds must be overruled. (See Lockley v. Law Office of
Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 881
[“It must appear clearly and affirmatively that, upon the face of the
complaint, the right of action is necessarily barred”].) Instead, “[t]he proper
remedy ‘is to ascertain the factual basis of the contention through discovery
and, if necessary, file a motion for summary judgment ….’ [Citation.]” (Roman
v. County of Los Angeles (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 316, 325.) 
A statute of limitations starts to
run once the cause of action “accrues,” and although a cause of action
typically accrues when it is complete with all of its elements, a cause of
action will at times be deemed to accrue at a later date, such as when the
plaintiff did not discover and had no occasion to discover the cause of action
until that later date, when the defendant fraudulently concealed the existence
of a possible claim until that later date, or when the defendant committed
multiple wrongs that ended on that later date. (Doe v. Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Los Angeles (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 953, 961.) 
The statute of limitation for a
professional negligence claim or another claim involving “[a]n action against
an attorney for a wrongful act or omission, other than for actual fraud,” is
“one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable
diligence should have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or
omission, or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,
whichever occurs first.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.6, subd. (a).) 
However, there can be a tolling of
the statute of limitations for no more than four years if the “plaintiff has
not sustained actual injury” or if “[t]he attorney continues to represent the
plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful
act or omission occurred.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.6, subds. (a)(1), (2).) The
one-year statute of limitations has been found to apply to breach of fiduciary
claims as well. (Stoll v. Superior Court (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1362,
1368-69 [applying the one-year statute of limitations under Code of Civil
Procedure section 340.6 to a breach of fiduciary duty claim in the context of
legal malpractice].)
Here, the Defendants argue in their
motion to strike that the SAC lacks the factual particularity required to state
a cause of action for actual fraud. They argue that the allegations are thus subject
to the one-year statute of limitations period set out in Civil Code section
340.6. The Defendants allege that the latest discovery date for the harm
alleged is February 7, 2022, per paragraph 24 of the SAC. As this action was
filed on February 14, 2023, the Defendants allege that the Plaintiffs were on
notice of facts giving rise to their claims more than a year before filing this
action. 
In opposition, the Plaintiffs argue
that they have pled sufficient facts to support a finding of actual fraud, and
thus the applicable statute governing the statute of limitations for this
action is Code of Civil Procedure section 338 subdivision (d) which provides a three-year
limitations period for “[a]n action for relief on the ground of fraud or
mistake.” (Code. Civ. Proc. § 338 subd. (d.)) Plaintiffs allege that they
discovered the alleged harm relating to the Shor and Kindra
Litigations as of February 8, 2022, when the Plaintiffs disputed the Additional
Fees (SAC ¶ 25.) Hence, they argue that the three-year statute of limitations began
to run on February 7, 2022 and because the initial complaint was filed on
February 14, 2023, their claims are not time barred. 
For Code of Civil Procedure section
340.6 purposes, actual fraud means an intentional misrepresentation as opposed
to constructive fraud of concealment. (Quintilliani v. Mannerino (1998)
62 Cal.App.4th 54, 69-70 [constructive fraud and negligent misrepresentation
within ambit of section 340.6, but intentional fraud is not].) 
Intentional misrepresentation
involves “(1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.” (Service by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996)
44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816.) Allegations of fraud “must be pled with more detail
than other causes of action.” (Apollo Capital Fund, LLC v. Roth Capital
Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226, 240.) “Every element of the cause
of action for fraud must be alleged … factually and specifically[,] and the
policy of liberal construction of the pleadings … will not ordinarily be
invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect. [Citations.]”
(Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983)
35 Cal.3d 197, 216, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey
Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) A plaintiff pleading
fraud must allege facts showing “how, when, where, to whom, and by what means”
the allegedly fraudulent representations were tendered. (Lazar v. Superior
Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) “[G]eneral and conclusory allegations do
not suffice.” (Small v. Fritz Cos., Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184
[citations omitted].)
Here, the SAC contains the
particularity required to allege actual fraud. 
First, the SAC alleges that the
Defendants “knowingly and willfully misrepresented the nature and extent of
legal fees being accrued” by concealing “the accrual of significant additional
fees totaling $27,073.33 from May 4, 2019, to January 18, 2022, which were not
disclosed until after the settlements of both the Shor Litigation and
the Kindra Litigation.” (SAC ¶ 58.) 
Second, the SAC alleges that the “Defendants
intended for Plaintiffs to rely on these misrepresentations as factual, causing
Plaintiffs to enter into the Shor Litigation and II Settlements [sic] under
false pretenses.” (SAC ¶ 60.)
Third, the SAC alleges that the “Plaintiffs
justifiably relied on Defendants’ stated and written assurances, which directly
influenced their decision to settle without seeking alternative legal advice or
renegotiating the terms of their legal representation.” (SAC ¶ 60.)
Fourth, the SAC alleges that “[a]s
a direct result of this fraudulent conduct, Plaintiffs suffered substantial
damages, including but not limited to the misappropriation of settlement funds
to cover undisclosed fees, which were significantly higher than anticipated or
justified.” (SAC ¶ 61.)
The SAC alleges that “[t]hese
misrepresentations were made in face-to-face meetings, through email
communications, and during telephone conversations directly between Ross and
Coffman, wherein Ross explicitly stated that the fees charged would be
transparent and reasonable. Instead, Defendants issued a delayed and
consolidated invoice only after the conclusion of the Kindra Litigation,
strategically timing the disclosure to coincide with the receipt of settlement
funds, thereby ensuring Plaintiffs had limited recourse.” (SAC ¶ 59.)
Thus, the allegations in the SAC
meet the particularity required of intentional misrepresentation claims, and the
three-year limitations period prescribed in Civil Code of Procedure section 338
subdivision (d) could apply. Accordingly, the portions of the SAC that Defendants
move to strike in so far as they are time barred pursuant to Civil Code section
340.6, are DENIED. 
Defendants
motion is thus DENIED as to striking from the SAC: (a) ¶ 16, (b) ¶¶ 18-20, (c)
the words “[o]nce again, … Fees,” at 6:15-21, (d) the words “[n]one … period,” at
7:6-8, (e) ¶¶ 25, 32-40, 52-68, 69-74, 76-79 and (f) ¶¶ 80-84.

2.    
Punitive Damages
“In an action for the breach of an
obligation not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages
for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.” (Civ. Code, §
3294, subd. (a); College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8
Cal.4th 704, 725 [explaining amendments requiring “despicable” conduct for
malice and oppression].) 
When the defendant is a
corporation, ‘[a]n award of punitive damages … must rest on the malice of the
corporation’s employees’” specifically, “the oppression, fraud, or malice
perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by an officer, director, or managing
agent of the corporation,” where a managing agent “include[s] only those
corporate employees who exercise substantial independent authority and judgment
in their corporate decision making so that their decisions ultimately determine
corporate policy.’” (Wilson v. Southern California Edison Co. (2015) 234
Cal.App.4th 123, 164, citations omitted.) 
A motion to strike is properly
granted when a complaint fails to allege facts to state a prima facie claim for
punitive damages under the standards of the statute. (Turman v. Turning
Point of Cent. California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) Alleging an
intentional tort alone is not enough to support a claim for punitive damages,
nor are conclusory allegations that merely parrot the language of the statute.
(Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166; Blegen v.
Superior Court (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 959, 963.)
The SAC seeks punitive damages
pursuant to Civil Code section 1780, subdivision (a)(4), i.e., under the
CLRA. (SAC, Prayer, p.17:11-12.) Because the Court has sustained Defendants’
demurrer to the SAC’s CLRA claim (see Section III.C. discussion supra), the
punitive damages prayer has no supporting cause of action. For these reasons,
the prayer for punitive damages is “a demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(3), (c)), making the prayer immaterial, and subject
to a motion to strike. 
Defendants’ motion to strike is
thus GRANTED as to striking Plaintiffs’ prayer for punitive damages pursuant to
Civil Code section 1780, subdivision (a)(4), alleged in the SAC at 17:11-12.
3.    
Attorney Fees 
Attorney fees are only recoverable
when authorized by contract, statute or law. (Code Civ. Proc. 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10).) Otherwise, regardless of who prevails in litigation, each party must
bear his or her own attorneys’ fees—a proposition known as the American Rule. (Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society (1975) 421 U.S. 240, 247; Trope
v. Katz (1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 278-279 [“California follows what is commonly
referred to as the American rule, which provides that each party to a lawsuit
must ordinarily pay his own attorney fees. [Citation.] The Legislature codified
the American rule in 1872 when it enacted Code of Civil Procedure section 1021,
which states in pertinent part that ‘Except as attorney’s fees are specifically
provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties
….’ [Citation.]”].)
The SAC prays for attorney fees
pursuant to Civil Code section 1780, subdivision (a)(5), i.e., under the
CLRA, and pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. (SAC Prayer, p. 17:13-16.)
Because the Court has sustained
Defendants’ demurrer to the SAC’s CLRA claim (see Section III.C discussion
supra), the CLRA attorney fees prayer has no supporting cause of action. For
these reasons, the CLRA-based prayer for attorney fees is “a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or
cross-complaint” making the prayer immaterial, and subject to a motion to
strike (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(3), (c).) 
However, the same conclusion is not
warranted for the prayer for attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021.5. Section 1021.5 permits recovery of fees in relation to the
enforcement of important rights affecting public interest. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1021.5.) The SAC prays for this relief in relation to the SAC’s unfair
competition claim. (SAC, ¶ 79, Prayer, p. 17:15-16.) It is well established
that in the appropriate case, a prevailing plaintiff may seek attorney fees under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 for claims arising from Business & Professions
Code section 17200. (Zhang v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal.4th 364, 371,
fn. 4.) A challenge to the pleadings is not the time to decide whether
Plaintiffs will or will not be able to meet the standard under section 1021.5.
(Camenisch v. Superior Court (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1689, 1699 [“the
court was not required the strike the prayer [for attorney fees] before [plaintiff]
has a full opportunity to determine, through discovery, whether a basis for recovery
exists”].)
Defendants’ motion to strike is
thus GRANTED as to striking Plaintiffs’ prayer for attorney fees pursuant to
Civil Code section 1780, subdivision (a)(5), requested in the SAC at p. 17:13-14,
but not as to and Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, requested in the SAC at
p. 17:15-16.
