 Hearing
  Date:  September 17, 2024



 
Defendants HG Law APC’s and Hyka A.
Karapetian’s demurrer to Plaintiffs Lilit Keshishyan’s and Levon Ehtibaryan’s second
amended complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend in the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action, only as to the allegations
pertaining to not disbursing the settlement pursuant to the settlement terms.

Defendants HG Law APC’s and
Hyka A. Karapetian’s motion to strike is denied as moot. 
 
Defendants HG Law APC (“HG Law”) and Hyka H. Karapetian (“Karapetian”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) demur to Plaintiffs Lilit Keshishyan’s (“Keshishyan”) and Levon
Ehtibaryan’s (“Ehtibaryan”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) second amended
complaint (“SAC”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§430.10
et seq.)  Defendants also move to strike
portions of the SAC.  (Notice of MTS, pg.
2.)
 
Background
Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint on August 22, 2023.  On November 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their
first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants.  On March 19, 2024, this Court sustained
Defendants’ demurrer to each cause of action in the FAC with 20 days leave to
amend.  (3/19/24 Minute Order.)
Plaintiffs filed the operative SAC against Defendants alleging
five causes of action: (1) legal malpractice; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3)
fraud and deceit; (4) breach of contract; and (5) violation of Penal Code §496.
This action arises out of Plaintiffs retaining HG Law on June 28,
2017, to represent them regarding a June 27, 2017, auto collision that occurred
in Glendale, California, for a personal injury action against Commercial Waste
Services Inc. and its driver, Ramon Alcantara.  (SAC ¶¶18-19.)  Plaintiffs
allege they each executed separate Client Services Agreements for the retention
of Defendants in the personal injury action, and Defendants did not disclose or
advise Plaintiffs of any potential conflict(s) of interest with respect to the
firm’s representation of multiple parties in the same action, and Defendants
did not present or obtain Plaintiffs’ informed written consent to joint
representation despite the potential for conflict(s) of interest arising from such
joint representation.  (SAC ¶¶20-21.)
On July 12, 2024, Defendants filed the notice of the instant
demurrer.  On July 21, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant demurrer and motion to strike.  On September 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
oppositions.  Defendants filed their
combined reply on September 10, 2024.
 
A.  
Demurrer
Summary of Demurrer
Defendants demur to Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes
of action.  Defendants demur on the basis
that Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th causes of action are barred by the
statute of limitations.  (Demurrer, pgs.
2-4; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)  Defendants
demur on the basis that all of Plaintiffs’ causes of action fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendants.  (Demurrer, pgs. 2-4; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)  Defendants demur on the basis all of
Plaintiffs’ causes of action are uncertain. 
(Demurrer, pgs. 2-4; C.C.P. §430.10(f).) 
Finally, Defendants demur on the basis the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes
of action are duplicative.  (Demurrer,
pgs. 2-4; Kracht v. Perrin, Gartland & Doyle (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d
1019, 1022-1023; Loube v. Loube (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 421, 429-431; Award
Metals, Inc. v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1135.)
 
           Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the
meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Defendants’ counsel declares that on May 10, 2024, she called
Plaintiffs’ counsel and left a voicemail, and afterwards she sent Plaintiffs’
counsel a follow-up email.  (Decl. of
Koshkaryan ¶4, Exh. A.)  Defendants’
counsel declares that on May 14, 2024, she sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a second
follow-up email.  (Decl. of Koshkaryan
¶5, Exh. B.)  Defendants’ counsel
declares that on June 17, 2024, she received an email from Plaintiffs’ counsel
providing dates to schedule a meet and confer. 
(Decl. of Koshkaryan ¶6, Exh. C.) 
Defendants’ counsel declares that on June 20, 2024, she called
Plaintiffs’ counsel on her direct line, but she was unavailable.  (Decl. of Koshkaryan ¶7.)  Defendants’ counsel’s declaration fails to indicate
that she responded to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s email confirming the date for the
meet and confer.  (See Decl. of
Koshkaryan ¶¶6-7, Exh. C.)  Despite this
deficiency and probable reason for Plaintiffs’ counsel’s unavailability on June
20, Defendants’ counsel’s declaration is sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a).  Accordingly, the Court will consider the
instant demurrer.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Uncertainty & Statute of Limitations
A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the
complaint is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., he or she
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
counts or claims are directed against him or her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
If the complaint contains enough facts to apprise defendant of the
issues it is being asked to meet, failure to label each cause of action is not
ground for demurrer: “Although inconvenient, annoying and inconsiderate, the
lack of labels . . . does not substantially impair [defendant’s] ability to
understand the complaint.” (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986)
185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 n.2.)
C.C.P. §340.6 provides in part, “[a]n action against an attorney
for a wrongful act or omission, other than for actual fraud, arising in the
performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year
after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence
should have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,
whichever occurs first.”  (C.C.P.
§340.6(a), emphasis added.)
Plaintiffs allege that on June 28, 2017, they retained Defendants
to represent them regarding the auto collision in a personal injury action
against Commercial Waste Services Inc. and its driver, Ramon Alcantara.  (SAC ¶19.) 
Plaintiffs allege on or about June 26, 2019, Defendants, on behalf of
Plaintiffs, filed a personal injury action in Los Angeles Superior Court, which
was assigned Case Number 19STCV22401, Lilit Keshishyan, et al. v. Ramon
Alcantara, et al. (“Personal Injury Action”).  (SAC ¶22.)
Plaintiffs allege on August 15, 2022, Plaintiff Keshishyan saw
that the Court’s Register of Actions reflected a Request for Dismissal had been
filed in June 2022.  (SAC ¶31.)  Plaintiffs allege Plaintiff Keshishyan did
not understand what it meant that a Request for Dismissal had been filed in the
case, and immediately texted Defendant Karapetian and referenced the dismissal
and asked for an update on the case.  (SAC
¶31.)  Plaintiffs allege Defendant Karapetian
replied, indicating disbursement is not finalized, that she had arrived back in
the country on August 9, 2022, that she had caught Covid, and explained she
would call Plaintiffs “as soon as everything is finalized,” although Defendant
Karapetian did not explain the status or what she meant by “everything” or what
was actually being “finalized.”  (SAC
¶31.)  Plaintiffs allege she also did not
explain what it meant that a Request for Dismissal had been filed.  (SAC ¶31.)
Plaintiffs allege during the meeting at Defendants’ office on
August 23, 2022, Defendant Karapetian finally disclosed that she had settled
Plaintiffs’ personal injury action for $80,000.00 on or around June 15, 2022.  (SAC ¶34.) 
Plaintiffs allege she also informed Plaintiffs that she had signed the
written release agreement memorializing the terms of the settlement on behalf
of Plaintiffs and confirmed that the Request for Dismissal filed in June 2022
had been filed “with prejudice” and therefore had fully and completely disposed
of the Personal Injury Action.  (SAC
¶34.)
The one-year limitations period for professional negligence, at a
minimum, was triggered on August 15, 2022, by Plaintiffs’ discovery of the
facts constituting the alleged act or omission, i.e., the filing of the request
for dismissal without their knowledge or consent. The one-year limitations
period is triggered by Plaintiffs’ discovery of the facts constituting the
alleged act or omission, not “by his discovery that such facts constitute
professional negligence, i.e. by discovery that a particular legal theory is
applicable based on the known facts.”  (Peregrine
Funding, Inc. v. Sheppard Mullin (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 658, 684; see
Laird v. Blacker (1992) 2 Cal.4th 606, 609 [holding C.C.P. §340.6(a)’s
one-year-from-discovery limitation period commences when he or she suffers an
adverse judgment or dismissal in the underlying action].)  Defendants filed their original complaint on
August 22, 2023, after the one-year statute had expired on August 15, 2023.  
Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th causes of action are also
subject to a one-year statute of limitations. 
(Stoll v. Superior Court (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1362, 1363 [“…we
hold that the statute of limitations within which a client must commence an
action against an attorney on a claim for legal malpractice or breach of a
fiduciary duty is identical”]; Austin v. Medicis (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th
577, 587 [stating breach of contract and constructive fraud claims are governed
by statute of limitations for attorney malpractice]; Foxen v. Carpenter (2016)
6 Cal.App.5th 284.)
The Court views the SAC as alleging at least two distinct wrongful
acts by Defendants: (1) causing Plaintiffs’ suit against Commercial Waste
Services Inc. and its driver, Ramon Alcantara, to be dismissed without Plaintiffs’
consent; and (2) not dispersing the settlement pursuant to the settlement
terms. 
The Court agrees that the one-year statute of limitations as to
the first act ran on August 15, 2023, when Plaintiffs discovered that the
matter had been dismissed. As to the second act, however, the Court finds that
the statute for that did not run until August 23, 2023, such that Plaintiffs’
present action would be timely filed.
The Court finds that the SAC does not adequately distinguish between
these two acts, rendering it uncertain.  The defect identified in the instant demurrer
is the same as presented in the last demurrer to the FAC.   Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer on the basis of uncertainty is sustained with 20
days leave to amend in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action, only
as to the allegations pertaining to not disbursing the settlement pursuant to
the settlement terms.        
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ SAC is sustained with
20 days leave to amend in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action, only
as to the allegations pertaining to not disbursing the settlement pursuant to
the settlement terms.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
B.  
Motion to Strike
In
light of the Court’s ruling on the demurrer, Defendants’ motion to strike is
denied as moot.
