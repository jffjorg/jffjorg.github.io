The judge instructed Plaintiff to re-file his motion in the correct format, which includes the name, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of the party, as well as a case caption in the upper left-hand corner of the first page. The judge noted that the Court cannot rule on Plaintiff's request until the correct format is used.
