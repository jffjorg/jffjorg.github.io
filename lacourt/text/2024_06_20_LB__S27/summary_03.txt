And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to conduct financial discovery in preparation for the trial of punitive damages claims. The plaintiff, Marilyn Dwellingham, filed the motion on April 2, 2024, and the court heard the motion on June 20, 2024. The plaintiff's attorney declared that the plaintiff is likely to prevail in the trial and that the defendant has financial information that is relevant to the punitive damages claims. However, the defendant correctly pointed out that the plaintiff's attorney lacks personal knowledge of the facts and that the evidence submitted is not competent. The court denied the motion, stating that a party moving for relief cannot submit evidence for the first time in reply. The parties are ordered to give notice and to submit on the tentative ruling if they intend to do so.
