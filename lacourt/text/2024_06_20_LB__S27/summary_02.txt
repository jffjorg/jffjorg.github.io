And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denied the motion for leave to amend the complaint to add claims by Luis and Marco Bonilla. The court found that the proposed amended complaint does not relate back to the original complaint, and amendment is not proper under CCP 473(a). The court also denied the motion to intervene brought by Luis and Marco Bonilla. The court found that the Bonillas do not meet the definition of interveners as a matter of right or permissive intervention. The court noted that granting the motion would be an act in futility, as the defendant would likely demur on the ground that the complaint in intervention is not timely.
