And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reconsidered the prior tentative ruling and has denied the petition for writ of mandate. The Court found that the District's deliberation in a closed session was permitted under California Government Code ยง54957(b)(1), which allows for closed sessions during a regular or special meeting to consider the appointment, employment, evaluation of performance, discipline, or dismissal of a public employee. The Court also noted that the employee had the option to request a public session, and since the employee did not request a public session, the deliberation in a closed session was permitted. The Court reversed its prior tentative ruling and denied the petition.
