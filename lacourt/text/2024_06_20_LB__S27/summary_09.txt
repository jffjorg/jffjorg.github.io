And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motion to consolidate the two cases, 23LBSC00738 and 24LBCV00161, brought by plaintiff Cecelia L. Wong against defendants Leroy Stone and Beth Arnold. The court denies the motion without prejudice for several reasons. First, there is no proof of service of the moving papers on Arnold, who has not appeared in the small claims case, but has not been defaulted or dismissed. Second, the plaintiff failed to file the notice of motion in the small claims case, as required by California Rules of Court 3.350(a)(1)(C). Third, the two cases have not been deemed related and are not pending in the same department. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court.
