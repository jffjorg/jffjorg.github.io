 Case Number:  23LBCV01664    Hearing Date:   June 20, 2024    Dept:  S27 Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. filed a
motion to compel (MC) responses to discovery on 3/04/24, setting it for hearing
on 7/11/24.  Home Depot U.S.A., Inc.
filed a motion to compel further (MTCF) responses to discovery on 3/13/24,
setting it for hearing on 6/25/24.  
 
At the 3/27/24 CMC, the Court
advanced the hearing on the MC and rescheduled it for 6/20/24; the Court also
continued the CMC to 6/20/24.  The Court
ordered Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling; to date, there is no notice of
ruling in the court file.  Notably, all
parties appeared at the 3/27/24 hearing, such that they are likely aware of the
ruling, despite the required notice.  
 
The MC and the MTCF seek to compel
responses to the same set of discovery – FROGs, Set One, propounded on
12/11/23.  Plaintiff served only
boilerplate objections to the discovery, which resulted in the filing of a motion
to compel responses and also a motion to compel further responses.  
 
The Court finds it is in the
interest of justice to hear both motions at the same time, as relief will only
be granted, if at all, a single time. 
The hearing on the MC is therefore continued to 6/25/24.  In the interest of conserving judicial and
party resources, the CMC is also continued to 6/25/24.  
 
The Court is hopeful the parties
will resolve the issues relating to the discovery motions prior to the 6/25/24
hearing.  The Court asks Defendant to
take the motions off calendar promptly, using the online reservation system, in
the event the issues are resolved.  
 
Moving Defendant is ordered to give
notice.
