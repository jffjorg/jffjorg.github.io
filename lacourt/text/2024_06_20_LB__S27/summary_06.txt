Here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel depositions and further responses to discovery in a case involving alleged violations of the ADA and UNRUH. The Plaintiff, Eric Cleveland, has osteoarthritis and contends that Defendant's property is in violation of the ADA and UNRUH because it needs to have an asphalt overlap in the parking area and needs to have work done on the disabled parking space. The Defendant, Cancun Properties LLC, Anjai Savire LLC, and Sirenitas Restaurant, Inc., opposes the motion, arguing that the depositions of David Yashar and Fernaz Esther Fard are unnecessary because they are mere investors in Cancun Properties and lack personal knowledge of any details of this case. The Court grants the motion to compel depositions and orders the parties to meet and confer forthwith to agree on a date, time, and location for the depositions to go forward. The Court also grants the motion to compel further responses to discovery and orders the parties to meet and confer in good faith forthwith. The Court notes that the parties have another discovery motion on calendar on 7/25/24 and that the hearing on this motion is continued to 7/25/24.
