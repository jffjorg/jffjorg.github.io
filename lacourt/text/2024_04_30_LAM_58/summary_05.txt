And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the issues of liability and the submission of additional evidence. The judge notes that neither Franco Vago SpA nor Nippon Express Italia SpA have been served with the plaintiff's complaint or appeared in the action. The judge concludes that the evidence does not demonstrate specific liability for the underlying allegations. The non-settling defendants object to the submission of additional evidence, citing the limited briefing schedule. The judge finds that the defendants' objection is baseless, as they would have had the opportunity to respond to the additional evidence even under the current briefing schedule.
