And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer of the defendant, Design Holdings, Inc. to the plaintiff's complaint alleging violations of the California Invasion of Privacy Act. The Court finds that the plaintiff's allegations fail to state a claim for violations of the Act because they do not show that Salesforce, a third-party vendor, was recording the information for its own benefit. Instead, the allegations show that Design Holdings was using Salesforce to extract greater information for its own business purposes. The Court denies the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint and orders that the demurrer be sustained without leave to amend.
