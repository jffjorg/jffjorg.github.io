[1]            The demurrer also contends
that Plaintiff
fails to allege the technical requirements for a CIPA violation, including use
of a telephone line or an “in transit” interception. With respect to the first
clause, Defendant is correct that it does not apply to internet technology;
however, the second clause does. (Valenzuela v.
Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2023) 674
F.Supp.3d 751, 756.) Liberally construing the allegations, the FAC adequately
alleges an “in transit” interception over the internet. (FAC ¶¶ 12-14.)
 


[2]            This determination is
generally a question of fact. (Yoon v. Lululemon USA, Inc. (C.D. Cal.
2021) 549 F.Supp.3d 1073, 1081.) Nonetheless, adequate facts must still be alleged
to state a claim. 


[3]            In opposition, Plaintiff
cites and relies on several Los Angeles Superior Court cases that she contends
overruled demurrers to similar claims to bolster her argument that her
allegations here are adequate. (Opp., 4:14-26, 5:2-12.) Plaintiff’s reliance on
these non-binding trial court cases is improper.
