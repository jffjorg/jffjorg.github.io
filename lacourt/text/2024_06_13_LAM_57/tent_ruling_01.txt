  Case Number:  21STCV40405    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  57 The motion of Built, Inc. and John Matthew Sofio to compel DWG International, LLC to provide further responses to special interrogatories (set one) is granted as to interrogatory numbers 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, and 27.  The further responses to these interrogatories must be provided without objection by July 5, 2024.  The motion is denied as to interrogatory numbers 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18, which, per the reply brief in support of the motion, are no longer at issue because the moving parties have withdrawn their request for an order to compel further responses to these interrogatories.The request in the motion for an order imposing sanctions on DWG International, Inc. and its counsel in the form of attorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with the motion is granted.  The objections of DWG International, Inc. to the interrogatories and its opposition to the motion based on those objections were not substantially justified. The amount of the sanctions awarded is $5,1800.  That amount must be paid to moving parties through their counsel by July 5, 2024.
