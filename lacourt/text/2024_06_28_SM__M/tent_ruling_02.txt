 Case Number:  23SMCV02663    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  M CASE NAME:           Cruz v. Trader
Joe’s Co., et al.
CASE NO.:                23SMCV02663
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   6/28/2024

 
Legal Standard
 
 If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.
(CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the moving
papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902,
905-906.) 
 
Where there has been no timely response to a CCP section
2031.010 inspection demand, the demanding party must seek an order compelling a
response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely respond waives all objections,
including privilege and work product. Thus, unless the party to whom the demand
was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to
the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a motion to compel responses.
Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve
the matter outside court before filing the motion. Where the motion seeks only
a response to the inspection demand, no showing of "good cause" is
required. 
 
Pursuant to CCP section 2033.280(b), a party may move for
an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). “Failure to timely
respond to RFA does not result in automatic admissions. Rather, the propounder
of the RFA must ‘move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and
the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well
as for a monetary sanction’ under § 2023.010 et seq.” (CCP, § 2033.280(b).) The
court “shall” grant the motion to deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP, § 2033.280(c).) 
   
ANALYSIS 
 
Plaintiff
Emanuel Luis Cruz moves to compel Defendant Granstoly, LLC’s verified
responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s: 1) Form Interrogatories, Set One;
2) Special Interrogatories, Set One; and 3) Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One. Plaintiff also moves to deem matters admitted as to Requests
for Admissions, Set One, against Defendant. For each motion, Plaintiff requests
monetary sanctions in the amount of $590.00 in reasonable costs and attorney’s
fees.
 
Plaintiff
demonstrates that the subject discovery was duly served on Defendant. On
November 2, 2023, Plaintiff served written discovery upon both defendants,
including form and special interrogatories, requests for production of
documents and requests for admission. (Elliott Decl., Exs. 1.) Plaintiff’s
counsel inquired with defense counsel regarding the responses in April and May
2024. (Id., Exs. 2, 4.) Defense counsel transmitted Trader Joe’s discovery
responses but indicated that Granstoly had been difficult to communicate with,
and that they would follow up. (Id. Ex. 3.) Despite this representation, Plaintiff
has not received any verified answers to discovery. 
 
Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED. Defendant Granstoly is ordered to provide verified responses,
without objection, within 10 days. The requests for admissions are deemed
admitted.  Sanctions are imposed in the
notice amount of $590.00 per motion, for a total sanction of $1,770.00, against
Defendant Granstoly. Sanctions are to be paid in 30 days.
