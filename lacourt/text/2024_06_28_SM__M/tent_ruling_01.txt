MOTION
TO STRIKE
 
Defendants Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center and Michele Nicole Neely Akhmerov, M.D., move to strike Plaintiff Hazel
Alers’s First Amended Complaint (FAC). At the outset, the Court is not certain
whether Defendants seek to strike Plaintiff’s FAC filed on November 20, 2023, or
the FAC filed December 8, 2023. Either way, the Court concurs that the FACs were
not filed in conformity with the laws of California or this Court’s orders. (CCP
§ 436(b).) Neither were filed with leave. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
The operative pleading remains the complaint, as discussed in the November 16,
2023, minute order.
 
MOTION FOR SUBSTITUTION
 
Successor-in-interest Alejandro Alers Jr. moves for
substitution under CCP section 377.31. Mr. Alers provides a code-compliant
declaration. In opposition, Defendants speculate that the decedent, Ms. Alers,
did not truly commence this action. While certainly in the realm of
possibility, such a claim is currently unsubstantiated. Further, the Court
would not find such an issue suitable grounds to deny the substitution. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is
GRANTED.  The granting of the motion,
however, does not alter the fact that Mr. Alers continued to illegally practice
law despite the Court’s November 16, 2023, finding that he was engaged in this
unlawful practice.
