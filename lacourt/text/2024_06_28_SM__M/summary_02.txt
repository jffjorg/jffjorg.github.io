The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant Granstoly's verified responses to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The judge also deems the matters admitted as to the requests for admission. The defendant is ordered to provide verified responses within 10 days. Sanctions are imposed in the amount of $1,770.00 against the defendant, payable in 30 days. The judge finds that the defendant failed to serve timely responses and failed to communicate effectively with the plaintiff's counsel.
