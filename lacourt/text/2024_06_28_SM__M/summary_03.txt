And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to set aside the default entered against RJ Nautical is granted. The default was caused by excusable neglect due to the mistaken filing of the envelope addressed to a former employee. RJ Nautical only became aware of the lawsuit after November 2023 and diligently secured counsel to informally resolve the issue. The judge notes that the circumstances that caused RJ Nautical to not timely respond to the suit were unforeseeable and beyond its control. As a result, the judge has deemed the answer filed as of the current date.
