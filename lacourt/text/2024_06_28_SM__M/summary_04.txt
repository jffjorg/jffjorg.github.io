And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further response to special interrogatory no. 1, which seeks to identify with precision and specificity each and every alleged trade secret that the plaintiff contends the defendant unlawfully acquired, used, or disclosed. The plaintiff's response to the interrogatory was found to be incomplete, as it provided broad categories of trade secrets rather than specific and identifiable trade secrets. The judge ordered the plaintiff to provide a plain and straightforward identification of each and every trade secret it currently believes the defendant unlawfully acquired, used, or disclosed, within 30 days. The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and prior case law, including Davies v. Superior Court (1984) and Coy v. Superior Court (1962).
