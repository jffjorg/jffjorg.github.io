Legal
Standard
 
Relief under section 473(b) is either discretionary
or mandatory. A motion for mandatory relief must be made no more than six
months after entry of judgment and be accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to the attorney’s “mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) The attorney affidavit of fault must contain a
“straight forward admission of fault.” (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co.
v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.) But it need not contain an
explanation of the reasons for the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence surprise or
neglect. (Martin Potts &
Assocs., Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016)
244 Cal.App.4th 432, 438-441.)
Relief must be
granted “unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact
caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) If mandatory relief is
granted, the court must “direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs” to the
opposing counsel or parties. (CCP § 473(b).)
 
Where a party cannot obtain an attorney affidavit of
fault, the party may seek discretionary relief under section 473(b) due to
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) A
motion for discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable time but in
no instance exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the court may
in its discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including attorney fees,
incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers Cadillac (1992)
11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is granted,
the court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions up to
$1,000 to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client Security
Fund, or “[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP § 473(c)(1)(A), (B),
(C).)
 
A motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted. . .” (CCP § 473(b).)
However, this requirement is
not jurisdictional; substantial compliance may suffice. (Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving
papers].) 
 
Analysis
 

Defendant RJ Nautical (“RJ”) moves
to set aside the default entered against it. Defendant provides a copy of its
proposed answer. (Casey Decl., Ex. H.) 
Plaintiff has not stipulated to the requested relief, but has filed a
notice of non-opposition.  
 
The court entered default against
RJ on November 27, 2023. The proof of service shows service on October 12, 2023,
via substitute service on the agent for service of process. 
 
RJ explains the circumstances which
caused it to not timely respond to this suit. On October 13, 2023, RJ’s front
office received an envelope made out to a former employee of RJ Nautical, Kira
Peralta. (Casey Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. A.) However, Ms. Peralta has not been employed
with RJ Nautical for several years, and the envelope was inadvertently
incorrectly filed. (Id.) In early November 2023, RJ became aware that Defendant
Engel Volkers Yachting was named in this lawsuit. (Id., ¶ 5.) Since, RJ’s only
involvement with the subject yacht was its management services that terminated
in November 2022, no one at RJ had reason to believe that it was named in this lawsuit.
(Id.) On November 10, 2023, upon further inquiry, RJ learned that it had been
named in the suit. (Id., ¶ 6.) After locating the misfiled complaint, RJ
contacted its insurance carrier to advise that RJ Nautical had been served with
the lawsuit. (Id.) On November 28, 2023, the day after default, RJ’s insurance
carrier agreed to defend RJ in the lawsuit under a full reservation of rights
and secure defense counsel. (Id.) On December 19, 2023, RJ’s counsel contacted
Plaintiff’s counsel seeking to stipulate to set aside the default. (Id., ¶¶
7-8.) Counsel negotiated the stipulation and settlement discussions throughout
December 2023 and early January 2024. (Id., ¶¶9-13.) The parties could not
reach an agreement on the stipulation, and this motion followed. (Id. ¶ 13.)  
 
With this, RJ shows excusable
neglect. Plaintiff’s service was addressed to an individual who had not been
employed by defendant for several years, causing RJ to mistakenly assume that the
envelope was either mislabeled or was meant for the former employee. Consequently,
RJ misfiled the papers. Once RJ discovered its mistake, it diligently secured
counsel. Counsel sought to informally resolve the issue, which explains any
delay in making this motion.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.  The answer is deemed filed as of this date.
