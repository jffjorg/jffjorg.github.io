* **Severability:** The Court finds a severability clause in the agreement, allowing the arbitration of individual PAGA claims while keeping representative claims in court.
* **Standing:** The Court recognizes Mora's standing to pursue representative PAGA claims even after individual claims are arbitrated, citing Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc.
* **Stay:** The Court grants the motion to compel arbitration for individual PAGA claims and stays representative PAGA claims pending the arbitration's conclusion.

**Legal Basis:**

* California Arbitration Act (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2 et seq.)
* Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 3, 4, 10, 11)
* Case Law: Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004), Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998), Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023), Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana (2022), Betancourt v. Prudential Overall Supply (2017)

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court grants the motion to compel arbitration in part, ordering the parties to arbitrate the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims. The action is stayed as to the plaintiff's representative PAGA claims. The Court finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, and that the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims are subject to arbitration. The plaintiff's representative PAGA claims are stayed pending completion of the arbitration. The Court rejects the plaintiff's argument that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable due to its waiver of representative PAGA claims, finding that the severability clause in the agreement allows for the arbitration of individual claims. The Court also finds that the plaintiff has standing to pursue her representative PAGA claims in court, despite the arbitration of her individual claims. The Court will set a status conference to monitor the progress of the arbitration.
