PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO SET ASIDE/VACATE
JUDGMENT, THE AMOUNT OF ATTORNE FEES (filed on 08/01/24)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment is DENIED. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On October
31, 2023, Plaintiff Kimi Kim filed this lawsuit against Defendant Jacob Woocher
alleging causes of action for:
C/A 1: Fraud
Intentional Misrepresentation 
C/A 2: Conversion
Theft 
C/A 3: Legal
Malpractice
 
The Complaint
alleges that Defendant lied, committed perjury and submitted falsified
documents in his representation of an unlawful detainer action. The unlawful
detainer action was filed by Plaintiff and Defendant provided legal
representation to the defendants in that underlying action.
 
On December
20, 2023, Defendant filed a Special Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Complaint
pursuant to C.C.P Section 425.16 (Anti-Slapp). 
 
On January
26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of the entire action without
prejudice. 
 
On March 21,
2024, the Court granted the Motion for Attorneys Fees filed by Defendant. The
Court stated in its Minute Order: “The
court finds that Woocher would have prevailed on his anti-SLAPP motion as to
the fraud cause of action. Woocher is therefore entitled to attorneys’ fees
pursuant to section 415.16, subdivision (c).” (Court’s 03/21/24 Minute Order,
p. 1.)
 
On April 11,
2024, the Court entered Judgment for Defendant against Plaintiff in the total
amount of $5,565.00. 
 
On April 2,
2024, Defendant (now Judgment Creditor) filed an Application and Order for
Appearance and Examination — Enforcement of Judgment against Plaintiff (now
Judgment Debtor). 
 
On June 25, 2024, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s Motion to Modify Attorney Fees. 
 
On August 13, 2024, the Court held a hearing on the Judgment
Creditor's Application for Order for Appearance and Examination of the
Plaintiff/Judgment Debtor. Upon Plaintiff’s failure to appear as previously
ordered, a bench warrant was ordered and held until September 19, 2024, and
bail was set in the amount of $5,000.00. The hearing was continued to September
19, 2024.
 
On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Set Aside/Vacate
Judgment the Amount of Attorney Fees. Plaintiff seeks to set aside/vacate the
amount of attorney fees granted to Defendant on March 21, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.     
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks
an order vacating or setting aside the order granting attorneys fees to
Defendant on March 21, 2024. However, the Court finds the instant motion is an
improper motion for reconsideration.  (CCP § 1008.)   
 
The moving
party must present new facts, circumstances, or law to meet its burden on a
motion for reconsideration.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a); see
also Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.)  The
party seeking reconsideration of an order shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, what order or decisions were made, and what new or
different facts or circumstances are claimed to be shown.  (Code Civ.
Proc, § 1008.)  Further, “…the party seeking reconsideration must provide
not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the failure to
produce that evidence at an earlier time.”  (Glade v. Glade (1995)
38 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457.)  The legislative intent was to restrict
motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a party offers the court
some fact or circumstance not previously considered and some valid reason for
not offering it earlier.  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)  A disagreement with a ruling is not a new fact
that will support the granting of a motion for reconsideration.  (Id.) 
 
Here, the Court
has already heard Defendant’s motion for attorneys fees. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on March 19, 2024. After the motion was heard and argued, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion on March 21, 2024. 
 
In addition,
on April 29,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Modification of the Amount of Attorneys Fees
again requesting the Court to modify the amount of attorneys fees granted to Defendant. The
Court denied that motion on June 25, 2024.
 
In the
instant motion, Plaintiff does not present any new laws, facts, or
circumstances that would justify reconsidering the Court's previous holding. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment is DENIED.
 
III. CONCLUSION

 
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment is DENIED.
