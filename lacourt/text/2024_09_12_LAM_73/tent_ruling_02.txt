BACKGROUND
 
On June 7, 2022, Plaintiff Veronica Avery filed the instant action
against Defendants Catherine Belanger (“Catherine”), Benjamin Belanger,
Kannella, Inc. dba Re/Max All-Pro (Re/Max), and Does 1-10.
 
On October 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
alleging the following causes of action:

Fiduciary Duty
3.      Fraud
4.      Violation of
Business and Professions Code section 17200

The FAC
alleges that Plaintiff is an elder with dementia and cognitive decline, and
that Plaintiff suffered damages when Defendants took her home against her will
and forged her signature to complete the sale of her home to themselves at a
discounted price. 
 
On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted against Defendant Only Escrow, Inc., arguing:
·      
Plaintiff moves the Court for an Order
that the truth of each matter specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission,
Set One to Defendant, served on June 7, 2024, be deemed admitted and
established for all purposes in this action
·      
Plaintiff requests sanctions against Defendant and/or its counsel
in the amount of $2,000.
 
No opposition was filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
 When
a party fails to serve a timely response to a request for admission, the party
propounding the request for admission may move for an order to deem the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails
to provide a timely response waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or work product. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court
shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction… on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
B.     
Discussion
 
Here,
Plaintiff served Request for Admissions, Set One on Defendant Only Escrow, Inc. on June 7,
2024. (Carpinelli Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Defendant’s response was due on or before
July 9, 2024, however, no response has been served. (Ibid.)  Therefore, because a response
has not been served, the motion is granted. The truth of the matters specified in Request for Admissions,
Set One, are hereby deemed admitted.
 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions for counsel’s
work on the instant motion. Plaintiff requests a total of $2,000.00, representing
2 hours spent on the motion and 2 hours to draft a Reply and appear at the
hearing, at an hourly rate of $485, plus $60 for the filing fee. (Id. ¶ 4.)
 
The Court finds sanctions are warranted because
Defendant has failed to respond. However, since no opposition was filed, the
Court reduces the total award by $485.00 which represents one hour of Plaintiff
counsel’s hourly rate. Therefore, the Court awards sanctions in the total amount
of $1,515. 
 
DISPOSITION
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deem Request for Admissions, Set One, Admitted is GRANTED. The truth of the matters specified in Request for Admissions,
Set One, are hereby deemed admitted.
 
The
Court further GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant
in the reduced amount of $1,515.00.
Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Plaintiff within 30 days
of the date of this order.
