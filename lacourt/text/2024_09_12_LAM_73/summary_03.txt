And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment is DENIED. The Plaintiff, Kimi Kim, seeks to set aside/vacate the amount of attorney fees granted to the Defendant, Jacob Wooher, on March 21, 2024. However, the Court finds that the instant motion is an improper motion for reconsideration. The Plaintiff did not present any new laws, facts, or circumstances that would justify reconsidering the Court's previous holding. The Court has already heard the Defendant's motion for attorneys fees and denied the Plaintiff's Motion for Modification of the Amount of Attorneys Fees. Therefore, the Plaintiff's Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment is denied.
