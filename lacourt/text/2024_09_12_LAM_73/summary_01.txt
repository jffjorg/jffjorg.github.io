And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on all four causes of action. The plaintiff, Edward Chung, sued Palux Optics Corp. and its owner, Billy Lee, for breach of contract, failure to pay earned wages, failure to timely pay wages at time of termination, and wrongful termination and retaliation in violation of public policy.

The plaintiff alleged that he was employed by the defendant from January 2019 to March 2019, but was never paid for his work. The plaintiff provided an employment agreement and his own testimony to support his claims.

The judge found that the plaintiff had met his burden of proof and that there were no disputed issues of material fact. The defendant did not file an opposition to the plaintiff's motion and did not provide any evidence to dispute the fact that the plaintiff was not paid for his work.

As a result, the judge granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on all four causes of action, finding that the defendant had breached the employment agreement, failed to pay the plaintiff's wages, and wrongfully terminated his employment in violation of public policy.
