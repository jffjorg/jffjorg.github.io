And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to enter the defendant's default due to improper service of process. The plaintiff served the defendant by certified mail to the defendant's P.O. Box, which is not an official address. The plaintiff also failed to serve the defendant at the Chase Bank where the Chase Bank account is located. The judge finds that the plaintiff may be entitled to serve the summons and complaint by registered or certified mail sent to both the P.O. Box and the Chase Bank, but the plaintiff has not yet complied with this requirement.
