Defendant Jaime Equihua Garcia dba Equihua Store Fixtures Inc.
(“Defendant”) moves for orders compelling a response to Defendant’s Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One,
propounded on Plaintiff Carlos Jr. Galvan (“Plaintiff”). 
Defendant
also moves for “an order deeming as admitted Defendant’s Requests for
Admissions, Set One, propounded on Plaintiff,” as well as an “an order to
compel a response to the Requests for Admissions, produced [sic] on Plaintiff…”
Defendant seeks monetary sanctions in connection with each of the motions. 
Defendant’s motions will be continued to a
new date as set forth below. NO HEARINGS WILL TAKE PLACE ON APRIL 22,
2024.   
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court
orders the parties in this case to participate in an Informal Discovery
Conference (“IDC”). (Note:¿The Court’s policy regarding IDCs appears in the
Courtroom Information available in Dept. 50 and on the Court’s website.)¿Lead
or other designated counsel for the parties with full authority and any
self-represented party are ordered to participate in
person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel and/or any
self-represented party regarding available dates, Defendant must make a prompt reservation for the IDC using the
Court’s online reservation system. Defendant must
file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the department seven days prior to the
IDC, and the responding parties may file the same form in the department
setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.   
Once Defendant has
confirmed an IDC date, Defendant must use the
Court’s online reservation system to continue the motions to a post-IDC
discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to have with them whatever
materials are needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. Prior
to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the parties with full
authority and any self-represented party are
to meet and confer, in person or via telephone in a
further attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before the IDC. (See
CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve their discovery disputes
before the IDC date, Defendant is ordered to
take both the IDC and the motions off calendar as soon as possible. 
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
