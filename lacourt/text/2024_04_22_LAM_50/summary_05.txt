And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge, Judge Beaudet, discloses her personal experience with a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. She and her husband purchased the truck about 24 years ago and it was eventually refunded. Judge Beaudet does not believe this experience will influence her decision, but notes that if anyone believes it would, they can file a statement by May 2, 2024. The Case Management Conference will be continued to July 2, 2024 unless both parties waive the right to file the statement. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the disclosure to any new parties added to the case.
