Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants defendant's request to continue the motions to compel responses to requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and admissions to a new date. The court orders the parties to participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) to resolve their discovery disputes. The court also orders the parties to meet and confer prior to the IDC date. If the parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC date, the defendant is ordered to take the IDC and the motions off calendar as soon as possible.
