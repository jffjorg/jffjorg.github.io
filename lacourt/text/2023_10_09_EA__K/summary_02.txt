And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by one of the parties. The motion was filed on September 13, 2023, and served via mail and email on an unknown date. According to California law, the motion should have been served via email at least 16 court days before the hearing date, which is October 9, 2023. However, September 22, 2023 was a court holiday and is excluded from notice calculations. As a result, the judge determines that the motion was timely filed but not timely served, as it should have been served via email by September 12, 2023.
