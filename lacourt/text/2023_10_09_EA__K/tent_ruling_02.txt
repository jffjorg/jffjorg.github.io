[1]              The motion was filed (and served
via mail and email) on September 13, 2023 for hearing on October 9, 2023. Code
of Civil Procedure § 1005, subdivision (b) provides that “all moving and
supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the
hearing. . .” Further, Code of Civil Procedure § 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3)(B)
provides that “[a]ny period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or
make any response within any period or on a date certain after the service of
the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of
court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days. .
.” Friday, September 22, 2023 was a court holiday and is thus excluded
from notice calculations. Although the motion was timely filed, it should have
been served via email no later than September 12, 2023.
