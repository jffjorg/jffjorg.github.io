And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's complaint. The Plaintiff, Tabitha Daugherty, alleges that the Defendant, C&H Rental Properties LLC, is responsible for her injuries sustained on September 23, 2020, when her foot became caught in the buckled and loose carpet on the stairs of the rental property. The Plaintiff is seeking damages for negligence and breach of implied warranty of habitability. The Judge has sustained the Defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action, which is for breach of implied warranty of habitability, because the Plaintiff has not pled that the Defendant was given notice of the condition or given a reasonable time to correct the deficiency. The Judge will hear from counsel for the Plaintiff as to whether leave to amend is requested and will require an offer of proof if so.
