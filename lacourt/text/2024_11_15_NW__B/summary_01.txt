And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to augment or amend their expert witness list. The plaintiff had sought to substitute Philip L. Rosescu for their previously designated expert Leo Aladzhadzhyan, who has become unavailable for trial. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to meet their burden of showing that they could not have been expected, through reasonable diligence, to designate Rosescu as an expert witness at the time of the parties' witness exchange. The judge also imposed sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $630.00 for improperly seeking to augment their expert witness list on the eve of trial without substantial justification.
