And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion for leave to submit expert designation and to reopen expert discovery. The motion was filed after the Defendant realized that they had mistakenly believed that the trial continuance extended the expert discovery cut-off date. The Judge found that the Defendant satisfied the requirements for relief under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 2034.710, including failing to submit the expert witness information in a timely manner due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

The Judge also found that granting the motion would not unduly prejudice the Plaintiff, as the Defendant served the Plaintiff with the expert designation list more than two months before trial and provided notice of the deposition availability of at least one expert. The Plaintiff is not entitled to relief under CCP § 2034.710, as they did not demonstrate that they were unduly prejudiced by the Defendant's actions.

The Judge ordered that the Defendant make its designated experts immediately available for deposition and bear any costs associated with expediting the deposition transcript(s). The Judge also ordered that all expert discovery be completed fifteen days before trial, absent stipulation(s) by the parties to conduct expert discovery closer to trial.
