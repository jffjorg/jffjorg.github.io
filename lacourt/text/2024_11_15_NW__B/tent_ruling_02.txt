 Case Number:  21STCV47500    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2024    Dept:  B Re: 21STCV47500 Defendant’s Motion for Leave to Submit Expert Designation and to Reopen Expert Discovery[TENTATIVE] RULING:Defendant’s motion for leave to submit expert designation and to reopen expert discovery is GRANTED.I. BACKGROUNDThis action arises from a January 21, 2020, motor vehicle accident in which Plaintiff Nijat Raizyan-Tanha (“Plaintiff”) alleges to have sustained injuries when Defendant Corinne Rachelle Specter (“Defendant”) negligently operated her motor vehicle.On December 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant and Does 1 to 20 alleging two causes of action: (1) motor vehicle negligence; and (2) general negligence.On June 6, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On October 1, 2024, Defendant filed an ex parte application to reopen expert discovery and for leave to submit expert designation. On October 3, 2024, the Court denied the application, stating that Defendant failed to act diligently in moving for the emergency relief requested and that Plaintiff would be prejudiced in trial preparation if such relief were to be granted on an ex-parte basis so close to trial. (See October 3, 2024, Minute Order.)On October 4, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for leave to submit expert designation and to reopen expert discovery.On October 9, 2024, Defendant filed an ex parte application to advance or shorten time on the hearing of the instant motion. On October 10, 2024, the Court again denied the application, stating that it was in improper request for the Court to reconsider its denial of Defendant’s October 1, 2024, ex parte application.On October 17, 2024, Defendant filed a further brief in support of the instant motion.On October 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed their opposition.On November 4, 2024, Defendant filed their reply.A jury trial is set for December 9, 2024.II. LEGAL STANDARDA party who fails to submit expert witness information on the date specified in a demand may seek leave to submit that information on a later date. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2034.710(a).) Absent “exceptional circumstances,” the motion for permission to file a tardy list must be made early enough to permit deposing the identified experts before the 15–day cut-off on expert witness depositions. (CCP §§ 2034.710(b) and 2024.030.)The court may permit tardy submission of expert witness lists and information if the following conditions are satisfied:(a) The court has taken into account the extent to which the opposing party has relied on the absence of an expert witnesses list.(b) The court has determined that any party opposing the motion will not be prejudiced in maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits.(c) The court has determined that the moving party did all of the following:(1) Failed to submit the information as the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.(2) Sought leave to submit the information promptly after learning of the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.(3) Promptly thereafter served a copy of the proposed expert witness information described in § 2034.260 on all other parties who have appeared in the action.(d) The order is conditioned on the moving party making the expert available immediately for a deposition under Article 3 (commencing with § 2034.410), and on any other terms as may be just, including, but not limited to, leave to any party opposing the motion to designate additional expert witnesses or to elicit additional opinions from those previously designated, a continuance of the trial for a reasonable period of time, and the awarding of costs and litigation expenses to any party opposing the motion.(CCP § 2034.720.) The motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (CCP § 2034.710(c).)III. ANALYSISDefendant seeks leave to submit expert designation and to reopen expert discovery pursuant to CCP § 2034.710 because defense counsel mistakenly believed that the July 12, 2024, trial continuance extended expert discovery cut-off. (See Motion p. 2, ¶¶ 3 and 4.)Defendant’s Ex Parte ApplicationsPlaintiff argues that Defendant’s prior ex parte applications were denied on the merits and that Defendant’s instant motion is an improperly disguised motion to reconsider. However, the Court’s prior denials of Defendant’s applications were not on the merits. Rather, the Court simply declined to decide this matter on an ex parte basis without proper notice or full briefing. (See October 3, 2024, Minute Order.)Defendant’s Further Brief Filed on October 17The Court will consider Defendant’s further brief in support of the instant motion filed on October 17, 2024.Pursuant to CCP § 1005(b), all supporting papers for a noticed motion shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing date. Here, Defendant served and filed their further brief on October 17, 2024, 17 court days before the hearing as originally noticed. Therefore, Defendant timely filed their supporting brief pursuant to CCP § 1005(b).Meet and ConferDefense counsel alleges they did not become aware of their calendaring mistake until September 30, 2024. (Cote Decl. ¶ 6.) Defense counsel represents that, upon learning of their mistake, they immediately met and conferred with Plaintiff. (Ibid.; Exh. E [meet and confer emails].) Therefore, Defendant satisfies the meet and confer requirement under CCP § 2034.710(c).Defendant’s BurdenHere, Defense counsel believed the expert discovery cut-off date was continued with the new December 9, 2024, trial date. (Cote Decl. ¶ 6.) Defense counsel claims they were unaware of their mistake until September 30, 2024, when Defendant served their demand for exchange of expert witnesses and, in response, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendant that the time to exchange expert information had passed. (Ibid. at ¶ 5; Exh. C [September 30, 2024, emails].) As a result, on October 1, 2024, Defendant filed their first ex parte application to reopen expert discovery and for leave to submit expert designation. That same day, Defendant served adesignation of expert witnesses on Plaintiff. (Cote Decl. ¶¶ 8 and 9; Exh. E.) Therefore, Defendant meets all statutory requirements for relief under CCP § 2034.710.Potential Prejudice Against PlaintiffThe Court now considers whether granting the instant motion would unduly prejudice Plaintiff. (CCP § 2034.710(a) and (b).)Granting this motion would not unduly prejudice Plaintiff. Defendant served Plaintiff with their expert designation list on October 1, 2024, more than two months before trial. (Cote Decl. ¶ 7; Exh. D [expert designation list].) On October 4, 2024, Defendant provided Plaintiff with the deposition availability of at least one expert, and anticipated the availability of their two other experts, to be confirmed shortly thereafter. (Ibid. at ¶ 10; Exh. F [October 4, 2024, correspondence].) All experts will be produced at least 15 days prior to trial. Additionally, defense counsel is willing to take the deposition of Plaintiff’s experts at any time prior to trial, even if those depositions occur within two weeks of trial.Furthermore, Defendant’s expert designations do not constitute surprise. In 2023, Defendant noticed exams of Plaintiff by Defendant’s orthopedic and plastic surgery experts. (Cote Decl. ¶ 11; Exh. G [exam demands].) Finally, in July 2024, defense counsel told Plaintiff’s counsel in certain terms: “We will not designate [experts] on the date listed in your demand, but will designate consistent with CCP 2034.230(b).” (Cote Decl. Exh. A [July 25, 2025 correspondence].) Therefore, even if Defendant provided an untimely expert designation list, Plaintiff knew of Defendant’s intention to rely on experts. In Plunkett v. Spaulding (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 114, the Court held that, although Defendant had relied on the absence of the physician at issue in the exert designation, there was no prejudice to Defendant since they had anticipated non-expert testimony from the physician at issue. (Plunkett, 52 Cal.App.4th at 136.) The same can be said here for Defendant’s proposed experts. Therefore, Plaintiff is not unduly prejudiced.IV. CONCLUSIONDefendant’s motion for leave to submit expert designation and to reopen expert discovery is GRANTED. Defendant is to make its designated experts immediately available for deposition and to bear any costs associated with expediting the deposition transcript(s). All expert discovery is to be completed fifteen days before trial, absent stipulation(s) by the parties to conduct expert discovery closer to trial.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
