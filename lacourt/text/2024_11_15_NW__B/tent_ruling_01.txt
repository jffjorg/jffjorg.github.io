  Case Number:  20STCV49669    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2024    Dept:  B Re: 20STCV49669 Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Augment or Amend Expert Witness List[TENTATIVE] RULING:Plaintiff’s motion for leave to augment or amend their expert witness list is DENIED.I. BACKGROUNDThis action arises from an August 11, 2020, incident in which Plaintiff Amelia Linares (“Plaintiff”) alleges to have sustained serious injuries from Defendants Roberto Garcia doing business as (“dba”) Garcia’s Tires, Roberto Garcia (“Garcia”), Garcia’s Wheels and Tires (“Garcia’s Wheels”), and Does 1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”)’s negligence when a car lift fell down and smashed Plaintiff’s foot.On December 30, 2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants alleging two causes of action: (1) general negligence; and (2) premises liability.On April 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint identifying Montemax Properties, LLC (“Montemax”) as Doe 3.On June 6, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective as of June 24, 2024.On October 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for leave to augment or amend their expert witness list, seeking to substitute Philip L. Rosescu (“Rosescu”) for Plaintiff’s previously designated expert Leo Aladzhadzhyan (“Aladzhadzhyan”).On November 1, 2024, Montemax filed their opposition.On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amended motion.A jury trial is set for November 15, 2024.II. LEGAL STANDARDTo obtain leave to amend or augment an expert witness list, moving party must show either that (1) it could not have been expected in the exercise of reasonable diligence to call the expert at the time of the original exchange, or (2) the failure was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2034.620(c).) Further, the Court must consider any prejudice to the opposing parties caused by reliance on the initial expert information of the witnesses already provided. (CCP § 2034.620(a) and (b).) As such, relief must be sought promptly after deciding to call the expert. (CCP § 2034.620(c)(2)(A).)The type of cognizable prejudice which the Court considers is opposing party’s reliance on a previous list of experts, such that they are not prepared and cannot be prepared in time for trial. (Dickison v. Howen (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1471, 1479.) Courts do not weigh that new experts might give testimony unfavorable to the opposing party. (Ibid.) “The decision to grant relief from the failure to designate an expert witness is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. . .” (Ibid. at 1476.)“A motion under subdivision (a) shall be made at a sufficient time in advance of the time limit for the completion of discovery under Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 2024.010) to permit the deposition of any expert to whom the motion relates to be taken within that time limit. Under exceptional circumstances, the court may permit the motion to be made at a later time.” (CCP § 2034.610(b).) Additionally, the motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under § 2016.040. (CCP § 2034.610(c).)III. ANALYSISPlaintiff’s Amended MotionAs a preliminary matter, the Court will not consider Plaintiff’s amended motion filed on November 13, 2024. Pursuant to CCP § 1005(b), all moving and supporting papers shall be filed at least 16 court days prior to the hearing of a noticed motion. Here, Plaintiff improperly filed their amended motion only two court days before the hearing.Meet and ConferPlaintiff’s counsel made a good faith effort to meet and confer with opposing counsel. (Zeesman Decl. ¶ 9.) On October 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s and opposing counsel exchanged emails in which opposing counsel indicated that they would not stipulate to further designation. (Ibid.; Exh. D [October 16, 2024, correspondence].) Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer in accordance with § 2034.610(c), and timely filed the instant motion on the following day.Plaintiff’s BurdenPlaintiff argues that they could not have been expected, through reasonable diligence, to designate Rosescu as an expert witness at the time of parties’ witness exchange. Plaintiff contends they only seek to add Rosescu as a substitute for previously designated expert Aladzhadzhyan, who has since become unavailable for trial. (Zeesman Decl. ¶¶ 7 and 8.)It’s unclear whether Plaintiff promptly sought relief after deciding to substitute Rosescu. Plaintiff does not explain why Aladzhadzhyan is now unavailable for trial or when they learned of his unavailability. Additionally, when Plaintiff initially brought their motion, trial was scheduled to take place on October 21, 2024. The trial did not commence on that date and is now scheduled for November 15, 2024. Plaintiff failed to provide any supplementaldeclarations as to Aladzhadzhyan’s unavailability for the continued trial. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to meet their burden under CCP § 2034.620.SanctionsPursuant to CCP § 2023.030(a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both.”Here, Plaintiff sought to augment their expert witness list on the eve of trial without substantial justification. Therefore, the Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel, payable to Montemax’s defense counsel within 20 days of this Order, in the amount of $630.00. (See Byrge Decl. ¶ 4.)IV. CONCLUSIONPlaintiff’s motion for leave to augment or amend expert witness information is DENIED. Sanctions in the amount of $630.00 are awarded.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
