And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to deem the truth of matters stated in requests for admissions as admitted, and to compel responses to form interrogatories and requests for production. The motion was brought by the defendant, Cynthia Harris, against the plaintiffs, Charles Quick and Gerald Yates.

The Judge granted the defendant's motion to deem the truth of matters stated in requests for admissions as admitted, and ordered the plaintiff, Charles Quick, to pay sanctions in the amount of $787.50. The Judge also granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and requests for production, and ordered the plaintiff, Gerald Yates, to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days. The Judge ordered the plaintiff, Gerald Yates, to pay sanctions in the total amount of $1,575.00.

The Judge found that the plaintiffs failed to respond to the requests for admissions and form interrogatories and requests for production, despite being served with them, and that this failure was a misuse of the discovery process. The Judge therefore ordered the plaintiffs to pay sanctions as a result of their failure to comply with the discovery requests.
