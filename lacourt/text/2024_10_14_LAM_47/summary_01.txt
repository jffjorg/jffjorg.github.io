And here is the text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in limine filed by the defendants. The first motion seeks to exclude any evidence not disclosed during discovery, but the judge denies this motion without prejudice, stating that the defendants have not identified any specific evidence that should be excluded and have not demonstrated a right to an exclusion order. The second motion seeks to exclude evidence, witnesses, or claims related to the liability of certain defendants for breach of contract, but the judge denies this motion, stating that the defendants have not identified any specific evidence that should be excluded and have not shown that any non-disclosure by the plaintiff was willful or that the failure to disclose violated a court order. The third motion seeks to preclude witnesses from the courtroom unless they are testifying, and the judge grants this motion, excluding all witnesses from observing the trial until after their testimony, except for the plaintiff, individual defendants, and a designated representative for each entity defendant.
