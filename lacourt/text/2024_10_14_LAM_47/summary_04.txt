And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for relief from the requirement to present a timely government claim. The plaintiff, Seong Eun Park, sustained injuries after tripping over construction debris on a sidewalk and failed to present a government claim within the six-month deadline. The plaintiff's counsel claimed that the error was due to a mistake in categorization, but the judge found that the counsel did not demonstrate good cause for relief. The judge noted that the counsel did not explain what work was done on the case between October 2023 and April 2024, and that the case "languished" until counsel reviewed photos of the location seven months after retention. The judge concluded that the plaintiff's counsel did not act with reasonable diligence and therefore failed to demonstrate mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
