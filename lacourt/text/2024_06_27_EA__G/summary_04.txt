And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims. The plaintiff, Oliver Summers, filed a PAGA complaint against the defendants, Superior Herbal Health, LLC and SHL-El Monte, LLC, alleging Labor Code violations. The defendants argued that the plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement with Superior Herbal Health, LLC that covers individual claims, and that the court should stay the litigation pending arbitration. The judge found that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and that the plaintiff's individual claims are subject to arbitration. The judge also found that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies, allowing the defendants to compel arbitration of the individual claims. The judge denied the plaintiff's argument that the arbitration of individual claims would bar litigation of the representative claims, citing recent Supreme Court and California Court of Appeal cases. The judge granted the motion to compel arbitration and stayed the litigation pending arbitration of the individual claims.
