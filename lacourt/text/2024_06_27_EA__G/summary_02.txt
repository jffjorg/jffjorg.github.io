And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer by the Makin Defendants (Makin International, Inc., Ashley Mason, LLC, Wade Leener, and Michelle Mulleneaux) to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) is sustained with twenty (20) days leave to amend. The judge found that the FAC is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, specifically the four-year statute of limitations for breach of a written contract. Although the plaintiffs (Gladden Makin House LTD and Derek Wong) argued that the breach occurred later in 2019 and that the COVID-19 pandemic tolled the statute of limitations, the judge found that these arguments rely on extraneous facts that were not pleaded or alleged in the FAC. Therefore, the court is limited to the four corners of the FAC and cannot consider these arguments. The judge granted the Makin Defendants' demurrer, but allowed them to amend their complaint within twenty (20) days.
