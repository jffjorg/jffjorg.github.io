 Case Number:  23PSCV00063    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  G Defendants Makin  International, Inc.; Ashley Mason, LLC; Wade Leener; and Michelle Mulleneaux’s Demurrer  to First Amended Complaint Respondent: Plaintiffs  Gladden Makin House LTD and Derek Wong TENTATIVE RULING Defendants Makin  International, Inc.; Ashley Mason, LLC; Wade Leener; and Michelle Mulleneaux’s Demurrer  to First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to amend. BACKGROUND This  is a breach of contract action arising from international shipping agreements.  Plaintiff Gladden Makin House, Ltd. (Gladden) is a Hong Kong corporation  engaged in the business of exporting textiles from China to the United States.  Gladden worked with textile factories in China and an export shipping company  in Hong Kong to fulfill orders from California businesses that include Swat  Fame, Inc. (Swat Fame), Defendant Dear John Denim, Inc. (Dear John), and  Defendant Ashley Mason, LLC (Ashley Mason). Defendant Makin International, Inc.  (Makin) served as an intermediary for Swat Fame and Dear John by forwarding  their orders and payments to Gladden while Ashley Mason dealt directly with  Gladden. In  August 2017, Ashley Mason attempted to cancel a shipment from Gladden but after  receiving the shipment, Ashley Mason allegedly accepted it and refused to  tender any payment. Makin also allegedly retained payments from Swat Fame that  were meant for Gladden. During the same month, Makin’s president and CEO,  Defendant Wade Leener, reached out to the Chinese factories and shipping  company that worked with Gladden to convince them to work directly with Makin  by falsely claiming Gladden was going to shut down. On  January 9, 2023, Plaintiffs Gladden and Derek Wong filed a complaint against  Defendants Makin, Ashley Mason, Dear John, Leener, Michelle Mulleneaux, Chiu  Fai Yeung, and Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach  of contract, (2) breach of contract with third-party beneficiary, (3)  conversion, and (4) intentional interference with contractual relations.¿On  April 18, 2023, the Court sustained a demurrer by Dear John and Yeung to  Gladden and Wong’s Complaint. On  May 8, 2023, Gladden and Wong filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the  same defendants and Does 1-20 alleging the same causes of action. On October  13, 2023, the Court sustained a demurrer by Dear John and Yeung to the FAC. On  November 8, 2023, Gladden and Wong dismissed Dear John and Yeung from the  present action. On January 24, 2024, Gladden and Wong dismissed all Doe  Defendants and their request for punitive damages from the present action. On April  2, 2024, Makin, Ashley Mason, Leener, and Mulleneaux (collectively, the Makin  Defendants) filed the present demurrer. Prior to filing on March 27, 2024, the  Makin Defendants’ counsel met and conferred telephonically with Gladden and  Wong’s counsel and was unable to reach a resolution. (Goldberg Decl., ¶ 7.) A hearing  on the demurrer is set for June 27, 2024, along with an OSC Re: Default/Default  Judgment and case management conference. ANALYSIS The  Makin Defendants demur to the entire FAC on the grounds that (1) it is barred  by the applicable statute of limitations and (2) insufficiently pled. For the  following reasons, the court SUSTAINS their demurrer on statute of limitations grounds  with leave to amend. Legal Standard A  party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.  (e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn  v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering  demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT  Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding,  the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial  notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,  994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other  extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face  of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court  (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing  is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,  states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.) “A  demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may  be, but is not necessarily, barred. [Citation.] In order for the bar of the  statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and  affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the  complaint shows that the action may be barred.” (Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn  & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403.)  The statute of  limitations for a breach of a written contract is generally four years from the  date of breach. (Code Civ. Proc., § 337, subd. (a); Piedmont Capital  Management, L.L.C. v. McElfish (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 961, 968, 970.) A  cause of action for conversion must be brought within three years (Code Civ.  Proc., § 338, subd. (c)(1)) while the statute of limitations for a cause of  action for intentional interference with contractual relations is two years  (Code Civ. Proc., § 339, subd. (1).) Discussion In  this case, the FAC alleges Makin and Ashley Mason breached their contracts with  Gladden by failing to make payments on goods that were delivered. (FAC, ¶  49-50.) In August 2017, the FAC alleges Ashley Mason accepted delivery of goods  from Gladden and failed to remit payment. (FAC, ¶ 37.) In the same month, the  FAC alleges Makin committed breach of contract and conversion by refusing to  transfer funds received from Swat Fame that were due to Makin. (FAC, ¶ 38, 54,  60.) Last, the FAC alleges Makin and Leener committed intentional interference  with contractual relations by telling Gladden’s factory and shipping partners  to cease their work with Gladden in August 2017. (FAC, ¶ 40, 43, 64-65.) Based  on the above allegations, the FAC appears to be time-barred as the present  action was not filed until January 9, 2023, which is more than five (5) years  after August 2017. In opposition, Gladden and Wong argue this period was  subject to tolling during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Opp., p. 4:19-5:21.) In 2020,  statutes of limitations over 180 days were tolled from April 6, 2020, to  October 1, 2020. (Cal. Rules of Court, App’x I, Rule 9.) This tolling, however,  does not save Gladden and Wong’s action since they missed the four (4) year  statute of limitations by more than a year. In  opposition, Gladden and Wong argue the breach of contract occurred later in  July 2019 because the Makin Defendants kept stalling on payments and making  promises to pay until they allegedly repudiated their obligations in July 2019.  (Opp., p. 4:11-20.) Plaintiffs further claim they did not discover the alleged  interference with their contractual obligations until 2022. (Opp., p. 6:10-21.)  These arguments, however, rely on additional facts that were not pled or  alleged in the FAC. Since the court is limited to the four corners of the FAC,  these extraneous allegations cannot be considered by the court. Accordingly,  the Makin Defendants’ demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the  Makin Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days  leave to amend.
