```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Tesla's motion to compel binding arbitration in this Song-Beverly action. The case is stayed pending completion of arbitration. The judge found that Tesla has established the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate, which is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Soliman did not dispute or even mention the applicability of the FAA.

The judge rejected Soliman's arguments that the arbitration provision is unconscionable, including claims that it is a contract of adhesion and that it waives Soliman's rights under the Song-Beverly Act. The judge found that the arbitration provision is enforceable and that Soliman failed to establish any defenses to its enforcement.

The judge also rejected Soliman's argument that the arbitration provision does not flow from the sale of the vehicle, finding that the provision applies to any dispute arising out of or relating to the relationship between Soliman and Tesla.

Overall, the judge's ruling is based on the principle that arbitration agreements are valid and enforceable unless they are revocable for reasons under state law that would render any contract revocable, including fraud, duress, and unconscionability.
