And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case was dismissed without prejudice on June 26, 2023, due to no party appearing for trial. The Plaintiff filed the motion to set aside the dismissal on October 11, 2023, within six months of the dismissal. The Plaintiff's counsel has filed a declaration attesting to his neglect in missing the trial date due to recovering from a heart attack. The Court finds that the dismissal must be set aside as the Plaintiff's counsel has provided a valid reason for the dismissal. The Court will calendar an OSC re dismissal for failure to file proof of service and give notice to the parties.
