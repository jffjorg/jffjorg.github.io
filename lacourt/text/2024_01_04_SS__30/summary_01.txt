And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of non-party witness Fawn Bishop. The Plaintiff has requested to compel the deposition of Fawn Bishop, citing that she gave confusing and contrasting answers during the deposition and that Plaintiff's counsel became combative and argumentative. The Defendant argues that the deposition was suspended due to harassment by Plaintiff's counsel and that they have no control over Fawn Bishop. The Judge has denied the motion to compel the deposition without prejudice due to lack of service and notice on the deponent of the deposition itself and this motion. The Judge has also denied the request for sanctions as no statute or law is cited to support the request.
