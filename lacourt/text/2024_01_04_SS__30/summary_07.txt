And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the answer filed by the defendant, Mr. Furleys, LLC, et al. The plaintiff, Devereaux, demurred to the answer arguing that the affirmative defenses fail to state sufficient facts and the pleading is uncertain. The court has reviewed the pleadings and the arguments presented by both parties.

The court finds that the defendant's answer does not fail to state sufficient facts to put the plaintiff on notice of the defenses alleged. The affirmative defenses identified by the plaintiff are either traverses that do not need to plead new matter, or state general allegations of ultimate fact when read together with the complaint. The court also finds that the answer is not so bad that the plaintiff cannot reasonably respond.

Therefore, the court overrules the demurrer to the affirmative defenses. The court also notes that the plaintiff's complaint states that the plaintiff was attacked by unknown individuals, and the plaintiff expects the defendant to identify these individuals in its answer. The court finds that the answer is sufficient to put the plaintiff on notice of the basis for the defendant's defenses.

The court further finds that the demurrer for uncertainty is not sustained, as the answer is not so bad that the plaintiff cannot reasonably respond. The court notes that any ambiguity or uncertainty in the answer may be clarified under modern discovery procedures.

The ruling is tentative and is subject to change after further review and submissions by the parties.
