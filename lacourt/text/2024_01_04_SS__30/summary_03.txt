And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is in response to Defendant AIDS Healthcare Foundation's motions to compel Plaintiff David Garvin to provide responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The Court grants the motions and orders Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests served on him within 20 days of this order. The Court also denies Defendant's request for sanctions, as the motions were not opposed and the Plaintiff did not misuse discovery. The ruling is based on the fact that Defendant properly served discovery requests on October 5, 2022, and Plaintiff failed to provide responses by November 7, 2022. The Court cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2023.010, and 2023.030 in its decision.
