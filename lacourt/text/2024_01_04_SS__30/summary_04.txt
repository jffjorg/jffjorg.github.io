(CCP § 426.50)
  - "A very strong showing of bad faith on the part of the defendant is required before a court will be justified in denial of leave to file or amend a cross-complaint." (Sidney v. Superior Court (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d at 710, 718)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff is granted. The cross-complaint must be filed within 10 days of this order and notice must be given to the moving party. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same transaction, namely the vehicle collision at issue. The judge also finds that there is no showing of bad faith on the part of the defendant, and therefore, the motion must be granted. The judge notes that the defendant's counsel did not provide a reasonable explanation for the extended delay in seeking leave to amend, but this is not sufficient to support denial of the motion absent some evidence of bad faith.
