And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Costco Wholesale Corporation in response to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Evelin Liseth Gonzalez Rodriguez, Brianna Magali Martinez Gonzalez, Andy Ruben Martinez, and Aliyah Liseth Martinez Gonzalez. The FAC alleges negligence, strict liability—warning defect, strict liability—design defect, fraudulent concealment, and breach of implied warranties against Costco and other manufacturers of artificial stone and natural stone countertops. The complaint alleges that Wilmer Ruben Martinez Paredes, the deceased husband of Evelin Liseth Gonzalez Rodriguez, was exposed to respirable crystalline silica, metals, and other toxins while working with these products and developed various medical conditions, including silicosis, pulmonary fibrosis, progressive massive fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, and other medical conditions, which led to his death.

Costco demurs to the FAC's concealment claim, arguing that it is conclusory and fails to state sufficient facts. The court agrees and sustains the demurrer, but will hear arguments on whether to grant leave to amend. Costco also moves to strike the FAC's references to punitive damages and a phrase requesting damages for "other stone products to be identified through the course of discovery." The court grants the motion to strike the punitive damages claim because there are no allegations in the FAC that rise to the level of malice, fraud, or oppression. However, the court denies the motion to strike the phrase requesting damages for "other stone products" because it is a nonissue given the specific products already identified in the FAC.
