Defendant Goal Properties Investments seeks to compel Plaintiff Family Christian Cathedral to provide initial responses to its special interrogatories (“SI”), set three, and requests for production, set two.Defendant Goal Properties Investments also seeks to compel further responses to its SI, set two, from Plaintiff Family Christian Cathedral.With respect to initial responses, Plaintiff indicates that responses were served on April 8, 2024. Defendant argues that the responses are “nonsensical” and that “Plaintiff Dr. Jynonna Norwood cannot and should not be allowed to be responding to discovery requests on behalf of an entity, as the Court previously agreed.”  Because responses were provided when Plaintiff was unrepresented, the Court deems the responses a nullity.  The two Motions to Compel initial responses are granted.  Responses, without objections, are to be served within 30 days.  The Court awards reduced sanctions in the total amount of $1,250.As to further responses for SI, set two, Plaintiff argues the Motion is untimely.  This lacks merit; there was an agreement by former counsel that “the deadline should be stayed until we can work this out (or not).”  Furthermore, the record clearly shows meet and confer attempts through at least February 2024 when the Motion was filed.Because Plaintiff has failed to address the propriety of its responses, the Motion to Compel is granted.  Further responses are to be provided within 30 days.  The Court awards reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,250.Moving party to give notice. If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
