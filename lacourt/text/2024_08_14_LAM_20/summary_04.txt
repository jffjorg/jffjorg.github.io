And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Goal Properties Investments and Family Christian Cathedral. Goal Properties Investments is seeking to compel Family Christian Cathedral to provide initial responses to special interrogatories and requests for production. The judge finds that the initial responses provided by Family Christian Cathedral are invalid since they were served when the plaintiff was unrepresented. As a result, the judge grants the motion to compel initial responses and orders the plaintiff to provide responses without objections within 30 days. The judge also awards reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,250.

Additionally, Goal Properties Investments is seeking to compel Family Christian Cathedral to provide further responses to special interrogatories. The judge finds that this motion is timely and grants it, ordering the plaintiff to provide further responses within 30 days. Again, the judge awards reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,250.

The judge notes that counsel should submit on the tentative ruling and recommends that counsel use LACourtConnect rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
