And here is the English summary:

The Judge, Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Sheila Elizabeth Merrill. The Defendant, KKR Investment Properties, filed the motion after Plaintiff failed to appear for a deposition. Although Defendant served a notice of deposition on Plaintiff, Plaintiff's counsel did not provide alternative dates for the deposition. The Court finds that the Defendant did not meet the requirement of Section 2025.450(b)(2) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires a meet and confer declaration before filing a motion to compel deposition. The Court will not grant the motion until this requirement is met, especially since Plaintiff is now representing herself in the case. The denial is without prejudice, meaning that Defendant can re-file the motion with the required meet and confer declaration.
