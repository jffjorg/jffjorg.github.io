Zeta Global Corp.
v. Socialcom, Inc., Case No. 19SMCV01066
Hearing Date
October 24, 2023 
Plaintiff Zeta’s
Motion to Increase Bond 
 
On February 15,
2023 after court trial, the court issued a net judgment in favor of Zeta for
$1,682,652. Defendant AudienceX appealed on February 28, 2023. On June 16, 2023
AudienceX noticed and executed an appeal bond of $2,373,978, one and a half
times the judgment, as required under Code of Civ. Proc. §917.1. On July 18, 2023
the court issued a minute order awarding Zeta $731,817.10 in attorney’s fees.
Zeta moves to increase the bond to reflect the attorney fees award.
 
Under Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc.§917.1, an appeal stays enforcement of a judgment if the appellant
posts a bond for one and one-half times the amount of the judgment if it is
given by an admitted surety insurer. In an action where a bond is given, the
court may order the bond increased if the bond has “become insufficient because
the sureties are insufficient or because the amount of the bond is
insufficient.” Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §996.010. 
 
When a motion for
new bond is made under section 996.010, moving party is not “entitled to have a
new undertaking which is in its aggregate one and one-half times (or two times)
the amount of the judgment, and accumulated appellate costs and post judgment
interest,” but “the amounts of such interest and costs are proper factors for
the trial court to consider in ruling on a motion pursuant to section 996.010.”
Grant v. Superior Court (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 929, 938. A party moving
for a new bond must “demonstrate a real, substantial possibility, not just
speculation, that the current bond ‘is or has from any cause become
insufficient[.]’” Id. 
Since attorney’s
fees are considered extraordinary costs, a motion to increase an undertaking to
reflect an award of attorney’s fees after the initial judgment is properly
granted. E.g., Chamberlin v. Dale’s R. Rentals, Inc. (1986) 188
Cal.App.3d 356, 362.
 
Zeta argues the
bond is insufficient because, after the court’s attorney fees award, it no
longer represents 1.5 times the judgment. 
 
Socialcom cites
grant Grant, arguing the attorney’s fee award alone cannot constitute
“good cause” for an increased bond. Socialcom argues the 150% undertaking
requirement already factors in post-judgment accumulation of costs and interest,
and the attorneys fee award – as a cost—need not be calculated when determining
the amount of the bond.
 
A party moving
under §996.010 is not entitled to a new undertaking of one-and-one-half times
the judgment amount whenever new costs accumulate. However, per Chamberlin, an
award of attorney’s fees is not a typical or incidental cost. Since the
attorney’s fees award becomes part of the underlying judgment, per Chamberlin,
this is good cause to increase the bond under §996.010. GRANTED. Bond
increased to a total of $3,471,703.65.
