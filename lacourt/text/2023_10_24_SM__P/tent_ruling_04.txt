Rice v. City of
Culver City et al., Case No. 23SMCV01306
Hearing Date
October 24, 2023
Chang’s Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel for Darren Ron Rice (UNOPPOSED) 
 
Hazel Chang, Esq.
moves to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Rice. The application includes
all the correct judicial council forms – MC-051-MC-053 – and the proof of
service indicates it was served on Rice and opposing counsel.
 
Chang seeks to be
relieved because of a “[b]reakdown in attorney-client relationship due to
inability to communicate with client. No longer able to see eye-to-eye with
client and effectively prosecute the action.” Chang decl., pg. 1.  This is a valid reason for withdrawing. There
are no hearings scheduled other than the hearing for this motion and a case
management conference, scheduled for 10/24. Rice is unlikely to suffer undue
prejudice if the motion is granted. GRANTED.
