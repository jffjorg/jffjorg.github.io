Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for post-judgment attorney's fees and a motion to tax costs. The case involves Mashian Law Group and R Chapter 3, LLC, with Cohen being a party to both judgments. The judge finds that both judgments included attorney's fees awards, and therefore, Mashian and MLG are entitled to attorney's fees incurred enforcing the judgments. The judge also finds that the one judgment rule does not apply in this case, as the judgments were entered after all issues had been resolved as to one party.

The judge grants Mashian's motion for post-judgment attorney's fees in the amount of $17,575 and MLG's motion for post-judgment attorney's fees in the amount of $4,250. The judge also grants in part R3 and Cohen's motion to tax costs, taxing $750 from the MLG memorandum for an inadequately justified title report fee. The judge denies the motion to tax costs as to the Mashian memorandum.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 685.40, 1033.5, and 1717, as well as various case citations, including Kinsmith Financial Corp. v. Gilroy, Nguyen v. Calhoun, and Ladas v. Cal State Automobile Ass'n.
