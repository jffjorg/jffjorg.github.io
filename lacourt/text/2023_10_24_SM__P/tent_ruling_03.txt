Acevedo v.
Herrera, Case No. 23SMCV00608
Hearing Date
October 24, 2023 
Plaintiff
Acevedo’s Motions to Compel Response to Written Discovery, Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted and Sanctions (UNOPPOSED) 
 
Plaintiff Acevedo
served special and form interrogatories, requests for production of documents
and requests for admission on defendant on April 27, 2023. Herrera, in pro per,
failed to respond. Acevedo moves to compel responses and to deem the requests
admitted. Herrera stated to the court at the prior hearing that she was
attempting to get her insurance carrier to step in to represent her, and the
lawyer she was speaking to advised her not to respond.
 
Responses were due
within 30 days of service. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §§2033.250(a), 2030.260(a),
2031.030(c). Herrera did not respond to any of the requests by the due date of
May 27, 2023. Vardanyan decl. ¶3. Plaintiff meets the burden to show Herrera
failed to respond to proper discovery. The motions to compel are granted.
Additionally, reasonable sanctions are mandatory since Herrera does not oppose
the motion and has provided no excuse for her failure to respond. 
 
Acevedo requests $811.65
for each of the four motions, three hours of attorney work at $250/hr. plus
filing fees. Cumulatively awarding three hours’ worth of attorney’s fees for
each motion would be duplicative and excessive, as the motions were brief and
involved no complicated issues. The motion is GRANTED. The issue of sanctions
is deferred, pending a decision from the insurance company as to whether
defendant will be represented.
