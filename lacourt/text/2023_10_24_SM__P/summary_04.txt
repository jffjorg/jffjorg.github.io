This tentative ruling is regarding Hazel Chang's motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Darren Ron Rice. Chang is seeking to withdraw due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, citing an inability to communicate with Rice and see eye-to-eye on the case. The motion includes all required judicial council forms and was properly served on Rice and opposing counsel. The court finds that Rice is unlikely to suffer undue prejudice if the motion is granted, and therefore, the motion is GRANTED. The next hearing is scheduled for October 24, 2023, which will also include a case management conference.
