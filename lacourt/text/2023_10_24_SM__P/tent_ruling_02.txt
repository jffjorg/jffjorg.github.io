Mashian Law/Mashian’s
Motion for Post Judgment Attorney’s Fees
Cohen and R
Chapter 3, LLC’s Motion to Tax Costs 
 
On December 2, 2021
cross-defendant Mashian obtained a judgment for $56,153.99 in attorney’s fees
and costs (Mashian judgment) against cross-complainants R Chapter 3, LLC (R3)
and Cohen. On February 3, 2023 plaintiff/cross-defendant Mashian Law Group
(MLG) obtained a judgment of $75,000 (MLG judgment) against defendant RC3. Mashian
seeks $17,575 in post-judgment attorney’s fees and $4,256.23 in post judgment
costs. MLG seeks $4,250 in post-judgment attorney’s fees and $1,109.05 in post
judgment costs.  
 
R3 and Cohen
oppose the attorney’s fees requests and move to tax costs filed in connection
with both judgments. 
 
Motion for
Attorney’s Fees
Under Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. §685.40, reasonable attorney’s fees incurred to enforce a judgment
are recoverable if the underlying judgment contained an attorney’s fees award.
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §685.040. Both the Mashian and MLG judgments included
attorney’s fee awards. See Stanton decl., exhs. 1 & 2. Per CCP
§685.40, Mashian and MLG are entitled to attorney’s fees incurred enforcing the
judgment.
 
R3 and Cohen argue
it was improper for the court to enter separate judgments for Mashian and MLG,
arguing this violated the one judgment rule, rendering both judgments void and
improper as the basis for post-judgment fees.  
 
The one judgment
rule is a “principle of appellate practice that prohibits review of
intermediate rulings by appeal until final resolution of the case.” Kinsmith
Financial Corp. v. Gilroy (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 447, 452. The one judgment
rule does not apply when a judgment is entered that leaves no issue to be
determined as to one party. Nguyen v. Calhoun (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th
428, 437. 
 
The December 2,
2021 Mashian judgment resolved all issues as to Mashian. He is not a plaintiff
in the complaint; he was named as a cross-defendant by R3 and Cohen. On April
14, 2021, the court granted Mashian’s motion for summary adjudication as to all
causes of action against him in the cross-complaint, resolving all claims
against him. Since there were no remaining issues as to Mashian, the 12/2/2021
entry of judgment was proper under Nguyen to enter separate judgments
for Mashian and MLG. Cohen and R3’s arguments based on the one final judgment
rule fail. 
 
MLG and Cohen also
argue the Mashian judgment does not include attorney’s fees, so Mashian is not
entitled to post-judgment fees. After prevailing on his MSA, Mashian moved for
attorney’s fees under the parties’ retainer agreement. The court determined the
retainer’s attorney fee provision applied to the cross-complaint and awarded
Mashian contractual fees per Code of Civ. Proc. §1717. See 11/12/2021
minute order, pg. 2. That ruling was incorporated into the December 12, 2021
judgment, which included a fee award. Mashian is entitled to post-judgment
attorney’s fees. 
 
Cohen and R3’s attorney
Waecker states both judgments were satisfied by August 2023 at the latest.
Waecker decl. ¶4. He identifies a $65,000 payment on July 21, 2023 and a pair
of payments totaling $75,000 on August 23, 2023. The Mashian parties do not
dispute receiving these amounts, but state that, after including interest and
post judgment fees/costs, the judgments are not yet fully satisfied. The court
reviewed the calculations of interest and credits underlying the declaration of
Mashian’s attorney Stanton and found they are accurate. See Stanton
reply decl. ¶¶2-16. As the judgments have not been fully satisfied,
post-judgment attorney’s fees are still available.
 
Finally, Cohen and
R3 argue the enforcement fees requested by the Mashian parties are excessive.
They object to two specific fee categories –1.4 hours spent preparing for a judgment
debtor examination conducted by an attorney other than Stanton, and 3.95 hours
spent preparing for and attending a mandatory settlement conference (MSC),
which Waecker contends was unrelated to judgment enforcement. 
 
Time spent on a
judgment debtor exam is recoverable as a post-judgment enforcement fee. The Cohen
ORAP was conducted by attorney Daly. Stanton reply decl. ¶17. Fees Daly
incurred are recoverable, as they represent attorney time spent enforcing a
judgment. MSC fees are recoverable since much of the September 1, 2022 MSC was
dedicated to negotiating payment of the Mashian judgment. Fees incurred preparing
for and attending the MSC constitute recoverable post-judgment enforcement
fees. Stanton decl. ¶15. 
 
GRANTED. Mashian
awarded $17,575 in post judgment attorney’s fees, MLG awarded $4,250 in
post-judgment fees. 
 
Motion to Tax
Costs 
On August 11, 2023,
the Mashian parties filed two memorandums of costs. The memorandum associated
with the MLG judgment seeks $1,109; the memorandum associated with the Mashian
judgment seeks $4,256.23. R3 and Cohen move to tax. 
 
There are three
categories of costs under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §1033.5: allowable,
disallowable and discretionary. If a party seeks allowable costs, the objecting
party has the burden of proof of demonstrating they are not reasonable and
necessary; requesting party has the burden of proof for discretionary costs. Ladas
v. Cal State Automobile Ass’n. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774. 
 
R3 and Cohen argue
three filing fees incurred in connection with the MLG judgment “appear to be
unnecessary and cumulative,” and the memorandum of costs fails to explain why
the first fee was $83.54, while the second two fees are $21.77 and $20.74. An
invoice from One Legal confirms the amounts. Stanton decl., exh. 7. Filing fees
are allowable costs under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §1033.5, and the objecting
parties fail to meet their burden to show they were unnecessary. 
 
R3 and Cohen
object to $750 for a title report. The Mashian parties’ opposition to the
motion does not explain why the report was a necessary post-judgment cost. A
title report is not a specifically allowable cost under §1033.5. As a
discretionary cost, the Mashian parties have the burden to show it was
reasonable and necessary and fail to carry that burden. The $750 is taxed.
 
Finally, R3 and
Cohen object to ORAP fees incurred in connection with the Mashian judgment,
arguing the fees were unnecessary since Waecker agreed to voluntarily schedule Cohen’s
debtor’s exam. Stanton states the offer to produce Cohen was made July 21, 2023
after costs were already incurred, including those associated with the August
5, 2022 ORAP. Stanton supplemental decl. ¶7. This is supported by invoices and
copies of Waecker’s July and August 2023 letters offering to produce Cohen
voluntarily. Stanton supplemental decl. ¶7, exhibits 11-4. The ORAP costs are
recoverable. 
 
The motion to tax
costs is GRANTED in part as to the MLG memorandum, which will be taxed by $750
representing an inadequately justified title report fee. The motion is DENIED
as to the Mashian memorandum.
