And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shafner v. Zackery, Case No. 23SMCV03220. The case involves allegations that Zackery, a business partner of Shafner, misappropriated partnership funds for personal use. Zackery has requested a protective order and bifurcation of the trial, with phase one addressing whether a 50/50 partnership existed and whether Zackery embezzled funds, and phase two addressing remaining liability issues and damages.

The Judge has denied Zackery's request for bifurcation, finding that the proposed phases are interrelated and require the same evidence. The Judge also denied Zackery's request for a protective order, as the matter is not bifurcated and there will be no "phase one" to complete. The Judge notes that Shafner cannot prove Zackery's liability without extensive discovery into Zackery's finances, and that liability and damages are intertwined and require evidence regarding misappropriation of funds.

The Judge concludes that bifurcation would create a risk of duplicative trials and repetition of evidence, and that the proposed phases are not conducive to economy or efficiency. The case is set for hearing on October 24, 2023.
