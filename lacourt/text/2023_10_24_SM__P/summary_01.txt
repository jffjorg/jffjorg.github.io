Significant Statements:

Since the attorney's fees award becomes part of the underlying judgment, per Chamberlin, this is good cause to increase the bond under §996.010."
  - "GRANTED. Bond increased to a total of $3,471,703.65."

The Court has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Zeta Global Corp. v. Socialcom, Inc. regarding Zeta's motion to increase the bond.
