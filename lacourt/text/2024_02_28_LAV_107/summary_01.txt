And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by GTO Security. The court has found that the demurrer is the inappropriate means of attacking the punitive damages of the FAC, and has granted the motion to strike punitive damages. The court has also overruled the demurrer as moot.

The court has determined that GTO Security's actions, including having advance knowledge of the unfitness of Reducindo Oliva and employing him with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, do not qualify as "oppression, fraud, or malice" under California Civil Code section 3294. The court has also found that the FAC does not plead sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages against GTO Security.

The court has ordered that the plaintiffs may amend their complaint to plead sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages.
