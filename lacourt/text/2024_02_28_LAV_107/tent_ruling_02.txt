[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE:]
 
 
Motion #1 is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
 
Motion #2 is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
 
Motion #3 is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
On
December 30, 2020, plaintiffs Miguel de Santiago Salcedo (“Miguel”) and Armando de Santiago
Salcedo (“Armando” and, together with Miguel, “Plaintiffs”) purchased a certain
2020 Ford Escape (the “Vehicle”) for personal use from a retailer. (Complaint
pp. 2–3.) In connection with their purchase of the Vehicle, Plaintiffs received
an express written warranty from Ford Motor Company (“Defendant” and together
with Plaintiffs, “Parties”), the manufacturer and/or distributor of the
Vehicle, that provided that Defendant would repair any defects that developed
within a certain amount of time (the “Warranty Period”). (Ibid.) During
the Warranty Period, several defects developed, but Defendant did not
adequately repair the Vehicle, replace the Vehicle, or repurchase the Vehicle.
(Id., pp. 2–4; Motion #1 p. 1.) Plaintiffs filed a complaint (the
“Complaint”) against Defendant on May 22, 2023 alleging various causes of
action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly”).
 
On October 4, 2023,
Plaintiffs propounded discovery requests upon Defendant. (Whitman Decl. #1 3:13.)
On November 6, 2023, Defendant responded. (Id., 3:14.)
 
On December 27, 2023, Parties
met and conferred over the phone about the discovery requests and responses. (Id.,
4:19; MacLear Decl. #1 2:4.)
 
On January 11, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further response to special interrogatories
(“Motion #1”), a motion to compel further response to requests for production
of documents (“Motion #2”), and a motion to compel verified further response to
a form interrogatory (“Motion #3”).
 
On February 13, 2024,
Defendant opposed Motion #1 (via “Opposition #1”) and Motion #3 (via
“Opposition #3”), and the following day, Defendant opposed Motion #2 (via
“Opposition #2”). On February 20, 2024, Plaintiffs replied to Opposition #1
(via “Reply #1”), and the following day, Plaintiffs replied to Opposition #2
(via “Reply #2).
 
PARTIES’ POSITIONS
 
I. The Motions
 
Motion
#1 seeks further responses to several special interrogatories, which relate to “(1)
those related to the identities of individuals who inspected and/or repaired
the [] Vehicle; (2) the number of days that the [] Vehicle was out of service
for warranty repairs; (3) the steps taken to permanently repair the [] concerns
that were presented to [Defendant’s] authorized repair facilities; and (4)
[Defendant’s] investigation, root cause analysis, and proposed repairs for the
Sensor, Infotainment, and Transmission concerns.” (Motion #1 p. 1.) Plaintiffs
contend that Defendant’s November 6, 2023 responses were little more than
“boilerplate objections and evasive, non-code-compliant responses.” (Id.,
p. 4.) Plaintiffs explain they have attempted to meet and confer with Defendant
regarding the responses, but Defendant “vehement[ly]” refused to explain their
objections, evidencing Defendant’s bad faith. (Id., pp. 5–6.) Defendant
“is thumbing its nose at the Discovery Code” by refusing to provide updated
responses to the special interrogatories. (Id., p. 8.) Plaintiffs
observe that the scope of discovery is broad and argue that “general or
boilerplate objections are not proper objections” and they may not be
“indiscriminately raise[d] [] to evade [Defendant’s] discovery obligations.” (Id.,
p. 6.) Plaintiffs further contend that their discovery requests were relevant
to their ability to prove the causes of action they bring. (Id., pp.
6–7.)
 
Motion
#2 seeks further response to a request for production of documents, which
relate to “[Defendant’s] internal investigation and analysis of the [d]efects
plaguing [the Vehicle] and establishing that Defendant previously knew of such
[d]efects but nevertheless refused to repurchase the [V]ehicle.” (Motion #2 p.
1.) Plaintiffs content that Defendant responded with “nothing more than
‘boilerplate’ objections” “and evasive, non-code-compliant responses,” which
are “meritless” and which evidence Defendant’s bad faith. (Id., pp. 1–2,
6.) Plaintiffs assert that Defendant is certainly conducting investigations
into vehicle defects like Plaintiffs’ and that its request for production of
documents sought documents related thereto. (Id., pp. 4–5.) But, “not a
single email, memo, or internal communication was produced.” (Id., p.
6.) Also, because Defendant “failed to make any attempt to articulate the basis
of its burden objection, Defendant has waived any objections it may assert
relating to [electronically stored information].” (Ibid.) Plaintiffs
reiterate that the scope of discovery is broad and that boilerplate objections
“fall far short of the required standards.” Plaintiffs contend that the
requested documents are relevant and necessary to prove their causes of action
under Song-Beverly. (Id., pp. 11–12.) Plaintiffs further contend that “courts
routinely compel production of the same information and documents as requested
here[] when the defect at issue[] is a common one alleged by consumers.” (Id.,
pp. 12–15.)
 
Motion
#3 seeks a verified further response to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1. (Notice of
Motion #3 p. 2.) Plaintiffs contend that Defendant’s November 6, 2023 responses
were little more than “boilerplate objections and evasive, non-code-compliant
responses,” which Plaintiffs describe as “especially concerning considering
Defendant made numerous allegations that there were no nonconformities in the
[] Vehicle, that any concerns in the [] Vehicle were the result of Plaintiffs’
abuse, alteration, and/or unauthorized use, but [Defendant] refuses to provide
any information to support these allegations.” (Motion #3 p. 4.) Plaintiffs
reiterate that the scope of discovery is broad, that boilerplate objections are
not proper objections, and that Defendant’s “failure to provide adequate
responses…evinces a lack of good faith.” (Id., pp. 5–6.) Plaintiff
further argues that “[t]he requested information is relevant to the issues
related to Defendant’s good faith compliance with the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act, including breach of the express warranty and implied warranty of
merchantability.” (Id., p. 7.) Finally, “Form Interrogatories are
judicially approved interrogatories, and thus Defendant’s boilerplate
objections are meritless.” (Id., p. 9.)
 
II. The Oppositions
 
Opposition
#1 contends that “[b]ecause [Defendant’s] responses and objections to [the
special interrogatories] were Code-compliant and complete at the time of
service, no further response is required.” (Opposition #1 p. 2.) Defendant
argues that Motion #1 “disregards the information contained within
[Defendant’s] discovery responses and document production, misrepresents the
information contained within the records produced, and overlooks the facts of
this case.” (Ibid.) For each special interrogatory for which Plaintiffs
seek further responses, Defendant describes its objections and prior production.
(Id. at pp. 3–7.) Defendant contends that “independently-owned dealerships
are not [Defendant’s] agents” and therefore “information regarding
independently-owned dealerships [] exceeds the information in [Defendant’s] possession”
and therefore need not be produced by Defendant. (Id. at p. 4.) Finally,
Defendant states that the special interrogatories seek “information based on
Ford’s review, analysis and interpretation of the records provided to it by
Plaintiffs or the dealership after litigation commenced, which is clearly
protected by the work-product doctrine and attorney-client privilege.” (Id. at
p. 8.) 
 
Opposition
#2 argues that Defendant has already produced “reasonable and proportional
discovery” and that “[a]ny additional information beyond what [Defendant]
already produced would be unduly burdensome, overly broad, and irrelevant.”
(Opposition #2 p. 2.) Defendant believes that Motion #2 should be denied
firstly because Plaintiffs’ use of repetitive statements in its separate
statement incorporating another request for production or lack of statements
fails to comply with California Civil Rule of Court 3.1345. (Id. at pp.
4–5.) Defendant describes documents it already produced or offered to produce.
(Id. at p. 5.) “The remaining Requests at issue in this Motion…seek all
documents relating to specific Technical Service Bulletins or Field Service
Actions” including those not performed on the Vehicle,” for which “[Defendant] produced
a list of all [Technical Service Bulletins] and Field Service Actions
applicable to the [Vehicle] and offered to produce specific ones sought by
Plaintiffs” to no response. (Id. at pp. 5–6.) Defendant argues that
Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden of setting forth “specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought. (Id. at p. 6; Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) Defendant further argues that Plaintiffs’ “catchall
request[s]” “lack reasonable particularity” and are “overly broad.” (Opposition
#2, supra, pp. 6–7.) Because “[n]one of the [Plaintiffs’ r]equests
are limited to information relating to the Plaintiffs’ claims in this case, the
[Vehicle] (or any other reasonable vehicle scope), or the repairs at issue,”
they are “overly broad, unduly burdensome, and seek irrelevant documents,”
especially given that Defendant does not have a central database it may search
for this information. (Id. at pp. 7–8.) And, Plaintiffs use a
“particularly obnoxious” tactic “by applying external definitions in an attempt
to disguise overly broad discovery [r]equests.” (Id. at p. 8, quoting
but improperly citing Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223.) Finally, Defendants ask that Motion #2 “be
denied to the extent it seeks documents protected by [Defendant’s]
attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine objections.” (Id. at
pp. 8–9.)
 
Opposition
#3 argues that Motion #3 “should be denied because [Defendant’s] [a]nswer to
this Interrogatory is code-compliant and provides the information sought, and
because Plaintiffs have not shown good cause to require further response.”
(Opposition #3 p. 2.) Defendant contends that the form interrogatory at issue “seeks
facts and identification of documents and witnesses to support Ford’s
preservation of affirmative defenses and its general denial” of the Complaint.
(Id. at p. 3.) Defendant explains that at the time it answered the form
interrogatories, “it had not yet deposed Plaintiffs or inspected the [Vehicle],”
so it responded “by identifying documents known to it at the time of serving
responses which contain information supporting Ford’s general denial and
reservations of affirmative defenses.” (Id. at pp. 4–5.) “Further, Ford
provided a list of specifically identified documents that support Ford’s
defenses and/or denials and produced documents identifying witnesses with
information to support Ford’s defenses.” (Id. at p. 5.)
 
III. The Replies
 
Plaintiffs’
arguments may be found in Reply #1 and Reply #2 and are not repeated here.
 
PROCEDURE
 
I. Timeliness
 
All
motions to compel further responses to written discovery must be brought within
45 days of receiving the challenged responses, or as otherwise agreed upon in
writing.  (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(c), 2031.310(b)(1),
2033.290(c).)  This deadline is jurisdictional, and courts are without
authority to grant untimely motions.  (Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)
 
Here,
Defendant responded to all of Plaintiffs’ discovery requests on November 6, 2023. Plaintiffs
received Defendant’s signed verifications on November 17, 2023. Forty-five days
after this date was January 1, 2024, but Parties agreed in writing to extend
the deadline for Plaintiffs to file their motions to compel further until
January 9, 2024. (Motion #1 “Exhibit 7.”) Plaintiffs filed all three Motions on
January 9, 2024, and thus, the Motions are timely.
 
II. Meet and Confer Requirement
 
Motions
to compel further responses must always be accompanied by a “meet and confer” declaration
evidencing a “reasonable and good faith attempt an informal resolution of each
issue presented by the motion.”  (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040,
2030.300(b), 2031.310(b)(2), 2033.290(b).) 
 
Here,
both Parties submit declarations by their counsel that they exchanged written
communications, then met and conferred over the phone on December 27, 2023
about the discovery requests and responses. (Whitman Decl. #1 4:17–19; MacLear
Decl. #1 2:4.) This court is therefore satisfied that this requirement has been
met.
 
ANALYSIS
Unless
otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with this title, any
party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is
relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the
determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) Discovery may
relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other
party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)
“Relevant
evidence is defined in Evidence Code section 210 as evidence ‘having any
tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of
consequence to the determination of the action.’ The test of relevance is
whether the evidence tends logically, naturally, and by reasonable inference to
establish material facts. The trial court has broad discretion in determining
the relevance of evidence but lacks discretion to admit irrelevant evidence.” (Donlen
v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 148, internal quotations and
citations omitted; see also Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th
92, 97 [“[I]n the context of discovery, evidence is relevant if it might
reasonably assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or
facilitating a settlement.”].)
A
court “retains the discretion to weigh the burden of compliance against the
likelihood of producing helpful information, to avoid duplicative production,
and to narrow demands if appropriate to balance the reasonable concerns of both
parties.” (Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Superior Court (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 1481, 1497.) “[Discovery] statutes must be construed liberally in
favor of disclosure unless the request is clearly improper by virtue of
well-established causes for denial.” (Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court In
and For Merced County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 377.) But, “discovery, like all
matters of procedure, has its ultimate and necessary boundaries.” (Columbia
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1968)
263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19.)
 
I. The Interrogatories
 
A
party on whom interrogatories are propounded is required to refer to all
sources of information that are under the party's control. CCP § 2030.220(a)–(b).
A responding party’s duty also encompasses the requirement that it make a
reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information sought by the
interrogatory, except where that information is readily available to the
propounding party. (Regency Health Services, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1998) 64 Cal. App.4th 1496, 1504; Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 782 [“If a party is unable to fully answer it should set forth
the efforts made to secure the information.”].) If an interrogatory cannot be
answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible. (CCP §
2030.220(b).) 
 
If
the responding party responds with inappropriate objections or evasive or
incomplete answers, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300.) A motion to compel further
is properly brought to challenge “boilerplate” responses to special
interrogatories. (Best Products, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 119
Cal.App.4th 1181, 1190; see also Hernandez v. Superior Court (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 285, 294.) The responding party bears the burden of justifying any
objection or insufficient answer to a special interrogatory. (Coy v.
Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–21 [“Defendants here had the
burden of showing facts from which the trial court might find that the
interrogatories were interposed for improper purposes. The statute does not
require any showing of good cause for the serving and filing of
interrogatories.”].) “Nevertheless, if interrogatories are reasonably subject
to objection as calling for the disclosure of matters so remote from the
subject matter of the action as disclosed by the issues framed by the pleadings
as to make their disclosure of little or no practical benefit to the party
seeking the disclosure or if to answer them would place a burden and expense
upon the parties to whom the interrogatories are propounded which should be
equitably borne by the propounder or if the interrogatories are so framed as to
require the disclosure of relevant as well as irrelevant matter, the trial
court in the exercise of its discretion may refuse to order such interrogatories
answered.” (Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior Court for Los
Angeles County, supra at 19.)
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 5
 
Parties
dispute whether independently owned authorized Ford dealerships and the
technicians at those dealerships are agents of Defendant. However, regardless
of the answer to that question, Defendant has produced sufficient documents
related to the inspection and repair of the Vehicle. To the extent that more
detailed information about the identities and contact information of
technicians is in the possession of the local Ford dealership, either Party may
contact the dealership with equal burden. Therefore, Defendant is not required
to do so on Plaintiffs’ behalf. 
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 5 is denied.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 18
 
This
interrogatory is not objectionable by virtue of it being a contention
interrogatory. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010, subd. (b).) Plaintiffs seek a
number answer and Defendant appears to refuse to provide one. We agree with
Defendant that this interrogatory presupposes that the Vehicle was ever out of
service because of Plaintiff’s definition of “sensor defect,” which includes an
admission that the Vehicle had certain defects and admissions of what concerns
are identified in the Vehicle’s repair history, which Defendant disputes.
Moreover, Defendant produced in response certain documents “that contain
information related to the total number of calendar days that the subject
vehicle was out of service by reason of repair.” Defendant has fully responded
to this interrogatory.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 18 is denied.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 19
 
Again,
we agree with Defendant that this interrogatory presupposes that the Vehicle
was ever out of service because of Plaintiff’s definition of “sensor defect,”
which includes an admission that the Vehicle had certain defects and admissions
of what concerns are identified in the Vehicle’s repair history, which
Defendant disputes. Defendant “answered these interrogatories based on the
information presently known to it by identifying and producing the specific
documents in which responsive information can be found.” If Plaintiffs want a
copy of the Vehicle’s repair manual, they may specifically seek such. Defendant
has fully responded to this interrogatory.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 19 is denied.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 23
 
We
agree with Defendant that this interrogatory presupposes that the Vehicle was
ever out of service because of Plaintiff’s definition of “infotainment defect,”
which includes an admission that the Vehicle had certain defects and admissions
of what concerns are identified in the Vehicle’s repair history, which
Defendant disputes. Moreover, Defendant produced in response certain documents
“that contain information related to the total number of calendar days that the
subject vehicle was out of service by reason of repair.” Defendant has fully
responded to this interrogatory.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 23 is denied.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 24
 
Again,
we agree with Defendant that this interrogatory presupposes that the Vehicle
was ever out of service because of Plaintiff’s definition of “infotainment
defect,” which includes an admission that the Vehicle had certain defects and
admissions of what concerns are identified in the Vehicle’s repair history,
which Defendant disputes. Defendant “answered these interrogatories based on
the information presently known to it by identifying and producing the specific
documents in which responsive information can be found.” Defendant has fully
responded to this interrogatory.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 24 is denied.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 28
 
We
agree with Defendant that this interrogatory presupposes that the Vehicle was
ever out of service because of Plaintiff’s definition of “transmission defect,”
which includes an admission that the Vehicle had certain defects and admissions
of what concerns are identified in the Vehicle’s repair history, which
Defendant disputes. Moreover, Defendant produced in response certain documents
“that contain information related to the total number of calendar days that the
subject vehicle was out of service by reason of repair.” Defendant has fully
responded to this interrogatory.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 28 is denied.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 29
 
Again,
we agree with Defendant that this interrogatory presupposes that the Vehicle
was ever out of service because of Plaintiff’s definition of “transmission
defect,” which includes an admission that the Vehicle had certain defects and
admissions of what concerns are identified in the Vehicle’s repair history,
which Defendant disputes. Defendant “answered these interrogatories based on
the information presently known to it by identifying and producing the specific
documents in which responsive information can be found.” Defendant has fully
responded to this interrogatory.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 29 is denied.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 41
 
Defendant
contends it “identifyi[ed] and produc[ed] the specific documents in which
responsive information can be found,” but Plaintiffs content that “these
documents do not have any relationship to the information which this
Interrogatory seeks.” Plaintiffs seek “the actual analyses, tests, studies,
investigations, etc. that relate to the SENSOR DEFECT,” and we are persuaded
that Plaintiffs show good cause and establishes the relevance of this request
to its claims. We therefore do not consider Defendant’s objection that this
interrogatory is irrelevant. Again, we agree with Defendant that this
interrogatory presupposes that the Vehicle was ever out of service because of
Plaintiffs’ definition of “sensor defect,” but we believe that Defendant may
condition its answers so that it produces responsive information without
conceding to Plaintiffs’ definition of “sensor defect.” Defendant further
objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it “seek[s] expert opinions
and the premature disclosure of information developed by [Defendant’s] experts
and consultants,” but we observe that “the information and opinions of the
expert [r]elevant to his status as a witness may be discovered through
interrogation and deposition procedures.” (Sigerseth v. Superior Court
(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 427, 433.) We agree with Defendant that the request is
overly broad, and we therefore limit it to a reasonable time period from before
the events at issue in this case took place to the present. Finally, Defendant
notes that it “did not perform repairs or service the [Vehicle]” and “also
objected to the extent that these Interrogatories seek information that is not
within [Defendant’s] possession, custody, or control.” However, we do not read
this interrogatory to refer to the repairs or service performed on the Vehicle
and believe Defendant may produce responsive information that is within its
possession, custody, or control.
 
We
note that the form of this interrogatory is not in compliance with Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.060(f), which bars special interrogatories from having
subparts.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 41 is granted
but limited to a reasonable time period from before the events at issue in this
case took place to the present.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 42
 
Defendant
contends it “identifyi[ed] and produc[ed] the specific documents in which
responsive information can be found,” but Plaintiffs content that its response
“is deficient and the objections are improper.” We are persuaded that
Plaintiffs show good cause and establishes the relevance of this request to its
claims. We therefore do not consider Defendant’s objection that this
interrogatory is irrelevant. Again, we agree with Defendant that this
interrogatory presupposes that the Vehicle was ever out of service because of
Plaintiffs’ definition of “sensor defect,” but we believe that Defendant may
condition its answers so that it produces responsive information without
conceding to Plaintiffs’ definition of “sensor defect.” Defendant further
objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it “seek[s] expert opinions
and the premature disclosure of information developed by [Defendant’s] experts
and consultants,” but we observe that “the information and opinions of the
expert [r]elevant to his status as a witness may be discovered through
interrogation and deposition procedures.” (Sigerseth v. Superior Court, supra
at 433.) We agree with Defendant that the request is overly broad, and we
therefore limit it to a reasonable time period from before the events at issue
in this case took place to the present. Finally, Defendant notes that it “did
not perform repairs or service the [Vehicle]” and “also objected to the extent
that these Interrogatories seek information that is not within [Defendant’s]
possession, custody, or control.” However, we do not read this interrogatory to
refer to the repairs or service performed on the Vehicle and believe Defendant
may produce responsive information that is within its possession, custody, or
control.
 
We
note that the form of this interrogatory is not in compliance with Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.060(f), which bars special interrogatories from having
subparts.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 42 is granted
but limited to a reasonable time period from before the events at issue in this
case took place to the present.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 43
 
This
interrogatory asks Defendant for its assessment of the “sensor defects” in the
Vehicle. Plaintiffs respond that it “does not contend there is a sensor defect
in the [Vehicle].” Defendant has fully responded to this interrogatory.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 43 is denied.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 45
 
Defendant
contends it “identifyi[ed] and produc[ed] the specific documents in which
responsive information can be found,” but Plaintiffs content that its response
“is deficient and the objections are improper.” We are persuaded that
Plaintiffs show good cause and establishes the relevance of this request to its
claims. We therefore do not consider Defendant’s objection that this

The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 45 is granted
but limited to a reasonable time period from before the events at issue in this
case took place to the present.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 46
 
Defendant
contends it “identifyi[ed] and produc[ed] the specific documents in which
responsive information can be found,” but Plaintiffs content that its response
“is deficient and the objections are improper.” We are persuaded that
Plaintiffs show good cause and establishes the relevance of this request to its

Civ. Proc. § 2030.060(f), which bars special interrogatories from having
subparts.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 46 is granted
but limited to a reasonable time period from before the events at issue in this
case took place to the present.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 47
 
This
interrogatory asks Defendant for its assessment of the “infotainment defects”
in the Vehicle. Plaintiffs respond that it “does not contend there is an
infotainment defect in the [Vehicle].” Defendant has fully responded to this
interrogatory.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 47 is denied.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 49
 
Defendant
contends it “identifyi[ed] and produc[ed] the specific documents in which
responsive information can be found,” but Plaintiffs content that its response
“is deficient and the objections are improper.” We are persuaded that
Plaintiffs show good cause and establishes the relevance of this request to its
claims. We therefore do not consider Defendant’s objection that this
interrogatory is irrelevant. Again, we agree with Defendant that this
interrogatory presupposes that the Vehicle was ever out of service because of
Plaintiffs’ definition of “transmission defect,” but we believe that Defendant
may condition its answers so that it produces responsive information without
conceding to Plaintiffs’ definition of “transmission defect.” Defendant further
objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it “seek[s] expert opinions
and the premature disclosure of information developed by [Defendant’s] experts
and consultants,” but we observe that “the information and opinions of the
expert [r]elevant to his status as a witness may be discovered through
interrogation and deposition procedures.” (Sigerseth v. Superior Court, supra
at 433.) We agree with Defendant that the request is overly broad, and we
therefore limit it to a reasonable time period from before the events at issue
in this case took place to the present. Finally, Defendant notes that it “did
not perform repairs or service the [Vehicle]” and “also objected to the extent
that these Interrogatories seek information that is not within [Defendant’s]
possession, custody, or control.” However, we do not read this interrogatory to
refer to the repairs or service performed on the Vehicle and believe Defendant
may produce responsive information that is within its possession, custody, or
control.

Special
Interrogatory No. 50
 
Defendant
contends it “identifyi[ed] and produc[ed] the specific documents in which
responsive information can be found,” but Plaintiffs content that its response
“is deficient and the objections are improper.” We are persuaded that
Plaintiffs show good cause and establishes the relevance of this request to its
claims. We therefore do not consider Defendant’s objection that this

but limited to a reasonable time period from before the events at issue in this
case took place to the present.
 
Special
Interrogatory No. 51
 
This
interrogatory asks Defendant for its assessment of the “transmission defects”
in the Vehicle. Plaintiffs respond that it “does not contend there is a
transmission defect in the [Vehicle].” Defendant has fully responded to this
interrogatory.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 51 is denied.
 
Accordingly, Motion #1 is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
 
Form
Interrogatory No. 15.1
 
The
form interrogatory at issue seeks background information that parties are
generally entitled to in any action. Form interrogatories are approved by the
Judicial Council and entail “fundamentally routine” discovery
information.  (Puerto v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th
1242, 1250.)
 
Form
Interrogatory No. 15.1 asks the responding party to 
 
Identify
each denial of a material allegation and each special or affirmative defense in
your pleadings and for each: 
 
(a)
state all facts upon which you base the denial or special or affirmative
defense; 
 
(b)
state the names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have
knowledge of those facts; and 
 
(c)
identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support your denial or
special or affirmative defense, and state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone
number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT.
 
In
its response, Defendant identifies its general denial and affirmative defenses
by reference to its answer to the Complaint. Defendant identifies the facts
upon which it bases that denial and those affirmative defenses as the “various
tests, inspections, and evaluations to validate that the subject vehicle did
not exhibit any problems that would adversely impact the vehicle's use, value,
or safety” employed by Defendant “throughout each phase of design and
production.” Defendant further identifies and says it will produce specific
documents that it will use to support its defenses.
 
Plaintiffs
argue that “Defendant’s response to No. 15.1 is unresponsive[] because it does
not identify witnesses that can support Defendant’s Affirmative Defenses by
name and address.” Defendant states in its response to Form Interrogatory No.
15.1 that “employees [of Defendant] or other individuals identified in the
records referenced herein can be contacted through counsel of[ ]record or
through their employer” and then provides addresses for itself and Plaintiff’s
local Ford dealership and a phone number for the dealership. However, offering
to produce identification of and contact information for witnesses, but
seemingly only those witnesses who happen to be its employees, when asked in
the future is not the same as producing identification of and contact
information for those witnesses, as Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 demands.
Defendant should not wait for its counsel of record to be asked for Defendant’s
witnesses’ contact information; Defendant is being asked to produce that
information now. Defendant should at least identify and provide contact
information for those witnesses who are Defendant’s employees in its response.
If Defendant can identify and provide contact information for those witnesses
who are the employees of the dealership or who are otherwise not Defendant’s
employees, it should share that information with Plaintiffs in its response. 
 
The
motion to compel further response to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 is granted.
 
Accordingly, Motion #3 is GRANTED.
 
II. Production of Documents
 
If the party on whom a
request for production of documents is propounded responds with inappropriate
objections, incomplete compliance, or an inadequate, incomplete, or evasive
representation of inability to comply, the demanding party may move for an
order compelling further response to the demand. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310.) Like for special interrogatories,
a motion to compel further is properly brought to challenge “boilerplate”
responses to requests for production. (Best Products, Inc. v. Superior Court,
supra at 1190.) The burden is on the moving party to show both
relevance to the subject matter and specific facts showing good cause justifying
discovery. (Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.)  Once good cause
is established by the moving party, the burden then shifts to the responding
party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Hartbrodt v.
Burke (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 168, 172–174.) The moving party must file
evidence, such as a declaration showing good cause based on specific facts that
the requested matter is admissible evidence or appears reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of such evidence. (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.
Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223–24.) Declarations are generally used to
show good cause by reference to specific facts regarding relevance.  (Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct.
(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1138, 1141.) However, a bare showing of “good cause” is
insufficient to compel production of materials constituting attorney work
product, some of which may be ordered disclosed only if the moving party can
demonstrate injustice or unfair prejudice. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2018.030.) Where the responding party has
refused to provide electronically stored information (“ESI”) on the grounds
that its source is “not reasonably accessible because of the undue burden or
expense,” the responding party bears the burden of demonstrating this on a
motion to compel. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(d).) 
 
Requests
for Production Nos. 16–18, 20–24, 26–30, and 32–33
 
We
agree with Defendant that these requests are overbroad in that they seek “all
documents” including ESI and e-mails regarding the sensor, infotainment, and
transmission systems in all vehicles of the same make, year, and model as the
Vehicle. (Southerland Decl. pp. 2–7.) Even if the moving party establishes good
cause, these requests would be defeated by Defendant’s objection on the grounds
of undue burden or expense. Defendant has produced sufficient responsive
documents.
 
The
motion to compel further response to Requests for Production Nos. 16–18, 20–24,
26–30, and 32–33 is denied.

The
motion to compel further response to Requests for Production No. 40 is granted
only as to TSB No. 20-2363.

further responses without substantial justification.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300(d), 2031.310(h), 2033.290(d).)  Because none are
requested, NO SANCTIONS shall issue.
