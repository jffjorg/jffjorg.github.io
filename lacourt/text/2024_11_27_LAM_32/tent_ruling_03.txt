     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant city of los angeles’ motion
  for judgment on the pleadings 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff
Juventino Rojas filed this action against Defendants County of Los Angeles,
City of Los Angeles, and Los Angeles Unified School District. The complaint
asserts (1) negligence, (2) premises liability, and (3) dangerous condition of
public property. The action stems from personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff
after tripping on a sidewalk. 
            On October 28, 2024, Defendant City
of Los Angeles filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A motion for judgment on the pleadings may
be made on the same grounds as those supporting a general demurrer, i.e., that
the pleading fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a legally cognizable
claim or defense. (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.) A
motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general
demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings
or by matters that can be judicially noticed. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman
Corp. (1999) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) Judgment on the pleadings must be
denied where there are material factual issues that require evidentiary
resolution. (Schabarum v. Calif. Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205,
1216.)  
DISCUSSION
            Under the Government Claims Act, “failure
to timely present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars a
plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity.” (State of California
v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239.) “[F]ailure to allege facts
demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation requirement
subjects a claim against a public entity to a demurrer for failure to state a
cause of action.” (Ibid.)
            “Although a government claim need
not contain the detail and specificity required of a pleading in a civil
action, it nevertheless must ‘fairly describe what [the] entity is alleged to
have done.’” (Hernandez v. City of Stockton (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1222,
1231.) “When a civil action is filed following the rejection of a government
claim, it is acceptable for the complaint to elaborate or add further details
to a government claim, but the complaint may not completely ‘shift [the]
allegations’ and premise liability on facts that fundamentally differ from
those specified in the government claim.” (Ibid.) “In other words, the
factual basis for recovery in the complaint must be ‘fairly reflected’ in the
government claim.” (Ibid.) 
            Here, Plaintiff’s government claim
alleged the following: 
 
“On or about
August 14, 2023, Mr. Rojas was walking on the sidewalk located across from 2217
S. Gramercy Pl, Los Angeles, CA 90018, which was abutting Interstate 10
freeway. As he was lawfully walking, he tripped and fell as a result of an
uneven/defected sidewalk, causing him to land directly on his face, left arm
and knee.”
(Def.’s
RJN, Ex. A.) 
            Plaintiff’s complaint alleges the
following:
 
“At all relevant
times herein mentioned, Plaintiff was lawfully walking on a sidewalk located at
or near Joseph Widney High School, 2302 S. Gramercy Pl, Los Angeles, CA 90018.”
  
(Compl.
¶ 2.) 
 
“This lawsuit
arises out of a trip and fall incident which occurred on or about August 14,
2023, when Plaintiff tripped and fell as a result of a dangerous condition on
the SUBJECT PROPERTY. Specifically, a height discrepancy existed such that
Plaintiff tripped on a raised concrete slab, causing serious bodily injury.” 
(Id.,
¶ 10.) 
            Defendant City argues that “Plaintiff’s
complaint reflects an entirely different factual basis for recovery because
2217 S. Gramercy Pl., Los Angeles is a different address from 2302 S. Gramercy
Pl., Los Angeles, CA 90018.” (Mtn. 5:20-22.) However, clarifying the precise
location of the incident does not constitute a complete change in facts. A
complaint may “elaborate or add further detail to a claim” as long as “the
claim and the complaint . . . are premised on essentially the same foundation.”
(Hernandez, supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at p. 1233.) Plaintiff’s complaint is
not based “on an entirely different factual basis than that stated in the
government claim.” (Id. at p. 1232.) Instead, the foundation of
Plaintiff’s complaint remains the trip-and-fall he allegedly suffered due to an
uneven sidewalk. The facts in the complaint are “fairly reflected” in the
government claim. (Id. at p. 1231.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant City of Los Angeles’
motion for judgment on the pleadings is DENIED.
