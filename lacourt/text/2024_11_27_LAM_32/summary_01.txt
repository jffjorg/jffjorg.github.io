And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in this case, which is subject to change after further argument and consideration. The ruling addresses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Grey Defendants.

The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, which means that the Grey Defendants may refile their demurrer with additional allegations or evidence.

The judge has denied the motion to strike, which means that the allegations in the complaint will stand. The judge has also denied the motion to strike as to attorney's fees, prejudgment interest, and punitive damages.

The judge has found that the Grey Defendants did not owe VISM a duty of care in their interactions with Choi and Song, and therefore did not commit any wrongdoing.

The judge has also found that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to establish a claim for intentional interference with contract and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.

The judge has left open the question of whether VISM is entitled to prejudgment interest, which will be decided separately if VISM prevails and moves for prejudgment interest.
