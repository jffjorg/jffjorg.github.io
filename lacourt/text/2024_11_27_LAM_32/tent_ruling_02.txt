     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant heritage’s motion to compel
  responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 7, 2024, Plaintiffs Dustin
Riach and Jason Rivas filed this action against Defendants Heritage Auctioneers
& Galleries, Inc. and Brian Chanes. The complaint asserts causes of action
for declaratory relief, negligence, fraud, and deceptive trade practices. 
            On October 28, 2024, Defendant
Heritage filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to special
interrogatories and requests for production. Plaintiffs filed a late opposition
on November 18, 2024. Defendant filed its reply on November 20, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION 
            The subject discovery was served on
August 14, 2024 and September 16, 2024. (Tiemstra Decl. ¶¶ 2, 6.) Plaintiffs
did not respond to the following sets: (1) Special Interrogatories (Set One) to
Rivas; (2) Requests for Production (Set One) to Rivas; (3) Requests for
Production (Set Two) to Rivas; and (4) Requests for Production (Set Two) to
Riach. (Id., ¶ 8.)
            Defendant propounded substantively
different sets of discovery to each Plaintiff. Plaintiffs either did not
respond to certain sets, served joint responses, or mixed up the responding
plaintiff. Plaintiffs’ opposition fails to address these issues. 
            Plaintiffs argue that Defendant
failed to meet and confer or file a separate statement. However, neither is
required for a motion to compel responses in the first instance. This is not a
motion to compel further. The issue is not the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’
responses, but their failure to respond at all. Because Plaintiffs have not
responded to the subject discovery, an order compelling responses is warranted.

            Defendant requests sanctions, but
defense counsel has not provided any supporting evidence of her hourly rate or
hours spent. Thus, sanctions are denied. 

CONCLUSION
            Defendant Heritage’s motion to
compel responses is GRANTED. Plaintiffs shall respond to the subject discovery
within 15 days of this order. Sanctions are denied.
