And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the City of Los Angeles. The City argued that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because the address listed in the government claim (2217 S. Gramercy Pl) is different from the address listed in the complaint (2302 S. Gramercy Pl). However, the judge found that the complaint is not based on an entirely different factual basis than that stated in the government claim, but rather is an elaboration or addition of detail to the claim. The judge ruled that the complaint fairly reflects the factual basis for recovery in the government claim, and therefore the motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.
