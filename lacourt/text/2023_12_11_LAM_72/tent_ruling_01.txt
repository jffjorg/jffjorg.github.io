         v.

 Case No:  23STCV18209
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 11, 2023
 Calendar Number:  10



 
 
 
Plaintiff Golden Dragon Group LLC (“Plaintiff”) seeks
default judgment against Defendant Jonathan Valdez (“Defendant”)
 
Plaintiff requests:
 
(1) money judgment in the amount of $67,949.42, consisting
of:
 
(a) damages in the amount of
$57,574.84; 
 
(b) interest in the amount of
$6,293.80;
 
(c) costs in the amount of $507.79;
 
(d) attorney’s fees in the amount
of $3,572.99;
 
The Court cannot sign the form of proposed judgment that
Plaintiff filed as the attorney’s fees must be reduced to $2,647.48 for the
reasons explained below.  Plaintiff may submit
by the next hearing a proposed judgment changing the attorney’s fees to
$2,647.48 and recalculating the “Total.”  The Court will continue this hearing to allow Plaintiff
to make this correction.  
 
Background
 
Defendant executed an agreement entitled “Promissory Note”
(the “Agreement”) in favor of Plaintiff. On August 29, 2022, Defendant
defaulted under the Agreement by failing to make a payment that was due.
 
          Plaintiff
filed this action on August 1, 2023, stating claims for (1) goods and services
sold and delivered; (2) account stated; (3) open book account; and (4) breach
of note.
 
On October 30, 2023, the Court entered default against Defendant.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7);
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
           
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
          According
to the proof of service filed on October 5, 2023, Defendant was served on
August 24, 2023 at 2616 Griffith Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90011 via substitute
service on Blanca Jaurigui.
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed from the action on November
3, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Natalia A. Minassian avers to Defendant’s non-military
status.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in its Case
Summary in Support of Default Judgment by Court. Plaintiff adequately pleads
its causes of action in the Complaint.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
G. Anthony [name illegible] (“G. Anthony”) avers that
Defendant owes the principal sum of $57,574.84 on the Agreement. (G. Anthony Decl.
at ¶ 7; Exh. 2 (“Statement of Account”.) 
 
 
Interest
 
The Complaint requests interest on the unpaid loan amount. (Complaint
at p. 5:13-14.) The amount of principal damages is certain because it is laid
out in the Agreement and Statement of Account; pre-judgment interest is
therefore permissible here.
 
G. Anthony provides the interest computations in an exhibit
to his declaration. (G. Anthony Decl. at ¶ 9; Exh. 3.) The total amount of
interest is $6,293.80.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff includes a memorandum of costs in the submitted
Form CIV-100, averring that it expended $507.79 in costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
          Plaintiff
requests $3,572.99 in attorney’s fees.
 
This is an action on a contract.
Because the judgment is between $50,000.01 and $100,000, the maximum recovery
of attorney’s fees is equal to $1,890 plus 2% of the excess over $50,000. (Local
Rule 3.214.) The excess over $50,000 here is $7,574.84. 1% of that amount is
$757.48. Thus, the maximum amount of attorney’s fees is $2647.48. Plaintiff’s
request exceeds this amount. The Court therefore reduces Plaintiff’s attorney’s
fees to $2647.48.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
          Plaintiff
submitted a proposed form of judgment as required on October 28, 2023.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
          California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation requires a clerk’s note across the face of the writing that
there has been a judgment. Here, Plaintiff has not submitted the original
documents. The Court does not discern any practical need for such a clerk’s
note on the written obligation in the current case and therefore orders that it
need not be included. If this causes any issues for any party or non-party they
are authorized to bring the matter to the Court’s attention.  
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
