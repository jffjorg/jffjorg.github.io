And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the punitive damages prayers from the plaintiffs' complaint. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant, Frankie Florez, improperly cut and damaged trees on their property, defamed them regarding the tree situation, and committed other wrongs. The complaint includes claims for punitive damages, but the judge finds that the allegations are insufficient to support a finding of fraudulent, oppressive, or malicious conduct. The judge gives the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint to try to cure the defects in their pleading.
