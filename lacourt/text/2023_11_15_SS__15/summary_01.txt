And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike the plaintiff's claims, finding that the claims are barred by workers' compensation exclusivity. The plaintiff's wife was exposed to mold and asbestos at work, developed lung cancer and died as a result, and filed for workers' compensation benefits. However, the plaintiff is attempting to plead a new cause of action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant concealed the existence and connection of the injury, which aggravated the plaintiff's wife's lung cancer. The judge has found that the plaintiff has not shown that the defendant concealed the existence and connection of the injury before the plaintiff's wife did, and therefore the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike is moot. The defendant is to file a proposed judgment of dismissal within five court days.
