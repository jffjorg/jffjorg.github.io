Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to disqualify Michelman & Robinson, LLP as counsel for Warner Park Recovery Center, LLC. The motion was brought by Anatoly Krichevsky, a defendant in the case, who argued that the law firm lacked authority to represent the plaintiff. The judge found that the law firm was not authorized to represent the plaintiff because the plaintiff's members did not unanimously agree to retain the law firm. The judge also found that the law firm breached its duty of loyalty to the plaintiff by taking sides in an ownership dispute between equal membership factions over control of the business. The judge disqualified the law firm and ordered that notice be given to the parties.
