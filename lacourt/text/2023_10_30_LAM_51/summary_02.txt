And here is the English summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the disputes surrounding Resolution No. 191, which was adopted by PVHA. The ruling notes that there is a discrepancy between the FACC and captioned parties, and that a 2020 lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice. The judge finds that the business judgment rule argument fails because it ignores allegations of procedural violations. The judge also rejects Cross-Defendants' arguments that they have waived any contrary argument and that they only attack part of the fourth cause of action. The ruling concludes that the court will not address the final argument because it ignores the subject properties' status as part of a common interest development subject to a homeowners' association and restrictions.
