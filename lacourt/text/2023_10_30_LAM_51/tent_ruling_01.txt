STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On March 28, 2022, Plaintiffs Reed L. Harman and Nan M.
Harman, individually and as Trustees of the Visalia Trust (Plaintiffs) filed a
Complaint against Defendants Stanley Francis Chao and Steve Francis Chao
(Defendants). The Complaint had four causes of action for: (1) declaratory
relief; (2) injunctive relief; (3) nuisance; and (4) negligence.
 
According to the Complaint, this case involves real property
located at 1820 Via Visalia, Palos Verdes Estates, California 90274 (Plaintiff’s
Property) and real property located at 1113 Via Mirabel, Palos Verdes Estates,
California 90274 (Defendant’s Property). Both properties are located within the
Palos Verdes Homes Association (PVHA). Plaintiffs allege that each property is
bound by the protective Restrictions in the PVHA and that Plaintiffs have the
right to enforce the Restrictions against Defendants. Plaintiffs claim that
Defendants have failed to properly maintain their trees and vegetation which
resulted in obstructing Plaintiffs’ views from the main living areas of their
property and in violation of the condition of approval Defendants received
before planting.[2]
PVHA adopted new rules regarding protecting scenic views on April 6, 2021. Defendants
still have not maintained their trees and vegetation such that they do not
obstruct Plaintiffs’ scenic views. 
 
On November 8, 2022, Defendant Stanley Francis Chao filed an
Answer.
 
On December 15, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a Request for
Dismissal as to Defendant Steve Francis Chao only.
 
On March 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint against
Defendant Steve Francis Chao only, bearing Case No. 23STCV04882 for (1)
declaratory relief, (2) injunctive relief, (3) nuisance, and (4) negligence. 
 
On March 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Related
Case.
 
On April 5, 2023, the subsequent case was transferred to
Dept. 51 and the first case was deemed the lead case.
 
On April 18, 2023, Cross-Complainants Stanley Francis Chao,
Steven Francis Chao, and Herair Garboushian filed a Cross-Complaint against
Cross-Defendants Reed L. Harman and Nan M. Harman, individually, and as
Trustees of the Visalia Trust. 
 
On May 4, 2023, Defendant Steven Francis Chao filed an
Answer to the Complaint in the second action.
 
On July 26, 2023, Cross-Complainants sought leave to file a
First Amended Cross-Complaint, which the court granted.
 
On August 23, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed a First Amended
Cross-Complaint (FACC) with four causes of action for: (1) Trespass; (2)
Invasion of Privacy; (3) Nuisance; (4) Declaratory Relief; and (4) Injunctive
Relief.
 
According to the FACC, Cross-Defendants have engaged in an
unrelenting campaign to force the Chaos to cut down trees at their property.
Cross-Complainant Garboushian is a tenant at the Chao’s property. Cross-Complainants
allege that Cross-Defendants flew a drone over their property to take
photographs and video without prior notice at least twice. Cross-Complainants
also challenge the validity of Resolution No. 191 that PVHA adopted in 2021. 
 
Cross-Defendants filed a Demurrer to the FACC on September
28, 2023. Cross-Complainants timely filed an opposition on October 17, 2023.
Cross-Defendants timely filed a reply on October 23, 2023.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states
a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.) 
 
Timeliness
 
Cross-Complainants contend that the demurrer is untimely
because it was due on or before September 26, 2023 pursuant to CCP § 430.40 and
that Cross-Complainants did not initiate meet and confer efforts until
September 27, 2023. (Riskin Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) Cross-Complainants asks the court to
overrule the demurrer because the lack of meaningful opportunity to meet and
confer prejudiced them. (Opp. 6:10-12.) Cross-Defendants claim the late filing
was caused by a calendaring mistake. (Peterson Decl. ISO Reply ¶¶ 3, 4.) 
 
A defendant can demur within the same period
of time it has to answer the complaint – i.e., 30 days after
service, unless extended by stipulation or court order. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
(CCP) § 430.40(a).) If the parties cannot meet and confer by the deadline, the
demurring party is granted an automatic 30-day extension of time to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving a declaration, on or before the date
the responsive pleading is due, stating that a good faith attempt to meet and
confer was made and explaining why the parties could not meet and confer. (CCP
§ 430.41(a)(2).) Because the statutory language setting the time limit after
service of the complaint states “may” and not “must” the court can still
consider a general demurrer. (CCP § 473(a)(1); McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 280; Jackson v. Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th
742, 750 [concluding that the late-filed demurrer did not affect plaintiff’s
“substantial rights” because plaintiff did not take steps to obtain a default
judgment or otherwise demonstrate prejudice from the delay.])
 
Here, Cross-Complainants did not demonstrate prejudice by
Cross-Defendants’ late-filing of the demurrer. Notably, Cross-Complainants’
only claimed prejudice is failure to engage in meaningful meet and confer
discussions in advance of Cross-Defendants’ filing the demurrer. Additionally, Cross-Complainants
did not request entry of default and had the opportunity to fully oppose the
instant demurrer. Finally, the delayed filing, by the parties’ declarations,
occurred two days after the responsive pleading deadline.
 
Accordingly, the court exercises its discretion to consider
the merits of the instant demurrer.
 
Meet and Confer
 
Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required
to satisfy their meet and confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.
(CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate that they so satisfied their meet and confer
obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to CCP §430.41(a)(2) &
(3).¿Upon reviewing the declarations submitted in support and in
opposition to the demurrer, the parties did not meet and confer prior to Cross-Defendants’
filing the instant motion. (Peterson Decl., ¶¶ 6,7; Riskin Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) Still, failure
to meet and confer is not a sufficient ground to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Declaratory Relief
 
Cross-Defendants claim that there is no actual controversy
between Cross-Complainants and Cross-Defendants as to Resolution No. 191
because PVHA adopted it, not the Cross-Defendants. Additionally,
Cross-Defendants assert that since PHVA adopted Resolution No. 191 in 2021,
Cross-Complainants impermissibly seek to redress a past wrong. Alternatively,
Cross-Defendants claim that the fourth cause of action fails because
Cross-Complainants did not plead facts to avoid the consequences of judicial
deference and the business judgment rule.[3]
Cross-Complainants argue that they did allege a current and prospective harm
because Cross-Defendants are suing them over their trees despite not being
adjoining property owners under the purported authority of Resolution 191.[4]
Cross-Defendants reply that Cross-Complainants have not alleged facts to
support applying Civ. Code § 4000 et seq
to this action because there are no common areas.[5]
 
A plaintiff’s declaratory relief
complaint must specifically allege that an actual, present controversy exists,
and must state the facts of the respective claims concerning the disputed
subject matter. (City of Cotati v.
Cashman (2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 79; Connerly
v. Schwarzenegger (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 739, 746 (Connerly).) A sufficient complaint: (1) sets forth facts showing
the existence of an actual controversy relating to the parties’ legal rights
and duties, and (2) requests the court to adjudge these rights and duties. (Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 606; Qualified
Patients Ass’n v. City of Anaheim (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 734, 751; see also
Travers v. Louden (1967)
254.Cal.App.2d 926, 931-32 (Travers)
[commenting that declaratory relief may be appropriate for parties with a
continuing relationship].) A declaratory relief claim should not be used to
determine issues that are already engaged by other causes of action. (Hood v. Superior Court (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 319, 324.)
 
After reviewing the FACC, there are sufficient factual
allegations to support a claim for declaratory relief. As a threshold matter,
this dispute is about cutting trees, which happens to include whether
Resolution 191 is valid to allow Cross-Defendants to seek a court order to
force Cross-Complainants to cut their trees. The trees have not been cut
therefore there is a continuing controversy. Second, the FACC alleges that Resolution
No. 191 was not adopted in accordance with the Restriction requirements. (FACC
¶¶ 48, 49.) Third, the FACC alleges that after Cross-Defendants dismissed their
2020 Complaint (after Cross-Complainant Steven Chao filed a demurrer arguing
that Cross-Defendants lacked authority because they were not adjoining
homeowners) PHVA passed Resolution 191. (FACC ¶¶ 17, 18.) Fourth, the
controversy is between Cross-Complainants and Cross-Defendants because
Cross-Defendants are the parties seeking to enforce Resolution 191 – not PHVA. In
fact, Cross-Defendants’ underlying Complaint relies on Resolution 191 to allow
them as non-adjoining homeowners to sue Cross-Complainants to get them to cut
their trees. Cross-Complainants have requested the court to adjudge their
rights and duties. (FACC ¶ 51(a) – (f).)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      
Demurrer
to the fourth cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
