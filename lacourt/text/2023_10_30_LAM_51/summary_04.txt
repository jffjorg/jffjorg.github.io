And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling discusses the case between Plaintiff and Anatoly, Larisa, Michelman, and Kopytov. The court notes that Anatoly challenged Plaintiff's ability to retain counsel and seek injunctive relief, citing Anmaco, Inc. v. Bohlken and Sprengel v. Mohr. The court determines that under Anmaco, Kopytov cannot cause Plaintiff to sue Anatoly directly and must instead proceed by derivative action. The court also notes that Kopytov cannot retain counsel on behalf of Plaintiff to do so.

The court then addresses Plaintiff's proposal to move to intervene under CCP Sec. 387(d)(1)-(2) or file a collateral injunctive action to seek to disqualify Michelman. The court notes that Moving Party waited over 100 days after being dismissed from the case to bring the instant motion, which may indicate tactical abuse.

The court also addresses Kopytov's authority to sue Larisa and Anatoly, concluding that Section 6.1 does not provide authority for suit against Anatoly. Finally, the court notes that it may appoint a provisional director to defeat a deadlock, alleviating Plaintiff's concern that it will never retain counsel.
