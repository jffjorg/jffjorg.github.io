And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the City of Los Angeles, sustaining the demurrer and denying the petition for writ of mandate. The court found that the City has discretion whether, when, and how to enforce its orders to comply, and that it did not have a ministerial duty to enforce those orders. The court also denied leave to amend the petition to assert a claim for petition for writ of mandate based on a ministerial duty. The court granted leave to amend to re-assert a claim for petition for writ of mandate based on the theory that a refusal to exercise discretion in itself is an abuse of discretion, and also granted leave to amend to assert any non-writ causes of action. The court ordered the parties to file a first amended petition and complaint within thirty days, and scheduled a trial setting conference for December 4, 2024.
