English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery related to their recent surgeries. The Plaintiff and Defendant had previously agreed to submit discovery plans, but the Plaintiff sought to reopen discovery to provide updated medical records and respond to additional written discovery. The Judge finds that the Defendant's proposed discovery plan is reasonable and necessary for the Defendant to fairly defend the action. However, the Judge notes that the Defendant's proposed deadlines in 2025 were missing, and assumes this was an error. The Judge grants the motion, subject to the parties' stipulation to continue the trial date to a date prior to June 26, 2026, which is the five-year date for the case.
