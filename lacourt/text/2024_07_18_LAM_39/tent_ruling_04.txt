CASE NUMBER:


23STCV19761




MOTION:  


Motions to Compel Discovery Responses




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Ariel Alfaro




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
MOTIONS
            Plaintiff
Ariel Alfaro (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel responses from Defendant Man
Staffing, LLC (“Defendant”) to Form Interrogatories, set one (“FROG”), and
Requests for Production, set one (“RPD”). 
Defendant has not opposed the motions.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff served
the FROG and RPD on Defendant on February 20, 2024 by mail and email.  Defendant’s responses were thus due by March
25, 2024.  As of the filing date of these
motions, Defendant had not responded to the discovery.  Accordingly, the motions to compel responses
to the FROG and RPD are granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.290 and 2031.300, respectively.  Defendant
is ordered to serve verified responses to Plaintiff’s FROG and RPD, without
objections, within 30 days of service of this order.
The court finds Defendant’s
failures to timely respond to the FROG and RPD abuses of the discovery process
and imposes sanctions.  Defendant and its
counsel of record, Marc P. Grismer, jointly and severally, are to pay sanctions
to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,700, which represents four hours of attorney
time to prepare the motions and attend the hearing at $425 per hour.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to
the FROG and RPD are granted.  Defendant
is to serve verified responses, without objections, within 30 days of notice of
this order.  
Defendant and its counsel of record, Marc P.
Grismer, jointly and severally, are to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,700 to
Plaintiff, by and through counsel, within 30 days of notice of this order.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service thereof.
