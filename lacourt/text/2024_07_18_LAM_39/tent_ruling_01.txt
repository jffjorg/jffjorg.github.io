MOTION


Motion to Reopen Discovery 




MOVING PARTY


Plaintiff Guadalupe Encisco




OPPOSING PARTY


Defendant Avanti Hospitals, LLC



 
MOTION
Plaintiff
Guadalupe Encisco (“Plaintiff”) moves to reopen discovery related to Plaintiff’s
recent surgeries.  Defendant Avanti
Hospitals, LLC (“Defendant”) opposes the motion.  The court previously considered this matter
and, in its order of June 25, 2024, continued it to July 17, 2024 for the
parties to submit discovery plans in compliance with this court’s March 1, 2024
order.
ANALYSIS
In determining
whether to reopen discovery, the court must consider the necessity of and
reasons for the additional discovery, the diligence or lack thereof by the
party seeking to reopen discovery in attempting to complete discovery prior to
the discovery cutoff date, whether permitting the discovery will prevent the
case from going forward on the trial date or will otherwise prejudice any
party, and any past continuances of the trial date. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.050, subd. (b).)
Plaintiff moves to
reopen discovery as to surgeries Plaintiff underwent on January 8 and 11,
2024.  (See March 17, 2024 Declaration of
Raymond Ghermezian (in support of and attached to motion), Exhibit A.)  This is a proper basis to reopen
discovery.  Plaintiff proposes to provide
updated medical records to Defendant, to submit to a second session of
deposition, and to respond to additional written discovery concerning  Plaintiff’s surgeries and updated medical
issues.  (Plaintiff’s Proposed Discovery
Plan.)  Defendant agrees Plaintiff’s
proposed discovery is necessary but contends Defendant will also need to
propound subpoenas for updated medical and pharmacy records, depose Plaintiff’s
surgeon regarding her surgical care, prognosis, and future care needs, and have
Plaintiff sit for an updated orthopedic examination with Defendant’s
expert.  (Defendant’s Proposed Discovery
Plan.)  
The court finds
Defendant’s proposed discovery plan is reasonable and necessary for Defendant
to fairly defend this action.  However,
the court notes Defendant did not include discovery in 2025 in its proposed
deadlines, but rather jumped from November 30, 2024 to March 26, 2026.  The court assumes this was a clerical
error.  The court, therefore, grants the
motion, subject to Plaintiff’s stipulation to submit to Defendant’s proposed
discovery plan, with all proposed deadlines in 2026 corrected to reflect deadlines
on the proposed dates in 2025.  
The court notes, pursuant
to the court’s order of December 5, 2023, the five-year date for this case is
June 26, 2026.  The court also conditions
its grant of this motion on the parties’ stipulation to continue the trial date
to a date prior to June 26, 2026.  
Plaintiff is to
give notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
