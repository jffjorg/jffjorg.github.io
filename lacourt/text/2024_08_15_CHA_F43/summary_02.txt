And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to undergo a physical examination by a neurologist. The defendants had already examined the plaintiff by an orthopedic doctor and are seeking to determine the extent of the plaintiff's neurological injuries. The judge finds that there is good cause for the examination, as the plaintiff has ongoing claims of neurological injury and has sought treatment with a neurologist. The judge also finds that the conditions sought for the examination are reasonable and that the plaintiff's arguments against the examination are unfounded. The judge orders the plaintiff to appear for the examination on August 23, 2024, at 12:30 p.m. at 2190 Lynn Road, Suite 380, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360.
