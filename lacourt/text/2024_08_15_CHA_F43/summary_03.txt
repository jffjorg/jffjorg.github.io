And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Road Runner Wyoming's motion to intervene in the action and deemed its answer and cross-complaint filed as of the date of the order. Road Runner Wyoming has a mandatory right to intervene under CCP § 387(d)(1)(B) and a permissive right to intervene under CCP § 387(d)(2). The judge has also granted Cross-Defendants' motion to vacate all actions taken under the cross-complaint, including defaults. Any defaults taken on the cross-complaint filed by Road Runner Wyoming are void.

The case arises from competing ownership claims to the property located at 30141 Lexington Dr., Val Verde, CA. The property was owned by Erik L. Lassman and Jim V. Robinson as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. The property was transferred to DeWelt, LLC in April 2011 and then to Road Runner Land & Homes, LLC in May 2011. The property was conveyed from Road Runner to DeWelt in February 2022 and then to McConnell in February 2022 for $10,000, which Road Runner alleges was well below market value.

Road Runner Wyoming filed a cross-complaint against DeWelt in October 2023, alleging two causes of action for cancellation of instrument and conversion. The Court of Appeal later reversed the default judgment and Order After Judgment as to Road Runner Wyoming. Road Runner Wyoming then filed a motion to intervene in the action and a cross-complaint in order to resolve any clouds on title and to be reimbursed for personal property that it alleges was converted after the property was conveyed to DeWelt.
