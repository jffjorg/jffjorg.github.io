Legal Standard for
Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v.
Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court
liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has
been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Discussion

 
            Defendant
demurs to the violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act cause of action on the
grounds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim. 
 
            The
Unruh Civil Rights Act guarantees every person in California “full and equal”
access to “all business establishments of every kind whatsoever” and imposes a
duty on business establishments to serve all persons without arbitrary
discrimination. (Isbister v. Boys' Club of Santa Cruz, Inc. (1985) 50
Cal.3d 72, 75.) 
 
A plaintiff
can recover under the Unruh Act on two alternate theories: (1) a violation of
the ADA (§ 51, subd. (f)); or (2) denial of access to a business establishment
based on intentional discrimination.” (Martinez v. San Diego County Credit
Union (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1059.) 
 
            Plaintiff
is a permanently blind “tester” who insists that she “genuinely wants to use
defendant’s goods and services.” She alleges that she attempted to access Defendant’s
website but the website was inaccessible to people who were visually impaired.
(Compl., ¶ 20.) The Complaint further alleges that “Defendant’s actions constitute
intentional discrimination against Plaintiff on the basis of a disability in
violation of the Unruh Act because Defendant has constructed a Website that is
inaccessible to Plaintiff, knowingly maintains the Website in this inaccessible
form, and has failed to take adequate actions to correct these barriers even
after being notified of the discrimination that such barriers cause.” (Compl.,
¶ 21.) Additionally, the Complaint alleges Defendant “violat[ed] the Unruh Act
because the conduct alleged herein likewise constitutes a violation of various
provisions of the ADA.” (Compl., ¶ 22.) 
 
            These allegations
are insufficient to state an Unruh claim based on
intentional discrimination. 
 
            First, “[u]nless an
Unruh Act claim is based on an ADA violation, the act requires a claimant to
prove “ ‘intentional discrimination.’ ”” (Martinez v. Cot'n Wash, Inc.
(2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 1026, 1036.) A plaintiff cannot not “rel[y] on the effects
of a facially neutral policy on a particular group ... to infer solely
from such effects a discriminatory intent.” (Koebke v. Bernardo Heights
Country Club (2005) 36 Cal.4th 824, 854.; see also ibid. [“
‘[a] disparate impact analysis or test does not apply to Unruh Act claims’ ”].)
Thus, absent an ADA violation, the Unruh Act requires allegations supporting “
‘willful, affirmative misconduct’ ” (Koebke v. Bernardo Heights Country Club,
supra at p. 853,) with the specific intent “to accomplish discrimination on
the basis of [a protected trait].” (Id. at p. 854.) 
 
            Here,
there are no specific allegations showing discriminatory intent. Rather, the
allegations show only that Defendant failed to take corrective action after
being notified of the allegedly discriminatory impact. Such allegations are
insufficient as matter of law to show discriminatory intent. (Martinez,
supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 1036.)
 
            The
demurrer, however, does not persuasively address Plaintiff’s allegations that
the Unruh claim
is also based on a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
 
To state a
claim under the Unruh Act based on a violation of the ADA, a plaintiff must
plead a violation of the ADA; specifically, Plaintiff must allege (1) he is
disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) Defendant is a private entity that
owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) that he was
denied public accommodations by Defendant because of his disability. (Molski
v. M.J. Cable, Inc. (9th Cir. 2007) 481 F.3d 724, 730.) 
 
In the moving papers and reply, Defendant
asserts that the holding in Koebke requires a showing of intentional discrimination
to show a ADA violation. Defendant’s
analysis of this issue is not well-taken. It is well established that an Unruh
violation based on an ADA violation does not require a showing
of intentional discrimination.[1]
((Martinez, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1038–1039; Munson v. Del
Taco, Inc. (2009) 46 Cal.4th 661, 672-673.)
 
            Thus,
the demurrer must be overruled as it states a claim for an Unruh Act violation
based on an ADA violation. 
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer
to the Complaint is overruled.
