[1]            In Martinez, which is repeatedly cited by Defendant, the court
explained that a standalone website, with no connection to a physical location
where goods or services were offered to the public, does not constitute a place
of public accommodation under Title III of the ADA. (Martinez, supra, 81
Cal.App.5th at pp. 1034, 1039.) Here, however, the Complaint
alleges Defendant operates a ““brick and mortar” location . . . such that the
inaccessibility of the website illegally impedes access to the goods and
services offered at the physical location, which is a place of public
accommodation.” (Compl., ¶ 1.)
