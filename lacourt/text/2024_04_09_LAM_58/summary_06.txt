And here is the English-text summary:

The Court grants the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Versus Production SRL because there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant is a Belgian film and television production company that entered into a license agreement with Netflix, Inc. to produce a film. However, the plaintiff's claims for defamation arise from the film, not the license agreement. The plaintiff failed to show that the defendant purposefully directed its activities towards California or that the defendant's contacts with California were related to the plaintiff's claims. Therefore, the Court finds that there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
