And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling finds that neither Franco Vago SpA nor Nippon Express Italia SpA have been served with the Plaintiff's Complaint or appeared in the action. While the evidence suggests an employment relationship between the Plaintiff and these companies, it does not demonstrate specific liability for the underlying allegations of harassment or discrimination. The Judge cites Bradley v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2008) in support of this finding, which emphasizes that liability is predicated on the allegations of harassment or discrimination involving the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment under the control of the employer.
