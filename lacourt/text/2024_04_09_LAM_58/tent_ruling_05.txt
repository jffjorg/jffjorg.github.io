[1]            To date, neither
Franco Vago SpA nor Nippon Express Italia SpA have been served with Plaintiff’s
Complaint or appeared in the action.


[2]            Rather, these facts only
suggest an employment relationship with Plaintiff such that FEHA claims may
apply but the evidence does not demonstrate specific liability for the underlying
allegations here. (Bradley v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation
(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1612, 1629 [“[t]he key is that liability is predicated
on the allegations of harassment or discrimination involving the terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment under the control of the employer,
and that the employment relationship exists for FEHA purposes within the
context of the control retained.”].)
