And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's default judgment application with $21 million in damages. The Plaintiff, David Gilchrist, alleged that the Defendant, Pollock, defamed him by accusing him of mismanagement, fraud, money laundering, and theft. The Plaintiff seeks damages for shame, loss of reputation, harm to business profession, and punitive damages. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence of the Defendant's financial condition, which is necessary to assess punitive damages. Additionally, the Judge finds that the $6 million claimed for compensatory damages is unsubstantiated and highly speculative. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to file a new proposed judgment seeking $500,000 in total damages.
