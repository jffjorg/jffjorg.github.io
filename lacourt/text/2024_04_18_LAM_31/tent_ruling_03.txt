I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On January 10,
2024, Defendant AMCO Insurance Company (“AMCO” or “Defendant”), filed a Motion to
Compel Plaintiff 3884 Stoneridge LLC (“Stoneridge” or “Plaintiff”) to provide responses
to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and a Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission, Set One, Admitted against Stoneridge.  AMCO seeks sanctions.
                                                     
            On April 9,
2024, Stoneridge filed an opposition to the Motion To Deem Admitted, arguing
sanctions should be reduced because responses have been provided to AMCO’s
Requests for Admission.  Stoneridge did
not file an opposition to the Motion to Compel. 
 
            On April
10, 2024, AMCO filed a reply to Stoneridge’s opposition acknowledging that Stoneridge
filed untimely responses to the admission requests.  
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            If a party
to whom interrogatories were directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  If a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order that the truth of the matters specified
in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  Failure to timely serve responses
waives objections to the requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2033.280, subd. (a).)  A party moving to
compel discovery responses under these statutory provisions is not required to
meet and confer prior to filing the motion.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b); see also Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411 (Sinaiko)
(citing Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the
proposition that “meet and confer” requirement “did not apply when propounding
party sought order compelling responses to interrogatories and sanctions for
responding party's failure to respond ‘within the statutorily permitted
time’”).)¿¿¿ 
 
            Monetary
Sanctions 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
¿ 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . .
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  In the context of a motion to deem requests
for admission admitted, it is mandatory that the court impose monetary
sanctions on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to the request necessitated the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            AMCO moves for
an order compelling Stoneridge to provide responses to AMCO’s interrogatories
and to deem admitted the admissions request. 

 
            The
following is not in dispute.  AMCO
properly served Stoneridge with the at-issue discovery requests.  With respect to the interrogatories, Stoneridge
has not provided responses.  Stoneridge’s
objections to the interrogatories are therefore waived.¿ AMCO is entitled to an
order compelling Stoneridge’s response to the interrogatories.  With respect to the admission requests,
Stoneridge served untimely responses before this hearing.  The Motion to Deem Admitted is therefore moot.  
 
             Monetary
Sanctions
 
            AMCO
requests sanctions against Stoneridge.  Given
the Court’s ruling, sanctions are warranted.  In the context of admissions request, they are
mandatory.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)  Accordingly, sanctions are
imposed against Stoneridge in the total amount of $915 consisting of three hours
at defense counsel’s hourly rate and $120 in filing fees. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The unopposed
motion to compel responses to Defendant AMCO Insurance Company’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.  
 
            The unopposed
motion to deem admitted Request for Admissions, Set One, is MOOT.  
 
            The request
for sanctions is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered
to pay sanctions in the amount of $915 to Defendant, by and through their
counsel.
 
Discovery responses are to be provided and sanctions are to
be paid within 30 days of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
