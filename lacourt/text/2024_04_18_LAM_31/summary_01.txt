And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike the request for punitive damages filed by the defendant, Equity Residential Management, LLC. The defendant argues that the request for punitive damages is improper because there are no allegations showing that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. The plaintiffs argue that the standard for punitive damages under the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA) is gross negligence or willfulness. The court agrees with the plaintiffs and finds that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) sufficiently allege grossly negligent or willful conduct. The court also finds that the defendant's conduct was willful and grossly negligent in violating the ICRAA. The motion to strike is denied, and the defendant is ordered to serve and file their answer within 10 days.
