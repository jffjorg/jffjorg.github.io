**Case Number:** 24STCV01883
**Hearing Date:** April 18, 2024
**Tentative Ruling:**

**Case Summary:**

* Plaintiff Angela Pasquini filed a complaint against Decron Properties Corp., Villa Cezanne Apartments, and others.
* Plaintiff alleges breach of express and implied contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, wrongful termination, and more.
* Defendants moved to compel arbitration and stay the action.

**Tentative Ruling:**

1. **Existence of Arbitration Agreement:** The court finds that a valid arbitration agreement exists between Plaintiff and Decron.
2. **Enforceability:** The court finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable, despite being a contract of adhesion.
3. **Unconscionability:** The court finds that there is a low degree of procedural unconscionability and no high degree of substantive unconscionability.

**Key Points:**

* The arbitration agreement is a contract of adhesion, but this does not render it unenforceable.
* The court finds that the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable due to its adhesive nature, but this is not sufficient to render it unenforceable.
* The court finds that there is no high degree of substantive unconscionability, as the arbitration agreement does not impose prohibitively high costs on the Plaintiff.

**Next Steps:**

* A hearing will be held to address the applicability of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021.
* If the Act applies, the court may need to reconsider its decision.
