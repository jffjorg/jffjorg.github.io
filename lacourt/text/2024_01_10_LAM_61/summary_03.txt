Here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's Motion for Attorney Fees After Trial in the amount of $2,000.00. The Plaintiff, FML Management Corp., seeks attorney fees from the Defendants, Edgar Santiago and Wendy Santiago, following a trial and judgment in the Plaintiff's favor. The Plaintiff relies on a provision in the lease agreement that requires the Defendants to pay actual attorney fees incurred in any actions arising from a breach of the lease agreement. The Plaintiff's counsel charged a flat fee of $2,000.00 for prosecuting the action, and the actual compensable hours spent on the matter would yield a figure greater than $2,000.00. The Court finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to fees under the lease agreement and that the $2,000.00 sought is reasonable. No opposition to the motion has been filed.
