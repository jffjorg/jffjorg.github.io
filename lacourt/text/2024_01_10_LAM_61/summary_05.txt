And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling denying Michael Leight's motion to be relieved as counsel for non-party Garry Itkin. Leight seeks to be relieved due to Itkin's non-payment of fees and costs. However, the motion is defective in two respects: it does not include a proposed order prepared on the MC-053 form, and Garry Itkin is not a party to the action. The Judge notes that the cases are related, but not consolidated. The ruling references Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. (“CCP”) section 284 and Cal. Rule of Court 3.1362, which outline the requirements for a motion to be relieved as counsel.
