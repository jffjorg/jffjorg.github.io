And here's a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff FML Management Corp.'s Motion for Attorney Fees After Trial in the amount of $2,000.00. The motion is based on a provision in the lease agreement requiring Defendants Rene Gallardo and Flor Mazariegos to pay actual attorney fees incurred in any actions arising from a breach of the lease agreement. Plaintiff's counsel charged a flat fee of $2,000.00 for prosecuting the present action, and the actual compensable hours spent on this matter would yield a figure greater than $2,000.00. The court finds that Plaintiff has shown entitlement to fees under the lease agreement and that the $2,000.00 sought is actually incurred and reasonable. Since no opposition to the motion has been filed, the motion is granted.
