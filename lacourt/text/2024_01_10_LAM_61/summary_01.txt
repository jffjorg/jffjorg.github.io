And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants FML Management Corp.'s (Plaintiff) motion for attorney fees in the amount of $2,000.00. The motion is based on a provision in the lease agreement that requires the defendants to pay actual attorney fees incurred in any actions arising from a breach of the lease agreement. The judge uses the lodestar method to determine the reasonable amount of fees to award, which is calculated by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the reasonable hourly rate. The court finds that the $2,000.00 sought by the plaintiff was actually incurred and reasonable. No opposition to the motion was filed, and the motion is therefore granted.
