And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff, FML Management Corp., $2,000.00 in attorney fees from the Defendants, Jose D. Chinchilla and Marta J. Villegas. The Plaintiff seeks fees under a provision in the lease agreement that requires the Defendants to pay actual attorney fees incurred in any actions arising from a breach of the lease agreement. The Plaintiff's counsel charged a flat fee of $2,000.00 for prosecuting the present action, which was actually incurred and reasonable. The Judge used the lodestar method to determine the proper amount of fees to award, considering the total number of reasonable hours expended and the reasonable hourly rate. The Plaintiff has shown entitlement to fees under the lease agreement, and the motion is therefore granted.
