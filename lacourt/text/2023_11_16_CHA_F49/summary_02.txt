And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories (set one) brought by the defendants/cross-complainants, Reza Abad and Aiden Bohloul, against the plaintiff/cross-defendant, James Hoseini. The motion is granted, and the responding party is ordered to serve complete and responsive answers to the interrogatories.

The court finds that the responding party's objections to the interrogatories lack merit and that the party has failed to provide sufficient support for its claims of relevance and financial privacy. The court also finds that the responding party's responses to the interrogatories are factually incomplete and that it has failed to comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220.

As a result, the court awards sanctions in the amount of $250 joint and several against the responding parties and counsel. The court also notes that the practice of challenging Judicial Council drafted and approved interrogatories with minimal support for non-code compliant response requirements, as well as the continued propounding of broad discovery with reliance on conclusions, accusations, and constant challenges to credibility, represents an inordinately growing burden on court resources for a case without a trial date even set.
