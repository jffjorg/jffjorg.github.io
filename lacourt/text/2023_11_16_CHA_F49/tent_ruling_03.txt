SUMMARY OF ACTION
The
parents of Michal Lodl, plaintiffs Jacek and Barbara contend their child Michal
suffered from post traumatic stress disorder as a result of the 2019 shooting
at Saugus High School.  Michal
subsequently began therapeutic treatment with defendant Child and Family Center.
 
On
July 7, 2020, Michal Lodl stepped into traffic on the 405 Freeway, and died
from a vehicle on pedestrian collision. Plaintiffs allege defendant failed to
adequately treat and/or intervene the acknowledged suicidal thoughts and
ideations expressed by Michal.
 
On
March 23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for Survival Action, Wrongful
Death, Professional Negligence, and Negligence. On March 28, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a 170.6 challenge to Department 47, thereby leading to the reassignment
of the action to Department 49. On October 11, 2023, Plaintiffs dismissed
individual defendant Araceli Hirtle.
 
RULING: Sustained with
Leave to Amend in Part/Overruled in Part
Defendant Child and Family
Center submits a demurrer to the entire complaint on
grounds of a statute of limitations bar, and failure to state sufficient facts.
Plaintiffs contend the complaint is not barred by the statute of limitations
and articulates sufficient facts establishing liability. The subject
case is preceded by a July 5, 2022, filed prior action in District Court, which
Plaintiffs dismissed on March 2, 2023. Defendant first challenges the action
under the one year medical malpractice statute of limitations, and denies any
application of the three year standard. Plaintiffs in opposition contend the
demurrer misinterprets the applicable statute of limitations and maintains the
action was timely filed. Defendant in reply also asserts a misinterpretation of
the Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5, reiterates the one year statute of
limitations for medical malpractice claims, and the duplicity of the medical
negligence and negligence claims. 
 
A
demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from
either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules, where the
complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]
 
The demurrer begins with characterization of the action as
one entirely governed by professional negligence, in that decedent received medically
based treatment. Defendant therefore describes the action as governed by the
professional negligence statute under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5.
Plaintiffs offer no challenge to the categorization of the action under the
professional negligence standard, but counter that the negligence claims are
brought on behalf of the Michal, and therefore the three year statute of
limitations applies on the negligence claims in that Michal died as a 17-year
old minor.
 
The age of Michal at the time of death remains undisputed,
especially for purposes of the demurrer. “In an action for injury or death
against a health care provider based upon such person's alleged professional
negligence, the time for the commencement of action shall be three years after
the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the
use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever
occurs first. ... Actions by a minor shall be commenced within three years from
the date of the alleged wrongful act ...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.5.)
 
The complaint itself however identifies the action as a
“combined survival and wrongful death” pleading brought both by the parents and
on behalf of the estate of Michal. [Comp., ¶ 2.] While the complaint lacks
specific articulation of which causes of action are brought individually versus
on behalf of the estate, the negligence claims appear to belong to the estate,
and wrongful death action is clearly brought by the parents. 
 
Given Michal was 17 years old at the time of death on July
7, 2020, the claims brought on behalf of the estate of Michael, and the filing
of the complaint on March 23, 2023, the court finds the negligence based claims
timely under the three year statute of limitations. Nothing in the demurrer
distinguishes the application of the three year statute of limitations brought
on behalf of a minor as opposed to the minor bringing the claim while still
alive. The claims belong to Michael. The court otherwise declines to consider
unmade argument. 
 
The court also declines to consider any distinction on a
scenario not presented in the complaint—a wrongful death claim brought by a
minor. “In view of the express statutory language and controlling Supreme Court
precedents, we hold that, absent applicability of one of the tolling
provisions, section 340.5 gives a minor a minimum of three years within which
to bring a medical malpractice action. For reasons we set forth below, this
three-year period applies whether the minor is herself the victim of medical
malpractice or brings a wrongful death action as the heir of one whose death
was caused by medical malpractice.” (Ferguson v. Dragul (1986) 187
Cal.App.3d 702, 707–708.) 
 
On the redundancy of the causes of action between the
professional negligence and negligence causes of action, the court finds both
causes of action in fact allege claims based on the provision of professional
services. The court declines to make factual distinctions at the demurrer
stage. (Flowers v. Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical Center (1994) 8
Cal.4th 992, 998.) The court otherwise declines to consider the demurrer on the
basis of facially duplicative claims. (Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown
Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 889.) Plaintiff may plead
alternative, even inconsistent causes of action within the same pleading. (Third Eye Blind,
Inc. v. Near North Entertainment Insurance Services, LLC (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1323; Rader Co. v. Stone (1986) 178
Cal.App.3d 10, 29.)
 
Nevertheless, neither party addresses the wrongful death
claim. Wrongful death is a separate cause of action belonging to the surviving
heirs, and not derivative of the negligence claims. (San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. v. Superior Court (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1545, 1550–1551 [“A
cause of action for wrongful death is a statutory claim (§§ 377.60–377.62) that
compensates specified heirs of the decedent for losses suffered as a result of
a decedent's death]; Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 1256, 1274 (footnote 21).) Wrongful death is governed by a two year
statute of limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1.) “[T]he statute of limitations
on a wrongful
death action begins to run at
the time of death,
and not at the time of
injury which caused the
death, for it is only on
the date of death
that the action is complete in all of its elements.”
(Kincaid v. Kincaid (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 75, 80–81.) 
 
Again, the demurrer lacks any
actual address of this particular aspect of the complaint, but to the extent
adult Plaintiffs maintain both an action on behalf of the estate and separate
wrongful death claim, an argument can be made for an untimely filed wrongful
death cause of action by the adults, but (as addressed above) not on behalf of
the minor. (Ferguson v. Dragul, supra, 187 Cal.App.3d 707-708.) The court therefore sustains the demurrer with leave to
amend on the wrongful death cause of action in order to allow the parties an
opportunity to address the claim. 
 
The demurrer is therefore sustained with 30 days leave to
amend as to the wrongful death cause of action, and overruled as to the
remainder of the complaint brought on behalf of Michael. If Plaintiffs decline
to file a first amended complaint, Defendant is ordered to answer the remaining
causes of action within 10 days of the lapse of the amendment deadline. 
 
Defendant to give notice.
