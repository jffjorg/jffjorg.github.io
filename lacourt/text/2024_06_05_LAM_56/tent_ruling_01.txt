RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs
Jo A Saint-George and Steven Saint-George
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers and opposition
papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            On March 8, 2022, Plaintiffs Jo A. Saint-George and
Steven Saint-George (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) initiated this action against
Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“Defendant”), alleging the following
causes of action: (1) medical malpractice; and (2) loss of consortium. As
alleged in the complaint, Plaintiff presented herself to Defendant for surgery
and related medical procedures on March 12, 2021 through March 28, 2021.
(Compl. ¶ 9.) While in the ER or from the ER to post surgery ICU, Plaintiff
developed paralysis “of her right face, right arm, entire thigh, lower leg,
intracranial mass, with other injuries.” (Ibid.) It is further alleged
that Defendant was negligent in “furnish[ing] ancillary surgical treatment
and/or post-surgical medical services, assistance and cared so as to avoid
permanent injury.” (Id. at ¶ 10.) 
 
            On May 17, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion for summary
judgment, on the grounds that there are no triable issues of material fact
concerning Plaintiff’s first and second causes of action because they are
meritless as a matter of law.
 
            As of May 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their opposition
papers. 
 
DISCUSSION
Procedural
Issues
            As a preliminary matter, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ opposition
papers are procedurally defective because they do not comply with Code of Civil
Procedure § 437c(b)(3) and California Rules of Court, rules 3.1350. In
particular, Plaintiffs have failed to enclose a responsive separate statement.
In this regard, the Court is unable to overlook this procedural defect because “if
it is not set forth in the separate statement, it does not exist.”  (San
Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308, 313.)  The content and format for the separate
statement must adhere to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(f) and (h). 
 
Also, Plaintiffs have included hundreds of pages of
alleged evidence but have failed to either file them separately or include a
table of contents. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(g).) Similarly,
Plaintiffs’ objections are not in proper form. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1354(b)-(c) [requirement of two separate documents, i.e., evidentiary
objections and a proposed order on those objections].) Furthermore, the
opposing memorandum appears to be incomplete because sections identified in the
table of contents are missing. 
 
Lastly, it is noted that Plaintiffs have included
extraneous evidence relating to a fraud claim that has not been alleged.
Because Plaintiffs have not moved to amend their complaint, this issue is not
properly before the Court. Therefore, a continuance is required in order for
these defects to be corrected. 
             
            Based on the foregoing, the Court CONTINUES Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment or in the alternative for summary adjudication to
June 26, 2024. Plaintiffs are ordered to file their corrected opposition papers
on or before June 12, 2024. Failure to abide by this order may result in
granting the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(b)(3).) Defendant is ordered to
file an additional reply, if any, on or before June 19, 2024.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
        
 Dated this 5th day of June 2024
