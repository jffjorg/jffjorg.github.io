 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Motion to Confirm
  Arbitration Award [RES ID # 9453]



 
I. Background
On September 26, 2024, Petitioner Meyer,
Olson, Lowy, Meyers, LLP (MOLM), filed a motion to confirm an arbitration award
of $126,121.12 in its favor as against Respondent Erik Oh (Oh) and awarded by a
JAMS arbitrator on August 22, 2024. The motion prays for confirmation of the
award, judgment according to the award, and for such other relief as the Court
may deem proper. 
            This matter
originally came up for hearing on October 29, 2024. On the Court’s own motion,
the matter was continued to this date to allow Petitioner’s counsel to file and
serve a supplemental declaration.  
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been
made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1285.) 
“A proceeding under th[e] [Arbitration title of the Code of
Civil Procedure] in the courts of this State [i.e., pursuant to Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 1280-1294.4] is commenced by filing a petition. Any person named as a
respondent in a petition may file a response thereto. The allegations of a
petition are deemed to be admitted by a respondent duly served therewith unless
a response is duly served and filed. The allegations of a response are deemed
controverted or avoided.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.) 
The petition must: “(a) [s]et forth the substance of or
have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies
the existence of such an agreement”; “(b) [s]et forth the names of the
arbitrators” and “(c) [s]et forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The
petition must also “name as respondents all parties to the arbitration and may
name as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration award.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1285.) A petition to confirm an award must be served and filed
within four years after the date the petitioner was served with a signed copy
of the award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.)  
If a petition or response requesting confirmation is duly
filed and served, the court must confirm, correct and confirm, or vacates the
award or dismiss the proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; see Horn v.
Gurewitz (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 255, 258; Pacific Law Group U.S.A. v.
Gibson (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 577, 580; Cooper v. Lavely & Singer
Professional Corp. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1, 10.) 
“The court may not vacate an award unless … [¶] [a]
petition or response requesting that the award be vacated has been duly served
or filed ….” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.4, subd. (a).)  A response seeking
to correct and confirm or vacate an arbitration award must be served and filed
within ten days of service of a petition to confirm that same arbitration
award, unless the timeframe is extended by agreement of the parties or “for
good cause, by order of the court.” Thus, a court may not vacate an award pursuant
to a petition for that relief that was not duly served or filed. (See Oaktree
Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Bernard (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 60, 64 [a response
served out of the ten-day window has not been “duly served” as required for
relief by Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.4].) 
“If an [arbitration] award is confirmed, judgment shall be
entered in conformity therewith. The judgment so entered has the same force and
effect as and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment
in a civil action of the same jurisdictional classification; and it may be enforced
like any other judgment of the court in which it is entered, in an action of
the same jurisdictional classification.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.4.) 
B. Analysis
Here, MOLM’s motion satisfies the
procedural requirements for a petition to confirm an arbitration award. 
Petitioner’s counsel provides a
copy of the Retainer Agreement which contains the relevant arbitration clause.
(Friedman Supp. Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 12.) The motion names the arbitrator (Mot., ¶ 4
[“Honorable Jackson Lucy [sic], Judge of the Superior Court (ret.)”), and
attaches a copy of both the Partial Final Award and the Final Arbitration Award
(Mot., Ex. A; Friedman Supp. Decl., Ex. B). (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) 
MOLM’s motion also names Erik Oh as
respondent. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1285; see Mot. p. 1.)
Last, MOLM’s was served and filed
within four years after the date the respondent was served with a signed copy
of the award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288; see Motion, Ex. A., 8/23/24 Proof of
Service.)  
The motion to confirm the
arbitration award is unopposed. Thus, the motion to confirm the arbitration
award is not controverted and the allegations in MOLM’s motion to confirm are
accepted as true. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.) 
Thus, MOLM’s motion is GRANTED. 
III. Conclusion
Petitioner Meyer, Olson, Lowy,
Meyers, LLP’s Motion to Confirm
Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
