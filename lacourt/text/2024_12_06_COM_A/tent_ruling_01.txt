CASE NO. 23CMCV00173
MICAELA LUNA CUEVAS
vs. THE KROGER CO., ET AL.
 
               On November
27, 2024, Defendant The Kroger Co. filed a statement in compliance with the court’s
October 8, 2024 order continuing the hearing on plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses to plaintiff’s demand for inspection of documents, set
two.  Plaintiff failed to comply with the
court’s order by failing to participate in the filing of a joint statement with
respect to the issues remaining after meeting and conferring as required by the
court’s order.  Nor did plaintiff file a
notice of withdrawal or notify the court at least three days before the continued
December 6, 2024 hearing, which the court continued from November 18, 2024.  The court deems the matters presented in
plaintiff’s June 21, 2024 motion to compel further responses to demand for
inspection of documents resolved in light of The Kroger Co.’s representation to
the court that it has served verified supplemental responses to request numbers
19 and 20.  The court finds that the
imposition of sanctions against either party would be unjust under the
circumstances, and therefore declines to award sanctions to either party. (Code
of Civ. Proc. Section 2031.310, subdiv. (h).)
