ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
The purpose of a preliminary injunction
is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution upon a trial. (See Scaringe
v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc. (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536.) Relief requires
the use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the
grounds for relief. (See, e.g., ReadyLink Healthcare v. Cotton (2005)
126 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016; Ancora-Citronelle Corp. v. Green (1974) 41
Cal.App.3d 146, 150.) The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as moving party.
(O'Connell v. Superior Court (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481.) A
plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence of an adequate
damages remedy at law. (C.C.P. § 526(4); Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v.
Chrysler Motors (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d
 
The trial court considers two factors in determining whether
to issue a preliminary injunction: (1) the likelihood the plaintiff will
prevail on the merits of its case at trial, and (2) the interim harm the
plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the
harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary
injunction. (C.C.P. § 526(a); Husain v. McDonald's Corp. (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 860, 866-67.) The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating
both a likelihood of success on the merits and the occurrence of irreparable
harm before a final judgment can be entered. (Savage v. Trammell Crow Co.
(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571.)
II.                
MERITS 
 
Likelihood of Success on
the Merits 
 
Violation Of Civil Code § 2923.5 – 1st
COA
 
California Civil Code § 2923.55(b)(2)
provides: 
 
A mortgage servicer shall contact the borrower in person or by
telephone in order to assess the borrower's financial situation and explore
options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure. During the initial contact, the
mortgage servicer shall advise the borrower that he or she has the right to
request a subsequent meeting and, if requested, the mortgage servicer shall
schedule the meeting to occur within 14 days. The assessment of the borrower's
financial situation and discussion of options may occur during the first
contact, or at the subsequent meeting scheduled for that purpose. In either
case, the borrower shall be provided the toll-free telephone number made
available by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) to find a HUD-certified housing counseling agency. Any meeting may occur
telephonically.
 
Plaintiffs allege no one from Defendant
contacted them by telephone or in person, as required by § 2923.55(b)(2).
(Compl. ¶ 20, Torossian Decl. ¶7.) Plaintiffs also allege no one from Defendant
assessed their finances or explored all non-foreclosure options other than Covid-19
related forbearance. (Id.) 
 
In opposition, Defendant submits
evidence that their offices attempted to contact Plaintiffs numerous times
prior to entry of foreclosure. Defendant states that they initially sent
Plaintiffs five letters soliciting loss mitigation in 2020 and thereafter
Plaintiffs entered a forbearance plan. (Ellison Decl. ¶¶ 11-16, Exhs. D-H.)
This forbearance plan began in April 2020 and lasted until September of 2020. (Id.
¶ 16, Exh I.) On September 16, 2020, Defendant extended the forbearance program
to April 2021 and then further to July 1, 2021. (Id. ¶¶ 18,21 Exhs. K
& L.)
 
Defendant thereafter sent three more
loss mitigation letters. (Id. ¶¶ 21-23 Exhs. L-N.) On August 20, 2021,
Plaintiffs requested another forbearance extension, but Defendant declined. (Id.
¶ 24.) Plaintiffs indicated at that time that they would file a modification
application. (Id. ¶ 26.) Defendant thereafter contacted Plaintiffs
several time by letter and telephone regarding loan modification. (Id.
¶¶ 29-29.) From September 28, 2021 to July 13, 2022, Defendant attempted to
contact Plaintiffs with respect to loan modification options several dozen
times. (Id. ¶¶ 30-50.) 
 
On July 14, 2022, Defendant received a
partial application for loss mitigation from Plaintiffs. (Id. ¶ 51.)
Defendant then advised Plaintiffs several times via telephone of the documents
which were missing from the application and that the application was under
review. (Id. ¶¶ 53-55, 58.) Defendant attempted to contact
Plaintiffs several times while the application was pending. (Id.
¶¶ 54, 56, 57.) 
 
On August 12, 2022, Defendant sent
Plaintiffs a letter advising them that their loss mitigation application was
closed for lack of critical information. (Id. Exh. W.) Plaintiffs had
been previously notified of this deadline in a letter dated July 19, 2022. (Id.)

 
From August 26, 2022 to October 14,
2023, the parties repeated the above. Plaintiffs sent another loss mitigation
application and Defendant ultimately denied it for Plaintiffs failure to
provide critical information. (Id. ¶¶ 61-71.) From October 31, 2022 to
December 7, 2022, the process repeated. (Id. 72-83.) No further
applications have been submitted. (Id. ¶ 92.) 
 
The Court finds that Defendant has
produced ample evidence of the numerous attempts to contact Plaintiffs with
respect to their options to avoid foreclosure. Defendant contacted Plaintiffs
numerous times by telephone as required by statute and spoke to them via
telephone on several occasions. Plaintiffs thereafter submitted applications
for loss mitigation which the parties communicated about several times. Based
upon the evidence presented the Court finds it incredibly unlikely that
Plaintiffs would succeed on this cause of action on the merits at trial. 
 
Violation Of Civil Code §
2923.6(c)(1) – 2nd COA
 
California Civil Code 2923.6(c)(1)
provides that a mortgage servicer may not record a notice of default without
first making a written determination that the borrower is not eligible for a
first lien loan modification and any appeal period has expired. 
 
Plaintiffs allege Defendant failed to
issue such a written determination before recording the notice of default.
Plaintiffs also allege that, sometime between July of 2022 and January of 2023,
they applied for “first lien relief”. (Compl. ¶ 58, Torossian Decl. ¶ 12.)
Plaintiffs state they attempted to comply with Defendant’s subsequent requests
for documents, but eventually “exhausted all efforts” to provide the
documentation to them. (Torossian Decl. ¶ 13.) Plaintiffs state Defendant
thereafter recorded a notice of Trustee’s Sale against the property on October
31, 2022. (Torossian Decl. ¶ 14.) 
 
On December 7, 2022, Defendant issued
Plaintiffs a letter stating they were ineligible for any form of loss
mitigation option, including a repayment plan, forbearance plan, and loan
modification. (Ellison Decl. ¶ 84, Exh. DD.) 
 
Defendant has provided the very letter
required of them by statute. Plaintiffs have submitted no evidence in
contravention of this letter and Plaintiffs’ declaration does not even go so
far as to claim that the letter was never received. Accordingly, the Court
finds it highly unlikely Plaintiffs would succeed on this cause of action at
trial.
 
Violation of Civil Code § 2923.7- 3rd
COA
 
Civil Code § 2922.7(a) provides, “When a
borrower requests a foreclosure prevention alternative, the mortgage servicer
shall promptly establish a single point of contact and provide to the borrower
one or more direct means of communication with the single point of contact.”
 
Plaintiff alleges Defendant never
established a point of contact or provided them with a direct line of
communication. (Compl. ¶ 73.) Plaintiffs declaration is silent as to this
allegation. 
 
On or about July 18, 2022, Flagstar sent
Plaintiffs a letter identifying Plaintiffs’ single point of contact (“SPOC”),
Andrew Vidos, and providing contact information for Plaintiffs’ SPOC. (Ellison
Decl. ¶ 52, Exh. T.) Defendant repeated this process each time Plaintiffs
submitted a loss mitigation application. (Id. ¶¶ 64, 75.) 
 
As before, Plaintiffs offer no evidence
in rebuttal and the Court finds its unlikely they would succeed at trial. 
 
Violation Of California Business
& Professions Code § 17200 – 4th COA
 
California Business and Professions Code
§ 17200 prevents the practice of “unfair competition” which the statute defines
as “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,
deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.” “Unlawful” conduct under § 17200
is any practice forbidden by law whether civil or criminal, federal, state, or
municipal, statutory, regulatory, or court made. (See Farmers Ins. Exchange
v. Super. Ct. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 383. A business practice is “unfair” when
it violates the spirit or an established public policy of a law. (People v.
Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc. (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 509, 530.) 
 
Plaintiffs allege Defendant’s refusal to
grant them a loan modification constitutes an unfair business practice. (Compl.
¶ 86.) Plaintiffs allegation of unfair business practice is based entirely on
the statutory violations in their previous causes of action. Plaintiffs have
provided no evidence showing they are likely to prevail on any of their causes
of action for statutory violation. As such, Plaintiffs’ cause of action which
is premised on those alleged statutory violations is also unlikely to prevail. 
 
Irreparable Harm 
 
The balancing of harm between the
parties “involves consideration of such things as the inadequacy of other
remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity of preserving the
status quo.” (Husain, supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at 867.) Thus, a
preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of potential
entitlement to such relief. (Doe v. Wilson (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296,
304 [“The trial court abuses its discretion in granting such a preliminary
injunction when “there is no likelihood” that the movants will prevail on the
merits of their claims for relief.”].)
 
Here, the Court has found that there is insufficient
evidence presented at this hearing to support the likelihood that Plaintiffs
would succeed on the merits at trial. Generally, the harm of selling real
property is deemed irreparable by law. (See C.C.P. § 3387.) The law is clear
that where no likelihood of success exists the Court must deny the preliminary
injunction, even where the harm is irreparable 
 
III.             
CONCLUSION
 
The Court
finds Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show likelihood of prevailing on
the merits with respect to any cause of action. Accordingly, the motion for
temporary restraining order and OSC: re preliminary injunction is DENIED.
