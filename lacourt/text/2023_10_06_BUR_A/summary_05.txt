And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to Foster's Cross-Complaint. The Court has sustained Sweeny's demurrer, deeming Foster's failure to oppose the motion a consent to granting the motion. As a result, the Court finds no need to conduct an extensive analysis of the moving party's arguments. The Court concludes that the Plaintiff has deemed the motion to have merit. The Demurrer is sustained, and Plaintiff has 20 days' leave to amend. The Court vacates the status conference and sets a Case Management Conference on January 17, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Unless all parties waive notice, Defendant is to give notice.
