	* "A terminating sanction is a 'drastic measure which should be employed with caution.'"

But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion for terminating sanctions filed by American Family Connect Property Casualty Insurance Co. (Petitioner) against Carlos Cruz (Respondent). The motion was filed due to Respondent's failure to obey court orders compelling discovery responses. The court found that Respondent's counsel withdrew representation on January 25, 2023, and that Petitioner served notice of motions to compel on Respondent on March 1, 2023. The court was satisfied that Respondent has not been represented by counsel since January 2023 and that Petitioner's service of notice was proper.

However, the court did not find that Respondent's failure to comply with court orders was willful, and therefore denied the motion for terminating sanctions. Instead, the court scheduled a hearing for non-terminating evidentiary sanctions and ordered the moving party to serve notice. The court will determine whether evidentiary sanctions or issue preclusion is appropriate at the hearing.
