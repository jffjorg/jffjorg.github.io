And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion for evidentiary sanctions filed by West Coast Urgent Care Clinics, Inc. (Defendant) against Susanna Yagubyan (Plaintiff). The Defendant is seeking to preclude the Plaintiff from introducing text messages and emails mentioned in her deposition into evidence, as well as to exclude her testimony at trial entirely.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's counsel has consistently abused the discovery process by failing to respond to the Defendant's requests for production of text messages and emails, and by producing only a non-native format of the text messages. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's counsel has refused to produce the emails mentioned in her deposition.

The Judge denies the motion in part, ruling that the Plaintiff is not precluded from introducing text messages into evidence, but must provide them in a readable and usable format within 10 calendar days. The Judge grants the motion in part, ruling that the Plaintiff is precluded from introducing emails mentioned in her deposition into evidence.

The Judge also sets an informal discovery conference regarding compliance on October 17, 2023, and warns that if compliance is not achieved, the Defendant may be entitled to a further motion for evidentiary sanctions.
