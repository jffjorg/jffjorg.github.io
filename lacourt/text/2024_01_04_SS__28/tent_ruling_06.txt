 Case Number:  22STCV15221    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving and opposing papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
May 6, 2022, Plaintiff Jasmin Daniella Campos (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“City”), County
of Los Angeles (“County”), Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (“Department”),
and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises liability. 
On
November 28, 2022, the City and Department filed an answer and the City filed a
cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Roes 1 to 25 for indemnification, apportionment
of fault, and declaratory relief. 
On
November 13, 2023, the City and Department filed a motion for summary judgment
or, in the alternative, summary adjudication, which is set for hearing on March
6, 2024. 
On
November 16, 2023, the City and Department (“Moving Defendants”) filed a motion
to continue the trial.  On December 14,
2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition.  
Trial
is currently scheduled for March 1, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Moving
Defendants ask the Court to continue the trial to August 26, 2024. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b), provides that “a party seeking a continuance of
the date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by
the parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an
ex parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations. The party must make the motion or application as soon
as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.” 
          Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c), the Court may grant a continuance
only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.
Circumstances that may indicate good cause include “a party's excused inability
to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite
diligent efforts,” or the unavailability of a party, counsel, or expert due to
death, illness or other excusable circumstance. The Court should consider all
facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as proximity of the
trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice are served.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 

DISCUSSION 
Moving
Defendants request that the Court continue the trial because it is currently scheduled
to begin on March 1, 2024, five days before the March 6, 2024 hearing on their
motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication.  
A
court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed within the time
limits of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c.  (See Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918, 919.) 
Although Plaintiff asserts that Moving Defendants could have filed their
summary judgment motion earlier, Plaintiff does not show that the motion is
outside the time limits of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. 
Moving
Defendants ask the Court to continue the trial to August 26, 2024 because
their counsel’s trial calendar “does not free up until August 2024.” 
The
Court finds good cause to continue the trial but declines to continue the trial
to August 2024.  The Court continues the
trial to May 7, 2024. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion to continue trial filed by Defendants City of Los
Angeles and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  The Court continues the trial to May  7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the
Spring Street Courthouse. The Final Status Conference is April 23, 2024, at
10:00 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  Discovery and all related dates will be based
on the new trial date. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file a proof of service of this ruling within five days.
