And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the motion to continue the trial and reopen discovery filed by the plaintiff, Scott Wilson. The plaintiff is requesting a continuance to May 1, 2024, or the next available date, and to reopen discovery. The defendant, Ralphs Grocery Co., The Kroger Co., Ralphs Employee "Robert", and Does 1 to 25, does not oppose the motion to continue the trial.

The judge is considering the factors listed in Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, which includes the necessity and reasons for the discovery, the diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery, and any likelihood that permitting the discovery will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set or result in prejudice to any other party.

Based on the information presented, the judge finds good cause and grants the motion to continue the trial to May 20, 2024. The judge also grants the request to reopen discovery and sets the final status conference for May 6, 2024. The discovery and related dates will be based on the May 20, 2024 trial date.
