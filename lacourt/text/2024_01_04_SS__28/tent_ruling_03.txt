Proc., § 2025.450,  subds. (a), (b), (g).)  B.   Inspection demand          “If a party to whom a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response  to it, the following rules shall apply:  “(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party making the demand may move for an order  compelling response to the demand.  “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order  compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including  the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition  to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional  circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney  of a party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has  been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good  faith operation of an electronic information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.”  (Code Civ.

The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this  waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are  satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290.)  D.      Requests for admission  “If a party to whom requests for admission are  directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are  directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege  or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).

It is mandatory that the court  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to  requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)  E.       Discovery  sanctions  “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering  that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney  advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including  attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may  also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has  engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised  that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any  provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds  that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or  that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)  “Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not  limited to, the following:  * * *  “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized  method of discovery.”  (Code Civ.

not object to the deposition notice or ask to continue or reschedule the  deposition.  On  June 27, 2023, Apex’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel to confirm that  Plaintiff would appear at his June 30, 2023 deposition.  Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond.  On  June 30, 2023, counsel for Apex, Goldenvoice, and AEG appeared for Plaintiff’s  deposition but Plaintiff and his counsel did not appear.  The court reporter prepared an official  transcript certifying Plaintiff’s failure to appear.  On  July 18, 2023, after receiving the official transcript, Apex’s counsel reached  out to Plaintiff’s counsel to see if Plaintiff would voluntarily appear for his  deposition or if Apex needed to seek court intervention.  Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond.  The Court grants Apex’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s  deposition.  Plaintiff is ordered to  appear for his deposition by February 5, 2024.  Apex requests monetary sanctions of $2,463.15 based on  6.5 hours of attorney time at a
