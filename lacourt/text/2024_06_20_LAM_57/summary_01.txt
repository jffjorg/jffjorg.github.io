  - "For purposes of a motion to expunge a lis pendens, the term "'probable validity'... means that it is more likely than not that the claimant will obtain a judgment against the defendant on the claim."
  - "When it comes to 'a motion to expunge a lis pendens after judgment against the claimant and while an appeal is pending, the trial court must grant the motion unless it finds it more likely than not that the appellate court will reverse the judgment."'
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens that the plaintiff recorded on the property. The defendant had filed a summary judgment motion, which was granted, and the plaintiff has appealed. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion to expunge the lis pendens. The court finds that the plaintiff cannot meet the standard for expungement, which requires that it is more likely than not that the appellate court will reverse the judgment. The court awards the defendant attorney's fees and costs associated with the motion, including $3,472.50, which must be paid by the plaintiff by October 1, 2024.
