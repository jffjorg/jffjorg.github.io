Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Ben and Reef Gardens, Inc., moves to set aside the default entered against it. The motion is denied. The defendant argues that it is entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, which provides for mandatory relief from default judgments when an attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect causes the default. However, the court finds that the defendant's motion is untimely and that the defendant's counsel's mistake, as alleged, does not relate to the entry of default by the clerk.

The court notes that the defendant's counsel delayed in properly revising and filing a stipulation to set aside the default, and that the defendant's motion was filed more than six months after the entry of default. The court also finds that the defendant's counsel's declaration in support of the motion is provably false, as demonstrated by the ex parte application to set aside the default and the subsequent fraudulent stipulation.

Accordingly, the court denies the defendant's motion to set aside the default.
