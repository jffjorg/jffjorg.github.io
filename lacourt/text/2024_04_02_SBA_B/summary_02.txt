Significant Statements:
  - "We construe the second sentence of section 664.6 to mean, and we so hold, that even though a settlement may call for a case to be dismissed, or the plaintiff may dismiss the suit of its own accord, the court may nevertheless retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement, until such time as all of its terms have been performed by the parties, if the parties have requested this specific retention of jurisdiction."
```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the court has the power to retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement, even after the case has been dismissed, as long as the parties requested this retention of jurisdiction. The judge also clarifies that the court does not need to wait for full performance of the settlement agreement before filing a dismissal. This ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 and the case of Sayta v. Chu (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 960, 966.
