And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this matter, modifying the subpoenas issued to plaintiff's former employers. The court finds that the subpoenas are overly broad and seek protected information. The court grants the motion to modify the subpoenas and orders the defendant to provide limited information, including job descriptions, attendance records, payroll records, and performance evaluations. The court also denies the requests for sanctions. The court's ruling is intended to balance the plaintiff's right to privacy with the defendant's need to test the plaintiff's claims and demonstrate their credibility.
