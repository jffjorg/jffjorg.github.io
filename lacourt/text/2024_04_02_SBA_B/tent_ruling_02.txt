[1] /              Plaintiff’s counsel evidenced a misunderstanding regarding how C.C.P. § 664.6 works when he suggested in an email on September 14, 2021, that there was a conflict between the obligation to dismiss the case within 10 days and the provision that the court shall retain jurisdiction under C.C.P. § 664.6.  It is not necessary to wait for full performance of the Settlement Agreement to file the dismissal.“We construe the second sentence of section 664.6 to mean, and we so hold, that even though a settlement may call for a case to be dismissed, or the plaintiff may dismiss the suit of its own accord, the court may nevertheless retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement, until such time as all of its terms have been performed by the parties, if the parties have requested this specific retention of jurisdiction.”  (Wackeen, at p. 439, 118 Cal.Rptr.2d 502.)”  Sayta v. Chu (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 960, 966.
