And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court conditionally grants the motion to withdraw as counsel, filed by Manuel Eli Gonzalez, defendant's counsel. The court finds that the motion fails to comply with California Rule of Court, rule 3.1362, as the proposed order was not filed. However, the court considers the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the hostile behavior by the client's boyfriend as sufficient grounds for withdrawal. The court will delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of the signed order on the client and proof of service of the next trial date are filed with the court.
