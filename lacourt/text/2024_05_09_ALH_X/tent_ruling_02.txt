RELIEF
REQUESTED 
To compel Defendants Chung Huei Lin and Willy Ling’s (collectively,
“Defendants”) responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One and Form
Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions in the amount
of $3,261.65 against Defendants. 
             
 
BACKGROUND
On
March 9, 2023, Plaintiff Chia Huey Lin (“Plaintiff”) filed the
Complaint against Defendants for quiet title. On May 26, 2024, Defendant Willy
Ling filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff. 
 
On
January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant improperly combined discovery motions.
As of May 6, 2024, Defendants have not filed an opposition. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel initial responses from
Defendants to Form Interrogatories, Set One is granted. Defendants are ordered
to provide responses without objection within 30 days of the Court’s order. Also, the Requests for Admissions, Set One are deemed admitted
against Defendants. 
 
The Court grants
monetary sanctions for a total of 3 hours at $250.00 per hour for a total of
$750.00. Defendants are ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount to
Plaintiff, by and through counsel, within thirty (30) days of notice of this
order. Plaintiff is ordered to pay
an additional filing fee of $60.00 to the Court within (20) days of this Order.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this
ruling.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.¿(CCP §
2030.290(b).)¿The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where
no responses or no verified responses have been served.¿¿All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served.¿(See¿Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Where a party fails to timely respond to a
request for admission, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿
The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the
court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has
subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s
failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)¿ The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Form
Interrogatories, Set One 


Here, on
August 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office served Form Interrogatories, Set
One on each of the Defendants in this action. (Lin Decl. ¶ 2; Ex. 1.) Plaintiff
provided multiple extensions per Defendants’ counsel’s requests. (Id. at
¶ 3.) On January 3, 2024, Defendant’s counsel served a motion to withdraw which
was granted on February 5, 2024.  To
date, Defendants have not responded to the discovery request. (Id. at ¶
4.) Defendants did not file an opposition. Therefore, the Court grants the
Motion. 
 
Requests for
Admissions, Set One 
 
Here, on
August 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office served Form Interrogatories, Set
One on each of the Defendants in this action. (Lin Decl. ¶ 2; Ex. 1.) Plaintiff
provided multiple extensions per Defendants’ counsel’s requests. (Id. at
¶ 3.) On January 3, 2024, Defendant’s counsel served a motion to withdraw which
was granted on February 5, 2024.  To
date, Defendants have not responded to the discovery request. (Id. at ¶
4.) Defendants did not file an opposition. Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
deeming the Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted against Defendants. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)¿ 
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions against Defendants,
jointly or severally in the amount of $3,261.65.  
 
Although Defendant did not oppose the motions, the Court
can impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery, which includes failing
to respond to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d); see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a) [“The court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.”].)  
 
The Court finds Defendants’ failure to respond was a misuse
of the discovery process. Sanctions have been sufficiently noticed. However,
the Court reduces the requested fees because: (1) Plaintiff does not justify
the $400 hourly rate with an explanation of Plaintiff’s counsel’s experience (Lin
Decl. ¶ 7.); (2) two hours spent trying to resolve the discovery dispute
informally (via emails) is excessive given this is a regular, simple task for
counsel (Id.); (3) the one hour and half preparing discovery is
excessive due to its simple nature; and (4) three and a half hours spent
preparing this simple discovery motion is excessive. 
 
In addition, Plaintiff filed a
single motion for what should have been two separate motions. Combining
discovery motions allows the moving party to avoid paying the requisite filing
fees. “Every direction of a court or judge, made or entered in writing, and not
included in a judgment, is denominated an order. An application for an order is
a motion.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1003.) Government Code section 70617 requires
payment of a $60 filing fee for each motion filed with the Court. Plaintiff may
not circumvent the Government Code with an omnibus filing. An additional filing
fee is required before the Court may hear the motion. Filing fees are
jurisdictional and it is mandatory for court clerks to demand and receive them.
(See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457, 460.) Thus,
Plaintiff is ordered to pay an additional filing fee.
 
Accordingly, the
Court grants monetary sanctions for a total of 3 hours at $250.00 per hour for
a total of $750.00. Defendants are ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the
amount to Plaintiff, by and through counsel, within thirty (30) days of notice
of this order. Plaintiff is ordered
to pay an additional filing fee of $60.00 to the Court within (20) days of this
Order.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel initial responses from
Defendants to Form Interrogatories, Set One is granted. Defendants are ordered
to provide responses without objection within 30 days of the Court’s order. Also, the Requests for Admissions, Set One are deemed admitted
against Defendants.
