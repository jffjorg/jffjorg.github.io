REQUESTED
To be relieved as Defendant Pinkberry Inc.’s counsel. 
 
             
BACKGROUND
 
On
October 11, 2022, Plaintiff Brian Whitaker (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint
against Jasjit K. Bisla, Satinder S. Bisla, and Pinkberry Inc. (collectively,
“Defendants”) seeking damages and injunctive relief of Unruh Civil Rights Act
and California Disabled Persons Act. 
 
On
April 15, 2024, Defendant’s counsel, Manuel Eli Gonzalez (“Counsel”) filed the
instant action. 
 
As of
May 6, 2024, no oppositions have been filed. 

 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Court conditionally grants the motion pursuant to
Counsel filing the Proposed Order. 
             
LEGAL STANDARD
For a Motion to Withdraw, California Rule of Court, rule 3.1362 requires
(1) a notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client; (2) a
declaration stating in general terms the basis for the withdrawal, without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship; (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties
who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving
counsel.  
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion fails to comply with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362. For instance, the Court finds that Counsel failed to file
the Proposed Order (MC-053).¿However, Counsel did file a notice of motion and
motion to be directed to the client and a declaration. The declaration states
that he seeks to withdraw because “it has been very challenging for his office
to maintain regular communication with [the client].” (Gonzalez Decl. ¶¶ 3-6.)
Moreover, Counsel states there has been a serious breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. (Id. at ¶ 9.) For instance, Counsel states “[o]n April
13, 2024, I called defendant who for some reason was very hostile towards me.
During the telephone call Ms. Kaur informed me that she no longer desired my
services. Also, during that phone call, Ms. Kaur put her boyfriend on the phone
who then threatened to “kick my ass,” and he then demanded a refund. (Id.
at ¶¶ 7- 8.) There does not seem to be obvious prejudice because trial has not
been set and oppositions have not been filed. Although the Case Management
Conference is set for June 13, 2024, it can be continued if prejudice arises. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Therefore,
the Court conditionally grants the motion pursuant to Counsel filing the
Proposed Order. 
 
            The court
will delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until (1) proof of
service of a copy of the signed order on the client and (2) proof that the
client has been properly served with notice of the next trial date have been
filed with the court.
