SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
an unspecified date, but sometime after November 2012 and presumably before
November 2018, plaintiffs Layne Kramer, et al. invested in two annuity
contracts provided by defendant Allianz Life Insurance Company of North
America. The annuities were acquired with inheritance money following the
passing of Layne Kramer’s father. Layne sought a source of income for the care
of her elderly, ill mother. The transaction was arranged/brokered by insurance
agent defendant David Neuman. 
 
Again,
presumably following the purchase of the annuities, Neuman was convicted on one
count of felony embezzlement, and his insurance license revoked on November 13,
2018. A new agent was assigned by Allianz to Plaintiffs’ account. Notwithstanding
the termination of any relationship between Neuman and Allianz, Neuman, as a
continuing authorized agent on the account, was subsequently able to arrange
for the disbursement of $330,000 from the annuities for personal use. Plaintiffs
allege Allianz neither informed Plaintiffs of the prior conviction and loss of
license by Neuman, nor properly inquired on the requested disbursements by
Neuman. 
 
On
October 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for Financial Elder Abuse,
Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Professional Negligence, and Receipt and Possession
of Stolen Property (David Neuman only named defendant in this cause of action).
David Neuman answered on December 12, 2023. 
 
RULING
Demurrer: Sustained with
Leave to Amend.
Defendant
Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz) brings the subject
demurer to the second and third causes of action in the complaint for Breach of
Fiduciary Duty and Professional Negligence. Allianz submits the demurrer on
grounds that Allianz, as an insurer owed no fiduciary duty or professional duty
of care to its insureds. Plaintiffs, Layne Kramer, Kramer Family Irrevocable
Grant Trust by trustee Layne Kramer (Kramer) in opposition contends the
operative complaint alleges a relationship beyond a conventional insurer,
thereby demonstrating the undertaking of additional fiduciary and professional
duties. Allianz in reply reiterates the lack of any basis of duty, and
maintains the lack of sufficient facts distinguishing the conduct of Newman
from Allianz.
 
A
demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from
either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules, where the
complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]
 
2nd
Cause of Action: Breach of Fiduciary Duty
To plead a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, a
plaintiff must allege facts showing the existence of a fiduciary duty owed to
that plaintiff, a breach of that duty and resulting damage. (Pellegrini v. Weiss (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 515, 524.) A fiduciary duty is founded upon a special relationship
imposed by law or under circumstances in which “confidence is reposed by
persons in the integrity of others” who voluntarily accept the confidence. (Tri-Growth Centre City, Ltd. v. Silldorf,
Burdman, Duignan & Eisenberg (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1139, 1150; City of Hope National Medical Center v. Genentech, Inc. (2008) 43 Cal.4th 375, 386.) “A fiduciary or
confidential relationship can arise when confidence is reposed by persons in
the integrity of others, and if the latter voluntarily accepts or assumes to
accept the confidence, he or she may not act so as to take advantage of the
other's interest without that person's knowledge or consent.” (Pierce v. Lyman (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th
1093, 1101–02.)
 
In the insurance coverage context, “[a]n insurer is not a fiduciary, and owes no obligation to
consider the interests of its insured above its own.” (Morris v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 966, 973; Village Northridge Homeowners Assn. v. State Farm Fire &
Casualty Co. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 913, 929.)
Allianz relies on this general presumption, as well as the lack of facts
establishing any alternative basis demonstrating a voluntary undertaking of
duties through the relationship of the parties. The contractual relationship
established through the annuities insufficiently establishes such a basis. (Wolf v. Superior Court (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 25, 30-31.)
 
Plaintiff relies on a
characterization of the relationship with Allianz as one of investor advisor or
principal to agent. (Hasso v. Hapke (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 107, 140; Michelson v. Hamada (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1566, 1575-1576.) Plaintiff cites to argument regarding four
factors potentially determining a fiduciary duty listed as: “(1) one party
entrusts its affairs, interests or property to another; (2) there is a grant of
broad discretion to another, generally because of a disparity in expertise or
knowledge; (3) the two parties have an “asymmetrical access to information,”
meaning one party has little ability to monitor the other and must rely on the
truth of the other party's representations; and (4) one party is vulnerable and
dependent upon the other.” (City of Hope National Medical
Center v. Genentech, Inc., supra, 43
Cal.4th at pp. 387–388.) Consistent with the California Supreme Court, however,
the court declines to find allegations fitting description of the four factors
presented, especially within a contractual relationship, establishes the
existence of fiduciary duty. (Id. at pp. 388-389.) Even considering the
factors, the court finds the allegations in the operative complaint
insufficiently articulate any contractual based fiduciary duty simply based on
the purchase of the two annuity contracts.
 
The actual cause of action however
dedicates allegations to the existence of a principal agent relationship, and
therefore a basis for an imposed fiduciary duty. [Comp., ¶¶ 58-59.] Allianz generally
describes the allegations as a conflation of facts without sufficient
knowledge, while Plaintiff maintains the doctrine of imputed knowledge to the
principal of the personal situation of Plaintiffs establishes a basis of agency
liability effectively via the fiduciary duty with Neuman. [Id., ¶¶ 60-63.] (Hale v. Depaoli (1948) 33
Cal.2d 228, 232-233.)
 
The validity of the legal argument
remains undisputed. Allianz carefully points out that the alleged transfer of
funds by Neuman occurred after cessation of the relationship with the insurer,
thereby effectively severing any principal agent relationship. [Comp., ¶¶
32-38.] (Civ. Code, § 2343; Peredia v. HR Mobile Services,
Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680, 691.) The
court concurs.
 
The facts, as presented in the
current complaint, insufficiently establish the basis for a continuing
principal agent relationship via Neuman, and otherwise fails to present an
alternative basis for the finding of a fiduciary duty against Allianz. The court
therefore sustains the demurrer with leave to amend.
 
3rd Cause of Action: Professional Negligence
Allianz challenges the subject claim on the failure
to allege an independent basis of duty separate and apart from the alleged
conduct of Neuman. Plaintiff relies on the principal agent basis of liability
for establishment of a basis of imposed duty. 
 
“To state a cause of action for professional
negligence, a party must show ‘(1) the duty of the professional to use such
skill, prudence and diligence as other members of the profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) breach of that duty; (3) a causal connection between
the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage
resulting from the professional negligence.’” (Giacometti v. Aulla, LLC
(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1137.) The operative complaint alleges the
elements of the claim. [Comp., ¶¶ 70-73.] As addressed in the breach of
fiduciary claim, the court finds the factually reliant but flawed agency
relationship seeking to impose a duty of care after Allianz’s termination of
the relationship with Neuman and disqualification of Neuman’s insurance license
renders the demurrer valid. The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
 
 
Motion to
Strike
Allianz
moves to strike paragraphs 7-9, 25-27, and 49 of the Complaint on grounds that
said claims improperly seek relief beyond the scope of the financial elder
abuse statute. More specifically, Layne Kramer alleges wrongful conduct before
turning 65 years old, as well as challenges to the specific types of conduct
relied upon in support of the elder abuse claim. Plaintiffs in opposition
maintains the motion sweeps too broadly, and all challenged claims are
relevant. Any and all conduct before Plaintiff turned 65 should also remain as
part of the action. Allianz in reply reiterates the lack of a valid claim for
anything accruing prior to age 65, as well as the lack of actionable facts.
 
Allianz proactively contends the motion to strike is
the proper means for challenging the subject claims, even though the arguments
read as a substantive challenge to the basis of the cause of action itself in
regards to the basis of liability. (PH
II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682-1683
[While a demurrer is not the exclusive means to challenge a cause of action, a
motion to strike generally applies to parts of a cause of action, claim for
damages, or where the cause of action or primary right is barred as a matter of
law.]; Quiroz v. Seventh Ave.
Center (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1281 [“Where a whole cause of
action is the proper subject of a pleading challenge, the court should
sustain a demurrer to the cause of action rather than grant
a motion to strike”].) Plaintiffs offer no apparent response to
the procedural basis of the challenge. The court therefore considers the identified
allegations within context of entire complaint.
 
The court
only considers the identified paragraphs in the notice of motion, and declines
to make a general finding of a barred claim for conduct occurring before Layne
Kramer turned 65. [See Comp., ¶ 31.] Furthermore, such an argument regarding
the propriety of a claim accruing before age 65 constitutes a legal challenge
to the entire cause of action and therefore the subject matter of a demurrer. The
motion to strike is denied as to this argument.
 
On the
identified paragraphs, the court finds the allegations in paragraphs 7-9 are in
no way strictly limited to the elder abuse claim and therefore factually
improper. The motion is denied as to these items. 
 
Paragraphs
25-27 on the other hand fail to allege elder abuse simply based on the improper
recommendation of the annuity options due to the lack of liquidity and risk
factors. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30.) Nevertheless, like paragraphs
709, the subject paragraphs are not exclusively part of the elder abuse claim
in that all prior paragraphs are incorporated. While such allegations could be
a part of the fiduciary duty, and professional negligence causes of action, and
Plaintiffs’ reliance on the allegations remains unclear as to the other causes
of action, the court finds no basis for striking the general allegations based
on a challenge under the elder abuse statute. The motion is therefore denied as
to these paragraphs. 
 
On
paragraph 49, however, the court finds no basis for the subject claim within
the scope of the elder abuse claim. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30.) The
motion to strike is therefore granted as to paragraph 49 only.
 
 
In summary, the demurrer is sustained with 30 days leave to amend as
to the breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence causes of action.
The motion to strike is granted as to paragraph 49 only, and denied on the
remainder. 
 
Plaintiff
may not add any new causes of action without leave of court. (Harris v.
Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) Material
changes to the operative complaint seeking to alter or omit the material terms or
dates may also be subject to a demurrer under the sham pleading standard. Given
the case presents the first review of the action, the court declines to consider
Plaintiffs’ potential inability to factually present a claim without omitting
or altering certain key facts. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (e)(1); Youngman
v. Nevada Irr. Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.) The court will consider
potential alternative theories of liability upon the request of Plaintiffs,
however.
 
The court will concurrently conduct the Case Management
Conference.
