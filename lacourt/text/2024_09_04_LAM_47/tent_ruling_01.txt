DISCUSSION:
 
Demurrer to Complaint
 
            Defendant
demurs to the Complaint in its entirety for failure to state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields
v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n
demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations contained therein are
assumed to be true”].) “This rule of liberal construction means that the
reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.” (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1238.) 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who has filed the pleading subject to the demurrer and file a declaration
detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)
However, an insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds
to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(4).)
 
            The
Declaration of Stephen McAndrew in support of the Demurrer states that counsel
for Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff on January 31, 2024 outlining the
claimed deficiencies in the Complaint. (Declaration of Stephen McAndrew ISO
Dem. ¶ 3; Exh. B.) Plaintiff responded by email that same day stating that he
would not be withdrawing the Complaint. (Id. ¶ 4; Exh. B.) Defendant’s
counsel also states that Plaintiff informed Attorney McAndrew by telephone that
he would not be amending the Complaint. (Id.) Defendant has therefore
demonstrated compliance with its statutory meet and confer obligations. 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
demurs to the Complaint on the grounds that it does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. Defendant principally argues that the
Complaint is deficient because it does not contain a statement of the facts
giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims. Under Code of Civil Procedure section
425.10(a)(1), a complaint must contain “[a] statement of the facts constituting
the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
425.10(a)(1).) Although Plaintiff’s Complaint contains a header for “factual
allegations,” that section has been left blank. (Complaint p.2.) Moreover, while
Plaintiff has included text conversations and email chains as supporting
documentation, these materials are not a substitute for a statement of the
facts in ordinary and concise language. The Court concurs with Defendant that
the Complaint is deficient.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED.
 
Leave to Amend
 
When a demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether
there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318).  When a plaintiff “has
pleaded the general set of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the
court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since
plaintiff should not “be deprived of his right to maintain his action on the
ground that his pleadings were defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v.
Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) Accordingly, California law
imposes the burden on the plaintiffs to demonstrate the manner in which they
can amend their pleadings to state their claims against a
defendant.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
“Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the
complaint shows on its face it is incapable of amendment. 
[Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair
opportunity to correct any defect has not been given." (Angie M. v.
Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.)
 
            As
Plaintiff has not responded to the Demurrer, Plaintiff has not shown how the
defects in the Complaint might be cured by amendment. That said, because the
deficiencies arise from an absence of information required by statute, it is
facially apparent that further detail, in the form of a statement of facts in
ordinary and concise language, would cure that defect. The Court therefore
finds good cause to permit amendment of the Complaint.
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. 
 
            Plaintiff
shall have 30 days leave to file a First Amended Complaint. 
 
Motion to Strike Complaint
 
            Defendant
also moves to strike the Complaint as improper. Because the Court has sustained
the Demurrer to the Complaint, the Motion to Strike is MOOT. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly, Defendant’s
Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. 
 
            Defendant’s
Motion to Strike is MOOT.
 
            Plaintiff
shall have 30 days leave to file a First Amended Complaint. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
