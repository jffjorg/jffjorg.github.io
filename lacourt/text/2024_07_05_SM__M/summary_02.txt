The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Elizabeth Howland's motion to compel Plaintiffs Samantha and Royce Clayton's compliance with a previous order awarding her attorney's fees in the amount of $9,100.00. The Defendant contends that the Plaintiffs have failed to comply with the order, while the Plaintiffs argue that the Defendant lacks standing to pursue the attorney's fees. The judge finds that the motion does not seek any new relief, but rather an affirmation of the previous order. The judge also notes that the order is a money judgment, subject to typical post-judgment collection remedies under the Enforcement of Judgments Law.
