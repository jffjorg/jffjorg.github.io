And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion brought by Plaintiff Eugene Rapaport M.D. to set aside the dismissal of the action and to vacate the motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The judge found that Plaintiff is not entitled to mandatory relief under CCP § 473(b) because the dismissal is not a "resulting default entered by the clerk... which will result in entry of a default judgment" or a "resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client." Additionally, the judge was not inclined to grant discretionary relief under CCP § 473(b) because Plaintiff's counsel failed to attend an OSC hearing due to a calendaring error and did not make a good faith effort to resolve the issue informally before bringing the motion. The judge also noted that even if discretionary relief were granted, Plaintiff's counsel would be required to pay sanctions for failing to appear and necessitating the motion.
