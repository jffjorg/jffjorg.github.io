LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
 
            Defendant’s
request for judicial notice is GRANTED.  The
Court will consider the complaint filed in case no. 22STCV15803, and concludes
that the two complaints are consistent in their allegations.  The instant complaint alleges
that Plaintiff “first learned or reasonably should have known the facts that
plaintiff's injuries and damages were a legal result of the negligent acts or
omissions of the defendants on or about May 10, 2022, when Plaintiff underwent
surgery for revision to the total hip replacement surgery that was performed by
Defendant Michael G. Hannon, M.D. on May 21, 2019.” (Compl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff’s complaint
against Attune Health was filed the next day, on May 11, 2022.  The Attune Health complaint alleges that less
than one year elapsed since Plaintiff first learned or reasonably should have
known the injuries and less than three years from the actual injury. This is
consistent with the allegations here that Plaintiff first discovered the
negligent cause of the injury on May 10, 2022, and that the injury first
manifested within three years of March 24, 2023. The Court will not, however,
consider Defendant’s new basis for demurrer that another action is pending
between the parties. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Demurrer 
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’
causes of action for medical negligence and loss of consortium fail as a matter
of law because Plaintiffs failed to comply with the statute of limitations set
forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5, which states: 
 
“In an action for injury or death
against a health care provider based upon such person’s alleged professional
negligence, the time for the commencement of action shall be three years
after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers,
or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever
occurs first. In no event shall the time for commencement of legal action
exceed three years unless tolled for any of the following: (1) upon proof of
fraud, (2) intentional concealment, or (3) the presence of a foreign body,
which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of the
injured person.” 
 
(Emphasis Added.)
The term “injury” for purposes of section 340.5 refers to the damaging effect
of the alleged wrongful act, not to the act itself. (Filosa v. Alagappan
(2020) 59 Cal.App.5th 772, 779.)  The
injury is not necessarily the ultimate harm suffered, but instead occurs at the
point at which “appreciable harm” first it first manifests in “some significant
fashion” and damage is “noticeable.” (Id., quoting Warren v. Schecter
(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1189, 1203.) “Because the three-year limitations period
accrues at the time of injury, it is the surfacing of appreciable harm that
marks the beginning of the three-year period.” (Filosa, supra, 59
Cal.App.5th at 779.)
            
Plaintiffs
filed their lawsuit in March 2023. Plaintiffs’ medical malpractice claims stem
from a surgical procedure in 2019, facially outside the three-year limitations
period. (Compl., ¶ 9.) However, Plaintiffs also allege, as a matter of fact,
that less than one year had elapsed from when Plaintiff first learned or
reasonably should have known that the injuries were the result of the negligent
acts or omissions of the Defendants. (Id.) 
Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that he discovered the negligent cause
of his injury on May 10, 2022, when Plaintiff underwent surgery for revision
to the total hip replacement surgery that was performed by Defendant Michael G.
Hannon, M.D. on May 21, 2019. (Id.) Therefore, Plaintiffs pled sufficient facts
to show that the one-year statute of limitations did not accrue until May 10,
2023. Critically, Plaintiff also pleads that less than three years have elapsed
since the manifestation of Plaintiff's injury. (Id.) Whether this is accurate
or not, it would suffice for pleading purposes as to the statute of limitations
because the complaint does not reveal, on its face, that the claims are subject
to a statute of limitations defense.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
Motion to
Strike – Prejudgment Interest
 
Defendants
move to strike the Prayer for Prejudgment Interest, item no. 5: “For
pre-judgment interest, according to law.” California Civil Code section 3287 provides for
prejudgment interest for damages that are certain or capable of being made
certain by calculation. Prejudgment interest is awarded to provide just
compensation to the injured party for loss of use of the award during the
prejudgment period. (Howard v. American National Fire Ins. Co. (2010)
187 Cal. App. 4th 498, 535-536.) Whether a defendant is liable for prejudgment
interest depends on whether “defendant¿actually know[s] the amount owed or from reasonably available
information could the defendant have computed that amount.”  (Duale v.
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC¿(2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 718, 729, citing Children's Hosp. v. Bonta¿(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 774.) “The statute . . . does not authorize
prejudgment interest where the amount of damage, as opposed to the
determination of liability, depends upon a judicial determination based upon
conflicting evidence and¿it is not
ascertainable from truthful data supplied by the claimant to his debtor. Thus,¿where the amount of damages cannot be resolved except by verdict or
judgment, prejudgment interest is not appropriate.” (Id., citations,
quotations and emphasis omitted.) 
 
            Here, Plaintiffs have not pled sum
certain damages entitling them to prejudgment interest. Plaintiff cites their
economic medical damages as certain or capable of being made certain. However, such
economic damages are not yet certain, but instead depend upon a later judicial
determination based upon conflicting evidence. Plaintiffs’
claimed damages stem solely from allegedly improper medical care. At this
juncture, Defendants could not know the amount owed, and could not have
computed any amount from reasonably available information. Thus, prejudgment
interest would be improper. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to strike
prejudgment interest is GRANTED without leave to amend.
