MOTION:                  Motion
to Comple Compliance with Order Re: Fee Award 
HEARING DATE:   7/5/2024

 
Analysis
 
Defendant Elizabeth Howland moves
to compel Plaintiffs Samantha and Royce Clayton’s compliance with this Court's
March 15, 2023, order granting her attorney’s fees in the amount of $9,100.00
pursuant to her successful anti-SLAPP. Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have
failed to comply with this Court’s order awarding attorney’s fees. 
 
Plaintiffs assert that Defendant
lacks standing to pursue her attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs cite no authority for
this proposition. (See McFarland v. City of Sausalito (1990) 218
Cal.App.3d 909, 911-912 [intervenor was not allowed to further participate in
action after his complaint in intervention was dismissed pursuant to
demurrer].)  That said, the motion does
not seek any appropriate relief. Essentially, Defendant asks this Court to
re-affirm its prior order. There is no reasonable dispute that the Court has
already ordered fees as sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16(c). Such an award is a money judgment, and subject to typical
post-judgment collection remedies under the Enforcement of Judgments Law. (See CCP
§680 et seq.)
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
