And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the complaint and a motion to strike the prayer for prejudgment interest in a medical malpractice lawsuit. The complaint alleges that the plaintiff's injuries were caused by the negligent acts or omissions of the defendants, and that the plaintiff discovered the negligent cause of his injury on May 10, 2022. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred because the statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims in California is three years from the date of injury, and that the plaintiff failed to comply with this statute. The court rules that the plaintiff's claims are not time-barred because the one-year statute of limitations did not accrue until May 10, 2022, and that the complaint does not reveal, on its face, that the claims are subject to a statute of limitations defense. The court also rules that the prayer for prejudgment interest is improper because the amount of damages is not certain and depends on a later judicial determination.

The court grants the demurrer and overrules the defendants' demurrer to the complaint. The court grants the defendants' motion to strike the prayer for prejudgment interest without leave to amend. The court orders the defendants to file an answer within 20 days.
