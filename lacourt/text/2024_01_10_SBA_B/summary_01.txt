Summary:

The Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka has issued a tentative ruling denying Michael Forbes' application for a preliminary injunction to restrain the foreclosure sale of the subject property at 3818 Newton Street, Torrance, CA. Forbes alleged that Select Portfolio Services, Inc. and others violated California Civil Code sections 3273 et seq. and Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., and that the foreclosure sale would cause him irreparable harm. The Court found that Forbes failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his case, and that the defendant would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted. The application for a preliminary injunction is denied, and the temporary restraining order is dissolved.
