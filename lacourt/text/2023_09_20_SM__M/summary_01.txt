And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling from a judge regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Counsel Tatiana Ingman on behalf of plaintiffs Bruce Glatman and Encore International LLC. The motion is granted due to an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel has been unable to communicate with the clients, who have failed to respond to attempts at communication. The judge finds that the clients will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal, as the action is still in its early stages and no trial is set. The order is effective upon the filing of proof of service of the order on the client.
