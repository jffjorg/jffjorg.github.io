 Case Number:  20STCV32993    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2023    Dept:  28 Claimant
Yiping Liu (“Claimant”) hit his head on the glass wall in Defendant’s inn. As a
result, Claimant suffered from dizziness, vomiting, concussion,
laceration to forehead, syncopal episode, headache, and fibrosis of skin. 
This
is an expedited petition without a hearing, which is permitted under California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, if Petitioner Yingran Liu (“Petitioner”) uses the
required Judicial Council forms and meets certain conditions. The conditions
are: 
1. Petitioner is represented
by an attorney.
2. The claim is not for
wrongful death.
3. Settlement proceeds will
not be placed in a trust.
4. There are no unresolved
liens.
5. Petitioner’s attorney did
not become involved at the request of Defendant or the insurance carrier.
6. Petitioner’s attorney is not
employed by or associated with a Defendant or insurance carrier in connection
with the petition.
7. If an action is filed, all
Defendants have appeared and are participating in the compromise OR the court
has determined that the settlement is in good faith.
8. The settlement, exclusive of
interests and costs, is $50,000 or less OR if greater than $50,000, the amount
payable is the insurance policy limits AND all proposed contributing parties
would be substantially unable to use assets other than the insurance policy limits
AND the court does not otherwise order. 
SETTLEMENT:
$50,000.00  INJURIES:
dizziness, vomiting, concussion, laceration to forehead, syncopal episode, headache,
and fibrosis of skin.
MEDICAL
EXPENSES: $6,463.83  COSTS:
$7,435.52
ATTORNEY’S
FEES: $12,500.00, which is 25% of the gross settlement.
BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: $23,600.65 
DISCUSSION: 
Section
13a of the petition states that total medical expenses were $12,339.76.  That amount was reduced by $5,771.80 as the
result of negotiated, contractual, and statutory reductions.  This leaves $6,567.97 in medical expenses to
be accounted for.  However, Section 13a
states that only $6,463.83 is to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  As a result, $104.13 in medical expenses have
not been accounted for.  The Court cannot approve a minor’s compromise unless
it reimburses all medical expenses that have not been reduced or waived. 
Therefore,
the Court denies the petition.
