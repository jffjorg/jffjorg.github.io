PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court consolidate this case (22STCV24859)
with case number 23STCV13096. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a).) 
Los
Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(g) provides: “(1) Cases may not be
consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate
two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the
cases were already assigned to that department. (2) Upon consolidation of
cases, the first filed case will be the lead case, unless otherwise ordered by
the court. After consolidation, all future papers to be filed in the
consolidated case must be filed only in the case designated as the lead case.
(3) Before consolidation of a limited case with an unlimited case, the limited
case must be reclassified as an unlimited case and the reclassification fee paid.” 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court consolidate this case (22STCV24859) with case number 23STCV13096,
which is pending in a different department.  The Court cannot consolidate cases that are
pending in different departments unless they have previously been related.  
Plaintiff
has not submitted a notice of related cases in this case (22STCV24859).  (Plaintiff filed a notice of related cases
only in case number 23STCV13096.)  Plaintiff
may submit a notice of related cases in this case (22STCV24859). 
The
Court denies the motion to consolidate. 
CONCLUSION 
The court
DENIES the motion to consolidate without prejudice. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
