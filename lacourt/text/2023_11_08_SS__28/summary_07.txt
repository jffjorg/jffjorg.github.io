And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers and has ruled as follows. The plaintiff, Jaunee Tolson, has requested that the Court consolidate this case (22STCV24859) with case number 23STCV13096, which is pending in a different department. However, the Court cannot consolidate cases that are pending in different departments unless they have previously been related. The plaintiff has not submitted a notice of related cases in this case, and therefore the motion to consolidate is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
