And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Yingran Liu, on behalf of Claimant Yiping Liu, who suffered injuries after hitting his head on a glass wall in a Defendant's inn. The petition is for an expedited petition without a hearing, permitted under California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5. However, the judge has denied the petition because the settlement proceeds do not fully account for the claimant's medical expenses. The judge notes that the petition states that total medical expenses were $12,339.76, but only $6,463.83 was paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds, leaving $104.13 in medical expenses unaccounted for. The judge cannot approve the minor's compromise unless all medical expenses are reimbursed.
