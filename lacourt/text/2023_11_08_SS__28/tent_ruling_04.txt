[1] On August 2, 2023, the Court granted Lung’s ex parte
application to continue the trial from October 6, 2023, to April 8, 2024 and
denied Lung’s request to continue or re-open the discovery deadline without
prejudice. As a result, the deadline for fact discovery was September 6,
2023.  Moving Defendants filed this
motion on October 10, 2023, after the discovery deadline.  Therefore, although Moving Defendants frame
their motion as a request to extend discovery, the Court addresses the motion
as a request to re-open discovery.
