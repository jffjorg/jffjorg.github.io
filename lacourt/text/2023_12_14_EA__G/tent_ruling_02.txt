Services, Inc.’s Application for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiffs Porsche Leasing Ltd. and Porsche Financial
Services, Inc.’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from a vehicle lease agreement. In
January 2023, Porsche Ontario entered into a written motor vehicle lease
agreement with Defendants Qinhai Qin and Lina Jiang in which Porsche Ontario
agreed to lease a 2023 Porsche Cayenne to Qin and Jiang. In that same month,
Porsche Ontario assigned its rights in the agreement to Plaintiff Porsche
Leasing Ltd. (Porsche Leasing) who designated Plaintiff Porsche Financial
Services, Inc. (Porsche Financial Services) as the servicer. In February 2023,
Porsche Leasing and Porsche Financial Services allege Qin and Jiang defaulted
on the agreement by failing to make payments due. They also allege Qin and
Jiang have refused to return the leased vehicle.
On July
11, 2023, Porsche Leasing and Porsche Financial Services filed a complaint
against Qin, Jiang, and Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
possession of personal property, (2) deficiency judgment, (3) foreclosure of
security interest, (4) breach of express written contract, (5) money lent, and
(6) account stated. On July 15, Porsche Leasing and Porsche Financial Services’
process server served Qin and Jiang with substitute service in La Puente.
On October
4, 2023, default was entered against Qin and Jiang. On November 1, Porsche
Leasing and Porsche Financial Services submitted the present application for
default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for December 14, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Porsche
Leasing and Porsche Financial Services seek default judgment against Qin and
Jiang in the total amount of $110,957.23, including $100,796.56 in damages, $6,682.95
in interest, $2,897.96 in attorney fees, and $579.76 in costs. Because the
court finds Porsche Leasing and Porsche Financial Services have submitted
sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their application for default
judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Porsche
Leasing and Porsche Financial Services’ application for default judgment is GRANTED.
