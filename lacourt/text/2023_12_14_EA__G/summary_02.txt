The judge has granted the application for default judgment filed by Porsche Leasing Ltd. and Porsche Financial Services, Inc. against Qinhai Qin and Lina Jiang. The application was filed due to the defendants' alleged breach of a vehicle lease agreement, failure to make payments, and refusal to return the leased vehicle. The plaintiffs are seeking a default judgment in the amount of $110,957.23, including damages, interest, attorney fees, and costs. The judge has found that the plaintiffs have submitted sufficient evidence to support their application, and therefore grants the request for default judgment.
