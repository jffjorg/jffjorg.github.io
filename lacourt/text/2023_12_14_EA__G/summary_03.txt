And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the applications for writs of possession filed by U.S. Bank National Association against Koky, Inc. and Jorge Chavez Avalos. The applications are denied without prejudice due to a failure to provide proof of service for the writs of possession. The court finds that U.S. Bank failed to comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 512.030, subdivision (a), which requires proof of service for the writs of possession. The court will hear from counsel for the moving party on the time needed to effectuate service of the instant writs of possession.
