And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Swift Financial, LLC's petition to confirm the arbitration award against Walden Speed Shop, Inc. and Bobby Walden. The arbitration award was issued in favor of Swift in the amount of $105,884.82. The respondents failed to appear for the arbitration hearing and failed to file a timely response or opposition to the petition. The court finds that Swift has satisfied the requirements for confirming the arbitration award, and that the respondents were properly served with notice of the petition. The court also notes that there is a defect with the proofs of service, but finds that there is sufficient evidence that the respondents were properly served at their place of business.
