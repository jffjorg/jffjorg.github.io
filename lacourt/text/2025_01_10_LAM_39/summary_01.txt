And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a claim for breach of contract and to substitute the Plaintiff's successor-in-interest, Nancy Igdaloff. The Plaintiff seeks to amend the complaint to enforce the settlement agreement into which the parties entered, and to add a claim for breach of contract. The Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the Plaintiff unreasonably delayed in seeking leave to amend. However, the Court finds that the delay was occasioned by the Plaintiff's filing of a motion to enforce the settlement agreement, which was not denied until November 14, 2024, and therefore, the delay alone is not grounds for denial of the motion. The Court also notes that the Defendant fails to articulate any prejudice suffered as a result of the delay. The Court has granted the motion, and the Plaintiff is to file and serve its Second Amended Complaint within 10 days from the issuance of this order. Additionally, the Court has struck the answer of Defendant Fangary Law Group, Inc. to Plaintiff's first amended complaint, as it is a suspended corporation and cannot sue or defend a lawsuit while its taxes remain unpaid.
