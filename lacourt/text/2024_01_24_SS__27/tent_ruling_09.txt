MOVING PARTY: Timothy M. Ghobrial, Esq./Downtown LA Law

RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed  
 
I.           
INTRODUCTION
This
action arises from a motor vehicle accident which occurred on August 23, 2019.
On August 19, 2021, Plaintiffs Justin Freeman (“Freeman”) and Christopher
Gonzalez (“Gonzalez”) filed a complaint against Defendants Jaime Molina
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50, alleging causes of action for: (1) motor
vehicle and (2) general negligence. 
On
March 22, 2023, Defendant filed an answer to the complaint. 
On
December 8, 2023, Timothy M. Ghobrial, Esq./Downtown LA Law Group filed and
served the instant motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Gonzalez. 
On
December 14, 2023, a Trial Setting Conference occurred, and the Court scheduled
a Final Status Conference (“FSC”) for July 22, 2024, and Non-Jury Trial for
August 5, 2024. (12/14/23 Minute Order.)
The
FSC and trial dates were set after the motion to be relieved as counsel was
filed. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The determination whether to
grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion
of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in
the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 Further, the requisite forms must
be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
III.       
DISCUSSION
Timothy M. Ghobrial, Esq. declares that
there has been a breakdown in the attorney client relationship which appears
irreconcilable. (Form MC-052.) 
The proof of service in support of the
motion shows that the motion was served on Plaintiff Gonzalez via mail at 2887
Mosshire Circle, Saint Cloud, Florida 34772-3603 (the “Florida Address”). According
to the MC-052 Form, counsel has been unable to confirm that the Florida Address
is Plaintiff Gonzalez’s current address or locate a more current address for
Plaintiff Gonzalez. Counsel attests that a “skip trace” revealed Plaintiff
Gonzalez’s address to be the Florida Address.   
Counsel has stated a valid basis to be
relieved as counsel. The motion, however, cannot be granted.  The Court has concerns as to whether counsel
sufficiently confirmed that the Florida Address is, in fact, the current
address for Plaintiff Gonzalez. Counsel provides no evidence for the Court to
ascertain whether the Florida Address is Plaintiff Gonzalez’s current address. As
noted, counsel references a “skip trace,” but provides no information about
what that specifically means or evidence of it. 
Plaintiff Gonzalez is entitled to proper notice of the motion.   
Thus, the Court CONTINUES the hearing
on the motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Gonzalez to Tuesday, March
12, 2024 at 1:30 PM in this department, for counsel to provide additional
information as to efforts to locate Plaintiff Gonzalez’s current address 
IV.     CONCLUSION
The motion to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff Gonzalez is CONTINUED to March 12, 2024 at 1:30 PM in this department.
Counsel is instructed to file and serve a revised motion at least 16 court days
before the continued hearing in accordance with CCP § 1005(b). 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
      Dated this 24th day of January 2024
