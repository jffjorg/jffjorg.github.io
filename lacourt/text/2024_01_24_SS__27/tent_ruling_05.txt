On January 25, 2021, Plaintiff Hedyeh
Hamedanizadeh filed this trip and fall action against Defendants. On December 14,
2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel Defendant Glenoaks Business
Park’s responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of
Documents, Sets Two. The motions are unopposed.
Compel Responses
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve
timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on
privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).)  Unlike a motion to
compel further responses, a motion to
compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the propounding
party has no meet and confer obligations. 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 404.)
Here, Plaintiff served the subject
discovery on Defendant on November 6, 2023. Defendant has not responded. (Graves
Decl., ¶¶3-4.) Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED. 
Monetary Sanctions
Where the court grants a motion to
compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even where the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1348(a).)
Plaintiff request sanctions in the
amount of $811.65 per motion. As Defendant has not responded to discovery or
opposed the motion, sanctions are warranted. Sanctions are granted in the
reduced amount of $723.30 total for both motions based on 2 hours at counsel’s
hourly rate of $300, plus $61.65 per filing fee. (Graves Decl., ¶6.)
Moving party to give notice.
