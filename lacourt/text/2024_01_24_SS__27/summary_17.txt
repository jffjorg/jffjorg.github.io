And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion by Plaintiff Victor Manuel Benites Olazabal to compel Fire Cause Analysis (FCA) to comply with a business records subpoena. The subpoena was served on FCA in September 2023, requesting records related to a fire that occurred on October 16, 2021, at a commercial property rented by the Plaintiffs. FCA failed to produce the requested report, despite no objection being filed. The judge has awarded sanctions to the Plaintiff in the amount of $500 to be paid by FCA within 20 days of the order. FCA is also ordered to produce the requested report within 10 days of the order. The judge has not awarded sanctions to the Defendant or Defendant's counsel, as they were not the parties responsible for the non-compliance.
