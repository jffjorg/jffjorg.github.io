And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion to relieve Timothy M. Ghobrial as counsel for Plaintiff Christopher Gonzalez. The motion was filed on December 8, 2023, and is opposed by none. The judge expresses concerns about whether Ghobrial sufficiently confirmed that the current address for Gonzalez is the Florida address listed in the motion. The judge orders the motion to be continued to March 12, 2024, at 1:30 PM, for Ghobrial to provide additional information about his efforts to locate Gonzalez's current address. The judge also instructs Ghobrial to file and serve a revised motion at least 16 court days before the continued hearing.
