TERMINATING SANCTIONS
I.           
INTRODUCTION
This
action arises from a motor vehicle accident which occurred on November 28,
2016. On October 19, 2018, Plaintiff Stephen Harris (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Jack Swank (“Decedent”) and Does 1 through 100,
alleging a single cause of action for negligence.  
On
November 20, 2018, Decedent filed and served an answer to the complaint. 
On
February 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for an order substituting Judith
Lorraine Swank (“Swank”) as a defendant in this action due to the death of Decedent.
On June 22, 2023, the Honorable Michelle C. Kim, sitting in Department 31 of
this Court, denied Plaintiff’s motion to substitute Swank in place of Decedent
without prejudice. 
On
May 25, 2023, Decedent filed a motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff’s
experts. 
On
June 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to substitute Swank in place of Decedent
and, on August 29, 2023, the Honorable Michelle C. Kim, sitting in Department
31 of this Court, granted Plaintiff’s motion. The Court ordered Plaintiff to
serve Swank with an amended complaint within 20 days. (08/29/23 Minute Order.) 
On
August 17, 2023, the Court held a Final Status Conference and, pursuant to oral
stipulation, continued the scheduled August 31, 2023, jury trial to October 9,
2023. 
On
September 19, 2023, after hearing oral argument and taking the matter under
submission on September 18, 2023, the Honorable Michelle C. Kim, sitting in
Department 31 of this Court, granted Decedent’s motion to compel the
depositions of Plaintiff’s experts. (09/19/23 Minute Order.) The Court granted
Decedent’s request to compel the depositions of Steven Dunbar, D.C. and Babak
Samimi, M.D. (Id.) The Court, however, denied Decedent’s request for
sanctions on the grounds that the notice of motion did not specify the type of
sanction sought. (Id.) On September 20, 2023, Swank filed and served a
Notice of Ruling as to the Court’s September 19, 2023 order. 
Plaintiff’s Appeal and Subsequent Procedural History
On
October 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of Appeal which merely
states that Plaintiff was appealing the collateral order doctrine (the “1d
Notice”). The 1d Notice did not include the date the purported order was
entered.
On
October 3, 2023, Swank filed and served a peremptory challenge as to the
Honorable Michelle C. Kim, which was granted. This matter was then transferred
to Department 27 at the Spring Street Courthouse. 
On
October 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Swank
and Does 1 through 10, alleging a single cause of action for negligence. 
Also,
on October 5, 2023, the Court held a Final Status Conference where it indicated
that jury trial scheduled for October 9, 2023, was continued to December 15, 2023
and that “[d]iscovery is to remain closed.” (10/05/23 Minute Order.) 
On
October 25, 2023, Swank filed and served the instant motion for terminating
sanctions (the “Motion”) on the grounds that Plaintiff objected to the
depositions of Plaintiff’s experts in defiance of this Court’s September 19,
2023 order.[1]
The Motion also requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
attorney of record In the sum of $2,614.86, as well as non-appearance
deposition costs. 
On
October 27, 2023, Swank filed and served a Brief re: Plaintiff’s Notice of
Appeal. 
On
October 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of Appeal (the “2d
Notice”), which indicates that Plaintiff is appealing the Court’s September 19,
2023 order. 
On
November 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Brief re: Stay Pending Appeal. 
On
November 20, 2023, Plaintiff purported to file an opposition to the Motion;
however, such filing only includes a caption page and does not contain a
memorandum of points and authorities or a declaration in support thereof. 
On
November 21, 2023, Swank filed a reply brief. 
On
November 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition brief to the Motion.
Plaintiff’s November 28, 2023 filing contains a memorandum of points and
authorities and a declaration in support thereof. Such opposition requests a
stay of this action pending appeal or a denial of the Motion.
On
December 1, 2023, the Second District Court of Appeal issued an order stating
that Plaintiff is in default and the appeal filed on October 2, 2023, was
dismissed. 
On
December 4, 2023, after hearing, the Court sustained Swank’s demurrer to the
FAC with leave to amend and ordered Plaintiff to file a Second Amended
Complaint. (12/04/23 Minute Order, p. 6.) The Court continued the hearing on
the Motion to January 24, 2024 (12/04/23 Minute Order, p. 5.) The Court also
set an OSC re: Should This Matter Be Stayed Due to the Appeal for January 24,
2024. (12/04/23 Minute Order, p. 7.) The Court indicated that “[c]ounsel for
Plaintiff may file supplemental briefing in the event that the matter is deemed
not appealable at least seven court days before the next hearing date.”
(12/04/23 Minute Order, p. 7.) 
Also,
on December 4, 2023, Swank’s counsel filed a declaration re: the status of
Plaintiff’ s appeal. Counsel’s declaration states that on December 1, 2023, his
office received documents from the Court of Appeal showing that the Court of
Appeal effectively dismissed the appeal. (Dewey Decl., ¶ 1; Exhibit A.) Counsel
declares that the Court of Appeal has indicated that the relief Plaintiff is
seeking is a non-appealable order. (Dewey Decl., ¶ 2; Exhibit B.) The Court of
Appeal requested that Plaintiff “demonstrate within 15 days of the date of [the
December 1, 2023] notice why the October 31, 2023 . . . appeal should not be
dismissed as having been taken from a nonappealable order.” (Dewey Decl., ¶ 2;
Exhibit B.) The Court of Appeal indicated that “[f]ailure by the [Plaintiff] to
respond within the time provided may result in the appeal being dismissed as
taken from a nonappealable order.” (Dewey Decl., ¶ 2; Exhibit B.) 
On
December 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”) against Swank and Does 1 through 10, alleging a single cause of action
for negligence. 
On
December 8, 2023, the Court held a Final Status Conference and, pursuant to
oral stipulation, continued jury trial from December 15, 2023, to February 26,
2024. (12/08/23 Minute Order.) The Court indicated that “[a]ll discovery and
related deadlines are continued to the new trial date.” (12/08/23 Minute
Order.) 
On
December 27, 2023, a Notice of Default was issued by the Clerk of this Court
indicating that Plaintiff’s appeal has been placed in default and will be
referred to the Court of Appeal for dismissal if Plaintiff does not correct the
deficiencies outlined therein—related to Reporter’s Transcripts—by January 11,
2024. 
On
January 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the Motion. The Court will
treat this filing as the operative opposition to the Motion. Plaintiff’s
earlier-filed opposition to the Motion merely requested a stay of this action
due to the pending appeal. 
On
January 11, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court continued the hearing
on Swank’s demurrer to the SAC to January 19, 2024, and stated that it would
allow counsel to submit supplemental briefing, which was to be filed no later
than January 16, 2024. 
On
January 17, 2024, Swank filed a reply brief concerning the Motion. The Court
will treat such filing as the operative reply brief. 
II.      LEGAL STANDARD 
          “If a party .
. . fails to obey [an] order compelling a response, the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of . . . a terminating
sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Terminating sanctions may
be imposed against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) 
“The discovery statutes evince an
incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley
Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “Discovery sanctions should
be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required
to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Ibid.)
“[C]ontinuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher
sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.)
Where discovery violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Ibid.) A trial court has broad discretion to impose
discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally a prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004)
124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Where discovery sanctions are requested against a
party, there must be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure
must be willful. (Ibid.)  
          California Code
of Civil Procedure, Section 2023.030 provides that “[t]he court may impose
a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.”  A misuse of the discovery
process “include[s] . . . [d]isobeying a court order to provide
discovery.”  (Doppes v. Bentley
Motors, Inc., supra, 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 991.)  
III.    DISCUSSION 
Judicial Notice
          The Court
GRANTS Swank’s request for judicial notice of Decedent’s motion to compel the
deposition of Plaintiff’s experts and the Court’s September 19, 2023 order.
(Evid Code, §§ 452(d) and 453.) 
Issue No.1: The Status of Plaintiff’s Appeal    
          “Generally,
discovery orders are not appealable.” (Aixtron, Inc. v. Veeco Instruments
Inc. (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 360, 387.) “Instead, the challenge to a
discovery order must await appeal from a final judgment.” (Ibid.) “[C]ourts
have recognized two general exceptions to the one final judgment rule.’ (Ibid.)
“Even though issues remain for further determination, a direct appeal may be
taken from (1) a collateral final judgment or order, or (2) a judgment that is
final as to a party.” (Ibid.) 
However, “[t]he perfecting of an appeal
stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from
or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement
of the judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter
embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 916.) 
The operative opposition to the Motion
does not seek a stay due to the pending appeal. Moreover, based on a review of
the court file, Plaintiff’s October 31, 2023 Notice of Appeal is in default. The
Court of Appeal has indicated, pursuant to the December 4, 2023 declaration of
Brian Dewey, that the appeal is taken from a non-appealable order. 
Given that it appears that Plaintiff
has defaulted on the appeal of the Court’s September 19, 2023 order, the issue
of terminating sanctions is ripe for determination.  And, even if Plaintiff has not defaulted on
the appeal, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed on matters not impacted
by the issues on appeal.  Thus, the Court
will proceed with assessing the merits of the Motion. 
Issue No.2: Appropriateness of Terminating Sanctions
          Swank seeks a
terminating sanction against Plaintiff in the form of dismissing the complaint.
Plaintiff opposes the Motion and asserts that terminating and monetary
sanctions are unwarranted. On reply, Swank asserts that Plaintiff’s argument
has no merit, and, to date, Plaintiff has refused to produce Plaintiff’s
experts. 
          Declaration
of Swank’s Counsel
          Counsel for
Swank, Brian S. Dewey (“Dewey”), declares that Decedent’s motion to compel the
depositions of Plaintiff’s experts was granted on September 18, 2023. (Dewey
Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s expert depositions were set for October 2, 2023,
pursuant to court order. (Dewey Decl., ¶ 5; Exhibits A-B.) Plaintiff objected
to the depositions and counsel declares that the objections were without merit.
(Dewey Decl., ¶¶ 6-7; Exhibits C-D.) Counsel states that Plaintiff’s experts
failed to appear at the depositions on October 2, 2023. (Dewey Decl., ¶ 8;
Exhibits E-F.) Counsel then reset the depositions for October 18, 2023;
however, Plaintiff sent unfounded objections. (Dewey Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Exhibits
I-J.) Plaintiff’s experts failed to appear for the depositions set for October
18, 2023. (Dewey Decl., ¶ 12.)
          Declaration
of Plaintiff’s Counsel
          In opposition
to the Motion, Plaintiff’s counsel, Monique Harris (“Harris”), declares that
Plaintiff appealed from the Court’s September 19, 2023, order and further
argues that counsel for Decedent did not have authority to act on behalf of
Decedent. (Harris Decl., ¶ 2.)  
          Analysis
          The Court
finds that Plaintiff has failed to comply with the Court’s September 19, 2023
order. Plaintiff had notice of this Court’s September 19, 2023 order and alludes
to Plaintiff not complying with said order due to the pending appeal. Plaintiff’s
failure to comply was willful. 
While the court has discretion to
impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should be appropriate to the
dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”  Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.  “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations.”  (Ibid.)
 The Court finds that terminating
sanctions are inappropriate at this time. Plaintiff has failed to comply with
one order of this Court pertaining to discovery according to counsel’s
declaration in support of the Motion. Further, while not a valid basis to
ignore a court order, an appeal was pending at the time of the depositions that
arose from the order that was ignored.  The
Court must take an incremental approach to sanctions. While issue or
evidentiary sanctions might have been appropriate, Swank did not request
issue or evidentiary sanctions in the Motion.
The Court
exercises its discretion and DENIES Swank’s request for terminating sanctions
against Plaintiff.  
The Court, however, ORDERS Plaintiff to
fully comply with the Court’s September 19, 2023, order forthwith and in any
event no later than January 26, 2024, or such other dates as agreed upon by the
parties.  (The discovery cutoff date is
January 26, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a). Swank is “entitled
as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th
day . . . before the date initially set for trial.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd.(a).)) 
Issue No.3: Monetary Sanctions
          Swank
requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel of record
in the amount of $2,614.86. Counsel for Swank declares that his hourly rate is
$175.00 per hour, 2 hours were spent preparing the Motion, and counsel
anticipates spending 2 hours for travel time and appearing at the hearing on
the Motion. (Dewey Decl., ¶ 13.) Swank also seeks court reporter costs in the
amount of $1,854.86 pertaining to the October 2, 2023 deposition of Plaintiff’s
experts, at which such experts failed to appear. (Dewey Decl., ¶ 13; Exhibit
K.) Counsel declares that a $60.00 filing fee was incurred to file the Motion.
(Dewey Decl., ¶ 13.) 
          Exercising
its discretion, the Court GRANTS Swank’s request for monetary sanctions and
AWARDS Swank reasonable monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,500. Monetary
sanctions are to be paid to Swank and Swank’s counsel, Bretoi, Lutz &
Steele, by Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, Monique Harris, Esq., jointly and
severally, within 30 days of the date of notice of this order. 
IV.     CONCLUSION
The Motion is GRANTED IN PART. 
 The
Court exercises its discretion and DENIES Swank’s request for terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff.  
The Court, however, ORDERS Plaintiff to
fully comply with the Court’s September 19, 2023, order forthwith and in any event
no later than January 26, 2024 due to the discovery cutoff date being January
26, 2024.
The Court GRANTS IN PART Swank’s
request for monetary sanctions and AWARDS Swank reasonable monetary sanctions
in the amount of $2,500. Monetary sanctions are to be paid to Swank and Swank’s
counsel, Bretoi, Lutz & Steele, by Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel,
Monique Harris, Esq., jointly and severally, within 30 days of the date of notice
of this order. 
DEMURRER
          The Court adopts its January 18, 2024,
tentative ruling.  The issue of whether
Plaintiff complied with the Probate Code was previously decided by the Court
and is the law of the case.  That
decision is based on the action of Plaintiff and does not implicate Defendant’s
due process rights, particularly given that Defendant is appearing in a
representative capacity for Decedent, who was given notice of and argued at the
hearing in which the Court decided that issue. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.

 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
     Dated this 24th day of January 2024
