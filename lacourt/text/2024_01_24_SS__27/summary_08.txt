Summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants Defendant Caroline Ngo's Motion for Summary Judgment in part and denies it in part. The Motion is granted as to the first cause of action for negligence, as Ngo is not liable for Finley's negligence. However, the Motion is denied as to the second cause of action for premises liability, as there are triable issues of material fact as to whether Ngo maintained the premises in a safe manner. The Court finds that Ngo had a duty to Plaintiff as a social guest on the premises, but that duty cannot be proven by Plaintiff.
