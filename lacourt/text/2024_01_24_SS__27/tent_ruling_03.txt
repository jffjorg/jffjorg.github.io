I.       INTRODUCTION
          On
December 22, 2023, Defendant Forever 21, Inc.’s counsel, Kelly, Trotter &
Franzen filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.
II.      LEGAL
STANDARDS
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362
(Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to
be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is
brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion
and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).
The court has discretion to allow an
attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there
is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of
justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
III.     DISCUSSION
Counsel seeks to be relieved on grounds
that the entity has been dissolved, and all its assets were distributed in
bankruptcy. Further, the client has breached a material term of an agreement
with, or obligation, to counsel relating to the representation (Rule of
Professional Conduct 1.16(b)(5)). 
Here, there is no apparent prejudice as
there is no trial date and the client appears to be dissolved. However, the
Court would like to here from Counsel regarding the orderly process of justice
upon being allowed to withdraw as counsel.
        Dated this 24th day of January 2024
