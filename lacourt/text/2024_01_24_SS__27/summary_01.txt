And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's request for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to comply with the court's September 19, 2023 order, which required the deposition of the plaintiff's experts. The plaintiff's experts failed to appear for deposition, and the defendant requested terminating and monetary sanctions. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply was willful and exercises its discretion to deny the request for terminating sanctions. However, the court orders the plaintiff to fully comply with the court's September 19, 2023 order forthwith and in any event no later than January 26, 2024.

The court grants in part the defendant's request for monetary sanctions and awards the defendant reasonable monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,500. The monetary sanctions are to be paid to the defendant and the defendant's counsel by the plaintiff and the plaintiff's counsel jointly and severally within 30 days of the date of notice of this order.
