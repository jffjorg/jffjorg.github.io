And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to vacate the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff, Hermelinda Nunez, filed a complaint against the defendants, John Edward Powell and Nicolai Thomas Dressback, alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and general negligence. The action was dismissed without prejudice on April 19, 2023, due to the plaintiff's counsel's failure to properly calendar the hearings.

The plaintiff's counsel, David Issapour, filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, claiming that the dismissal was due to his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable neglect. The judge finds that the counsel's mistake was excusable and that the motion is timely. The judge grants the motion and vacates the dismissal of the action.

The judge also notes that the defendants have not yet been served with the summons and complaint, so they will not be prejudiced by the granting of the motion. The judge does not impose payment of reasonable compensatory fees and costs to opposing parties. The case will be set for a hearing on January 24, 2024, unless all parties indicate that they will not appear.
