CASE NUMBER: 22STCV28878
 
MOTION TO COMPEL SUBPOENA COMPLIANCE
 
[UNOPPOSED[1]]
 
TENTATIVE
            Plaintiff Victor Manuel Benites
Olazabal’s Motion to Compel Fire Cause Analysis (“FCA”) to Comply with Business
Records Subpoena Relating to Defendant Hashem 26, LLC is GRANTED.
The Court awards sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $500 against FCA. FCA
is ordered to produce the requested report within 10 days of this order.
 

Background
            This
matter stems from the damage sustained to the property of Victor Manuel Benites
Olazabal (“Victor”) and Joselyn Olazabal (“Joselyn”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) after the commercial property Plaintiffs rented burned down. On
October 16, 2021, an electrical fire ignited from an electrical panel at the
back wall of 5821 ½ W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90019. (Complaint, ¶ GN-1.)
The fire completely destroyed inventory and equipment for Joselyn’s business
located at 5821 ½ W. Pico Blvd. and Victor’s business located next door at 5821
W. Pico Blvd.
 
            Plaintiffs
filed suit against the landlord Hashem 26, LLC (“Defendant”) for general
negligence, premises liability, and negligence per se. The motion before the
Court now is Plaintiff Victor Manuel Benites Olazabal’s Motion to Compel Fire
Cause Analysis to Comply with Business Records Subpoena Relating to Defendant
Hashem 26, LLC (“Motion”). Additionally, Victor requests $3,010.00 in sanctions
against Fire Cause Analysis (“FCA”), Defendant, and Defendant’s counsel. 
            
Discussion
 
Legal Standard
            Victor files this Motion under CCP §
1987.1 which permits the Court to quash a subpoena, modify a subpoena, or
direct compliance with a subpoena upon the terms the Court declares.
Additionally, under CCP § 1987.2 “in making an order pursuant to motion made
under subdivision (c) of Section 1987 or under Section 1987.1, the court may in
its discretion award the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in making
or opposing the motion…”
 
Analysis
            Prior
to this action being commenced by Plaintiffs, non-party FCA investigated how
the fire ensued. (Declaration of Sylvia V. Karlan, hereinafter, “Karlan Dec.”,
¶ 3.) FCA’s site inspection took place on January 13, 2022, and Plaintiffs have
been seeking the report from FCA since then. (Id. at ¶ 4.) On September
11, 2023, Plaintiffs’ attorneys served a Deposition Subpoena for Production of
Business Records (“Subpoena”) on FCA requesting “any and all records related to
the fire that occurred on October 16, 2021” for the properties be produced by
October 6, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 6.)
 
            FCA
failed to produce the records by the stated deadline. (Id. at ¶ 9.) No
motion to quash nor objection was filed by either FCA or Defendant. (Id. at
¶¶ 10-11.) On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to meet and
confer with non-party FCA where FCA confirmed it had the report but stated they
could not release it without Defendant’s permission, as FCA had been instructed
by Defendant not to do so. (Id. at ¶ 13.) Plaintiff’s counsel then
attempted to confer with Defense counsel on the same day, however, Defense
counsel did not reply. (Id. at ¶¶ 14-15.) 
 
            It
is unclear why compliance with the subpoena did not occur. The subpoena was
drafted in accordance with the requirements specified in CCP §§ 2020.410 and
2020.430, and FCA failed to object to it. Additionally, Defendant as the
consumer was made aware of service of the subpoena. (Motion, Exh. C.) Finally,
Plaintiff states that Defense counsel directed FCA not to comply; however,
Defendant nor its counsel provide explanation as to why, even after Plaintiff’s
counsel attempted to meet and confer. (Motion, Exh. D.) Nor have they provided
explanation here, as the Motion is unopposed. Accordingly, the Motion is granted
and sanctions are warranted.    
 
            Sanctions[2]

 
            Plaintiff seeks sacntions against FCA,
Defendant and Defendant’s counsel. 
However, Defendant and Defendant’s counsel was not the party that failed
to comply with the subpoena and the contention that they are the ones
responsible for the non-compliance is hearsay. 
Plaintiff has requested $500 in sanctions from FCA, which the Court hereby
grants.
 
Conclusion
            Plaintiff Victor Manuel Benites
Olazabal’s Motion to Compel Fire Cause Analysis to Comply with Business Records
Subpoena Relating to Defendant Hashem 26, LLC is GRANTED. The
Court awards sanctions to Plaintiff of $500 to be paid by FCA within 20 days of
this order. FCA is ordered to produce the requested report within 10 days of
this order.
 
Moving party is to give Notice
