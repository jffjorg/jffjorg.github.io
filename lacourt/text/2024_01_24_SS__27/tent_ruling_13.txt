[1] The Court notes that Defendantâ€™s
answer to the complaint is not signed by counsel. 


[2] The Court finds that there are
inconsistences based on the Proof of Service of Summons and Declaration of Non-Service
as to whether Defendant was served. Both documents were signed under the
penalty of perjury by registered process server, Kevin Hardin. The Court
assumes that Defendant may have waived any issues with service or that
Defendant was, in fact, personally served given that Defendant filed an answer
and did not file a motion to quash service of summons. Such issues, however, are
not relevant to the Motions.
