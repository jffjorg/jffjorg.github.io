I.           
INTRODUCTION
This
action arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on June 11, 2020. On
June 10, 2022, Plaintiff Rosa Coles Miller (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against Defendants Antonio Hernandez (“Hernandez”) and Does 1 to 25, alleging
causes of action for Motor Vehicle and General Negligence. 
On
June 10, 2022, the Court set an OSC re: Dismissal for June 7, 2024.
On
November 13, 2023, LA Century Law and their attorneys of record (“LAC”) filed a
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff (the “Motion”).
On
November 27, 2023, the Court vacated the OSC re: Dismissal scheduled for June
7, 2024. On November 27, 2023, the Court scheduled an OSC re: Dismissal
(Settlement) for February 27, 2024.   
On
December 1, 2023, LAC filed and served a Proof of Service as to the Motion. The
Proof of Service shows that Plaintiff and Defendant were served with the Motion
on December 1, 2023. 
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The determination whether to
grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion
of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in
the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 Further, the requisite forms must
be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       
DISCUSSION
Laila Hawatmeh declares that Plaintiff “has
been unresponsive to LA Century Law.” (Form MC-052.) Multiple attempts have
been made to contact Plaintiff, which have failed, and the representation of
Plaintiff has become unreasonably difficult to carry out. (Id.) There
has been a total and irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
(Id.) 
LAC has stated a valid basis to be
relieved as counsel. The Motion, however, cannot be granted.  While the MC-052 Form indicates that
Plaintiff was personally served with the Motion papers, the Proof of Service
contradicts such fact. Plaintiff was served with the Motion via e-mail on
December 1, 2023.[1]
(12/01/23 Proof of Service.) Moreover, based on the Proof of Service, Plaintiff
was not served with the MC-053 Form (Proposed Order). 
Additionally, Plaintiff and Defendant were
not served with the Motion at least 16 court days prior to the hearing. “[A]ll
moving and supporting papers shall be served . . . at least 16 court days
before the hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) Here, the parties
were served with the Motion only 11 court days before the hearing. LAC
therefore has not complied with Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b). 
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
The Motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

 
LAC is ordered to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
      Dated this 18th day of December 2023
