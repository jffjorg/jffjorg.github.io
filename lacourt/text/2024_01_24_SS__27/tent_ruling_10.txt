INTRODUCTION
This
is an action arising from a motor vehicle accident which occurred on October
22, 2019. On October 20, 2021, Plaintiff Hermelinda Nunez (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants John Edward Powell and Nicolai Thomas Dressback
(collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 100, alleging causes of action for:
(1) motor vehicle and (2) general negligence. 
On
November 4, 2021, a PI General Order was mailed to Plaintiff’s counsel which
states that “Plaintiff(s) shall serve the summons and complaint in this action
upon defendant(s) as soon as possible but no later than three years from the
date when the complaint is filed.” (See Standing Order re: Personal
Injury Procedures, Central District at ¶ 3.) The PI General Order set forth the
April 5, 2023 Final Status Conference (“FSC”) and April 19, 2023 trial date in
this action.  
On
April 5, 2023, the FSC occurred, which was not called for hearing, and the
Court noted that no proof of service had been filed. (04/05/23 Minute Order.) There
were no appearances for either side at the FSC and there was no “communication
with the Court as to why there [were] no appearances by [c]ounsel or parties.”
(04/05/23 Minute Order.) The Court’s April 5, 2023 minute order stated that
“[i]f there is no appearance at the trial the Court may dismiss the case
pursuant to CCP Section 581(b)(3).” (04/05/23 Minute Order.) The Court vacated
the FSC. (04/05/23 Minute Order.) 
On
April 19, 2023, this action was called for non-jury trial and there were “no
appearances by, or for any party, nor any communication with the Court as to
why there [were] no appearances.” (04/19/23 Minute Order.) The Court ordered
the complaint dismissed without prejudice pursuant to CCP Section 581(b)(3).
(04/19/23 Minute Order.) Also, on April 19, 2023, the Court entered an order of
dismissal which dismissed this action without prejudice. 
On
September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served the instant unopposed motion to
vacate this Court’s April 19, 2023 order dismissing this action (the “Motion”).
The Motion is made on the grounds that dismissal of this action occurred due to
attorney mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable neglect. 
The
proof of service as to the Motion indicates that the Motion was served on
Defendants John Edward Powell and Nikolai Thomas Dressback by first-class mail
on September 14, 2023. Plaintiff has yet to file a proof of service as to
service of the summons and complaint on Defendants.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD 
“The court may, upon any terms as may
be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b).) “Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of
the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding was taken.” (Ibid.) “It is well settled that appellate courts
have always been and are favorably disposed toward such action upon the part of
the trial courts as will permit, rather than prevent, the adjudication of legal
controversies upon their merits.” (Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1948) 31
Cal.2d 523, 525.)  
Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b) also contains
a mandatory relief provision. (SJP Limited Partnership v. City of Los
Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 511, 516.) 
“[T]he court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more
than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied
by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk
against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default
judgment; or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or
her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in
fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.)
“If the prerequisites of the mandatory relief provision of section 473,
subdivision (b) exist, the trial court does not have discretion to refuse
relief.” (Ibid.) 
“Whenever relief is granted based on an
attorney’s affidavit of fault, the court shall direct the attorney to pay
reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties, in
addition to whatever additional fees are authorized by subdivision (c), of Code
Civ. Proc. § 473.” (J.A.T. Entertainment, Inc. v. Reed (1998) 62
Cal.App.4th 1485, 1491.) Whenever the court grants relief from a dismissal
based on any grounds in Code Civ. Proc. § 473, the Court may: (1) impose a
penalty of no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon an offending
attorney or party; (2) direct that an offending party pay an amount no greater
than one thousand dollars ($1,000) to the State Bar Client Security Fund; or
(3) grant other relief as is appropriate. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (c)(1)(A)-(C).)   
          
III.    DISCUSSION 
David Issapour (“Issapour”), Counsel for
Plaintiff, declares that he did not appear at the FSC or trial date due to
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable neglect. (Issapour Decl., ¶
8.) Counsel states that he did not appear at the hearings due to a calendaring
mistake. (Issapour Decl., ¶ 8.) Counsel attests that Plaintiff should not be
penalized for his mistake. (Issapour Decl., ¶ 9.) Counsel requests that the
Motion be granted so that Plaintiff has his day in Court and is not prejudiced
by his mistake. (Issapour Decl., ¶ 20.) 
The Court finds that counsel has shown
that the dismissal of this action was due to counsel’s mistake and inadvertence
in failing to properly calendar this matter. Calendaring errors are deemed excusable.
(Flores v. Board of Supervisors (1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 480, 483, citations
omitted.) The Court finds that the Motion is also timely. Plaintiff has shown
grounds for discretionary and mandatory relief under Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b). 
Defendants have not yet been served
with the summons and complaint.[1]
Thus, Defendants will not be prejudiced by the granting of the Motion. The
Motion does not request any substantive relief against Defendants. 
As to the issue of payment of
reasonable compensatory fees and costs to opposing parties, the Court need not
impose payment of such fees and costs due to Plaintiff showing a basis for
discretionary relief. (J.A.T. Entertainment, Inc. v. Reed, supra,
62 Cal.App.4th 1485, 1491.)   
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED.  
IV.     CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to
vacate this Court’s April 19, 2023 order of dismissal.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
