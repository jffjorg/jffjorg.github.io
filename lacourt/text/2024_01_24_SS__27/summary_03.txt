And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered a motion filed by Forever 21, Inc.'s counsel, Kelly, Trotter & Franzen, to be relieved from representing the defendant. The motion is based on the fact that the defendant is dissolved and its assets were distributed in bankruptcy, and that the client has breached a material term of an agreement with counsel. The judge has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but must ensure that doing so does not prejudice the client or disrupt the orderly process of justice. The judge is inclined to grant the motion, but wants to hear from counsel regarding the potential impact of allowing them to withdraw.
