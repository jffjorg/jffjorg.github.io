And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied LA Century Law's motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was unopposed, but LA Century Law failed to comply with the rules of court by not serving the motion on the client and other parties with sufficient time before the hearing. Additionally, the motion did not provide a proposed order that included all hearing dates, including the date of trial. The judge noted that LA Century Law has stated a valid basis for withdrawal, citing the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, but the failure to comply with the rules of court outweighs this factor. The judge ordered LA Century Law to give notice of the denial and instructed the parties to submit on the tentative ruling if they intend to do so. Unless all parties submit on the tentative, the judge may adopt it as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
