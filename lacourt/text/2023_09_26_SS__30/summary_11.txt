And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel responses to the request for production of documents. The court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff, Robert Lopez, to provide responses to the request without objections within 20 days of notice of this order. The court declines to issue sanctions because the motion was unopposed. The plaintiff is reminded that a party must respond to a request for production within 30 days after service, and failure to respond waives objections. The court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, Sections 2031.260 and 2031.300.
