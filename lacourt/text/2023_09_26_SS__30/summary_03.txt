Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the action. The plaintiff brought the action against the defendant, Hollywood Historic Trust, on January 10, 2020. However, the service of the summons and complaint was not effectuated until July 28, 2023, more than three years later. The defendant argued that the action was subject to mandatory dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure § 583.250. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's representations to the plaintiff's counsel regarding service and legal representation constituted a general appearance and estopped the defendant from seeking dismissal. The judge found that the defendant's representations did not constitute a general appearance, as they did not recognize the authority of the court to proceed. The judge also found that the defendant was not estopped from seeking dismissal, as there was no evidence of any representations or conduct that would have lulled the plaintiff into a false sense of security.
