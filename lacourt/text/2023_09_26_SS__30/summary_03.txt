Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the action. The plaintiff brought the action against the defendant, Hollywood Historic Trust, on January 10, 2020. However, the service of the summons and complaint was not effectuated until July 28, 2023, more than three years later. The defendant argued that the action was subject to mandatory dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure § 583.250. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's representations to the plaintiff's counsel regarding service and legal representation constituted a general appearance and estopped the defendant from seeking dismissal. The judge found that the defendant's representations did not constitute a general appearance, as they did not recognize the authority of the court to proceed. The judge also found that the defendant was not estopped from seeking dismissal, as there was no evidence of any representations or conduct that would have lulled the plaintiff into a false sense of security.

## English Summary:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge is granting the Defendant's motion to dismiss the case against Hollywood Historic Trust. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff did not properly serve the Defendant within the required three-year timeframe, as mandated by Code of Civil Procedure § 583.250.

The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant made a general appearance in the case, thus triggering exceptions to the statute of limitations. This argument was based on communications between Plaintiff's counsel and a board member of the Defendant, Jeffrey C. Briggs, Esq. However, the Judge ruled that these communications were insufficient to constitute a general appearance.

Additionally, the Plaintiff claimed that equitable estoppel should prevent the dismissal because the Defendant's conduct led to a reasonable belief that service had been effectuated. The Judge rejected this argument, finding that there was no evidence of the Defendant intentionally misleading the Plaintiff or preventing timely service. 


The Judge concluded that the dismissal is proper because the Plaintiff failed to meet the statutory requirements for service and did not establish sufficient grounds to prevent dismissal based on general appearance or equitable estoppel.

## English Summary

The judge ruled that the lawsuit against the Hollywood Historic Trust must be dismissed because the Plaintiff did not serve the Trust with the lawsuit in a timely manner. 

The Plaintiff argued that the Trust made a "general appearance" in the case by communicating with their attorney and promising to file an answer. However, the judge found that these communications were not sufficient to constitute a general appearance. 

The Plaintiff also argued that the Trust's conduct prevented them from filing the lawsuit on time, but the judge disagreed. The judge found that the Trust's communications made it clear they had not been served, and the Plaintiff should have taken steps to clarify the situation.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to dismiss the action. The Defendant, Hollywood Historic Trust, argued that the complaint was filed on January 10, 2020, but service of the summons and complaint was not effectuated until July 28, 2023, more than three years later. The Defendant claimed that this exceeded the three-year statute of limitations and therefore the action was subject to mandatory dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure § 583.250.

The Plaintiff, Anna Nguyen, opposed the motion, arguing that the Defendant made a general appearance in the action and that the Defendant was estopped from seeking dismissal due to representations made by the Defendant's counsel. The Court, however, found that the Plaintiff failed to show that the Defendant made a general appearance and that the Defendant's conduct did not constitute equitable estoppel.

The Court noted that the Defendant's counsel sent several emails to the Plaintiff's counsel asking if the Defendant had been served, which served as notice to the Plaintiff that the Defendant had not been served. The Court also found that there was a gap in communications with the Defendant's counsel from March 7, 2022, to January 3, 2023, during which time the Plaintiff took no action to follow up on the alleged representation made by the Defendant's counsel.

Based on these findings, the Court granted the Defendant's motion to dismiss the action.
