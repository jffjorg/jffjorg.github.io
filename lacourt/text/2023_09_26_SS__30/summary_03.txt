Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the action. The plaintiff brought the action against the defendant, Hollywood Historic Trust, on January 10, 2020. However, the service of the summons and complaint was not effectuated until July 28, 2023, more than three years later. The defendant argued that the action was subject to mandatory dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure § 583.250. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's representations to the plaintiff's counsel regarding service and legal representation constituted a general appearance and estopped the defendant from seeking dismissal. The judge found that the defendant's representations did not constitute a general appearance, as they did not recognize the authority of the court to proceed. The judge also found that the defendant was not estopped from seeking dismissal, as there was no evidence of any representations or conduct that would have lulled the plaintiff into a false sense of security.

## English Summary:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge is granting the Defendant's motion to dismiss the case against Hollywood Historic Trust. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff did not properly serve the Defendant within the required three-year timeframe, as mandated by Code of Civil Procedure § 583.250.

The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant made a general appearance in the case, thus triggering exceptions to the statute of limitations. This argument was based on communications between Plaintiff's counsel and a board member of the Defendant, Jeffrey C. Briggs, Esq. However, the Judge ruled that these communications were insufficient to constitute a general appearance.

Additionally, the Plaintiff claimed that equitable estoppel should prevent the dismissal because the Defendant's conduct led to a reasonable belief that service had been effectuated. The Judge rejected this argument, finding that there was no evidence of the Defendant intentionally misleading the Plaintiff or preventing timely service. 


The Judge concluded that the dismissal is proper because the Plaintiff failed to meet the statutory requirements for service and did not establish sufficient grounds to prevent dismissal based on general appearance or equitable estoppel.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to dismiss the action. The defendant argues that the complaint was filed on January 10, 2020, but the service of the summons and complaint was not effectuated until July 28, 2023, which is more than three years after the action was commenced. The plaintiff argues that the defendant made a general appearance and that the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevents the dismissal.

The judge finds that the plaintiff fails to show that the defendant made a general appearance. The judge notes that mere communications between the plaintiff's counsel and Jeffrey C. Briggs, Esq. do not constitute a general appearance. The judge also finds that the defendant's conduct is not sufficient to invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel.

The judge concludes that the dismissal is proper and that the defendant's actions do not constitute a general appearance or estoppel. Therefore, the motion to dismiss is granted.
