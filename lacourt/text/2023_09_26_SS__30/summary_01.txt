And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Chalian's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. The Judge has reviewed the evidence presented and finds that the Defendant has met his burden of proof in showing that the Plaintiff has not established a triable issue.

The Judge cites various laws and case citations, including Flowers v. Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Armato v. Baden, and Miranda v. Bomel Const. Co., Inc., to support his ruling. The Judge notes that the Defendant's expert witnesses, including Dr. Edmond Hewlett and Dr. Barry Vilkin, have provided testimony that the treatment provided to the Plaintiff met the standard of care and did not cause harm.

The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has failed to provide expert testimony to support his claims of breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and intentional misrepresentation. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff has not established a triable issue and therefore the Defendant is entitled to summary judgment.

The Judge's ruling is based on the following key points:

* The Defendant's expert witnesses have provided testimony that the treatment provided to the Plaintiff met the standard of care and did not cause harm.
* The Plaintiff has failed to provide expert testimony to support his claims.
* The Defendant has met his burden of proof in showing that the Plaintiff has not established a triable issue.
* The Plaintiff's claims of breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and intentional misrepresentation are unsupported by evidence and therefore cannot be sustained.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Chalian. The motion was granted based on the evidence presented by the Defendant, which showed that the dental care provided to the Plaintiff by Defendant Chalian met the standard of care and did not cause any injury to the Plaintiff. The judge found that the Plaintiff failed to provide expert testimony to rebut the Defendant's evidence, and therefore, the Plaintiff did not meet his burden of proof.

The judge also found that the Plaintiff's allegations of breach of fiduciary duty and fraud were insufficient to maintain a cause of action, as they were based on mere allegations of professional negligence and did not implicate a duty of confidentiality or loyalty to the client.

The judge's ruling is based on the following legal principles: general negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud and intentional misrepresentation. The judge cited several cases in support of his ruling, including Flowers v. Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Armato v. Baden, Miranda v. Bomel Const. Co., Inc., Salasguevara v. Wyeth Laboratories, Inc., Lerner v. Superior Court, Jambazian v. Borden, Munro v. Regents of University of California, and Willard v. Peninsula Hospital District.
