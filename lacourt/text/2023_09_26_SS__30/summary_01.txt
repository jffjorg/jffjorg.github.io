And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Chalian's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. The Judge has reviewed the evidence presented and finds that the Defendant has met his burden of proof in showing that the Plaintiff has not established a triable issue.

The Judge cites various laws and case citations, including Flowers v. Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Armato v. Baden, and Miranda v. Bomel Const. Co., Inc., to support his ruling. The Judge notes that the Defendant's expert witnesses, including Dr. Edmond Hewlett and Dr. Barry Vilkin, have provided testimony that the treatment provided to the Plaintiff met the standard of care and did not cause harm.

The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has failed to provide expert testimony to support his claims of breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and intentional misrepresentation. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff has not established a triable issue and therefore the Defendant is entitled to summary judgment.

The Judge's ruling is based on the following key points:

* The Defendant's expert witnesses have provided testimony that the treatment provided to the Plaintiff met the standard of care and did not cause harm.
* The Plaintiff has failed to provide expert testimony to support his claims.
* The Defendant has met his burden of proof in showing that the Plaintiff has not established a triable issue.
* The Plaintiff's claims of breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and intentional misrepresentation are unsupported by evidence and therefore cannot be sustained.
