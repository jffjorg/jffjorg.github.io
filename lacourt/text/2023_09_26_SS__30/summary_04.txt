Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's case due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders. The defendant had ordered the plaintiff to attend a defense medical examination, but the plaintiff failed to schedule the examination and did not respond to the defendant's attempts to reschedule it. The judge also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, as the court had already awarded terminating sanctions. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion and has not explained why terminating sanctions are not appropriate. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has effectively abandoned the case.
