## English Text Summary

In this case, Judge decided to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint against Defendant without prejudice.  

The Plaintiff initially requested a default judgment because the Defendant failed to respond to the complaint. However, the Judge identified several issues with the Plaintiff's request, including:

* **Demand for future medical expenses:** This was not properly supported.
* **Demand for attorney fees:** This was not properly supported.
* **DOE Defendants:** These defendants needed to be dismissed.
* **Evidence for general damages:** This was lacking.

The Judge granted the Plaintiff 60 days to correct these issues. However, the Plaintiff failed to do so within the given timeframe. Consequently, the court dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiff can refile the complaint after addressing the identified issues.

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling for the case 21STCV21619, with a hearing date of September 26, 2023, in Department 30. The Judge has reviewed the default package submitted on June 12, 2023, and has decided to dismiss the complaint without prejudice. On June 23, 2023, the Court granted a 60-day continuance to allow the Plaintiff to correct certain discrepancies, including the dismissal of DOE Defendants, exclusion of demand for future medical expenses and attorney fees, provision of evidence to support the demand for general damages, and exclusion of demand for attorney fees. However, on August 22, 2023, the Court denied the request for default judgment as Plaintiff had not filed any paperwork correcting the above-identified discrepancies.

As of September 20, 2023, Plaintiff Salvador R. Leguizamo and Francisca Leguizamo have not complied with the Court's order. A new request for entry of default judgment has not been filed excluding the demand for future medical expenses and demand for attorney fees. No evidence has been filed to support the demand for general damages. No request for dismissal has been filed dismissing the DOE Defendants. Forty-five days have passed since default was entered.

Therefore, the complaint is DISMISSED without prejudice.
