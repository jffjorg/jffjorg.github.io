And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the default package submitted by the plaintiff on June 12, 2023. The complaint is dismissed without prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order. The plaintiff was given 60 days to correct certain discrepancies, including dismissing certain defendants, excluding demands for future medical expenses and attorney fees, and providing evidence to support the demand for general damages. However, the plaintiff failed to do so, and as a result, the judge has denied the request for default judgment. The plaintiff's complaint is dismissed without prejudice, meaning it can be re-filed in the future.
