 Case Number:  20STCV32790    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  30 SHANE ANTLEY, et
al. vs ROBERT OLIE, et al.

Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant for
Robert Olie 
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant for
Florence Olie

Ruling:  The motions to be relieved s counsel
are denied without prejudice. The case is transferred to Dept. One as non-PI.
Clerk to give notice.

Discussion:  The request is made too soon to
the trial date. With less than a month to trial, the Client will be unduly
prejudiced. Further, this is a premises liability and breach of habitability
case, and thus considered non-PI. Should Dept. One accept the transfer, then
the upcoming dates will be vacated and Counsel may re-file its motion in the
proper court.
