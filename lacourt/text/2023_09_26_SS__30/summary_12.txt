The defendant's motion to compel further responses is denied as moot. The plaintiff never filed verified responses, which is tantamount to not filing responses at all. The defendant's motion is actually an initial motion to compel, not a motion to compel further responses. The plaintiff's untimely responses have waived their objections. The court declines to award sanctions against either party. The defendant must start the procedural requirements for a motion to compel further responses and abide by the 8th Amended Standing Order, which requires a meet and confer regarding the date of the IDC. IDCs in Dept. 30 must be in person.

## English Summary

The Judge denied the Defendant's motion to compel further responses from the Plaintiff as moot. The motion was initially filed because the Plaintiff had failed to provide verified responses to document requests. However, the Plaintiff ultimately served verified responses after the motion was filed, rendering the issue moot. 

The Judge noted that the Plaintiff's initial failure to file responses, and the fact that they were untimely, meant that the Plaintiff had waived any objections. 

Even though the Defendant still wanted the motion heard, the Judge explained that they needed to start the proper procedure for a motion to compel further responses, including complying with the court's standing order which requires a meet and confer regarding the date of an in-person Initial Disclosure Conference (IDC).


The Judge declined to award sanctions against either party.

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses in a case between ABDUL AZZIZ WILLAN and DIANA ESCOLERO.

The defendant is required to start the process for a motion to compel further responses, which includes a meet and confer with the other party.
