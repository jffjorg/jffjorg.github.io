And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion to compel further responses is denied as moot. The plaintiff never filed verified responses, which is tantamount to not filing responses at all. The defendant's motion is actually an initial motion to compel, not a motion to compel further responses. The plaintiff's untimely responses have waived their objections. The court declines to award sanctions against either party. The defendant must start the procedural requirements for a motion to compel further responses and abide by the 8th Amended Standing Order, which requires a meet and confer regarding the date of the IDC. IDCs in Dept. 30 must be in person.
