Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling is for the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Summons and First Amended Complaint to be granted. The Plaintiffs' proposed First Amended Complaint and Summons are deemed filed forthwith. The Plaintiffs are to file and serve the First Amended Summons and Complaint forthwith on all Defendants. The ruling is based on the fact that the Plaintiffs meet the requirements under California Rule of Court, rule 3.1324 and have provided a declaration that explains the effect of the amendment, why it is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amendment were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The amendment is intended to correct a misspelling in the middle name of Plaintiff Park, which appeared differently on the summons and complaint. The original summons and complaint were prepared by another law office, and the Plaintiffs offer the reason for the amendment as the clerk of the Court would not allow entry of Default due to the misspelling. The Court uses its discretion to grant Plaintiffs’ amended summons and complaint.
