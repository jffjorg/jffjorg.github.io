And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Palisades Organic Landcare, Inc. dba Dirty Girl Organic Landcare, and Hilary Susan Rose. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiff, Christopher Michael Dowding's, claims for damages resulting from an injury he sustained while working for the defendants. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the workers' compensation exclusivity rule, which provides that an employee can only seek compensation for workplace injuries through the workers' compensation system and not through a civil lawsuit.

The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to advance any substantive arguments or evidence in opposition to the motion, and therefore failed to meet his burden to show that there are triable issues of material fact. The judge struck the plaintiff's supplemental declaration and further briefing, which were filed in opposition to the motion, as they were not authorized by the court.

The judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented, which shows that the plaintiff was hired by the defendants to work on a job in Malibu, and that he was injured while performing his duties. The evidence also shows that the plaintiff presented a claim to recover workers' compensation benefits and received monetary benefits as a result. The judge found that the plaintiff's injury was within the scope of his employment and that there is no evidence to indicate that an exception to the workers' compensation exclusivity rule applies.

**English Summary:**

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this case.

The plaintiff, Christopher Michael Dowding, was injured while working for the defendants, Hilary Susan Rose and Palisades Organic Landcare, Inc. dba Dirty Girl Organic Landcare.  He filed a workers' compensation claim and received benefits. The defendants argued that because the plaintiff's injury occurred in the course of his employment, his sole remedy is through workers' compensation, and he cannot sue his employer for damages. 

The judge agreed with the defendants, finding that the workers' compensation exclusivity rule bars the plaintiff's claims against them. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not present any evidence to dispute the defendants' arguments and therefore failed to meet his burden of proof.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff's claims against them are barred by the workers' compensation exclusivity rule. The plaintiff was injured while working for the defendants and received benefits from their workers' compensation policy. The judge found that the plaintiff was an employee of the defendants at the time of the incident and was injured within the course and scope of his employment. The judge also struck the plaintiff's supplemental declaration and further briefing, which were filed out of time and without authorization. The plaintiff failed to present any substantive arguments or evidence in opposition to the motion, and thus failed to meet his burden to show that there are triable issues of material fact. As a result, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiff's claims.
