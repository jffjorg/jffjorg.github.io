And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Palisades Organic Landcare, Inc. dba Dirty Girl Organic Landcare, and Hilary Susan Rose. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiff, Christopher Michael Dowding's, claims for damages resulting from an injury he sustained while working for the defendants. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the workers' compensation exclusivity rule, which provides that an employee can only seek compensation for workplace injuries through the workers' compensation system and not through a civil lawsuit.

The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to advance any substantive arguments or evidence in opposition to the motion, and therefore failed to meet his burden to show that there are triable issues of material fact. The judge struck the plaintiff's supplemental declaration and further briefing, which were filed in opposition to the motion, as they were not authorized by the court.

The judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented, which shows that the plaintiff was hired by the defendants to work on a job in Malibu, and that he was injured while performing his duties. The evidence also shows that the plaintiff presented a claim to recover workers' compensation benefits and received monetary benefits as a result. The judge found that the plaintiff's injury was within the scope of his employment and that there is no evidence to indicate that an exception to the workers' compensation exclusivity rule applies.
