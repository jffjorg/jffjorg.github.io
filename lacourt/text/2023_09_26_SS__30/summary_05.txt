```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motions of Robert Olie and Florence Olie to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The case is being transferred to Department One as it is considered a non-PI (premises liability and breach of habitability) case. The upcoming dates will be vacated, and counsel may re-file their motion in the proper court if Department One accepts the transfer. The judge has denied the request to relieve counsel at this time because it is too soon to the trial date, which is less than a month away, and the client would be unduly prejudiced.
