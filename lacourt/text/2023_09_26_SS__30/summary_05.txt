## English Summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling denying motions filed by attorneys seeking to be relieved from representing defendants Robert Olie and Florence Olie in the case of Shane Antley et al. vs. Robert Olie et al.  

The judge found that the requests were made too close to the trial date (less than a month), which would unduly prejudice the defendants. Additionally, the case involves premises liability and breach of habitability, classifying it as a non-PI (personal injury) case.  

As a result, the case was transferred to Department One, which handles non-PI cases.  The judge indicated that if Department One accepts the transfer, the upcoming court dates will be vacated, allowing the attorneys to re-file their motions in the appropriate court.
