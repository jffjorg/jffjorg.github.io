And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The plaintiff, Gabriella Tranchina, seeks further responses from the defendant, Uber Technologies, Inc., regarding their amended responses to the request. The court grants the motion in part, finding that Uber's objections are sustained for certain requests, while denying others. Specifically, the court denies requests for monetary sanctions.

The court limits the scope of certain requests, including RFP 43, which is granted in part, and RFP 55, which is granted in part with limitations. The court also denies certain requests, including RFP 67, finding that Uber has sufficiently complied.

The defendant has 20 days from notice of the ruling to serve further responses consistent with the court's discussion. The moving party is required to give notice.
