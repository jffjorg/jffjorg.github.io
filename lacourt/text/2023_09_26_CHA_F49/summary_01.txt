And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and imposing sanctions on the remaining plaintiffs. The defendant, Associated Tank Constructors, Inc., argued that the responses lacked a proper statement of compliance, contained improperly redacted items, and failed to produce a privilege log. The plaintiffs, Katarina Ford, et al., contended that the responses were code compliant and that the objections were meritorious.

The judge found that the responses were sufficiently code compliant and that the objections were properly made. However, the judge also found that the defendant had not shown a deficiency in the responses that would warrant the imposition of sanctions. The judge further found that the defendant's request for a privilege log was not justified and that the plaintiffs had already produced a privilege log.

The judge also addressed the issue of attorney work product privilege, finding that the defendant's objections to production of certain documents were properly made and that the documents were protected by the work product doctrine. The judge also found that the defendant's request for disclosure of expert witness testimony was not justified and that the plaintiffs had already agreed to disclose the test results during expert witness testimony.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and imposes no sanctions on the remaining plaintiffs.

## English Summary

The judge issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant's motion to compel further document production from Plaintiffs. 

The Defendant argued that Plaintiffs' responses were deficient, lacked proper statements of compliance, improperly redacted information, and required a privilege log. Plaintiffs countered that their responses were compliant with legal requirements and that the objections raised by the Defendant were without merit.

The Judge found that Plaintiffs' responses were sufficiently compliant with Code of Civil Procedure requirements regarding document production. The Court also found that lab tests conducted by Plaintiffs at the request of their attorneys were protected by the attorney work product privilege.

Ultimately, the judge denied Defendant's motion, finding no basis for imposing sanctions against Plaintiffs.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion by Associated Tank Constructors, Inc. (Tank) to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. Tank argues that the responses lack a proper statement of compliance, contain improperly redacted items, and challenge the validity of the objections. The court finds that the responses comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 and Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.240. The court also finds that the separate statement sufficiently addresses the dispute and complies with statutory requirements.

The parties dispute over objections involving attorney work product and premature expert disclosure. The court finds that the work product privilege applies to certain documents and that the objection to premature expert disclosure is overruled.

The court denies the motion and sets a motion to quash for February 16, 2024. The moving party is to give notice.
