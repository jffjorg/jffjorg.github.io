And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case BC709434, which addresses two separate motions filed by the Plaintiffs, Natasha Robinson and David Maxim, in pro per. The first motion seeks to adjudicate an attorney lien filed by former counsel, I. Donald Weissman, and to strike the request for expert fees presented in the memorandum of costs from dismissed defendants Farouk and Mary Riad. The second motion seeks to strike the $15,500 in expert witness fees.

The Judge denied the motion to adjudicate the attorney lien, stating that the court lacks jurisdiction to determine the existence or validity of an attorney's lien on the judgment. The Judge also denied the motion to strike the attorney lien, finding that the attorney must bring a separate, independent action against the client to establish the existence of the lien, determine the amount of the lien, and enforce it.

The Judge granted the unopposed motion to strike the $15,500 in expert witness fees, finding that expert witness fees are not recoverable unless ordered by the court, and that the court never awarded the expert fees. The Judge also noted that the inclusion of the expert witness fees in the memorandum of costs without prior court approval constitutes an error in any fee award.

**English Text Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses two requests made by Plaintiff Natasha Robinson, acting pro per, in Case BC709434. 

First, Robinson seeks to have the attorney lien filed by her former counsel, I. Donald Weissman, declared invalid.  The court explains that it lacks jurisdiction to determine the validity of an attorney lien and that Weissman must initiate a separate action to enforce it. 

Second, Robinson requests the court strike $15,500 in expert witness fees sought by the previously dismissed Defendants, Farouk and Mary Riad. The court grants this request, stating that expert witness fees are not automatically recoverable and must be specifically ordered by the court. Since no such order was issued, their inclusion in the memorandum of costs is improper.


The court denies Robinson's request to adjudicate the attorney lien and grants her request to strike the expert witness fees. Robinson is responsible for providing notice of this ruling to all parties involved in the case.

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to adjudicate the attorney lien and strike the expert fees filed by Natasha Robinson and David Maxim, the Plaintiffs, in pro per. The motion is denied as to the attorney lien and granted as to the expert fees.

As for the expert fees, the Judge grants the motion to strike the $15,500 in expert witness fees. The Judge finds that expert witness fees are not recoverable unless ordered by the court, and that the court never awarded such fees. The Judge also notes that the expert fees were sought in a memorandum of costs without prior court approval, which is an error in any fee award.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to adjudicate the attorney lien filed by former counsel I. Donald Weissman, as the court lacks jurisdiction to determine the existence or validity of the lien. The motion to strike the expert witness fees is granted, as the fees were not ordered by the court and were not specially pleaded and proven at trial. The court orders Natasha Robinson to give notice to all parties. The ruling is based on the court's review of the motion, opposition, and relevant case law, including Carroll v. Interstate Brands Corp. and Ripley v. Pappadopoulos. The court notes that the attorney lien must be sought in a separate, independent action, and that expert witness fees must be ordered by the court to be recoverable.
