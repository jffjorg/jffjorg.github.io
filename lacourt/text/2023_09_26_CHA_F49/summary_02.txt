And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case BC709434, which addresses two separate motions filed by the Plaintiffs, Natasha Robinson and David Maxim, in pro per. The first motion seeks to adjudicate an attorney lien filed by former counsel, I. Donald Weissman, and to strike the request for expert fees presented in the memorandum of costs from dismissed defendants Farouk and Mary Riad. The second motion seeks to strike the $15,500 in expert witness fees.

The Judge denied the motion to adjudicate the attorney lien, stating that the court lacks jurisdiction to determine the existence or validity of an attorney's lien on the judgment. The Judge also denied the motion to strike the attorney lien, finding that the attorney must bring a separate, independent action against the client to establish the existence of the lien, determine the amount of the lien, and enforce it.

The Judge granted the unopposed motion to strike the $15,500 in expert witness fees, finding that expert witness fees are not recoverable unless ordered by the court, and that the court never awarded the expert fees. The Judge also noted that the inclusion of the expert witness fees in the memorandum of costs without prior court approval constitutes an error in any fee award.
