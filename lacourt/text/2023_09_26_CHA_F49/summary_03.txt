```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion by Plaintiff Mylene Lopez-Farooq to correct her name in the case caption. The motion was filed because the attorney who filed the case originally listed her name as Mylene Farooq instead of Mylene Lopez-Farooq. However, the judge has determined that the requested relief is moot because the case was previously dismissed on March 29, 2023. The judge has the authority to amend and control its process and orders to make them conform to law and justice, and therefore, the motion is denied as moot.
