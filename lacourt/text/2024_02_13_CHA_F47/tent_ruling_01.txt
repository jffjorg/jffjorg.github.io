MOTION TO
ENFORCE SETTLEMENT 
 
Motion filed on 11/9/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Luz Pineda Trust
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Shyla Walker
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
enforcing settlement against Defendant Shyla Walker.
 
RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.    
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a residential lease agreement
between Plaintiff Luz Pineda Trust (Plaintiff) as landlord and Defendants
Landon McBroom (McBroom) and Shyla Walker (Walker).  The First Amended Complaint contained causes
of action for breach of written contract and breach of implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing.  
 
At the 12/5/22 Mandatory Settlement Conference, the
parties settled the case.  (Tabibnia
Decl., Ex.1).  By 3/9/23, a written
Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (Settlement Agreement) had been signed
by all parties.  (Id., Ex.2).  The Settlement Agreement provides that,
pursuant to CCP 664.6, the Court retains jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until full performance, including entry of judgment.  (Id. ¶8).
 
McBroom fulfilled his obligations under the settlement
agreement and has been dismissed from the action.  (See 11/15/23 Request for
Dismissal).  Walker has defaulted on her
obligations under the Settlement Agreement. 
(Tabibnia Decl.).  Despite being
given notice of the default as required under the agreement, Walker has failed
to cure same.  Id.  
 
Therefore, on 11/9/23, Plaintiff filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order enforcing settlement against Defendant Shyla
Walker.  Thereafter, Walker’s attorney’s
motion to be relieved as counsel was granted. 
The order granting the motion to be relieved set forth that the hearing
on the instant motion was scheduled for 2/13/24.  (See Order Granting Attorney’s Motion
to Be Relieved As Counsel – Civil filed 1/24/24; Notice of Lodging Order filed
1/5/24).    No opposition or other response to the motion
has been filed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 664.6(a) provides: 
 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.”
 
Based on the terms of the Settlement Agreement and
Walker’s default thereunder, Plaintiff is entitled to have judgment entered in
Plaintiff’s favor for the outstanding balance of $23,500.00 plus interest of
$1,175.00.  (See Tabibnia Decl.
¶10).  The Settlement Agreement also
provides that the prevailing party in any legal proceeding to enforce the terms
of the Settlement Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs
and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with such proceeding.  (Tabibnia Decl., Ex.2 ¶19).  The Court finds the $2,050.00 in attorney’s
fees requested for the motion to be unreasonable.  (Id. at ¶11).  The Court awards $1,000.00 in attorney’s fees
in connection with this motion calculated at 3 hours to prepare the motion and
1 hour to appear at $250/hour.
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to a total
judgment against Walker in the amount of $25,675.00.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted as set forth above.
