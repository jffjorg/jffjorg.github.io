And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Luz Pineda Trust, in its motion to enforce a settlement agreement against defendant Shyla Walker. The settlement agreement was signed by all parties on March 9, 2023, and provides for the payment of $23,500.00 plus interest of $1,175.00. However, Walker has defaulted on her obligations under the agreement and has failed to cure the default despite being given notice. As a result, the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment against Walker in the amount of $25,675.00, which includes the outstanding balance and interest, as well as reasonable costs and attorneys' fees. The court awards $1,000.00 in attorneys' fees to the plaintiff's counsel for their work on the motion. The motion is granted as set forth above.
