And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion in full, ordering the defendant to provide complete further responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, including requests for admission, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories, within 30 days from the order. The judge also orders the defendant to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,743.00 to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days from the order. The judge's ruling is based on the defendant's failure to provide complete responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, despite repeated attempts to meet and confer with the defendant. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to respond was unreasonable and that the plaintiff is entitled to the requested sanctions.
