And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one filed by the plaintiff, Jeffrey Qiuhong Yang, to bifurcate the trial into two phases, and one filed by the defendant, Global Win Capital Corporation, to reopen discovery for limited purposes.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to bifurcate the trial, which will allow the jury to first determine liability and then, if liability is found, to determine the amount of punitive damages. The judge also grants the defendant's motion to reopen discovery, but only for limited purposes, including allowing the defendant to serve a demand on the plaintiff to supplement his responses and production to certain requests for production, to compel the plaintiff to comply with his prior agreement to permit the inspection of documents, and to serve the plaintiff's current employer with a subpoena seeking personnel and payroll records.

The judge also limits the evidence that can be introduced during the liability phase of trial, preventing the plaintiff from introducing evidence of the defendant's current or past financial condition, including the holdings and value of its real estate, stock portfolio, and related information, except in certain limited circumstances.
