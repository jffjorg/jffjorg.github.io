Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion to compel an independent medical examination of the Plaintiff. The Defendant requested that the examination be conducted by Dr. Praveen R. Kambam and that it cover the origin, nature, and severity of the Plaintiff's alleged emotional distress and mental health injuries. The Judge found that the Defendant's request was too broad and did not specify the diagnostic tests and procedures to be conducted. Additionally, the Judge found that the Defendant's request to inquire into the Plaintiff's prior or subsequent sexual history was an invasion of the Plaintiff's zone of sexual privacy and was not relevant to the case. The Judge also mentioned that the Defendant did not provide a declaration of a mental health professional showing why the specific inquiries were relevant.
