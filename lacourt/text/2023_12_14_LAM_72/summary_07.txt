And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for an order authorizing service on defendant Aetna Finance Company by delivering the Summons and First Amended Complaint to the Secretary of State of California. The court finds that Aetna has transacted business in California and surrendered its right to do so, making it proper to serve the company through this method. The plaintiff seeks to serve Aetna with the Summons and First Amended Complaint, which was previously served on the Office of the Secretary of State for the State of California. The court notes that Aetna failed to respond to the First Amended Complaint and that the plaintiff filed a request for entry of default, which was rejected.
