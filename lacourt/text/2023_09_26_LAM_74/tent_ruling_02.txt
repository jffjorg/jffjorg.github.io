 Case Number:  22STCV16874    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  74 Stephanie
Salto Soto v. Liberty Global, LLC, et al.
Plaintiff Stephanie Salto Soto’s Motion
to Compel Deposition of Defendant Adam Alvarado
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
TENTATIVE RULING
            The court finds this motion moot
because the deposition has taken place. However, sanctions are warranted.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
May 20, 2022, Plaintiff Stephanie Salto Soto filed a complaint against
Defendant Adam Alvarado (Defendant) and others. The complaint alleges the
following causes of action: discrimination; harassment; retaliation; failure to
prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation; failure to engage in a
good faith interactive process, failure to provide reasonable accommodations,
negligent supervision and retention, wrongful termination in violation of
public policy, and declaratory judgment.
            On
August 31, 2022, Plaintiff noticed Defendant’s deposition for October 3, 2022. 
            On
September 13, 2022, Defendant notified Plaintiff that the noticed deposition
needed to be continued. However, Defendant did not provide alternative dates
despite Plaintiff’s attempts to follow up.
            On
November 14, 2022, Plaintiff re-noticed the deposition of Defendant for
December 13, 2022. 
            On
December 12, 2022, Defendant notified Plaintiff that he needed to continue the
deposition and would provide alternate dates. However, Defendant did not do so.
            Plaintiff
followed up with Defendant on February 28, 2023, March 16, 2023, and April 10,
2023, to no avail. 
            On
May 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel the deposition of Defendant.
That same day, after Plaintiff had filed this motion, Defendant provided dates
for the deposition.
LEGAL STANDARD
            “The
service of a deposition notice . . . is effective to require any deponent who
is a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee
of a party to attend and to testify, as well as produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) “If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action . . . without having served a valid
objection . . . fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, the
party giving notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
DISCUSSION
            The court finds this motion moot
because the deposition took place on June 1, 2023, a date suggested by an email
sent at 6:44 p.m. on May 2, 2023. (Shiri Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. A.) But by that time,
however, Plaintiff had already filed her motion to compel a few hours earlier. The
court finds that sanctions are appropriate because Defendant has not provided
substantial justification for delaying the deposition of Defendant Adam
Alvarado for months. Plaintiff’s counsel’s proposed hourly rate is reasonable,
and he has substantiated his request with a breakdown of work performed ($2,774.77
= $450 x (3 hours (preparation of motion) + 1 hour (review of opposition) + 1
hour (preparation of reply) + 1 hour (attendance at hearing) + $74.77 (filing
fees)). 
CONCLUSION
            Based on the foregoing, the court finds
this motion moot. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel attorney fees in the
sum of $2,774.77 by October 26, 2023.
            Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice.
