The Court considered the motions, oppositions, and replies in the case of Mamdouh Habib, et al. v. A.L. Wilson Chemical Company, Inc., et al. regarding the Defendant's Motion to Strike portions of the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The Court found that the Plaintiffs must identify each product that caused the injury at issue, and that the Defendant has the right to be presented with a pleading that places it on proper notice of all material allegations against it. The Court granted the Defendant's motion to strike page 5, line 10, of the FAC, which listed "other products to be determined during discovery" as chemicals to which Decedent was supposedly exposed. The Court also granted the Defendant's motion to strike the portions of the FAC alleging that all Plaintiffs are entitled to punitive and exemplary damages, as punitive damages are not available in a statutory wrongful death action. The Court granted the Plaintiffs leave to amend the FAC to add allegations about other products once they can identify them, and to reflect that only Plaintiff Loris Attia, as Decedent's wife and successor-in-interest, is entitled to punitive damages.

**English Summary:**

The judge issued a tentative ruling on Defendant's motion to strike portions of the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (FAC). 

The court granted the motion to strike:

*  A portion listing unspecified chemicals as potentially causing the Decedent's injury, finding that Plaintiffs must identify specific products alleged to have caused harm. 
*  Allegations of punitive damages for all Plaintiffs, as punitive damages are not available in statutory wrongful death actions for all Plaintiffs except the surviving spouse.

The court allowed Plaintiffs leave to amend the FAC to:

*  Identify the specific chemicals allegedly responsible for the Decedent's injury.
*  Clarify that only the surviving spouse, Loris Attia, is entitled to seek punitive damages.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court considered the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiffs' first amended complaint. The plaintiffs, including the decedent's wife and children, alleged that the decedent was exposed to chemicals and suffered injuries as a result. The defendant moved to strike certain portions of the complaint, including allegations of punitive damages and a list of "other products to be determined during discovery" that the decedent was allegedly exposed to.

The court granted the defendant's motion to strike, finding that the plaintiffs had not adequately identified the specific products that caused the decedent's injury. The court also found that punitive damages are not available in a statutory wrongful death action, except for the decedent's successor-in-interest, who is the decedent's wife.

The court ordered the defendant to give notice and granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to add allegations about other products once they can identify them, and to reflect that only the decedent's wife is entitled to punitive damages. The court's ruling is tentative, and the parties may still argue their positions at a future hearing.
