And here is the summary in English text:

The Court considered the motions, oppositions, and replies in the case of Mamdouh Habib, et al. v. A.L. Wilson Chemical Company, Inc., et al. regarding the Defendant's Motion to Strike portions of the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The Court found that the Plaintiffs must identify each product that caused the injury at issue, and that the Defendant has the right to be presented with a pleading that places it on proper notice of all material allegations against it. The Court granted the Defendant's motion to strike page 5, line 10, of the FAC, which listed "other products to be determined during discovery" as chemicals to which Decedent was supposedly exposed. The Court also granted the Defendant's motion to strike the portions of the FAC alleging that all Plaintiffs are entitled to punitive and exemplary damages, as punitive damages are not available in a statutory wrongful death action. The Court granted the Plaintiffs leave to amend the FAC to add allegations about other products once they can identify them, and to reflect that only Plaintiff Loris Attia, as Decedent's wife and successor-in-interest, is entitled to punitive damages.
