 Case Number:  23VECV02047    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV02047 SHOWROOM
INTERIORS LLC, A D... vs TODRICK HALL
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant Todrick Hall’s Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings is DENIED. 
Introduction 
Defendant Todrick Hall
(Defendant) moved for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff Showroom
Interiors LLC’s (Plaintiff) Complaint. 
Defendant’s motion placed into issue all four causes of action (COA)
alleged in the Complaint (i.e., breach of contract, open book account, account
stated, and goods sold and delivered) and two affirmative defenses (AD) in the
Answer (i.e., tenth AD for “penalty” and eleventh AD for “no interest”). A
reply was due February 7, 2024 and none was filed.
Procedure 
Defendant’s argument as to the
tenth and eleventh AD for “penalty” and “no interest” are not proper for a
motion for judgment on the pleadings because “a complaint cannot be attacked by
reference to matters set forth in the answer.” 
(Hughes v. Western MacArthur Co. (1982) 192 Cal.App.3d 951,
954-955.)  Because the matters in the
Answer were improperly raised in the motion, there is good cause to deny the motion.  
Discussion  
Specifically reviewing only the
allegations of the Complaint, Defendant argued that Plaintiff’s damages that
are over and above the alleged defaulted final payment of $28,374.00 (i.e., the
requested $98,374.00) is improper. 
Defendant argued that the requested damage in support of the four COAs
are actually a demand for an unlawful penalty based upon the factual
allegations in the Complaint and the terms of the attached contract.  A motion for judgment on the pleadings, like
a demurrer, tests whether a COA is sufficiently alleged.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 438(d).)  The rules governing demurrers apply.  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
995, 999.)   The contract expressly
stated that the total value of the furnishings was $196,748.00 but a discount
would be provided if Defendant complied with terms of the payment plan.  Plaintiff expressly alleged that Defendant
defaulted on the sixth payment and thus the condition was not met.  According to the Complaint, because the
condition was not met, the total value of the furnishings became due and
payable (with a credit to Defendant of $70,000.00 – i.e., the first five
payments already made).  This is pleaded
as an unfulfilled condition of the contract. This is sufficient for pleading
purposes.
A demurrer does not lie as to
only a claim for relief (i.e., punitive damages, penalties, or other relief)
where some valid claim is alleged. (Caliber Bodyworks, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 365, 384.) 
“Parties are ‘entitled to any relief warranted by the facts pleaded, and
their failure to ask for the proper relief is not fatal.’ … A defective prayer
is simply irrelevant to the question whether a cause of action is stated.”  (Gomez v. Volkswagen of America, Inc. (1985)
169 Cal.App.3d 921, 925.)  Defendant did
not argue that the Complaint is deficiently pled in regard to the elements of
the COAs.  Defendant merely argued
against the damages requested.  Because
there is no issue as to the pleading elements of the COAs, arguments against
the requested relief are improper and unpersuasive at this pleading stage.  
The motion for judgment on the
pleadings against the four COAs alleged in the Complaint is DENIED.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
