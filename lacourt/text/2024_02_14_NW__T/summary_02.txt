And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, Todrick Hall, moved to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint, alleging breach of contract, open book account, account stated, and goods sold and delivered. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's damages, which exceed the defaulted final payment of $28,374.00, are improper because they are a demand for an unlawful penalty based on the factual allegations in the complaint and the terms of the attached contract.

The judge denied the motion, ruling that the defendant's arguments are improper and unpersuasive at this pleading stage. The judge noted that a complaint cannot be attacked by reference to matters set forth in the answer, and that the defendant failed to argue that the complaint is deficiently pled in regard to the elements of the causes of action. The judge also cited several California court cases to support its ruling.

The motion for judgment on the pleadings against the four causes of action alleged in the complaint is denied.
