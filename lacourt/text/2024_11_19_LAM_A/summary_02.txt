```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to discharge itself from liability and for related orders. The Defendant, Knight Law Group, LLP, filed an interpleader cross-complaint alleging that it has been threatened with double vexation due to conflicting demands made on funds totaling $107,185.64. The Plaintiff, Auto Fraud Legal Center, LLP, argues that the interpleader cross-complaint is frivolous and that the Defendant has not alleged facts to show a reasonable probability of double vexation. The Judge finds that the cross-complaint is ambiguous and that the Defendant has not shown that both the Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant, Hallen Rosner, have made competing demands for the funds at issue. Therefore, the motion is denied.
