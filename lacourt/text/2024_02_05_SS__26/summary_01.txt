And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's motion to enforce the settlement agreement with Feliciano Adame Lugardo. The settlement agreement was signed by both parties and their attorneys and provides for payment of $11,800.00 to State Farm. Since Lugardo defaulted on the payments, State Farm is entitled to enter judgment against him for $6,800.00 principal (the remaining balance of the settlement amount) and $500.00 costs. The court will enter judgment in favor of State Farm and against Lugardo in the amount of $6,800.00 principal and $500.00 costs.
