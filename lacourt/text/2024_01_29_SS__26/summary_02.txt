Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Xiaofu Zhang's motion to vacate dismissal of the action. The motion was filed on March 28, 2023, seeking to set aside the dismissal of the action filed on December 20, 2022. The Judge found that the motion was not properly supported by legal authority and that the Plaintiff failed to specify under which statute the motion was brought. The Judge also noted that the reconsideration statute, Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, cannot be used to reconsider a judgment after it has been entered. Therefore, the motion was denied.
