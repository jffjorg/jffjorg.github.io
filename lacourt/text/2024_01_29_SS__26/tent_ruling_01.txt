ANALYSIS:
 
Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain (“Judgment Creditor”), in pro
per, filed the instant action for fraud against Alina Grygoryshyna (“Judgment
Debtor”), also in pro per, on July 6, 2020. Following Judgment Debtor’s failure
to appear, the Court entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on
January 4, 2021. 
 
On June 29, 2023, Judgment Creditor served an Affidavit for
Order for Appearance and Examination of Masud Hakim (“Masud Hakim”). Judgment
Creditor also served Masud Hakim with a Subpoena Duces Tecum on July 3, 2023,
seeking Masud Hakim’s appearance on September 18, 2023 and production of the
following documents: 
 
1.     
Current Driver's license (or another valid
government-issued photo identification document)
2.

5.     
Any and all checks, transfers, and/or payments received
by you (including any associated business entities) from Alina Grygoryshyna

past two years (or official IRS Verification of Non-filing Letters)
7.

8.

beneficiary designations)
 
(Motion, Exh. B, p. 4.) Masud Hakim did not appear on
September 18, 2023 and the Court ruled that a bench warrant by ordered and held
until November 13, 2023, with bail set in the amount of $5,000.00. (Minute
Order, 09/18/23.) On November 6, 2023, the Court granted Masud Hakim’s ex parte
application for a continuance and continued the examination for January 29,
2024. 
 
Masud Hakim filed the instant Motion to Quash Examination
and for Protective Order on December 26, 2023. Judgment Creditor filed an
opposition on January 19, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Masud Hakim brings the instant Motion to Quash and for
Protective Order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1987.1, 708.130,
707.120, and 2025.420. Section allows the Court to issue an order:
 
[Q]uashing the subpoena entirely,
modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as
the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court
may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from
unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the
right of privacy of the person. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
1987.1, subd. (a).) The Motion first points to Code of Civil Procedure section
708.120, which provides that an order for a third party to appear for
examination may be made upon “by affidavit or otherwise to the satisfaction of
the proper court that a third person has possession or control of property in
which the judgment debtor has an interest or is indebted to the judgment debtor
in an amount exceeding two hundred fifty dollars . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §
708.120, subd. (a).) The affidavit in support of the Order for Appearance does
not state that Masud Hakim is in possession or control of property in which
Judgment Debtor has an interest. (Motion, Azadegan Decl., Exh. A.) Instead, the
affidavit refers to two properties: 1045 Carolyn Way, Beverly Hills, California
and 1006 Elden Way, Beverly Hills, California. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶¶4-5).
The affidavit goes on to state that Judgment Creditor believes Judgment Debtor
may have an interest in said property. In opposition, Judgment Creditor argues
that the affidavit shows Judgment Debtor and her husband live at 1045 Carolyn
Way, which is owned by Masud Hakim through a company called Carolyn, LLC. (See ibid.)
Judgment Creditor further argues that this living situation demonstrates Judgment
Debtor and her husband must either (1) share ownership of 1045 Carolyn Way with
Masud Hakim; (2) be making rental payments to Masud Hakim; or (3) or be
receiving housing as a gift. Any such gift would be reportable on Masud Hakim’s
federal tax returns and constitute community property and be collectible
towards the judgment.
 
The Court agrees that the affidavit does not provide the
necessary showing regarding Judgment Debtor’s interest in the two properties
but merely speculates as to the nature of her interest. Similarly, Judgment
Creditor cannot obtain documents from a third party without a showing that the
third party controls or possesses property in which the judgment debtor has an
interest. (Finance Holding Co. LLC v. The American Institute of Certified
Tax Coaches, Inc. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 681, 682 [citing Code Civ. Proc., §
708.120].) Finally, Judgment Debtor’s subpoena with respect to documents that
only created expected interests, such as wills, trusts, and insurance policies,
is improper. (See Welch v. Welch (2022) 79 Cal.App.5 283, 299; see also Cook
v. Cook (1941) 17 Cal.2d 639, 644.) In opposition, Judgment Debtor does not
address these legal authorities, expect to argue that by raising the issue of
revocable trusts, Masud Hakim has somehow admitted to the existence of
irrevocable trusts in which Judgment Debtor or her husband have vested
interests. (Opp., ¶9.) This tortured logic—that by mentioning one thing Masud
Hakim admits to the existence of the opposite—does not demonstrate the
existence of any such irrevocable trust. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, third party Masud Hakim’s Motion to
Quash Appearance and/or Protective Order is GRANTED. THE ORDER FOR APPEARANCE
AND EXAMINATION AND SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM WITH RESPECT TO MASUD HAKIM ARE
QUASHED.
