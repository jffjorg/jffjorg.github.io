And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the defendant, Wright, et al. The plaintiff had sought to strike the defendant's answer and enter default judgment due to the defendant's failure to serve verified responses and pay sanctions as ordered. However, the judge found that terminating sanctions would be improper because the defendant never filed a response to the complaint and the plaintiff failed to seek entry of default as required by law. Instead, the judge set an order to show cause re: entry of default for February 20, 2024, at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
