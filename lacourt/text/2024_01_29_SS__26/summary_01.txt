This is a tentative ruling on a motion to quash an examination and for a protective order. The motion was filed by Masud Hakim, a third party, against Andrew Krain, the judgment creditor. The judgment creditor had served an affidavit for an order for appearance and examination on Masud Hakim, as well as a subpoena duces tecum seeking various documents. Masud Hakim did not appear for the examination and the court issued a bench warrant. The court granted a continuance of the examination to January 29, 2024.

The court held that the affidavit did not provide sufficient showing regarding the judgment debtor's interest in the two properties at issue, and that the subpoena was improper. The court also noted that judgment creditor could not obtain documents from a third party without a showing that the third party controls or possesses property in which the judgment debtor has an interest.

The court granted the motion to quash the examination and protective order, and quashed the order for appearance and examination, as well as the subpoena duces tecum, with respect to Masud Hakim.
