Zhang
v. Singh, et al.MOTION
TO VACATE DISMISSAL [RECONSIDERATION](CCP § 1008(e))
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Xiaofu
Zhang’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Xiaofu Zhang (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, filed the
instant action for dental malpractice against Defendants Ravinder Steven Singh,
DDS (“Defendant Singh”) and Singh Dental Corporation dba Long Beach Total
Dental Care (erroneously sued as Long Beach Total Dental Care) (“Defendant
Singh Dental”) (collectively, Defendants”) on April 5, 2021. Defendants filed
an Answer to the Complaint on October 12, 2021. The Court dismissed the action
on December 20, 2022 and a judgment of dismissal was entered on December 27, 2022.
(Judgment, 12/27/22.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on
March 28, 2023. Defendants filed an opposition on April 14, 2023 and, following
a continuation of the hearing, Plaintiff replied on May 19, 2023. Defendants
filed an objection to the reply on June 5, 2023. 
 
The Motion initially came for hearing on June 15, 2023 and
was continued at Plaintiff’s request to December 20, 2023. (Minute Order,
06/15/23.) On December 20, 2023, the hearing was continued to accommodate
Plaintiff’s request for a Mandarin interpreter. (Minute Order, 12/20/23.)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff filed three different briefs on March 28, 2023 in
support of the instant motion, none of which cite any specific statute for
relief. Instead, the briefs refer broadly to the “CCP,” presumably the Code of
Civil Procedure, and the relief pursuant to reconsideration and rules to set
aside/vacate. (Motions, p. 2:33-38.) 
 
The reconsideration statute is set forth at Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008. (Motion, p. 2:35-37.) The Court, however, cannot
reconsider its ruling under this statute after entry of judgment. “‘A court may reconsider its order granting
or denying a motion and may even reconsider or alter its judgment so long as
judgment has not yet been entered. Once judgment has been entered, however, the
court may not reconsider it and loses its unrestricted power to change the
judgment....’ [Citation.]” (G.R. v. Intelligator (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th
606, 622 [citing APRI Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th
176, 181].) 
 
The set aside/vacate
statute is set forth at Code of Civil Procedure section 473, but Plaintiff does
not specify under which subsection the Motion is brought. Instead, the briefs
simply reiterate Plaintiff’s factual allegations without providing the
necessary legal authority to support the relief requested. Therefore, it is not
possible to determine whether the dismissal can be vacated under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473.  
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Xiaofu
Zhang’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is DENIED.
 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
