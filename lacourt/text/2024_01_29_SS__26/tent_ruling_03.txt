TENTATIVE RULING:

2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY APRIL 22,
2024, DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES AS
REQUIRED BY CAL. RULES OF COURT RULE 3.1113. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT’S
ORDER MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Petitioner Department of Industrial Relations, Labor
Commissioner’s Office (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Request That Clerk Enter
Judgment And Judgment On Final Order, Decision Or Award Of The Labor
Commissioner against Defendant Raisa Petrowizky (“Defendant”) on August 26,
2023. Judgment was entered in favor of Liudmila Averkiyeva (“Plaintiff”) and
against Defendant on the same date. Defendant filed the instant Motion to
Vacate Judgment on December 21, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
The Motion is not accompanied by a
memorandum of points and authorities, as required. “The memorandum must contain
a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments
relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in
support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) The
Motion, however, cites no legal authority in support of the request for relief.
(Motion, pp. 3:1-5:4.) Indeed, Defendant’s failure to provide a memorandum as
required by the Rule is an “admission that the [request] is without merit and
cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re
Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the hearing on Defendant Raisa Petrowizky’s Motion to Vacate Judgment
is CONTINUED TO MAY 28, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET
COURTHOUSE. BY APRIL 22, 2024, DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A MEMORANDUM OF
POINTS AND AUTHORITIES AS REQUIRED BY CAL. RULES OF COURT RULE 3.1113. FAILURE
TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT’S ORDER MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
