And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding the demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint (SAC). The court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply. The plaintiff, Elliot Shell, filed a complaint against defendants Carla Christofferson and Adam Shell, alleging that they had entered into an oral agreement to repay a loan of money from trusts. The defendants demurred to the complaint, and the court previously overruled the demurrer to the breach of contract, money lent, and account stated causes of action. The court sustained the demurrer to the money had and received cause of action without leave to amend.

The defendants have now demurred to the SAC's fourth cause of action for unjust enrichment. The court agrees with the defendants that the new allegations in the SAC fail to allege that the enrichment was derived from anything other than the loan agreement. Based on this, the court sustains the demurrer.
