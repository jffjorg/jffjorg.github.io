[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S SECOND
AMENDED COMPLAINT
MOVING PARTIES: Defendant CARLA CHRISTOFFERSON
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs ELLIOT SHELL and THE ELLIOT
LEWIS SHELL EXEMPT TRUST U/D/T 1/13/82
The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and
reply.
BACKGROUND
Defendants Adam Shell and Carla Christofferson are a
married couple involved in dissolution proceedings in Family Court initiated by
Defendant Shell prior to the filing of this case.
On January 30, 2023, Defendant Shell’s father, Plaintiff
Elliot Shell, as an individual and as a trustee of three trusts (the Shell
Family Trust Dated 7/30/91, Elliot Lewis Shell Exempt Trust U/D/T 1/13/83, and
The Elliot Lewis Shell Exempt Trust U/D/T 1/13/83) filed a complaint against defendants alleging (in substance)
that he and the defendants had entered into an oral agreement
whereby he loaned defendants money from the trusts that defendants had agreed
to repay.
Christofferson1 demurred to the Complaint, and Plaintiff
responded filed a First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”). Christofferson demurred
again to each cause of action in the FAC. On December 1, 2023, the court
overruled defendant’s demurrer to the breach of contract, money lent, and
account stated causes of action. The court sustained the demurrer to the money
had and received cause of action without leave to amend. The court sustained
the demurrer to the restitution based on unjust enrichment case of action with
leave to amend granted “only in so far as Plaintiff may add facts separate of
the loan agreement which constitute unjust enrichment.” (Demurrer to the SAC,
Exh. 1.)
On December 18, 2023, plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint (the “SAC”) and alleged the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract; (2) money lent; (3) account stated; and (4) restitution based on
unjust enrichment.
Christofferson now demurrers to the SAC’s fourth cause of
action for unjust enrichment. Plaintiff opposed and Christofferson replied.
LEGAL STANDARD
A party may object to a complaint or cross-complaint; the
party may file a demurrer, an answer, or both. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 430.30.)
The demurrer may be filed within 30 days after service of the complaint or
cross-complaint unless extended by stipulation or court order. (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 430.40(a).)
As a general matter, in a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence
or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The only
issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
DISCUSSION
As the Court previously noted
in its December 1, 2023 order, there is a split of authority on whether unjust
enrichment is a cause of action. “The phrase ‘Unjust Enrichment’ does not
describe a theory of recovery, but an effect: the result of a failure to make
restitution under circumstances where it is equitable to do so.” (Lauriedale
Associates, Ltd. v. Wilson (1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 1439, 1448.) “Unjust
enrichment is ‘a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines and
remedies,’ rather than a remedy itself.” (Melchior v. New Line Cinema (2003)
106 Cal. App. 4th 779, 793.) “[A]s a matter of law, a quasi-contract action for
unjust enrichment does not lie where . . . express binding agreements exist and
define the parties’ rights.” (California Medical Ass’n, Inc. v. Aetna U.S.
Healthcare of California, Inc. (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 151, 172; see also
Wal-Noon Corp. v. Hill (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 605, 650)
Christofferson argues, and the
court agrees, that Plaintiff’s new allegations quantify the extent of the
alleged enrichment but fail to allege that the enrichment was derived from
anything other than the loan agreement.
Based on the foregoing, the
court SUSTAINS the demurrer.
