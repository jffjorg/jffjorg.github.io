ANALYSIS
A propounding
party may move to compel responses to requests for production of documents
where the responding party fails to provide responses. (CCP § 2031.300.) The
responding party must provide responses within thirty days after the demand is
served. (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2) & (3).) The responding party waives all
objections, including privilege and work product, by failing to timely respond
to requests for production of documents. (CCP § 2031.300.) 
 
Plaintiff has
failed to respond to Defendant’s Requests for Production. Defendant has moved
for an order compelling Plaintiff’s response to these Requests. The Court
grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to the Requests for Production. 
 
Defendant’s
motion to compel responses to the Requests for Production is granted.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
