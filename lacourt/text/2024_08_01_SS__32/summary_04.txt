And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispute between the plaintiff and defendant regarding the burden of proof. The defendant argues that the plaintiff did not allege that the defendant increased the risks of swimming, and even if they had, the defendant provided sufficient evidence to shift the burden. The judge notes that the defendant did not cite authority to support the claim that a plaintiff's failure to seek an expert declaration prior to a hearing on a motion for summary judgment cannot constitute "newly discovered evidence." The judge is considering the defendant's argument that the expert declaration was obtained after the court's ruling on the motion for summary judgment, but does not address the issue of the burden of proof.
