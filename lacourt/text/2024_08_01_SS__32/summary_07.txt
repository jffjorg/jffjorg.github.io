Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the Defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), to deem admitted Requests for Admission, Set One, and to compel verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production, Set One. The Defendant served these requests on the Plaintiff, Robert Frausto Acevedo, on September 11, 2023, but the Plaintiff failed to respond. The Judge granted relief to the Plaintiff's counsel on March 27, 2024, and the Defendant subsequently filed the proof of service on July 15, 2024.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests despite receiving notice of the motions and having an opportunity to respond. Therefore, the Judge grants the Defendant's motions to deem admitted and compel verified responses. The Judge also awards $60 in sanctions against the Plaintiff for failing to respond to discovery requests.

The Plaintiff shall provide verified responses, without objections, within 10 days, and shall pay $60 in monetary sanctions to counsel for the Defendant within 30 days of this order.
