And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants. The plaintiffs are arguing that the defendants are liable for the death of the decedent, but the judge is not convinced. The judge points out that the plaintiffs' prior allegations in the verified complaint, including those regarding causation, constitute admissions that the defendants are immune from liability based on the decedent's consumption of alcohol. The judge is also skeptical of the plaintiffs' argument that the defendants failed to maintain the pool properly, citing inadequate lighting as an example. The judge notes that the plaintiffs do not explain what was newly discovered or why it was discovered after the filing of the complaint, except for the court's ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The judge is tentatively ruling that the plaintiffs have not established liability and will consider the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings.
