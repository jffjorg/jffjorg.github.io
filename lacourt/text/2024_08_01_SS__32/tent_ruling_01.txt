TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


August
  1, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


20STCV29949




MOTIONS:  


Compel
  Verified Responses to Request for Production, Set Two




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Yair Maor Dabush  




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendants
  Kenneth Russell Parga and Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
  Authority  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendants Kenneth Russell and Los Angeles
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide verified responses to
Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two. Defendants respond and Plaintiff
replies.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Requests for Production 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300, if a party
fails to serve a timely response to a demand for inspection, the party making
the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Code Civ.
Pro § 2031.300 (b).) The party who fails to serve a timely response to a demand
for inspection waives any objection to the demand unless the court finds that
the party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
or party’s failure was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300 (a)(1)- (2).)  
 
Courts shall impose a monetary sanction against any party
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand
for inspection unless the party acted with substantial justification or other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300 (c).) Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery
Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff served Requests for Production of
Documents, Set Two on Defendants. Defendants served an objection on February
26, 2024. Plaintiff re-served the discovery requests on May 9, 2024. Defendants
received an extension and served responses on June 14, 2024 which consisted
solely of objections.
 
Unverified
discovery responses are tantamount to no response at all, and are subject to a
motion to compel responses (rather than a motion to compel further responses).¿
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 632, 635-36.)¿¿However,
the party to whom interrogatories and requests for production are
directed shall sign the response under oath unless the responses contain only
objections. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.250(a), 2031.250(a).)
 
Here,
because Defendants’ responses contained objections, signed by counsel, a motion
to compel is not appropriate, but rather motions to compel further under Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and 2031.310, which requires the moving
party to meet and confer, schedule an informal discovery conference, and file a
separate statement. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court continues the motions to August 22, 2024 at 1:30
p.m. An informal discovery conference is set for August 14, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Plaintiff
shall promptly meet and confer with Defendants by telephone or in person and
submit a joint status report advising the Court whether any issues have been
resolved, by August 12, 2024. A courtesy of the joint report must be delivered
to Department 32 by 4:00 p.m. on August 13.
 
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
