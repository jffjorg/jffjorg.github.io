Plaintiffs further allege that Dr. Othon Mena, who signed Decedent’s death
certificate, testified during deposition “that ‘acute alcohol intoxication’
simply means that Decedent . . . had alcohol in his system at the time of his
death, as opposed to dying from chronic alcohol abuse.” (FAC ¶ 32.)


[2] The
complaint itself alleged a number of defects about the pool, including
inadequate lighting. (See, e.g., Complaint at ¶¶ 46-55.) Plaintiffs do not
explain what was newly discovered or why it was discovered after the filing of
the complaint, other than the Court’s ruling on the motion for judgment on the
pleadings.


[3] In order
to do so, Plaintiffs would have to establish that the Court could ignore their
prior allegations in the verified complaint including regarding causation, given
that Plaintiffs concede that Defendants were immune from liability based on any
theory of liability relating to Decedent’s consumption of alcohol. (Opposition
at p. 14.) Plaintiffs do not respond to Defendants’ argument that these prior
allegations constitute admissions.
