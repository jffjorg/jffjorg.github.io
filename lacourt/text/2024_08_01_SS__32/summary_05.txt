Summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendants Bonnie Fergurson, James Furgurson, and Katherine Furgurson in a wrongful death action. The defendants are seeking to strike a first amended complaint (FAC) filed by plaintiffs Thomas Robert Brown and Erin Michelle Brown, alleging that the FAC is a sham pleading and fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the FAC omits references to allegations in the original verified complaint that the defendants supplied alcohol to the party guests, contributed to the chaotic environment, and allowed impaired guests to use the pool. The Judge has also denied the motion to strike as moot.
