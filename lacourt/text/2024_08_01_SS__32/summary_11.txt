The tentative ruling grants the motion to consolidate Cases 23STCV28980 and 23STCV29051 for all purposes. The two cases involve common questions of law and fact, and both cases allege negligence theories based on the same motor vehicle accident that occurred on June 14, 2023. The court finds that consolidation will avoid unnecessary costs or delay, avoid duplication of procedure, and avoid inconsistent results. The motion is granted without opposition, and all future papers must be filed in Case 23STCV28980 only.
