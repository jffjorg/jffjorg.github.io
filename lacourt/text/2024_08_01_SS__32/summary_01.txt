And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel verified responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two. The plaintiff, Yair Maor Dabush, is seeking to compel the defendants, Kenneth Russell Parga and Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to provide verified responses to the requests. The defendants have served objections and responses, which the plaintiff argues are unverified and inadequate.

The court finds that the defendants' responses are subject to a motion to compel further responses under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.300 and 2031.310. The court sets an informal discovery conference for August 14, 2024, and requires the parties to meet and confer by August 12, 2024. The plaintiff must file a joint status report with the court by August 13, 2024. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution, they must indicate their intention to submit on this tentative ruling to the court by email.
