Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

```
case_number: 22STCV21519
hearing_date: 2024-08-01
dept: 32
moving_party: Plaintiffs Brandee Vasquez and the Estate of Jonathyn Bradford
opposing_party: Defendant Southern California Edison Company
background:
  - On December 5, 2022, Plaintiffs filed the operative first amended complaint (FAC) against Defendants Southern California Edison Co. and Does 1 to 20, asserting a wrongful death and survival action based on negligence surrounding the death of Decedent Jonathyn Bradford.
  - On July 7, 2020, Decedent was swimming in Shaver Lake when he was suddenly pulled underwater and ultimately drowned.
  - Defendant moved for summary judgment/adjudication against Plaintiffs' action, arguing four issues, including that Defendant did not owe a duty to Decedent, that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the doctrine of recreational immunity under Civil Code section 846, and that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk.
  - On May 1, 2024, the Court granted Defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk.
  - On June 14, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Intention to Move for New Trial.

Legal Standard:
  - A court has the power to vacate a decision in whole or in part and grant a new trial if the court determines either of the following grounds: irregularity in the proceedings, misconduct of the jury, accident or surprise, newly discovered evidence, excessive or inadequate damage, insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict, or error in law.
  - A motion for new trial is a creature of statute, and if the trial court grants such relief without conforming to the statutory procedures, the order will be void as an excess of jurisdiction.

Discussion:
  - A. Denial of Continuance: Plaintiffs argue that the Court granted summary judgment based on an incorrect understanding of the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk, but the Court finds that Defendant presented sufficient evidence to meet its initial burden.
  - B. Premature Burden Shifting: Plaintiffs argue that the Court prematurely shifted the burden to Plaintiffs to show evidence that Defendant's conduct increased the inherent risks of swimming, but the Court finds that Defendant presented evidence that the cove where the incident occurred did not contain strong currents, dangerous debris, or other conditions that would increase the drowning risk above those that generally might be expected in open bodies of water.
  - C. Plaintiff's Evidence Created Triable Issue of Fact: Plaintiffs argue that they produced facts that Defendant's operations affected the inherent risk of swimming, but the Court finds that the evidence does not point to conduct by Defendant that made the water in Shaver Lake "any colder such that it increased the risks inherent in swimming in an outdoor lake."
  - D. Newly Discovered Expert Evidence: Plaintiffs argue that newly discovered expert evidence shows how Defendant's operations caused Shaver Lake to have more drastic changes in water conditions than in a natural body of water, and the Court finds that the new Goll declaration creates a triable issue of fact since it links Defendant's management of the reservoir with varying cold pockets and currents.

Order:
  - The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' motion for new trial.
  - The Hearing on Motion for Summary Judgment, filed by Defendant Southern California Edison Company, is set for September 26, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. in Department 32 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
  - Plaintiffs shall provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
