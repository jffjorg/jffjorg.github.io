The rule requires that a motion to be relieved as counsel be accompanied by a declaration on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel â€“ Civil (form MC-052), which was not used in this case. The court also notes that the proposed order relieving counsel was not lodged with the court. The motion is denied without prejudice to Zulu Ali filing a new motion that complies with the rule.
