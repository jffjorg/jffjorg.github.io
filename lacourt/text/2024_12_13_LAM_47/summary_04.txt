Summary:

Judge Theresa M. Traber's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to dismiss the action, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310. The plaintiff, Cenigent Health Enhancement Medical Institute, seeks to recover outstanding invoices totaling over $1.5 million for medical treatment and research services provided to the defendants. The defendants, Dan Mintz, et al., move to dismiss the action, arguing that the five-year deadline to bring the action to trial has expired. The judge finds that the stay of arbitration and bankruptcy proceeding extended the deadline, and that the parties' stipulations to extensions waived the right to dismiss. The trial is set to commence on February 11, 2025, and the court will not dismiss the action.
