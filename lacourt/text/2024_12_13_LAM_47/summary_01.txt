```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary adjudication in part, finding that the plaintiff lacks standing to enforce the governing documents and that the plaintiff did not have justifiable reliance on the defendants' alleged misrepresentations. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not have a triable issue of fact with respect to the conversion and intentional interference with contractual relations claims. The judge denied the plaintiff's claim for fraud, finding that the plaintiff had not alleged sufficient facts to support the claim and that the defendants had not demonstrated their entitlement to summary adjudication. The judge granted the defendants' motion for summary adjudication on the eleventh cause of action, which alleged a breach of the governing documents.
