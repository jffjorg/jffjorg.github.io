STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract, fraud, and conversion. Plaintiffs
allege that Defendants agreed to sell the application rights for a cannabis
retail license to Plaintiffs for $100,000, but, after receiving the money, demanded
a further $60,000 for the application number necessary to make use of those
rights. 
 
Defendants John and Erica
Montgomery and Montgomery Enterprises, Inc. move to enforce a settlement
agreement. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants John and Erica
Montgomery and Montgomery Enterprises, Inc. move to enforce a settlement
agreement. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            Enforcement
of settlement agreements is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
This statute provides, in relevant part:
 
If the
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6(a).) The
Court is empowered under this section to resolve reasonable disputes over the
terms of a settlement. (Machado v. Myers (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 779,
795.) The Court does not insert provisions into the parties’ agreement but
applies the rules of contractual construction to interpret the settlement. (Id.
at 792.) When extrinsic evidence is necessary, the Court may decide the motion
on declarations alone. (Richardson v. Richardson (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d
91, 97.) 
 
Enforcement of
Settlement
 
            The Montgomery Defendants seek to enforce
a putative settlement agreement between Plaintiffs, on the one hand, and the
moving Defendants, on the other, in which Plaintiffs purportedly agreed to
dismiss this action in exchange for one dollar deemed received at the time the
agreement is signed. (Declaration of John Montgomery ISO Mot. Exh. A.) The copy
of the settlement agreement provided appears to be signed by these parties,
dated September 7, 2024. (Id.) However, the agreement also states that
“John Montgomery has agreed to assist Memory and her attorney in any way
possible to get refunded the 100k cash for the Daniel Wise/Wise Endevors [sic]
case.” (Id.) This provision of the Agreement appears to relate to Plaintiffs’
allegations against Daniel Wise and Wise Endeavors asserted in the First
Amended Complaint. (See FAC ¶¶ 20-25.) The terms of this agreement appear to
have some import to Plaintiffs’ claims against other Defendants who have not
yet been served with the summons and complaint. Taken together with the de
minimis settlement payment, the Court has concerns regarding the propriety
of this agreement, especially where other parties to this action have not yet
been given notice. The Court therefore declines to enforce the settlement until
such time as the remaining Defendants are before the Court so that they may be
given notice and an opportunity to be heard. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion to Enforce Settlement is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Moving Parties to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
