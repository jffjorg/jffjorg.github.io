And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the parties. The agreement, signed on September 7, 2024, states that the plaintiffs will dismiss their claims against the defendants in exchange for a payment of $1. The defendants, John and Erica Montgomery and Montgomery Enterprises, Inc., seek to enforce this agreement. However, the judge has concerns about the propriety of this agreement, particularly since other parties to the action have not yet been given notice. The judge declines to enforce the settlement until the remaining defendants are before the court and can be given notice and an opportunity to be heard. The motion to enforce settlement is therefore denied without prejudice.
