DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion
for Summary Judgment 
 
            Plaintiff moves for summary
judgment. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party can show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and, if
not, to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment
if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in
a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the
function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any
triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-82.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, a plaintiff moving for summary judgment satisfies the initial burden
to show that there is no defense to a claim by proving each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment. (Code Civ Proc. § 437c(p)(1).)
Similarly, the cross-defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the
initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or
to establish a defense. (Code Civ Proc. § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log
Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) In both cases, Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) The lack of
opposition is not grounds to grant a motion for summary judgment if a movant
cannot meet their initial burden of proof. (See Thatcher v. Lucy Stores,
Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1087.)
 
            Once the
moving party has met its burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to
show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause
of action or a defense thereto. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(1)-(2).) To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
//
Defective Notice
of Motion and Separate Statement
 
            Although Plaintiff purports to move
for summary adjudication as an alternative to summary judgment, Plaintiff’s
Notice of Motion does not separately identify the causes of action on which
summary adjudication is sought. (See Cal. Rules of Court Rule. 3.1350(b).)
Consequently, Plaintiff’s separate statement does repeat these issues for
summary adjudication, verbatim, nor does it separately identify the facts which
are material with respect to each cause of action. (Id. Rule 3.1350(b); (d).)
The failure to provide a separate statement is, in the Court’s
discretion, grounds for denial of the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(b)(1).)
Moreover, appellate precedent has consistently encouraged trial courts to
require strict compliance with the requirements for separate statements. (United
Community Church v. Garcin (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 327, 335 [superseded by
statute on other grounds]; North Coast Business Park v. Nielsen Construction
Co. (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 22, 30-32.) 
 
Owing to the deficiency in the
Notice of Motion, Plaintiff has failed to give Defendants proper notice of the
issues at hand for summary adjudication, although the motion does give valid
notice of intent to move for summary judgment. Thus, even if the Court
were to overlook the defective Separate Statement, the Court could consider
this motion as a motion for summary judgment only. For the reasons stated
below, however, Plaintiff’s motion must also be denied on the merits.
 
Defendants’
Evidentiary Objections
 
            Defendants object to the Declaration
of Dermot Givens submitted in support of this motion. The Court rules on these
objections as follows:
 
            Objection Nos. 1-8: SUSTAINED
for lack of relevance. That Plaintiff has not received information from
Defendants does not tend to establish whether Defendants can offer a defense to
any cause of action asserted against them.
 
            Objections Nos. 9:
SUSTAINED for lack of relevance. 
 
            Objection No. 10: SUSTAINED
for lack of relevance and lack of foundation. 
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff moves for summary judgment
against the HOA Defendant on the grounds that the HOA Defendant does not have
standing to defend against this suit. The Davis-Stirling Common Interest
Development Act, codified at Civil Code section 4000 et seq., governs
common interest developments in California, including, inter alia, the
establishment and conduct of homeowners’ associations. Section 5980 of the Act bestows
standing to sue and be sued on homeowners’ associations. (Civ. Code § 5980.)
Plaintiff asserts that the HOA Defendant does not have standing to defend
against this action because it has not complied with the other requirements of
the Act. Plaintiff does not specify what requirements have been violated, does
not offer any evidence tending to establish any violation, and does not set
forth any authority for the position that a violation of the Act deprives a
homeowners’ association of standing to sue and be sued. Mere assertions are not
sufficient to carry Plaintiff’s burden on summary judgment. Consequently, the
burden of proof does not shift to Defendant to demonstrate a triable issue of
fact, and Plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment.
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED. 
 
Defendants’ Motion
for Summary Judgment 
 
            Defendants move for summary judgment
on the Complaint. As Defendants have not demonstrated their entitlement to
summary adjudication of all causes of action for the reasons stated below,
Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. 
 
Defendants’ Motion
in the Alternative for Summary Adjudication
 
            Defendants move in the alternative
for summary adjudication of all causes of action. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party can show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and, if
not, to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil

if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in
a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the
function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any
triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-82.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ Proc. § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes,
Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) The lack of opposition by a plaintiff is
not grounds to grant a motion for summary judgment if a defendant cannot meet
their initial burden of proof. (See Thatcher v. Lucy Stores, Inc. (2000)
79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1087.)
 
            Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Plaintiffs’ Missing Opposition Papers
 
            Although
Defendants appeared to have received opposition papers from Plaintiff ahead of
the original October 3, 2024 hearing on this motion, no opposition was filed
with the Court. As part of the Court’s order continuing these proceedings in
light of the parties’ stipulation, the Court ordered Plaintiff to file his
opposition papers with the Court “forthwith.” (October 3, 2024 Minute Order.)
Although Plaintiff filed his opposition brief on October 3, 2024, he did not
include any supporting declarations or a response to Defendants’ Separate
Statement. The only supporting material filed was a “Notice of Exhibits” which
appears to have been cut off after six pages of a set of responses to requests
for admissions. (Notice of Exhibits filed October 1, 2024.) As no other
materials have been filed, the Court must limit its consideration of
Plaintiff’s opposition to these papers. 
 
Defendants’
Evidentiary Objections
 
            Defendants object to portions of the
Declaration of Dermot Givens which was purportedly submitted in opposition to
this motion. However, as the Court is not in possession of the Declaration at
issue, the Court cannot rule on these objections. 
 
Defendants’
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendants request that the Court
take judicial notice of (1) a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale dated August 10, 2023
recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office as instrument No.
20230556064; (2) the May 17, 2024 Minute Order in the action entitled Alexsei
Durack et al. v. Dermot Givens, Case No. 22STCV20402; (3) Dermot Givens’s
Status Report #13 filed with the Court in the above-entitled action on May 20,
2024; and (4) the docket in the above-entitled action.
 
            Defendant’s Request No.1 is GRANTED
pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(c) (official acts). Defendant’s remaining
requests are GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d) (court records). 
 
First Cause of
Action: Breach of Governing Documents
 
            Defendants move for summary
adjudication of the first cause of action for breach of governing documents.
            As alleged in the operative First
Amended Complaint, Plaintiff owned a condominium at 1628 North Formosa Avenue,
Unit B, Los Angeles CA 90046. (FAC ¶ 1.) The individual Defendants Durack and
Khuat owned Units A and E in the same development, respectively. (FAC ¶¶ 3-4.) The
development is managed by a Homeowner’s Association, whose establishing
Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions and governing Bylaws are
provided in the pleadings. (FAC ¶¶ 15-16; Exhs. A-B.) According to Plaintiff,
the HOA has largely ignored its obligations and is effectively defunct. (FAC ¶¶
18-32.) Plaintiff alleges that he purchased Unit B in 2004 and sold the
property in 2008. (FAC ¶ 47-48.) After he originally sold the Unit, Plaintiff
alleges that the new owner failed to pay HOA dues, resulting in liens being
asserted against the property until the new owner was foreclosed upon in August
2017. (FAC ¶¶ 49-51.) The foreclosure purchaser, Wells Fargo, allegedly did not
pay HOA assessments during its ownership and transferred title to HJK &
JJL, LLC in October 2019. (FAC ¶ 53.) 
 
In the meantime, Plaintiff alleges that, following a lawsuit brought by
Defendant Durack, a new election of the HOA Board of Directors was conducted,
naming Durack and Khuat the sole Board members in May 2019. (FAC ¶ 38.)
Plaintiff alleges the election was illegitimate. (FAC ¶ 39.) Plaintiff contends
the new HOA Board did not record a lien against the property for Wells Fargo’s
unpaid assessments, but rather secured HJK & JJL’s assent to a
hold-harmless agreement to pay Wells Fargo’s assessments. (FAC ¶ 56.)
Nevertheless, the assessments went unpaid. (Id.) Plaintiff reacquired
the property on June 23, 2020, and, shortly thereafter, the new Board of
Directors demanded payment for an assessment lien totaling $15,894, which
Plaintiff allegedly paid. (FAC ¶¶ 57-63.) This lawsuit followed. 
 
Plaintiff’s first cause of action alleges that Formosa Gardens HOA has
violated numerous provisions of the CC&Rs and Bylaws, including, inter
alia, having an insufficient number of directors, failing to conduct
regular meetings and maintain minutes and financial statements, failing to
require owners to pay assessments due and payable, and issuing further
assessments without notice nor a vote of the members. (See FAC ¶¶ 67-87.) Defendants
argue that Plaintiff cannot maintain this cause of action because he is no
longer an owner of property within the development. Under section 5975 of the
Davis-Stirling Act, an association’s covenants and restrictions “may be
enforced by any owner of a separate interest or by the association, or by both.
(Civ. Code § 5975(a).) As the Court of Appeal has stated, “[o]ne who no longer
owns land in a development subject to reciprocal restrictions cannot enforce
them, absent showing the original covenant parties intended to allow
enforcement by one who is not a landowner.” (Farber v. Bay View
Terrace Homeowners Assn. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1007, 1011, citing B.C.E.
Development, Inc. v. Smith (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1142, 1147-48.) According
to the evidence presented by Defendants, Plaintiff was foreclosed upon with
respect to his original unit, Unit B, in July 2023. (Separate Statement of
Undisputed Material Fact No. 12.) Moreover, although Plaintiff was granted
equitable title to Unit A subject to his ability to complete the terms of a
land sale contract in a separate action, he did not comply with those terms.
(SSUMF No. 14.) An order for Plaintiff’s ejectment from Unit A was issued on
October 24, 2024. (Order for Ejectment filed October 24, 2024, Case No.
22STCV20402.) Thus, Defendants contend Plaintiff’s ownership interest has
terminated, depriving him of standing to enforce the governing documents. As
Defendants have offered evidence tending to support this conclusion, the burden
shifts to Plaintiff to demonstrate a triable issue of fact either as to his
ownership or as to the intent of the covenanters to allow non-owners to enforce
the governing documents.
 
Plaintiff’s opposition asserts that
Defendant “cites no law” that a subsequent change of ownership terminates
Plaintiff’s right to maintain this action and baselessly asserts that the Court
has previously addressed this issue. Although Farber does not directly
address the consequence of a transfer of ownership with respect to ongoing
litigation, the language of the rule quoted above appears to address that
circumstance by its plain language. Moreover, Plaintiff offers no evidence that
he has maintained an ownership interest or that the governing documents contemplate
their enforcement by one who is not an owner. Plaintiff has entirely failed to
carry his burden to demonstrate a triable issue of fact, and Defendants are
therefore entitled to summary adjudication of this cause of action.
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Adjudication of the first cause of action is GRANTED.  
 
Second Through Seventh Causes of Action: Violation of
Civil Code Sections 5205; 5300; 5310; 5500; 5616; and 5806
 
            Defendants
move for summary adjudication of the second through seventh causes of action
for violation of Civil Code sections 5205; 5300; 5310; 5500; 5616; and 5806,
arguing that Plaintiff does not have standing to enforce these provisions
because he is no longer an owner. As Defendants state, only owners have
standing to seek redress for violations of the Davis-Stirling Act. (Martin
v. Bridgeport Community Assn. Inc. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1024, 1037 [tenant
does not have standing to enforce Davis-Stirling Act because the Act conveys
rights upon owners].) Thus, the same evidence which tends to establish that
Plaintiff cannot prevail on the first cause of action carries that same burden
for these claims. (See SSUMF Nos. 17, 22; Order for Ejectment filed October 24,
2024, Case No. 22STCV20402.) The burden of proof therefore shifts to Plaintiff
to demonstrate a triable issue of fact.
 
            As
Plaintiff offers the same conclusory, unsupported assertions in defense of
these causes of action as with the first cause of action, Plaintiff does not
offer evidence demonstrating a triable issue of fact in this respect.
Defendants are therefore entitled to summary adjudication of these causes of
action. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion for Summary Adjudication of the second through seventh
causes of action is GRANTED.
 
//
 
//
Eighth Cause of Action: Fraud
 
            Defendants
move for summary adjudication of the eighth cause of action for fraud.
 
“The elements of fraud that will lead to a tort action are:
(a) misrepresentation; (b) knowledge of falsity; (c) intent to defraud, i.e.,
to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage. (Engalla
v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 974.) Every
element of the cause of action for fraud must be alleged in the proper
manner and the facts constituting the fraud must be alleged with sufficient
specificity to allow defendant[s] to understand fully the nature of the charge
made. (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73.) “This
particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.”
(Ibid.) “[G]eneral and conclusory allegations do not suffice.” (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)
 
Plaintiff alleges that he was
defrauded by the individual Defendants into paying $15,894 in past due
assessments which were not actually owed based on their false representations
that they were the legitimately elected Board of Directors. (FAC ¶¶ 132-140.) Defendants
contend that this cause of action lacks merit because Plaintiff cannot
establish either justifiable reliance or resultant damage. With respect to
damages, Defendants contend that the undisputed facts show that Plaintiff paid
only $1,250 in fees and current dues, with the remaining $14,644 in back dues
paid by the seller of Unit B, not Plaintiff. This contention is not sufficient
to prove an absence of damages, as the basis for liability is that Defendants
had no right to any of that money. (FAC ¶ 137.) “The function of the pleadings
in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the
function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any
triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-82.)
Defendants have not demonstrated their entitlement to summary adjudication on
this basis. 
 
            As to
justifiable reliance, Defendants contend that Plaintiff admitted in deposition
that he never considered the election of the new Board of Directors as
legitimate. (See SSUMF No. 61; Defendants’ Exh. K [Deposition of Plaintiff]
Vol. II pp. 86:20-94:8.) However, close reading of that deposition reveals that
Plaintiff did not testify to his knowledge at the time of the allegations, but
rather to his then-current understanding, as of January 2024. (Id.)
Defendants’ evidence therefore fails to demonstrate the absence of justifiable
reliance by Plaintiff on Defendants’ representations. Defendants are therefore
not entitled to summary adjudication on this basis.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion for Summary Adjudication of the eighth cause of action is
DENIED.
 
//
 
Ninth Cause of Action: Conversion
 
            Defendants move for summary adjudication of the ninth cause of action for
conversion. 
 
To state a claim for conversion, a
plaintiff must plead “(1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of
the property; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or disposition
of property rights; and (3) damages.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th
1225, 1240.) 
 
Plaintiff’s conversion claim alleges that Defendants wrongfully took
possession of $15,894 in Plaintiff’s money by falsely asserting that he owed
that money to the HOA. (FAC ¶¶ 144-46.) Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot
prevail on this cause of action because he only paid $1,250 in fees and current
dues. This contention does not defeat Plaintiff’s allegation that Defendants
had no right to any of that money. “The function of the pleadings in a
motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function
of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable
issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County
of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc.
v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-82.) Defendants have not
demonstrated their entitlement to summary adjudication on this basis. 
 
            Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Adjudication of the ninth cause of action is DENIED.
 
Tenth Cause of
Action: Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations
 
            Defendants move for summary
adjudication of the tenth cause of action for intentional interference with
contractual relations on the same basis as the ninth cause of action.
Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Adjudication of the tenth cause of action is DENIED.
 
Eleventh Cause of
Action: Breach of Governing Documents
 
            Defendants move for summary
adjudication of the eleventh cause of action for breach of governing documents
against the individual Defendants on the same grounds as the first cause of
action. Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Adjudication on the eleventh cause of action is GRANTED. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment
is DENIED.
 
            Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Judgment is DENIED.
 
            Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Adjudication is GRANTED IN PART as to the first through seventh and eleventh
causes of action and otherwise DENIED.
 
            Moving parties to give notice.
