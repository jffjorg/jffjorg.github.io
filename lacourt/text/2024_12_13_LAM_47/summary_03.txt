And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, 6230 Yucca Urban Housing, LLC, moves to dissolve the preliminary injunction entered on March 6, 2024, which enjoins the defendants from attempting to remove the plaintiff, Harris Shukran, from the subject property. The defendant argues that the injunction does not require the posting of an undertaking and that it inadvertently precludes otherwise lawful activity outside the scope of the disputed allegations. The defendant also presents evidence that the plaintiff abandoned the rental unit as of September 10, 2024. The court grants the defendant's motion for dissolution of the injunction, finding that the defendant is entitled to dissolution based on both the factual record and legal authority.
