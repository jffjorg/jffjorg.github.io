STATEMENT

            This is a civil rights action that was filed on December 13, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants are attempting to evict him from his rental unit under
color of a judgment in an unlawful detainer action which Plaintiff contends is
invalid. 
 
            Defendant

entered on March 6, 2024. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Defendant
6230 Yucca Urban Housing, LLC’s Motion for Dissolution of
Injunction is GRANTED.
 
DISCUSSION:
 
            Defendant
6230 Yucca Urban Housing, LLC moves to dissolve the preliminary injunction
entered on March 6, 2024. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 533 states:
 
In any action, the court may on notice
modify or dissolve an injunction or temporary restraining order upon a showing
that there has been a material change in the facts upon which the injunction or
temporary restraining order was granted, that the law upon which the injunction
or temporary restraining order was granted has changed, or that the ends of
justice would be served by the modification or dissolution of the injunction or
temporary restraining order.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 533.) Modification of a preliminary
injunction “rests in the sound discretion of the trial court upon a
consideration of all the particular circumstances of each individual case.” (Union
Interchange, Inc. v. Savage (1959) 52 Cal.2d 601, 606.) The party seeking
modification has the burden of proving that the request is justified. (See Loeffler
v. Medina (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1504.) 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
moves for dissolution of the March 6, 2024 order enjoining Defendants from
attempting to remove Plaintiff from the subject property. Defendant offers
multiple bases for this motion, chief among these that the Court’s order, as
written, did not require Plaintiff to post an undertaking pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 529, and, further, precludes Defendants from regaining
possession of the unit notwithstanding that Plaintiff has apparently abandoned
the property. 
 
            Defendant
offers evidence that Plaintiff had abandoned his residence at the subject
property as of September 10, 2024. (Declaration of Kyle Kunz ISO Mot. ¶¶ 5-8.)  As Defendant states, the language of the
Court’s March 6, 2024 order precludes “any action” to remove Plaintiff from the
property, inadvertently encompassing otherwise lawful activity outside the
scope of the disputed allegations. (March 6, 2024 Minute Order.) Moreover, the injunction
does not require the posting of an undertaking, which entitles Defendant to its
dissolution as a matter of law. (Neumann v. Moretti (1905) 146 Cal. 31, 33-34.)
Thus, on both the factual record and legal authority, Defendant is entitled to
dissolution of the injunction. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant 6230 Yucca Urban Housing, LLC’s Motion for Dissolution
of Injunction is GRANTED.
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
