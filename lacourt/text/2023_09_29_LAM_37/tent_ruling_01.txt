Background
 
This action arises in connection with the employment of Paula
Salvador (“Defendant”) by Gheorghe Firescu and Gabriela Firescu (“Plaintiffs”). Plaintiffs allege Defendant acted
fraudulently in using an allegedly false identity, committed conversion,
defamed Plaintiffs, and caused emotional distress to Plaintiffs. In their
Complaint, Plaintiffs reference on several occasions the pending underlying
litigation brought by Defendant against Plaintiffs for several employment
causes of action, Case No. 19STCV35570. in the County of Los Angeles Superior
Court (“Underlying Action”). 
 
Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges the following causes of
action: (1) Forgery and Identity Theft; Violation of California Penal Code §
530.5(b-c); (2) Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation; (3) Conversion and Civil
Theft; (4) Fraud and Constructive Fraud and Deceit, (Civ. Code, § 1572;
1709-1710); (5) Defamation (libel & slander; Civ. Code, §§ 43,45, 46); (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress; and (7) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
Defendant
brought a Special Motion to Strike the Complaint pursuant to CCP § 425.16. On May 22, 2023, the court granted the
motion and found that Plaintiff was entitled to attorney’s fees as the
prevailing party on the anti-SLAPP motion. 
 
On September 01, 2023, the Defendant
brought a Motion for Attorney’s fees. Plaintiffs oppose the Motion. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to CCP § 425.16(c), a
prevailing defendant is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs
associated with the motion. Under CRC, rule 3.1702, a request for attorneys’
fees must be made within 180 days of service of the notice of entry of
judgment or “within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104
and 8.108 in an unlimited civil case[.]” A defendant may only recover fees and
costs related to the motion to strike. (Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v.
Chronicle Publishing Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383.) This includes
fees associated with bringing the motion for fees. (Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1141 (“an award of fees may include not only the fees
incurred with respect to the underlying claim, but also the fees incurred in
enforcing the right to mandatory fees under Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16.”).) Additionally, “[a]ny fee award must also include those incurred on
appeal. [Citation.]” (Trapp v. Naiman¿(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 113,
122.)¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
A.        Defendant’s Motion is Timely
 
The deadline for filing a motion for attorney’s
fees is mandatory.¿(Community Youth Athletic Center v. City of National City
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1444.) Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s Motion is untimely as it
was not filed within 60 days pursuant to CRC, rules 3.1702 and 8.104. Under
rule 8.104(a)(1), a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest
of:¿ 
 
(A)
60 days after the superior court clerk serves on the party filing the notice of
appeal a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a filed-endorsed
copy of the judgment, showing the date either was served;¿ 
 
(B)
60 days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a
party with a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a
filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, accompanied by proof of service; or¿ 
 
(C)
180 days after entry of judgment.¿(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.104(a)(1).)¿
 
Here,
no appeal has been filed, and no Notice of Entry of Judgment has been served.
Plaintiffs have only filed a Notice of Dismissal as to this action. Therefore,
Defendant’s Motion is timely. 
 
Moreover,
the court finds that Defendant’s proof of service is not defective and was
signed under penalty of perjury and was timely served on Plaintiffs pursuant to
CCP § 1005(b). 
 
B.        Motion for Attorney’s Fees
 
“A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a
touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time
spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the
presentation of the case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court
may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or
duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.)
 
Defendant’s Notice of Motion fails to
state the amount of attorney’s fees and costs requested. Defendant’s Motion
only states that she seeks fees for 32.4 hours of work, billed at an hourly
rate of $550.00 per hour, and $604.62 in costs. (Sirmabekian Decl. ¶¶ 12, 17,
20, Ex. B, C.) On reply, Defense counsel specifies they seek $18,424.62 in
fees. (Reply at 1:23-25.) An
omission in the notice may be overlooked if the supporting papers make clear
the grounds for the relief sought. (Carrasco v. Craft (1985) 164
Cal.App.3d 796, 807-808; 366-388 Geary St., L.P. v. Superior Court (1990)
219 Cal.App.3d 1186.) The purpose of the notice requirement is to cause the
moving party to “sufficiently define the issues for the information and
attention of the adverse party and the court.” (Hernandez v. National Dairy
Products (1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 490, 493.)
 
The Notice of Motion requires that the
moving party specify the grounds for the relief requested and Defendant’s
Motion sufficiently gave the Plaintiffs notice that Defendant sought attorney’s
fees in the amount of $18,424.62 (32.4 hours x $550.00/hour = $17,820.00 +
$604.62 (costs) = $18,424.62). Seeing no prejudice to the Plaintiffs in
Defendant’s failure to state the exact amount of fees sought, the court
proceeds to address the Motion on the merits. 
 
i.          Reasonable Hourly
Rates
 
The
burden is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove that the fees it seeks
are reasonable. (See Vines
v. O'Reilly Auto Enterprises, LLC (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 174, 184.) But
“‘[i]n challenging attorney
fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden
of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a
sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees
claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.’” (Lunada Biomedical, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th
at p. 488, citing Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)
 
Defense counsel asserts that their
hourly rate of $550.00 per hour is reasonable based on over eleven (11) years
of experience representing employees in employment-related disputes and is a
comparable rate requested by and awarded to other attorneys with similar
experience, background, and achievement. (Sirmabekian Decl. ¶¶ 15, 17, 18.) 
The court finds that the defense
counsel’s hours are reasonable. 
 
            ii.         Reasonable Hours Spent
 
Defense counsel asserts he spent 32.4
hours working on tasks related to the anti-SLAPP motion and provides a detailed
timesheet. (Sirmabekian Decl. ¶¶ 12, 13, Ex. B.) Plaintiffs make no opposition
to the hours billed by Defense counsel. Having reviewed the Defense counsel’s
billing entries, the court finds that the hours billed were reasonable and no
deductions are warranted. 
 
Therefore, the court finds that
Defendant is entitled to $17,820.00 in attorney’s fees for 32.4 hours of work
spent on matters related to the anti-SLAPP motion. 
 
                        iii.       Request for Costs
 
Pursuant to CCP § 425.16(c)(1),
Defendant is also entitled to recover costs. Defendant seeks to recover costs
in the amount of $604.62, as outlined in Exhibit C of the Declaration of Sarkis Sirmabekian. The costs include
court fees, delivery service/messengers, and postage fees related to the
anti-SLAPP motion. (Sirmabekian Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. C.)
 
The court finds the costs incurred are
allowable and reasonable. 
 

 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s Motion for attorney’s
fees and costs in the amount of $18,424.62 is granted.
