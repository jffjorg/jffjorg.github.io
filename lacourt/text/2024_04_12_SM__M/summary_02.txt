Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants. The defendants contend that the plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement covering the plaintiff's medical battery, malpractice, and negligent hiring claims. However, the plaintiff denies signing the agreement and presents evidence that the defendants' evidence is not credible. The defendants fail to meet their burden of showing the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. The judge finds that the defendants' evidence, including the declaration of Dr. Taheri, is insufficient to demonstrate that the electronic signature was the act of the plaintiff. The judge also finds that the defendants' evidence is not credible, including testimony from a former employee of the medical practice regarding the practice of falsifying consent and other patient forms. Therefore, the motion is denied.
