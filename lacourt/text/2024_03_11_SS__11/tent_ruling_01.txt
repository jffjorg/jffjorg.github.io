TENTATIVE RULING
 
Prelitigation Notice
 
The hearing is continued for supplemental briefing.
 
Summons and Complaint
 
The motion to quash is granted, and the complaint is dismissed without
prejudice.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a putative class
action.  The complaint alleges that Nutra
falsely advertises that its diet product – Lean PM Fat Burner and Sleep Support
– supports weight loss.  Plaintiff claims
the alleged conduct violates the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”).
 
Here, Nutra moves to quash
service of summons and to dismiss the complaint.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Facts
 
The following facts are relevant:
 
* Canada is a signatory to the
Hague Convention.
 
* Defendant is a Canadian
company.  
 
* Plaintiff sent the CLRA
prelitigation notice to Defendant’s legal department in Canada by Federal
Express (“FedEx”).
 
* Stephen Winter is a Canadian
attorney.  He is a partner in the Stewart
McKelvey law firm, which has represented Defendant at times.
 
* Plaintiff served the summons
and complaint on Winter in Canada via personal service.
 
Prelitigation Notice
 
First, Defendant contends the
motion should be granted as to Plaintiff’s CLRA prelitigation notice because
the Hague Convention and California law do not allow service by FedEx.  (See Motion, pp. 6-7, 11.)
 
Plaintiff disagrees.  She claims FedEx is an appropriate postal
channel under Article 10(a) of the Hague Convention.  (See Opposition, pp. 6-7.)
 
The hearing is continued as to
this issue.  “Article 10(a) permits the
‘sending’ of judicial documents by mail to persons abroad ‘provided the State
of destination does not object.’”  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 4:329.)  “Thus,
in cases governed by the Hague
Convention, service by mail is permissible so long as the receiving state has
not objected to service by mail and service by mail is authorized under
otherwise applicable law.”  (Ibid.)  There is no assertion that Canada objects to
service by mail, so the next question is whether service via FedEx is
authorized.  Under the Hague Convention,
whether a particular postal channel may be utilized depends on the law of the
forum state – here, California law.  (See
Inversiones Papaluchi S.A.S. v. Superior Court (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th
1055, 1066 (“Inversiones”.) 
Defendant cites Inversiones for the proposition that California
law bars use of FedEx.  There, the
document at issue was a summons served in Colombia.  The Second District Court of Appeal found
that California law did not permit service by FedEx in that context.  The analysis focused specifically on Code of
Civil Procedure section 413.10(c), which expressly pertains to service of a
summons outside the United States.  Is
there a California case that renders section 413.10(c) applicable to
prelitigation notices as well?  If not,
what is the particular California rule or statute that governs the
circumstances here?  The Court orders the
parties to provide supplemental briefs to answer these questions.
 
Second, Defendant asserts that the motion should be
granted because Plaintiff failed to send the prelitigation notice to “an
officer or authorized agent[.]”  (Motion,
p. 12.)  
 
The analysis is the same.  Defendant’s authorities appear to regard
service of a summons on a corporation.  The
parties’ supplemental briefs should discuss whether these rules – or other
rules – apply to service of a prelitigation notice.
 
Third, Plaintiff claims the Hague
Convention only governs service of process. 
She contends a CLRA prelitigation notice, by contrast, merely needs to
be sent, not served.  (See id. at pp.
7-8.) 
 
The Court disagrees. 
The Hague Convention applies “in all cases, in civil and commercial
matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial
document for service abroad.”  (Rockefeller
Technology Investments (Asia) VII v. Changzhou SinoType Tech. Co. (2020) 9
Cal.5th 125, 137.)  A
prelitigation notice at least qualifies as an extrajudicial document.  
 
Fourth, Plaintiff contends the
service substantially complied with Civil Code section 1782.  (See Opposition, pp. 8-9.)
 
The Court disagrees.  The CLRA requires a prelitigation notice “to
be in writing sent by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, to the place where the transaction
occurred, such person's principal place of business within California, or, if
neither will effect actual notice, the office of the Secretary of State of
California.”  (Stern, Business &
Professions Code Section 17200 Practice (The Rutter Group March 2023 Update) ¶
10:58.)  Plaintiff admits that she used
FedEx instead of certified mail, return receipt requested.  (See Opposition, p. 8.)  
 
Fifth, Plaintiff contends strict
compliance with section 1782 was impossible given that the transaction took
place in cyberspace.  (See id. at p. 9.)
 
The Court disagrees.  Plaintiff may have purchased the product from
the internet, but she clearly understood that she needed to send the
prelitigation notice to Defendant’s place of business in Canada.  Strict compliance was possible and would have
been accomplished if Plaintiff had used certified mail, return receipt
requested.  
 
Sixth, Plaintiff claims Defendant
waived its challenge to the prelitigation notice.  (See id. at pp. 10-11.)
 
The Court disagrees in part.
Plaintiff’s evidence of waiver is two letters from defense counsel that were
sent to Plaintiff’s counsel after Plaintiff sent the prelitigation notice.  The first letter simply states that defense
counsel are awaiting instructions from Defendant and will further communicate
with Plaintiff’s counsel once the instructions are received.  (See Ferrell Decl., Ex. B, p. 2.)  At the end of the second letter, defense
counsel states that the letter “is not intended to, and should not be construed
in any way as, waiver of [Defendant’s] rights to object to the defective
service of the notice and the summons and complaint[.]”  (Id. at Ex. C, p. 14.)  These facts are different than the facts in Outboard
Marine Corp. v. Superior Court (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 30 where the defense
counsel’s letter said: “We have reviewed your letter of October 11, 1974, which
we received on October 21, 1974, and which we are treating as a preliminary
notice and demand under California Civil Code 1782a.”  (Outboard Marine, supra, 52 Cal.App.3d
at 41.)
 
Nevertheless, the Court continues
the hearing as to this issue.  The
purpose of a prelitigation notice is to establish a 30-day period for pre-suit
settlements to occur.  (See Stern, supra,
at ¶ 10:57.)  Plaintiff sent the
prelitigation notice on March 23, 2023. 
(See Ferrell Decl., ¶ 2.)  Defense
counsel’s first response letter is dated August 15, 2023.  (See id. at Ex. B, p. 2.)  The second letter is dated November 17,
2023.  (See id. at Ex. C, p. 1.)  Both were sent well after the 30-day
period.  Is there a delay component that
should be considered in assessing waiver? 
The supplemental briefs should address this question.
 
In summary, the hearing is
continued for supplemental briefing on the FedEx and waiver issues.[1]
 
Summons and Complaint
 
Defendant contends the motion
should be granted as to the summons and complaint because Winter is not an
officer or authorized agent.  (See
Motion, pp. 7-8, 14-18.)
 
Plaintiff contends her process
server served Winter at Defendant’s registered address, and the service
substantially complied with due process. 
(See Opposition, pp. 13-17.)
 
The Court agrees with Defendant.  The parties agree that personal service is
allowed in Canada under the Hague Convention. 
The key question, though, is whether Plaintiff complied with the
personal-service rules.  Winter states
that he is not an officer, employee, or in-house counsel of Defendant.  (See Winter Decl., ¶ 2.)  His declaration tends to show that he is not
a proper person to serve to effectuate personal service on Defendant under
either California law or Canada law. 
(See Motion, p. 17 [citing Code of Civil Procedure section 416.10,
Corporations Code section 2110, and Rule 6.02 of the Civil Rules of the Supreme
Court of Newfoundland and Labrador]; see also Reply, pp. 9-11.)  This part of the motion is granted, and the
complaint is dismissed without prejudice. 
(See Kott v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th
1126, 1136 [instructing in a case involving a Canadian defendant that
“[f]ailure to comply with the Hague Service Convention procedures voids the
service” “even where the defendant had actual notice of the defendant”].)
