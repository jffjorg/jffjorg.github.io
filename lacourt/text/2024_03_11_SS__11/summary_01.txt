* "Article 10(a) permits the 'sending' of judicial documents by mail to persons abroad 'provided the State of destination does not object.'"
* "Thus, in cases governed by the Hague Convention, service by mail is permissible so long as the receiving state has not objected to service by mail and service by mail is authorized under otherwise applicable law."
* "The Court disagrees. The Hague Convention applies 'in all cases, in civil and commercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.'"
* "Plaintiff's evidence of waiver is two letters from defense counsel that were sent to Plaintiff's counsel after Plaintiff sent the prelitigation notice."
