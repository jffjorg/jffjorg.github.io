Defendant contends the Court must dismiss the CLRA damages claim with prejudice
if it ends up finding the prelitigation notice defective.  (See, e.g., Reply, pp. 6-8.)  The Court disagrees.  Morgan v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc.
(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1235 is a Second District decision.  It holds that the dismissal should be without
prejudice, and Plaintiff should be granted leave to resend the prelitigation
notice after the complaint is filed.
