The court has noted several defects in the plaintiff's application, including the lack of a copy of the assignment, and has set an order to show cause for default judgment for September 29, 2023.

The Judge's tentative ruling denies ODK Capital, LLC's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice due to several defects. On October 11, 2021, Charles Cooper and Celtic Bank entered into a Business Loan and Security Agreement, with Cooper executing a personal guaranty. Celtic subsequently assigned its rights, title, and interest under the agreement to ODK Capital, LLC. However, Cooper has failed to make required payments.

On December 9, 2022, ODK Capital, LLC filed a complaint asserting a breach of contract cause of action against Cooper and Does 1-10. On July 28, 2023, Cooper's default was entered, and an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is set for September 29, 2023.

The Judge notes several defects in the Plaintiff's Application for Default Judgment. ODK Capital, LLC's custodian of records, Cathleen Pugh, attests that the claim was assigned to ODK Capital, LLC, but Pugh has failed to provide the court with a copy of the assignment. As a result, the Judge denies the application without prejudice.
