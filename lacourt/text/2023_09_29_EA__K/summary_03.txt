And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied ODK Capital, LLC's application for default judgment against Charles Cooper without prejudice. The main reason for this denial is that the plaintiff's custodian of records, Cathleen Pugh, has not provided the court with a copy of the assignment from Celtic Bank to ODK Capital, LLC, despite claiming that Celtic Bank assigned the claim to the plaintiff. The court has noted several defects in the plaintiff's application, including the lack of a copy of the assignment, and has set an order to show cause for default judgment for September 29, 2023.
