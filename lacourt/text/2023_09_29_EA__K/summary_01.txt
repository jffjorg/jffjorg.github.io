Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies the Defendant LVGEM Hotel Corporation's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and the Plaintiffs' Zia Abhari and Amir Shamloo's Motion to Vacate a Null and Void Disposition. The Defendant sought a preliminary injunction to order the Plaintiffs to vacate Hamilton's Steakhouse, restrain them from entering the premises, and turn over certain financial information. The Judge found that the relief sought is mandatory in character and that the Defendant has not established that the right to an injunction is clearly established. The Judge also denied the Plaintiffs' motion to vacate the court's previous ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike brought by the Defendant, as the motion was legally unsupported and failed to provide any statutory or other legal authority to challenge the court's tentative ruling.

The Judge denied the Defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction, which would have required the Plaintiffs to vacate Hamilton's Steakhouse and turn over financial information.

The Judge also denied the Plaintiffs' motion to vacate a previous ruling that dismissed some of their claims. The Plaintiffs argued that the previous ruling was wrong, but the Judge found that they had not provided any legal basis for challenging the ruling.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for preliminary injunction filed by LVGEM Hotel Corporation and Gordes Hospitality, Inc. (collectively, "Defendants"). The Defendants sought to compel Plaintiffs Zia Abhari and Amir Shamloo to vacate Hamilton's Steakhouse, refrain from entering the property, and turn over certain financial information. The judge found that the relief sought by the Defendants is mandatory in character and requires the court to change the status quo, which is not justified. The judge also noted that the Defendants have not established that the right to an injunction is "clearly established."

Additionally, the judge has denied the motion to vacate the null and void disposition of the court's ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike brought by the Defendants. The Plaintiffs had sought to challenge the court's tentative ruling, but the judge found that the Plaintiffs failed to provide any statutory or other legal authority to support their motion.

The defendant's motion for preliminary injunction is denied, and the plaintiff's motion to vacate a null and void disposition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(d) is also denied.
