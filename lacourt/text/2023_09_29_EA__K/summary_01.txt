Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies the Defendant LVGEM Hotel Corporation's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and the Plaintiffs' Zia Abhari and Amir Shamloo's Motion to Vacate a Null and Void Disposition. The Defendant sought a preliminary injunction to order the Plaintiffs to vacate Hamilton's Steakhouse, restrain them from entering the premises, and turn over certain financial information. The Judge found that the relief sought is mandatory in character and that the Defendant has not established that the right to an injunction is clearly established. The Judge also denied the Plaintiffs' motion to vacate the court's previous ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike brought by the Defendant, as the motion was legally unsupported and failed to provide any statutory or other legal authority to challenge the court's tentative ruling.
