STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On June 14, 2022, Plaintiff DB Insurance Company LTD
(Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendant City of Los Angeles (Defendant)
for subrogation. According to the Complaint, Plaintiff investigated a property
damage claim due to LAPD’s removal of explosives/fireworks from a property
neighboring Plaintiff’s insured’s property. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is
responsible for the loss and seeks recovery of sums Plaintiff paid to its
insured.
 
On September 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed a request for entry
of default against Defendant which was entered that same date.
 
On September 30, 2022, the court held a Case Management
Conference and found the proof of service invalid.
 
On October 17, 2022, Defendant filed an Answer and a
Cross-Complaint.
 
On January 18, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation to Set
Aside Default which the court GRANTED.
 
On January 25, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer and a
Cross-Complaint.
 
On April 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint, which was rejected.
 
On December 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for
leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC). Oppositions were due on or
before February 28, 2024. As of March 6, 2024, Defendant has not filed an opposition
with the court.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 473,
subdivision (a)(1) provides, in relevant part: “The court may, in furtherance
of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any
pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by
correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect;
and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer.¿ The court
may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon
any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.”¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“This discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of
amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in
the same lawsuit.”¿ (Kittredge Sports Co.
v. Superior Court¿(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)¿ Ordinarily, the court
will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a
motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike are
premature.¿ The court, however, does have discretion to deny leave to amend
where a proposed amendment fails to state a valid cause of action as a matter
of law and the defect cannot be cured by further amendment.¿ (See¿California Casualty General Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court¿(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281 (overruled on other grounds
by¿Kransco¿v. American Empire Surplus
Lines Ins. Co.¿(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Under California Rules of Court Rule (CRC), rule 3.1324,
subdivision (a), a motion to amend a pleading shall (1) include a copy of the
proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are located;
and (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading,
if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional
allegations are located.¿¿  
 
Under California Rule of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivision (b),
a separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify (1) the
effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)
when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)
the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.¿¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff seeks to amend the Complaint to change the damages
amount from $98,574.29 to $121,735.52. Defendant has not filed an opposition.
Here, Plaintiff substantially complied with CRC, rule
3.1324. Plaintiff included a copy of the proposed FAC, identified the proposed
change to the previous pleading and amended pleading. As to the attorney
declaration, Plaintiff indicates that the only change is to the damages amount
due to incurring additional damages. There are no new facts or allegations
proposed.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for
leave to amend the complaint. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.Motion for Leave to File First
Amended Complaint is GRANTED.
2.The Proposed First Amended
Complaint attached to the Proposed Order is deemed filed this date.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
