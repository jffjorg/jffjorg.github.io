* "Equitable indemnity principles govern the allocation of loss or damages among multiple tortfeasors whose liability for the underlying injury is joint and several."

English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on an Amended Demurrer to Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Defendant Chloe Rogers-Brown. The Cross-Complaint was filed by Defendant Rose Mehr against Cross-Defendants Chloe Rogers-Brown and others, asserting causes of action for equitable indemnity, partial indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief. The Demurrer argues that the Cross-Complaint is defective because it does not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the cause brought against Mehr in the underlying action. The Judge finds that the Demurrer is improper and overrules it, holding that a party can file a cross-complaint against a co-tortfeasor asserting indemnity claims arising from indivisible injuries. The Judge grants the Cross-Defendant's request for judicial notice of the complaint Plaintiff filed in another case and finds that the Cross-Complaint is proper. The Amended Demurrer is therefore overruled.
