And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike punitive damages and attorney fees allegations from a complaint filed by plaintiff Mireya B. De La Rosa Gallegos against defendants Trukman Enterprises, Inc., Ultimate Express Moving, Jose Antonio Cabrera, and Joshua B. Quijano.

The motion was filed by the defendants, who argue that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute oppression, fraud, or malice, and that the punitive damages allegations are therefore not warranted. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the complaint adequately alleges facts sufficient to justify punitive damages.

The judge grants the motion to strike the punitive damages allegations with regard to the corporate defendants, Trukman and Ultimate, finding that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute oppression, fraud, or malice on their part. The judge also grants the motion to strike the punitive damages allegations with regard to Defendant Quijano, finding that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to warrant punitive damages against him.

Furthermore, the judge grants the motion to strike the prayer for attorney's fees, expenses, and costs, finding that the plaintiff has not alleged a statutory or contractual basis for her request for attorney's fees.

Finally, the judge grants leave to amend the complaint to cure defects, allowing the plaintiff to revise the complaint to address the issues raised by the motion to strike.
