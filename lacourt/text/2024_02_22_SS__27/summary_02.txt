English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by defendants CLG Management, LLC and R2 Lofts, LP against Robles Glass & Supplies, Inc. The motion is granted. The defendants intend to file a cross-complaint against Robles Glass because they believe that the latter is responsible for the installation of the blinds that allegedly fell on the plaintiff's head, causing injury. The plaintiff argues that the defendants have unduly delayed in bringing the motion and that it will prejudice him. The defendants argue that they have been communicating with the plaintiff regarding their intention to file a cross-complaint and that they are not seeking a trial continuance. The court finds that the prejudice arguments are unpersuasive and grants the motion, ordering the defendants to file their cross-complaint within 10 calendar days.
