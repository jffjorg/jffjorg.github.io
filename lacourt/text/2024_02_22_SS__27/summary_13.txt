The Judge's tentative ruling grants Lyft, Inc.'s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings as to Plaintiff Edward Madrid. The Plaintiff filed a Complaint for negligence/negligence per se on November 16, 2023, following an automobile collision on July 15, 2022, in which the Plaintiff was riding as a passenger while the driver was driving for Lyft, Inc. The Motion is targeted at the agreement between Lyft, Inc. and the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the Motion. The Judge finds that a valid arbitration agreement exists between Lyft, Inc. and the Plaintiff, and that the Plaintiff has refused to arbitrate the controversy by filing a lawsuit. The Judge grants the Motion, but only as between Lyft, Inc. and the Plaintiff, and does not affect the claims of the other parties involved.
