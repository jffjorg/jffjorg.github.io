Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to quash Defendant's subpoenas for Plaintiff's medical records. The Judge orders that the subpoenas be limited to the past ten years and only to Plaintiff's left leg and knee injury. The Judge finds that Defendant has not shown a compelling need for unlimited medical records and that Plaintiff has established a legally protected privacy interest in his medical records. The Judge also finds that Defendant's reliance on case law is misplaced and that the right to privacy is not absolute. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff's motion is granted and that the subpoenas will be limited as specified.
