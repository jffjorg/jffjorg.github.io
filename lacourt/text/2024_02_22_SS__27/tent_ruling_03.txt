[1] “Code of Civil Procedure section 474 … permits unknown
defendants to be sued originally under fictitious names with their true names
substituted when ascertained.” (Breceda v. Gamsby (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d
167, 168.) Here, Plaintiff amended the Complaint to substitute two defendants
for Doe 1. The Court is unclear whether that was a mistake and whether the Plaintiff
intended for one of the defendants to be Doe 2. 
If it is a mistake, Plaintiff should correct it.
