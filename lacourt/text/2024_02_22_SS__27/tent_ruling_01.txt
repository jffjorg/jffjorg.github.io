RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Antonio De La Cruz Zamora
(“Plaintiff”) 
 
 
 
I.           
INTRODUCTION
On
October 5, 2020, Plaintiff Antonio De La Cruz Zamora (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against Defendants County of Los Angeles (“County”), James Paul Furtsch
(collectively “Defendants”) and DOES 1 to 30, alleging causes of action for:
(1) motor vehicle, (2) general negligence, and (3) Government Code sections
815.2(a) and 820(a). 
On
December 7, 2021, Defendant County filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
On
March 17, 2022, Defendant County filed a Notice of Related Case indicating that
the instant action was related to Ontiveros v. County of Los Angeles, et
al., LASC Case No. 20STCV48053 (the “Ontiveros Action”). On March 21, 2022,
the Court deemed the instant action and the Ontiveros Action as related with
the instant action being deemed the lead case. (03/21/22 Minute Order.) 
On
January 4, 2024, Defendant County filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition and for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his attorneys of
record, Dean Hakkak and First Law Group APC, in the amount of $2,000.00 (the
“Motion”). Defendant County requests that Plaintiff appear for deposition on
February 29, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. at 5001 Airport Plaza Drive, Suite 240, Long
Beach, CA 90815. 
On
February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served an opposition to the Motion, which
only consists of a declaration from his counsel, Eric A. Forstrom. On February
15, 2024, Defendant County filed and served a reply brief. 
Defendant
County argues that the opposition should be disregarded due to untimeliness.
While the opposition is untimely, the Court exercises its discretion and will
consider the opposition. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1300(d).) 
Non-Jury
Trial is scheduled to begin on April 18, 2024. 
 
II.    LEGAL STANDARD 
          “The service
of a deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to require any
deponent who is a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent,
or employee of a party to attend and to testify, as well as produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) 
“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action . . . without having served a valid objection . .
. fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
III.    DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer 
          A motion to
compel deponent testimony “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produced the documents, electronically stored information, or
other things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that
the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450.) A meet and confer declaration in support of a
motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
          Here, Allen
L. Thomas (“Thomas”), counsel for Defendant County, declares that on January 19,
2023, a deposition notice was served to take Plaintiff’s deposition on February
10, 2023. (Thomas Decl., p. 10:8-10; Exhibit 1.) On January 27, 2023, Marlena
Martinez at First Law Group sent an electronic communication stating that they
may not have coverage for the unilaterally noticed deposition date. (Thomas
Decl., p. 10:12-14.) Plaintiff’s counsel’s office indicated that they were not available
for a unilaterally noticed deposition date and that they would choose a date in
March that was agreeable with all parties. (Thomas Decl., p. 10:17-18.) Thomas
declares that his office “notified Ms. Martinez on February 6, 2023, that the
deposition was off calendar” and invited Ms. Martinez to provide a few dates of
availability for the deposition, which Ms. Martinez provided. (Thomas Decl., p.
10:18-22.) Counsel states that on February 10, 2023, a notice of continuance of
Plaintiff’s deposition was served to take Plaintiff’s deposition on March 22, 2023,
but the deposition did not go forward because the parties sought and obtained a
trial continuance. (Thomas Decl., p. 10:23-28; Exhibit 2.) The parties
thereafter engaged in private mediation, which was unsuccessful. (Thomas Decl.,
p. 11:4-6.) Thomas then reached out to Plaintiff’s attorney, Dean Hakkak, to obtain
proposed deposition dates; however, Mr. Hakkak has not responded to counsel’s
correspondence or agreed to produce Plaintiff for a deposition. (Thomas Decl.,
p. 11:7-18.) 
          The Court finds
that the meet and confer requirement has been met. Counsel has set forth
efforts to depose Plaintiff. 
 
Issue No.1: Appropriateness of Compelling Plaintiff’s
Deposition
          The Court references
its recitation of counsel’s declaration as to the meet and confer process and
incorporates it herein. Defendant County cannot properly prepare for trial
without deposing Plaintiff. (Thomas Decl., p. 11:19-20.) 
In opposition to the Motion,
Plaintiff’s counsel, Eric A. Forstrom (“Forstrom”), states that Plaintiff
recently underwent surgery and was medically unavailable to sit for deposition.
(Forstrom Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) Forstrom states that despite Defendant County’s
implication, neither Plaintiff nor his counsel have refused to cooperate in the
scheduling of Plaintiff’s deposition. (Forstrom Decl., ¶ 4.) Forstrom declares
that Plaintiff is ready and willing to appear for his deposition within the
next 30 days. (Forstrom Decl., ¶ 5.) 
Plaintiff is agreeable to being deposed
by Defendant. Defendant has issued notices of deposition to Plaintiff, but the
deposition of Plaintiff has yet to occur. The Court therefore finds it
appropriate to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. Moreover, given that Plaintiff
has failed to file a memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to the
Motion, Plaintiff has conceded to Defendant County’s arguments raised in the
Motion. “Contentions are waived when a party fails to support them with
reasoned argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist.
v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) 
 
Issue No.2: Monetary Sanctions 
          If a motion
under Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(a) is granted “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) A court has discretion to fix the amount
of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v.
Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.)
Thomas declares that he spent three (3)
hours preparing the Motion and anticipates spending one (1) hour reading the
opposition and preparing a reply. (Thomas Decl., p. 11:21-23.) Thomas states
that he anticipates spending one (1) hour of attorney time attending the
hearing on the Motion. (Thomas Decl., p. 11:24-25.) A total of five (5) hours
was spent on the Motion at an hourly rate of $400.00 per hour. (Thomas Decl.,
p. 11:25-27.) Defendant County requests total monetary sanctions in the amount
of $2,000.00. (Thomas Decl., p. 11:27-28.)
          The Court
finds that monetary sanctions are appropriate. Exercising its discretion, the
Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant County’s request for monetary sanctions and
awards Defendant County reasonable monetary sanctions in the amount of $12000.00.
The Court reduces the award from the amount requested based on the
straightforward nature of the Motion and its relative brevity. Monetary
sanctions are to be paid by Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorneys of record, Dean
Hakkak and First Law Group APC, jointly and severally, to Defendant County
within 30 days of the date of notice of this order. 
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS Defendant County’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. Plaintiff is ORDERED to appear for
deposition on Thursday, February 29, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. at 5001 Airport Plaza
Drive, Suite 240, Long Beach, CA 90815, which is the location of the Thomas Law
Firm Incorporated. 
Defendant County’s request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorneys of record,
Dean Hakkak and First Law Group APC, are ORDERED to pay monetary sanctions,
jointly and severally, in the amount of $1200.00 to Defendant County within 30
days of the date of notice of this order. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
