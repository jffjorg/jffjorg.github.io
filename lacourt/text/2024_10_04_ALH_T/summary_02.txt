And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Ryan Thomas. The Plaintiff has attempted multiple times to depose Defendant Thomas, but has been unsuccessful due to Defendant Thomas' unresponsiveness. The Judge finds that there is good cause to compel the deposition, given that Defendant Thomas was the driver who allegedly caused the chain reaction collision. The Judge also grants the Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,664.50 against Defendant Thomas, which includes the costs of preparing and pursuing the motion, as well as a non-appearance fee. The Judge finds that an hourly billing rate of $450 is appropriate, rather than the $700 per hour rate requested by the Plaintiff.
