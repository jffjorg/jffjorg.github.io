And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendants' motion for summary judgment/adjudication. The Defendants argued that they had no legal duty to the Plaintiff to maintain and repair the public sidewalk, but failed to meet their burden of establishing that they did not exercise control over the subject property, did not maintain the subject property to the extent that might create a duty, or did not create the subject hazard. The Judge found that the Defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove that they did not owe a duty to the Plaintiff to maintain and repair the sidewalk, and that they did not establish that they did not maintain the sidewalk. As a result, the motion was denied.
