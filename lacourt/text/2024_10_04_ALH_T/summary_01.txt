And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, 4070 Venice LLC, has moved for summary judgment in this trip and fall case, alleging that it did not own, maintain, or control the public sidewalk where the plaintiff, Deborah McCree, tripped and fell. The plaintiff argues that there are triable issues of fact related to the defendant's alleged duty to maintain the sidewalk and the creation of the alleged dangerous condition. The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff. The case will proceed to a jury trial to determine whether the defendant was responsible for the plaintiff's injuries.
