And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment in a trip and fall case. The plaintiff, Cynthia Hopes, claims that she was injured when she tripped over an empty pallet left on the walkway at a Costco warehouse. The defendant, Costco Wholesale Corporation, argues that it had no knowledge of the pallet's presence and that it was not responsible for the plaintiff's injury. The judge finds that there are disputed issues of material fact regarding whether the defendant exercised reasonable care, whether it had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition, and whether it caused the plaintiff's injury. The judge concludes that a trial is necessary to resolve these issues.
