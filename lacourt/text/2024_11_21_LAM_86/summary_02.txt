And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the respondent Los Angeles County Assessment Appeals Board's motion to consolidate two cases: Jeffrey Prang v. Los Angeles County Assessment Appeals Board No. 1V (Case No. 24STCP01486) and Grand Pacific 8155, LLC v. County of Los Angeles (Case No. 24STCV11649). The two cases involve common questions of fact regarding the validity of ad valorem property tax assessed values. However, the judge has determined that the cases cannot be consolidated because they have not been related into a single department, and even if they had been, the Grand Pacific Action cannot be assigned to Department 86 because it is a writs and receivers department, and actions for refund of property taxes are not assigned to this department.
