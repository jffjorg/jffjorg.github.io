And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Ikspan, Inc.'s Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default is GRANTED. The judge has also OVERRULED Plaintiff Laurent Ruben's evidentiary objections. The judge found that Ikspan, Inc. did not have actual notice of the service of the summons and complaint and that its counsel, Maurice Pessah, made a mistake by advising Ikspan, Inc. not to respond to the service. The judge noted that Ikspan, Inc. did not file a responsive pleading and therefore, default was entered against it. The judge granted the motion subject to the condition that Ikspan, Inc. files a signed version of the declaration of counsel by November 22, 2024. The judge also imposed a $1,000 penalty against Maurice Pessah for his mistake.
