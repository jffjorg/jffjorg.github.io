And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition for relief from the claims filing statute filed by Ricardo Jose Nunez. Nunez was involved in a traffic collision on June 23, 2023, and hired counsel on June 24, 2023. Nunez filed claims with the City of Montebello and the County of Los Angeles, but failed to file within the six-month deadline. Nunez subsequently submitted applications for leave to present a late claim, but the respondents failed to respond within 45 days. Nunez argues that he was diligent in hiring counsel and that his counsel was reasonably diligent in discovering the available claims against the respondents. However, the judge finds that Nunez's counsel failed to conduct a reasonably prudent investigation of the circumstances of the accident and did not procure the traffic collision report until after the claim deadline had passed. Therefore, Nunez has not demonstrated the necessary mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect to obtain leave to file a late claim.
