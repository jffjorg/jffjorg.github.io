Case:               Ricardo Jose Nunez v. City of
Montebello (24STCP01859)
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner Ricardo Jose Nunez’s Petition for Relief from
Government Code § 945.4 is DENIED. 
 
According to petitioner, on June 23, 2023, at or near the
intersection of Duncan Ave. and 6th St. in Los Angeles, while
petitioner was waiting to make a left turn, a government-owned vehicle unsafely
passed petitioner and violently collided into petitioner’s vehicle. (Fradkin
Decl. ¶ 14 & Ex. 1.) Petitioner alleges he sustained injuries. Petitioner
filed claims with respondents City of Montebello and the County of Los Angeles.
After the deadline to file a government tort claim had passed, petitioner
discovered that the deadline to file the claims had passed. (Fradkin Decl. ¶¶ 7,
9. 10.)
 
A claim relating to a cause of
action for personal injury must be presented to the public entity no later than
six months after the accrual of the cause of action.¿ (Gov.
Code § 911.2; Munoz v. State of California¿(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th
1767, 1776.)¿Accordingly, petitioner had until December
23, 2023—the longer of six calendar months or 182 days—to present a claim to
respondents. (Gov. Code § 911.2; Munoz v.
State of California¿(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776; Jiminez v.
Chavez (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 50, 58.)¿
 
On April 17, 2024, petitioner submitted written applications
to respondents for leave to present a late claim. (CCP §§ 911.4, 911.6; Fradkin
Decl. ¶ 14 & Ex. 1.) Petitioner asserts that the applications were deemed
rejected on June 1, 2024, which was 45 days from submission. (Petition at
5:8-9.) Respondents do not dispute the assertion. Accordingly, it appears that
respondents failed to respond to the application within 45 days of submission.
(Gov. Code § 911.6(c) [“If the board fails or refuses to act on an
application within the time prescribed by this section, the application shall
be deemed to have been denied on the 45th day….”].) 
 
Petitioner files this petition seeking relief under
Government Code § 946.6 to present a late claim. The instant
petition was timely filed on June 7, 2024, within six months of June 1,
2024, as is required by Government Code § 946.6(b).
 
Petitioner is required to demonstrate that the failure to
present a claim under Government Code § 945.4 was “through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect….” (Gov. Code § 946.6(c)(1).)
“The mere recital of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect is
not sufficient to warrant relief…. There must be more than the mere failure to
discover a fact; the party seeking relief must establish the failure to
discover the fact in the exercise of reasonable diligence.” (Department of
Water & Power v. Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1293.) “The
party seeking relief based on a claim of mistake must establish he was diligent
in investigating and pursuing the claim [citation] and must establish the
necessary elements justifying relief by the preponderance of the evidence.” (Ibid.)
 
Petitioner hired counsel the day after the subject incident.
(Fradkin Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5.) Petitioner was diligent in hiring counsel. Irrespective
of whether petitioner himself was diligent in retaining counsel after the
incident, however, petitioner does not demonstrate that his counsel was
reasonably diligent in discovering the available claims against respondents.
“[A] late claimant who seeks relief under section 946.6 may be barred by
inexcusable delay by counsel.” (Hasty v. County of Los Angeles (1976) 61
Cal.App.3d 623, 626, citing Black v. County of Los Angeles (1970) 12
Cal.App.3d 670, 674-77.) “Where the lateness of the claim is attributable to
the failure of the claimant or his counsel to conduct a reasonably prudent
investigation of the circumstances of the accident, relief from the claims
filing statute is not available.” (Department of Water, 82 Cal.App.4th
at 1296.)  
 
Counsel avers that his office “immediately started working
in investigating the incident and obtaining necessary information.” (Fradkin
Decl. ¶ 8.) Other than that conclusory statement, counsel does not state what
work was done on petitioner’s case from June 24, 2023 to December 23, 2023.  Counsel fails to explain what, if any,
reasonably prudent investigation was conducted such that counsel might have
discovered that the six-month government claim deadline had not been properly
calendared. For example, counsel does not state what, if any, efforts he made
to obtain documents from petitioner before the claim deadline passed. (Fradkin
Decl. ¶ 9.) Indeed, counsel admits that he did not procure from petitioner the
traffic collision report until sometime after petitioner had obtained new
counsel on February 6, 2024, which was after the claim deadline had passed.
(Fradkin Decl. ¶ 9.) Simply put, petitioner does not establish reasonable
diligence in discovering that government claims had to be filed by December 23,
2023. 
 
Contrary to petitioner’s assertion in reply, petitioner may
not rely on an attorney affidavit of fault, like the type filed pursuant to CCP
§ 473(b), to obtain mandatory relief from government claim deadlines. (Tackett
v. City of Huntington Beach (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 60, 62 [“Do the recent
amendments to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, requiring a trial court to
vacate a default, default judgment, or dismissal if the aggrieved party’s
attorney submits a timely application for relief ‘in proper form, ...
accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,’ apply to a motion under Government Code
section 946.6 for relief from the claim-filing requirement under the Government
Tort Claims Act? No.”].) 
 
For the foregoing reasons, petitioner
does not demonstrate the diligence necessary to obtain relief under Government
Code § 946.6. While there is a “general policy favoring trial on the merits,”
it “cannot be applied indiscriminately so as to render ineffective the
statutory time limits.” (Department of Water, 82 Cal.App.4th at 1293.)  Because petitioner has not demonstrated the
necessary mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect to obtain leave
to file a late claim, the question of whether respondent would be prejudiced by
the grant of relief does not matter. (Id. at 1297 [“The public entity
has no burden of establishing prejudice arising from the failure to file a
timely claim until after the party seeking relief has made a prima facie
showing of entitlement to relief”].) 
 
The petition is DENIED.
