Case:               PNC Bank, National Association v. LJ Logistics, Inc., et
al.
(24STCV23594) 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
On 10/31/24, the Court issued a tentative ruling denying the
Application for Writ of Possession with respect to defendant Justrich because
there was no proof service indicating that the application for writ of
possession and supporting documents were served, as required by CCP §
512.030(a)(2) and (a)(3). (10/31/24 Minute Order.) The Proof of Service of
Summons filed on 9/25/24 indicated that the process server served copies of the
Summons, Verified Complaint, and “See List of Additional Documents” on defendant
Justrich. No list of additional documents was attached to the proof of service.
 
The Court continued the application as to defendant Justrich
for further hearing. (10/31/24 Minute Order.) On 10/31/24, plaintiff PNC Bank,
National Association filed an amended Proof of Service of Summons indicating
that on 9/24/24 by substitute service, defendant Justrich was served the
Summons, Verified Complaint, and “See List of Additional Documents.” The
attached list of documents included the Application for Writ of Possession and
supporting documents. Accordingly, the Court rules as follows:
 
Plaintiff PNC Bank, National Association’s UNOPPOSED
Application for Writ of Possession with respect to defendant Lee Justrich is GRANTED.
The Court finds that plaintiff has established the probable validity of its
claim to possession of the property, namely, three 2022 Wabash DVLSHPC Dry Van
Trailers (VINs 1JJV532D6NL336838, 1JJV532D8NL336839, and 1JJV532D4NL336840). 
 
The Court strikes the portion of the proposed order stating
that there is probable cause to believe that the subject trailers are located
at 2711 N. Sepulveda Blvd., #513, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266 or “any other
location known as to defendants” and that the sheriff may enter the Manhattan
Beach address or “any other location known as to defendants” to take possession
of the property. (Proposed Order at §§ 3(d), 5(f).) Plaintiff has not
demonstrated probable cause that the trailers are at any location other than
the address specified in the Loan and Security Agreement, i.e., 19129 S.
Hamilton, Gardena, CA 90248. (McGinley Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 1.) 
 
No undertaking is required. The amount owed ($119,732.34)
exceeds the market value of the trailers ($75,000 total). (CCP § 515.010;
McGinley Decl. ¶¶ 9, 20, 21 & Ex. 3.) 
 
Redelivery bond is ordered. The written undertaking required
by defendant Justrich for redelivery or to stay delivery is in the amount of
$25,000 for each trailer, based on the current fair market value of each of the
three trailers. (McGinley Decl. ¶ 20.) Plaintiff requests the redelivery bond
to include its litigation costs, but the fair market value is sufficient to
protect plaintiff’s interest in the trailers. 
 
Accordingly, the Court will sign the Proposed Order respect
to defendant Lee Justrich, electronically received 9/18/24, with the
modifications discussed herein.
