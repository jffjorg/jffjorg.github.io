And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the application for writ of possession filed by PNC Bank, National Association against LJ Logistics, Inc., et al., and Lee Justrich. The bank is seeking to take possession of three 2022 Wabash DVLSHPC Dry Van Trailers that are allegedly in the possession of defendant Justrich. The bank claims that it has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property.

The judge has granted the bank's unopposed application for writ of possession with respect to defendant Justrich, finding that the bank has demonstrated the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property. However, the judge has struck the portion of the proposed order that states that there is probable cause to believe that the subject trailers are located at any other location than the address specified in the Loan and Security Agreement, which is 19129 S. Hamilton, Gardena, CA 90248.

The judge has also ordered a redelivery bond in the amount of $25,000 for each trailer, based on the current fair market value of each of the three trailers. The bank is not required to file an undertaking, as the amount owed ($119,732.34) exceeds the market value of the trailers ($75,000 total).
