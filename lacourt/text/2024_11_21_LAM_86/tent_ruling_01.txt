  Case Number:  24STCP00454    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  86 MOTION TO SET ASIDE ENTRY OF DEFAULT
 
Date:               11/21/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:                           Laurent Ruben v. Ikspan, Inc. (24STCP00454)
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Ikspan, Inc.’s Motion to Entry of Default is GRANTED.

 
Plaintiff Laurent Ruben’s evidentiary objections are
OVERRULED.
 
Defendant Ikspan, Inc. moves for an order to set aside entry
of default pursuant to the mandatory relief provision of CCP § 473(b). “[T]he
court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months
after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s
sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect, vacate any…resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment…unless the court
finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) 
 
As a preliminary matter, CCP § 1008 does not bar the instant
motion. Plaintiff contends that the instant motion is defendant’s third request
to set aside default. On 7/24/24, defendant filed an ex parte application to
quash service of summons, or in the alternative, set aside default pursuant to
CCP § 473.5 based on purported lack of actual notice. On 7/25/24, the Court
denied the ex parte application. On 8/3/24, defendant filed a motion seeking
the same relief as the 7/24/24 ex parte application, including vacating the
default pursuant to CCP § 473.5 based on purported lack of actual notice. On
9/24/24, the Court denied the motion.
 
Citing Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v.
Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, plaintiff asserts that CCP §
1008 applies to CCP § 473(b) motions. (Even Zohar, 61 Cal.4th at
840-41.) Plaintiff correctly cites Even Zohar, but its holding is of
little help to plaintiff here.  In Even
Zohar, the defendants’ motion to set aside default seeking mandatory relief
based on an affidavit of fault was denied, after which the defendants filed a renewed
motion seeking mandatory relief based on a different explanation of fault. (Id.
at 834-36.) The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeal’s holding that, as
is required by CCP § 1008(b), the defendants were required to demonstrate new
facts, circumstances, or law under before granting mandatory relief. (Id.
at 837.)
 
Here, by contrast, defendant has never previously sought
mandatory relief under CCP § 473(b). Defendant’s 7/24/24 ex parte application
and the 8/3/24 motion were based on lack of actual notice under CCP § 473.5.  As such, CCP § 1008 presents no obstacle
here.  Indeed, the Court in Even Zohar
specifically discussed and cited Standard Microsystems Corp. v. Winbond
Electronics Corp. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 868 for the proposition that
section 1008 does not apply to a defendant’s application for mandatory
relief where the previous application sought discretionary relief, even
where both forms of relief are sought under section 473(b).  (Even Zohar, 61 Cal.4th at 843 [“[S]ection
1008 did not apply to the defendant’s application for mandatory relief
under section 473(b) because the application did not seek reconsideration or
renewal of the defendant’s earlier, failed application for discretionary
relief”], emphasis added.)  Accordingly,
because Ikspan never sought mandatory relief based on an attorney affidavit of
fault pursuant to CCP § 473(b), it does not have to demonstrate new facts,
circumstances, or law pursuant to CCP § 1008. The Court proceeds to rule on the
merits of the motion.
 
Defendant’s counsel submits a declaration stating that, on
2/23/24, his office was served with the summons and complaint, after which he
contacted defendant’s CEO and notified him of the service. (Pessah Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9
& Ex. 1.) Defendant’s counsel explains: “I further stated, that in my
professional opinion, I did not believe that the summons and complaint were
effectively or lawfully served, and Ikspan wouldn’t have a legal obligation to
file a response to the Complaint. Because Plaintiff’s counsel claimed that
service upon PLG [Pessah Law Group, PC] was proper under Corporations Code
§2011(b), and PLG did not ‘have charge’ of Ikspan’s assets at the time of the
alleged service, I advised Ikspan that service upon PLG was improper and
recommended that no action be taken. I realize now that, notwithstanding my
analysis regarding service of process on Ikspan being improper, it was a
mistake to advise Ikspan to abstain from taking action, be it via a motion to
quash or by the filing of a responsive pleading.” (Pessah Decl. ¶ 9; see
also Zarka Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant did not file any responsive pleading based
on counsel’s advice. (Pessah Decl. ¶ 9; Zarka Decl. ¶ 3.) 
 
The foregoing is sufficient to establish counsel’s mistake. Because
defendant did not respond to service of the summons and complaint by filing a
motion to quash or a responsive pleading, default was entered against defendant
on 4/24/24. (Pessah Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex. 3.) “The so-called mandatory provision
of section 473…requires the court to vacate a dismissal upon the attorney's
sworn statement of neglect, regardless whether the neglect was excusable or
whether other conditions for discretionary relief are satisfied.” (Vaccaro
v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 770.)
 
Plaintiff contends that defendant’s counsel did not specify
whether the communications between him and defendant’s CEO were in writing and
thus failed to provide the original writings. (See Evid. Code §§ 1520,
1521.) CCP § 473(b) does not demand any particular evidentiary showing other
than “an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake.” Defendant
included a declaration of counsel attesting to his mistake.  The statements therein are sufficient. 
 
Plaintiff also argues that defendant was not diligent in
filing the motion because it was filed on 10/14/24, more than five months after
the 4/24/24 entry of default. CCP § 473(b) only requires motions seeking
mandatory relief under CCP§ 473(b) to be “made no more than six months after
entry of judgment.” Here, no judgment has been entered against defendant. Plaintiff’s
citation to 
Caldwell v. Methodist Hospital (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th
1521 and Pulte Homes Corp. v. Williams Mechanical, Inc. (2016) 2
Cal.App.5th 267 are inapposite because both cases concerned motions for
discretionary relief, which requires motions to be filed “within a reasonable
time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Caldwell, 24 Cal.App.4th at 1524; Pulte,
2 Cal.App.5th at 273.) There is no “reasonable time” provision for mandatory
relief under CCP§ 473(b). “[T]he mandatory provisions…do not require…a showing
of diligence short of the six-month time limit.” (Metropolitan Service Corp.
v. Casa de Palms, Ltd. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1488.) Because no judgment
has been entered against defendant, defendant’s motion is not untimely. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court would be inclined to grant
the instant motion except for the fact that defense counsel’s declaration is
unsigned.  (See Pessah Decl. at
pg. 3.)  Mandatory relief under section
473(b) requires “an attorney’s sworn affidavit.”  
 
Accordingly, the Court CONDITIONALLY GRANTS Defendant Ikspan
Inc.’s Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default, subject to the condition that
defendant file a signed version of the Declaration of Maurice Pessah, filed 10/14/24,
by no later than 11/22/24.  If that
condition is satisfied, the default entered against defendant Ikspan, Inc. on
4/24/24 shall be VACATED and defendant shall file its Answer (see Pessah
Decl. ¶ 19 & Ex. 4) by no later than 12/2/24.  As part of this conditional grant, the Court
imposes a $1,000 penalty against Maurice Pessah. “Whenever the court grants
relief from a default…based on any of the provisions of [section 473], the
court may…[i]mpose a penalty of no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000)
upon an offending attorney or party.” (CCP § 473(c)(1)(A).) Plaintiff
requested imposition of a penalty, and defendant did not oppose such request in
its Reply.  Given that Pessah erroneously
advised that defendant was under no obligation to respond to service of the
summons and complaint instead of filing a motion to quash summons or a
responsive pleading, the Court finds that a penalty against Pessah Law Group,
PC in the amount of $1,000, payable to plaintiff within 30 days from the date
of this ruling, is warranted.  If
defendant fails to satisfy the condition of timely filing the sworn affidavit
of counsel, the Motion shall be DENIED.
 
The Court hereby sets a non-appearance case review for
12/3/24.
