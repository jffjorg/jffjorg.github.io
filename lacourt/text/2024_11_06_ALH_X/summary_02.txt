And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the case as moot. The defendant argued that the case is moot because the restaurant is closed and not reopening, and there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur. The judge agreed that the case is moot as to the plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief, as there is no possibility of ongoing harm and no basis for injunctive relief. However, the judge found that the closure of the restaurant does not moot the plaintiff's Unruh Act claim for statutory damages arising from barriers encountered during the plaintiff's visits to the website. The judge ruled that the statutory damages claim remains active and denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the case.
