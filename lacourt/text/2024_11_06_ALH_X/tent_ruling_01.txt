  Case Number:  23AHCV00625    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2024    Dept:  X MOTION FOR TERMINATING, ISSUE,
EVIDENTIARY, AND/OR MONETARY SANCTIONS 
Defendant’s Motion for Terminating, Issue, and Evidentiary
Sanctions against Plaintiff is GRANTED.  Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $690.00. 
 
The Court denies the
request for terminating sanctions for procedural reasons.  In the motion, the correct hearing
date, time, and location is listed, but the body of the notice of motion
mentions terminating sanctions without mentioning what type of order Defendant
is requesting.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.030(d) [striking a pleading, staying proceedings, dismissing the action,
or rendering judgment by default].)
 
As there is no evidence presented to the Court that Plaintiff
has responded to discovery pursuant to the Court’s prior order, the Court
issues an evidentiary sanction preventing Plaintiff from presenting any
evidence regarding whether Defendant was negligent or maintained the subject premises
in an unsafe manner.
 
Finally, the Court issues a monetary sanction against
Plaintiff in the sum of $690.00.  Plaintiff
is ordered to pay the monetary sanction to Defendant’s counsel within thirty
(30) days of notice of this Court’s Order.
 
Moving Party is to give notice.
