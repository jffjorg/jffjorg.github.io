Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Clearcover Insurance's motion to compel discovery responses from defendants Mari Marashlyan and Narek Agabalyan. The plaintiff's motion seeks to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and a demand for production of documents, as well as to deem certain facts admitted. The court finds that the defendants have failed to timely respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, which were served on December 8, 2023. As a result, the court grants the plaintiff's motion and orders the defendants to provide responses within 20 days. The court also deems certain facts admitted and grants the plaintiff's other requests for discovery.
