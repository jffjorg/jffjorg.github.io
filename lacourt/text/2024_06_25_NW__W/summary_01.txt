And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer with motion to strike the first amended complaint. The plaintiff, Eli Hertzel Dadon, alleges that he entered into an agreement with the defendants, Jakob Abergel and Sima Mazri, to transfer the rights to certain real property for $65,000.00. The defendants allegedly went into default and failed to pay the owed amount, despite repeated demands by the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed an original complaint, which was followed by a first amended complaint, and then a rejected second amended complaint.

The defendants have filed a demurrer with motion to strike the first amended complaint, but instead of filing an opposition, the plaintiff filed a new pleading, a special allegation of complicity (SAC), which was rejected under Code of Civil Procedure section 472. The SAC essentially moots out the demurrer, as it removes many of the causes of action that the defendant is demurring to. The judge intends to ask the defendant if it is willing to stipulate that the demurrer is moot and the SAC is the new operative pleading.
