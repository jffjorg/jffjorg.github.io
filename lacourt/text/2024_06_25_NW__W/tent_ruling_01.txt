BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Eli Hertzel Dadon alleges he entered into an agreement with Defendants Jakob
Abergel and Sima Maztri to transfer the rights to certain real property for a
sum of $65,000.00. Plaintiff alleges after Defendants made some payments pursuant
to the terms of the agreement, Defendants went into default. According to
Plaintiff, Plaintiff has repeatedly demanded payment as provided, however,
Defendants have failed to pay the owed amount. Plaintiff filed their original
complaint on December 28, 2023 and on March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint as of right. On June 10, 2024, Plaintiff attempted to file a
second amended complaint, however, that complaint was rejected. 
 
[Tentative]
Ruling
 
Defendants Demurrer with Motion to Strike is MOOT. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
There is a demurrer
with motion to strike set for hearing today as to the first through tenth
causes of action. Instead of filing an opposition, Plaintiff filed a SAC, which
was rejected per Code of Civil Procedure section 472. However, the SAC gets rid
of many (if not all) of the causes of action that Defendant is demurring to and
essentially moots it out. The court will ask Defendant if it is willing to
stipulate that the demurrer is moot and the SAC is the new operative pleading.
