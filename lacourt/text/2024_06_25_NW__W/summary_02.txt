And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike the request for punitive damages in the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The defendant argued that the complaint fails to properly plead and state any relevant facts, or sufficient underlying facts, to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge found that the allegations in the complaint, while conclusory in some respects, demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful disregard for the safety of others and intended to cause injury to the plaintiff. The judge concluded that the allegations may be enough for a trier of fact to find that the defendant intended to cause injury to the plaintiff or acted with despicable conduct. As a result, the motion to strike the request for punitive damages was denied.
