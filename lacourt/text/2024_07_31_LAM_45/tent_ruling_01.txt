Discussion
            Simon
P. Etehad of Etehad Law, APC (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel of
record for defendants Shahin S. Zackary and Stanford & 12th
Street, LP. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw and such
a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client,
and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.
App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
 
CRC, Rule 3.1362
(Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to
be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under CCP § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a
consent under CCP § 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the
notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have
appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on
the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-053)).
 
Here, Counsel has complied
with CRC, Rule 3.1362. Counsel filed the required forms and declared that there
has been a breakdown of the working relationship with the clients. (Etehad
Decl. ¶ 2.) Counsel further states that they have been unable to communicate
which prevents Counsel from further representing the clients. (Id.) Notably,
neither client filed an opposition. 
 
The Court notes
that MC-053 (Proposed Order) lists the next hearing as the Motion for Protective
Order on August 6, 2024. However, the next hearing is the Case Management
Conference scheduled for August 14, 2024. Moreover, the Status Conference re:
Mediation, Appointing a Referee, and Motion for a Protective Order were
continued to September 19, 2024. However, the Court notes that Counsel was not
aware of these changes until after this Motion had been submitted. 
 
The Court
therefore GRANTS Counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel effective upon
proof of service of this Order. 
 
It is so ordered.
