And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant, Toyota Financial Services International Corporation, is granted its motion for summary judgment in the case. The plaintiff, Adrian Texis and Randy Lopez, failed to file an opposition to the motion by the deadline, and the judge has determined that the defendant has met its burden of proof to show that there is no triable issue of fact as to the negligence cause of action. The defendant argues that since it is in the business of renting vehicles and has provided facts showing no negligence or criminal conduct on its part, it has met its burden. The judge agrees, and because the plaintiff did not oppose the motion, the plaintiff has failed to meet its burden. As a result, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted.
