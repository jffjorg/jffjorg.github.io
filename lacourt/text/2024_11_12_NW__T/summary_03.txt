And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, which means that the defendants have successfully argued that there is no factual dispute that would require a trial. The judge has also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice, which allows the court to take notice of certain facts without requiring evidence.

The defendants, Jennifer Kennick and Colleen Irby, argued that they were not the trustee or beneficiary on the non-judicial foreclosure proceedings, and that S.B.S. Trust Deed Network Corporation was the trustee and Grace Greens #1 Homeowners Association was the beneficiary. The defendants presented evidence showing that they were employees of SBS and did not participate in the foreclosure proceedings.

The plaintiff, Arvis Ash, failed to present any evidence or arguments to dispute these facts and therefore failed to meet her burden of proof. The judge has ruled that the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted and that the alternative motion for summary adjudication is moot.

It is worth noting that the judge has not ruled on the merits of the case, but rather has determined that there are no factual disputes that would require a trial. The case will likely proceed to a trial on the merits, but the judge's ruling is a significant step in the process.
