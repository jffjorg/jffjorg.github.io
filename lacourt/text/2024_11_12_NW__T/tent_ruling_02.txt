Introduction
Plaintiff
Roxana Eli (Plaintiff) moved for an award of attorneys’ fees, costs, and
expenses against Defendant General Motors LLC (Defendant).  Plaintiff
requested a total of $76,157.37, which consists of $64,277.35 in fees plus
$4,000.00 for reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply; and $7,880.02
in costs and expenses.
Discussion
A
prevailing buyer in an action under the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(Act) claim “shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a
sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's
fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been
reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.”  (Civ. Code, sec. 1794(d).)  The moving
party plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the fees incurred were
“allowable,” were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,” and
were “reasonable in amount.” (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 34.) 
There is no
dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing buyer in this action. 
“As
summarized in Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99,
104, 37 Cal.Rptr.2d 149, with respect to hourly fee cases: “It requires the
trial court to make an initial determination of the actual time expended; and
then to ascertain whether under all the circumstances of the case the amount of
actual time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time expended
are reasonable. These circumstances may include, but are not limited to,
factors such as the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the skill
exhibited and the results achieved. If the time expended or the monetary charge
being made for the time expended is not reasonable under all the circumstances,
then the court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser
amount.”  In the situation of a contingency fee arrangement, the court in
Nightingale stated, “for purposes of section 1794, subdivision (d), a
prevailing buyer represented by counsel is entitled to an award of reasonable
attorney fees for time reasonably expended by his or her attorney.” 
(Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 785, 817-818.)  Plaintiff submitted that this action was taken
on a contingency fee basis.  (Joseph Liu (Liu) Decl. par. 76.) 
Because of the contingency fee basis, the Court reviews the reasonableness of
the fees.  Liu, as a 16 year attorney, testified that he charged
$475-$500/hour and expended 5.5 hours.  Liu provided that a Partner at the
firm, Nancy Zhang (Zhang), as an 11 year attorney, charged $500-$515/hour and
expended 115.74 hours.  (Liu Decl. pars. 50-52.)  Based upon the
experience of Mr. Liu, the Court finds the hourly rate he charged to be
reasonable. 
It is noted
that from a calculation of the time record, Liu was the one that expended
115.74 hours and Zhang expended 5.5 hours (2.8 hours at $500/hr. and 2.7 hours
at $515/hr.).  (Liu Decl. par. 72, Exh. 17.)  Liu’s testimony stated
the hours backwards.  Liu also provided that two paralegals, Clarence
Serrano (Serrano) and Richard Ruiz (Ruiz), charged $210/hour and $200/hour,
respectively.  (Liu Decl. par. 53.)  Based upon the time record
submitted, Serrano charged 3.1 hours and Ruiz charged 21.04 hours. 
The Court
finds that the legal and factual issues to be straightforward and not complex;
nothing unique was presented in this action.  The Court finds that the
procedural demands of the action were also straightforward and not
complex.  In 2023, Mr. Liu charged 14.66 hours for discovery proceedings,
amounting to $6,963.50.  In 2024, Mr. Liu charged 60.12 hours for
discovery proceedings, amounting to $30,060.00.  Because the substantive
and procedural issues presented were straightforward, the Court finds the fees
charged by Mr. Liu to be excessive and reduces the hours expended by Mr. Liu in
2024 related to discovery by 35 hours or $17,500.00.   Plaintiff’s
requested fees are reduced to $50,777.35.   [Calculated at $68,277.35
– $17,500.00.] Further,
Plaintiff failed to submit an affidavit from Zhang, Serrano, or Ruiz to provide
admissible evidence to support the contention that their fees charged and time
expended were reasonable.  Without admissible evidence as to Zhang,
Serrano, or Ruiz, Plaintiff failed to meet the initial burden of proof to show
the reasonableness of fees charged by Zhang, Serrano, or Ruiz.  The
request for fees is reduced by $2,790.50 (Zhang fees), $651.00 (Serrano fees),
and $4,208.00 (Ruiz fees).  Plaintiff’s total attorney fees are further
reduced to $43,127.85.  [Calculated at $50,777.35 - $2,790.50 - $651.00 -
$4,208.00.]
The motion
for attorneys’ fees is GRANTED in Part and the fees are reduced to the amount
of $43,127.85.  Because of the lack of complexity of this case, the court denies a multiplier.As for the
request for $7,880.02 in costs and expenses, Plaintiff attached a Memo of Costs
asserting the costs/expenses incurred.  (Liu Decl. par. 74, Exh.
18.)  Plaintiff argued that the costs provision in the Act are broader
than the costs recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure, section 1033.5. 
However, Plaintiff failed to present any legal authority to support such a
contention.  Further, the right to recover costs under the Code of Civil
Procedure expressly begins with “Except as otherwise expressly provided by
statute, …”.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1032.)  The provision expressly
states that statutorily described methods of determining costs prevails over
the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.  The Act expressly provides
its method for determining costs.  The Act limits costs and expenses to
“the sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, … , determined by
the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action.”  (Civ. Code, sec. 1794(d).)
 Defendant asserted that Plaintiff’s requests for costs should be reduced
to the reasonable amount of $3,736.34. 
However,
the Court disagrees with Defendant’s contentions.  The request for jury
fees is reasonable in that it was a required cost to preserve Plaintiff’s right
to a jury trial, even though the case was later settled.  The costs for
filing motions in limine, sanctions motions, service of process and deposition
costs are reasonable and not seen as “optional costs”.  The Court notes
that these costs were, in part, a result of Defendant’s recalcitrance.  At
most, the Court agrees that the request for $12.34 for filing the change of
address notice is not reasonable because the filing is not seen to be related
to the substantive issues of the action.
Plaintiff’s
motion for costs and expenses is GRANTED in Part and the costs and expenses are
reduced to a reasonable amount of $7,867.68. 
IT IS SO ORDERED. CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
