And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Bank of America National Association, Defendant in this action. The demurrer was filed on December 4, 2023, and the Court has considered the opposition to the demurrer filed by Triway Logistics (USA), Inc., the Plaintiff.

The Court has concluded that the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action, alleging conversion under California Commercial Code section 3420 and violation of California Commercial Code section 3404, respectively, should be overruled. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently stated the causes of action and that the Defendant has failed to demonstrate that the provisions of the California Commercial Code are not applicable in this instance.

The Court notes that the Defendant's argument that Jimenez's actions fell within the scope of his agency authority is not persuasive, and that the Plaintiff has effectively demonstrated the element of "imposter" under California Commercial Code section 3404. The Court has also considered the evidence and arguments presented by the parties and has determined that the demurrer should be overruled.

Accordingly, the demurrer is overruled.
