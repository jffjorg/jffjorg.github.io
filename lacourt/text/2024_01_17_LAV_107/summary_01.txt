And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motion to compel deposition as moot. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Braulio De Mora Villegas against Defendant FCA US LLC, alleging that the Defendant failed to produce a "proper" witness with knowledge and documents responsive to the specific policies and procedures as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.230. However, the Court notes that the deposition of the person designated by the Defendant (PMK) had already occurred on December 28, 2023, making the motion moot. The Court also points out that the statute of limitations for discovery and discovery motions had passed, and the motion cannot be granted unless the moving party moves under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050.
