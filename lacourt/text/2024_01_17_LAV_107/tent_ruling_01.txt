COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: Motion to Compel Deposition
  
 



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
[Tentative]
Ruling:  Motion to
Compel Deposition is Denied as Moot. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
 
This is a lemon law
action by Plaintiff Braulio De Mora Villegas against Defendant FCA US LLC
relating to a 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 4x4. On December 21, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the action and on January 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint.
 
Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel
the deposition of Defendant’s PMK on December 15, 2023. According to both
sides, the deposition occurred on December 28, 2023.  However, Plaintiff now alleges that the
Defendant failed to produce a “proper” witness with knowledge and documents
responsive to the specific policies and procedures as required by Cal Code Civ Proc § 2025.230. The Court notes that Plaintiff
does not request sanctions.
 
ANALYSIS
Compel Deposition
As noted above, everyone
agrees that a deposition of the person designated by the Defendant under Cal Code Civ Proc § 2025.230 has occurred since the filing of the motion. That is
the only issue now before this Court and it is now moot.
 
In their reply, Plaintiff
alleges that the Defendant has designated someone lacking knowledge of all
matters specified in the notice. However, any issues regarding the PMK and the December
28, 2023, deposition can only be addressed in a separate noticed motion. 
 
Furthermore, trial
in this action is set for January 30, 2024. The corresponding cutoffs for
discovery and discovery motions, therefore, were December 31, 2023, and January
15, 2024, respectively. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) The instant
motion (and any other motion on the specific deficiencies of the PMK’s
testimony) would be heard after the statutory cutoff for discovery and
discovery motions.  The Court cannot
grant discovery motions after the cutoff date unless the moving party has moved
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 to have the motions heard closer
to the trial date. (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging
Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1586-1587.) The Court’s
discretion in allowing the motions to be heard closer to the trial date than
allowed by Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 is bounded by the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, which include
submission of a meet and confer declaration and the trial court’s consideration
of the statutory factors. (Ibid.) 
Based on the
foregoing, the instant motion is DENIED.
