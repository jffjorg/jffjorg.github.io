And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant, Lori Banks, to submit to an oral deposition. The plaintiff had previously attempted to obtain dates for the deposition from defense counsel, but was met with objections and failed to receive responses. The plaintiff then properly noticed Banks' deposition on two occasions, but Banks failed to appear for the deposition. The judge finds that the objections to the depositions were not timely/properly served and lack merit. The judge orders counsel for the parties to meet and confer regarding a mutually agreeable date for Banks' deposition to take place in the plaintiff's counsel's office. Additionally, the judge awards sanctions against Banks and her counsel in the amount of $2,981.65.
