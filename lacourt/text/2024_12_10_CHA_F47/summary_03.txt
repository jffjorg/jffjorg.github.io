And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling states that the hearing scheduled for December 10, 2024, is now off calendar. This decision comes after the original Petition to Approve Compromise of Dispute Claim filed on September 26, 2024, was denied on October 24, 2024, due to various defects. At the October 24, 2024, hearing, counsel represented that an amended petition would be filed and the Court scheduled a hearing on such petition for December 10, 2024. However, an amended petition has not been filed, and therefore, the matter is now off calendar.
