And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel. The defendant, Greg Jara, has filed a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs, Francisco Brigido Nava and Maria Gomez Ruiz, and is seeking to be relieved as counsel. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice, citing the failure to include a declaration on the mandatory form MC-052. The judge notes that the court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but that the motion must be accompanied by a declaration stating why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1). The motion is denied without prejudice, and the moving counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
