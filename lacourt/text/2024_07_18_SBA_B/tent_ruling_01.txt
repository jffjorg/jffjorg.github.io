The Court considered the moving
papers.
RULING
The motion is DENIED without
prejudice.  Rule of Court 3.1362(c).
BACKGROUND
On March 15, 2023, plaintiffs
Francisco Brigido Nava and Maria Gomez Ruiz filed a complaint against Greg Jara
for (1) negligence, (2) breach of implied warranty of habitability, (3)
wrongful eviction, and (4) fraud.
On May 1, 2023, defendant Greg Jara
filed a cross-complaint against plaintiffs for (1) abuse of elder person and
(2) IIED.
LEGAL STANDARD
The court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice.  See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal. App. 2d
398.
CRC Rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and
without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship
why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).
DISCUSSION
            Defendant and cross-complainant Greg
Jara’s attorney, Hector C. Perez, seeks to be relieved as counsel. Rule of
Court 3.1362(c) states:
“The motion to be relieved as
counsel must be accompanied by a declaration on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil (form MC-052).”  (Bold added.)
            Counsel states in his declaration
that his client advised him that he did not want counsel to work on the matter
anymore and that his client is in the process of hiring another attorney.
            The motion is DENIED without
prejudice as the declaration is not on the mandatory form MC-052.
ORDER
The motion is DENIED without
prejudice.
Moving counsel is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
