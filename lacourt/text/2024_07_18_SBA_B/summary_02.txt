And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Bryan Munguia and Ricardo Munguia, against the defendant, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. and South Bay Motors, LLC dba Pacific Volkswagen. The plaintiffs are seeking further responses to their request for production of documents, which includes information about the defendant's policies and procedures for handling Song-Beverly Act cases, warranty policy, and information about similar customer complaints in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle.

The judge has granted the motion as to Nos. 1-29 and 31, ordering the defendant to produce responsive documents within 20 days. The defendant has agreed to produce documents related to the plaintiffs' vehicle under Nos. 1-14 and 31, and will produce its confidential policy and procedure materials regarding Song-Beverly claims in response to Nos. 15-29 upon entry of a stipulation and confidentiality protective order.

The judge has denied the motion as to No. 30, which requested all documents of other customer complaints in the defendant's ESI database(s) that are substantially similar to complaints made by the plaintiffs with respect to the subject vehicle in other 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 vehicles. The judge has ruled that the request is too broad and unduly burdensome.

The judge has also ordered the case to be bifurcated for both discovery and trial, with phase one focusing on the basic Song Beverly Act claim arising from the claimed breach of the Song Beverly statutory obligations, and phase two focusing on the plaintiffs' claim to a civil penalty under Civil Code §1794(c) for a willful violation of the statute.
