Background
 
On July 18, 2023, Anthony
Wheaton pka Sir Jinx (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Grand Hustle
Records, LLC (“Hustle”); Roc Nation, LLC (“Roc Nation”), and Does 1 to 50. The
Complaint alleges four causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of
good faith and fair dealing, (3) unjust enrichment, and (4) accounting. 
 
On January 10, 2024, Defendant
Roc Nation filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint. Plaintiff opposed the
Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal
Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the
complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist.
(2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of
fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695,
713.)¿¿ 
  
B.        Leave
to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Summary of Allegations in the Complaint
 
Plaintiff is a music producer who
produced the song “Dope” for Defendants pursuant to a label contract.
(Compl. ¶ 9, 10, 11.) In 2016, Plaintiff wrote, produced, and registered the
song with Goonz Skwad Music via ASCAP Publishing. (Compl. ¶ 12.) Years after
Plaintiff learned that his song was played via various mediums and in October
2022, Plaintiff informed defendants that they had failed to pay him royalties
and he was entitled to an accounting regarding the profit and royalties for the
song. (Compl. ¶¶ 11, 14, 17.) On November 11, 2022, Plaintiff through counsel
sent a demand letter but to date, Defendants have failed to respond. (Compl. ¶¶
18-20, 22.) Plaintiff initiated this action on July 18, 2023, to recover
damages. 
 
Defendant Roc Nation now demurs to all
causes of action alleged in the Complaint. 
 
B.        First
Cause of Action – Breach of Contract
 
The elements of a claim
for breach of contract are: "(1) the existence of the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach,
and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff." (Oasis West Realty,
LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint
must demonstrate damages proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v.
American Dynasty (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.) Furthermore, “the
complaint must [also] indicate on its face whether the contract is written,
oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co.
(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452. at 458-59 citing CCP § 430.10(g).) “If the action is
based on an alleged breach of a written contract, the terms must be set out
verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written instrument must
be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Id. at p. 459 [internal
citations omitted].) 
 
Defendant Roc Nation
demurrers to the breach of contract claim on the basis that Plaintiff fails to
plead facts to show that it had a contract with Plaintiff and fails to layout
the terms of the contract and obligations that Roc Nation owed to Plaintiff under
the contract. The
court agrees that without a copy of the production label agreement or without
the terms of said contract being laid out in the Complaint, Plaintiff only pleads conclusory allegations
insufficient to put Roc Nation on notice as to what provision of the contract
were violated. (Compl. ¶ 27.) “If the action is based on alleged breach of
written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the
complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated
by reference.”¿ (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 299, 308.) Alternatively, “a plaintiff may plead the legal effect
of the contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction Protective
Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.)¿¿“[A]ll essential elements of a breach
of contract cause of action[] must be pleaded with specificity.”¿(Levy
v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.)
 
Plaintiff’s opposition alleges new facts
indicating that an implied agreement existed between Plaintiff and Roc Nation.
(Opposition at p. 5-6.) Facts not alleged in the pleading are presumed not to
exist. (Schick v. Lerner (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1321, 1327.) Therefore,
if an implied contract existed between Plaintiff and Roc Nation, the Complaint
must allege such facts. The court further notes that unless Plaintiff is
pleading an implied contract with Roc Nation as an alternative theory of
liability, there cannot be a valid, express contract and an implied contract
that embrace the same subject matter and exist at the same time. (See Wal-Noon
Corp. v. Hill (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 605, 613.) 
 
Based
on the above, the demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained with leave
to amend. 
 
C.        Second
Cause of Action – Breach of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
“[A]
tortious breach of contract … may be found when (1) the breach is accompanied
by a traditional common law tort, such as fraud or conversion; (2) the means
used to breach the contract are tortious, involving deceit or undue coercion;
or (3) one party intentionally breaches the contract intending or knowing that
such a breach will cause severe, unmitigable harm in the form of mental
anguish, personal hardship, or substantial consequential damages.” (Robinson
Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 990.)
 
Since
the demurrer to Plaintiff’s breach of contract is sustained, so is the demurrer
to Plaintiff’s second cause of action with leave to amend. 
 
D.        Third
Cause of Action – Unjust Enrichment
 
“[T]here
is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment. The phrase ‘Unjust
Enrichment’ does not describe a theory of recovery, but an effect: the result
of a failure to make restitution under circumstances where it is equitable to
do so. [Citation] Unjust enrichment is ‘a general principle, underlying various
legal doctrines and remedies, rather than a remedy itself.’ [Citation.] It is
synonymous with restitution. (Melchior v. New Line Cinema (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 779, 793 [internal quotations omitted].) “As a matter of law, an
unjust enrichment claim does not lie where the parties have an enforceable
express contract.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
1350, 1370 (Durell).)
 
Defendant
Roc Nation asserts that the demurrer to the third cause of action should be
sustained without leave to amend as there is no independent cause of action for
unjust enrichment. While there is no cause of action in California labeled
“unjust enrichment”, an unjust enrichment claim can be made and the remedy is
grounded in equitable principles of restitution. (See Sepanossian v. National Ready Mix Company, Inc. (2023)
97 Cal.App.5th 192.) “Unjust enrichment is generally an inapplicable basis for
restitution where the parties have an enforceable express contract, however,
‘restitution may be awarded in lieu of breach of contract damages when the
parties had an express contract, but it was procured by fraud or is
unenforceable or ineffective for some reason,’ or ‘where the defendant obtained
a benefit from the plaintiff by fraud, duress, conversion, or similar conduct.’
” (Id. citing Durell, supra, 183 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1370.) 
 
As
Plaintiff has pled the existence of an express Label contract existing between
the parties, Plaintiff’s third cause of action fails. The demurrer to the third
cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
E.        Fourth
Cause of Action – Accounting
 
“A cause of action
for accounting requires a showing of a relationship between the plaintiff and
the defendant, such as a fiduciary relationship, that requires an accounting or
a showing that the accounts are so complicated they cannot be determined through
an ordinary action at law.” (Fleet v. Bank of America N.A. (2014) 229
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1413.) “ ‘An action for accounting is not available where the
plaintiff alleges the right to recover a sum certain or a sum that can be made
certain by calculation.’ ” (Ibid.) “The right to an accounting can
arise from the possession by the defendant of money or property which, because
of the defendant’s relationship with the plaintiff, the defendant is obliged to
surrender.” (Teselle¿v. McLoughlin (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th
156,¿179-80.) 
 
Defendant
Roc Nation demurrers to the fourth cause of action on the basis that Plaintiff
fails to allege that a relationship existed between Plaintiff and Roc Nation.
Plaintiff does not allege that Roc Nation had an agreement with Plaintiff or
that a fiduciary relationship existed between them. Plaintiff’s opposition
reiterates that Roc Nation failed to provide accounting but neglects to explain
what relationship the Plaintiff had with Roc Nation. 
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the fourth cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Roc Nation’s demurrer to the Complaint is
sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiff is granted 30 days leave to amend. The
court sets a Non-Appearance OSC RE: Amended Complaint for May 1, 2024, at 8:30
a.m. Defendant to give notice.
