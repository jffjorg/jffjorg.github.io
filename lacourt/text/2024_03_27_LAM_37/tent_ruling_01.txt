Background
 
On
June 5, 2023, Shanah Richardson (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Roya
Gheytanchi; Yousef Gheytanchi (collectively “Defendants”) and Does 1 to 20. 
 
The
operative Complaint alleges ten causes of action: (1) tenant harassment in
violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code §§ 45.33, 45.35; (2) negligent
maintenance of premises; (3) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment (contract);
(4) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment (tort); (5) tortious breach of
warranty of habitability (intentional tort); (6) breach of warranty of
habitability (Civ. Code §§ 1941.1); (7) unlawful entry in violation of Civ.
Code § 1954; (8) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (9) negligent
infliction of emotional distress; and (10) unlawful business practices in
violation of Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200.
 
On October 27, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint which alleges identical causes 
of action.  On November 27, 2024, Defendant filed a
Demurrer with a Motion to Strike.  On 
February 21, 2024,
Plaintiff filed an Opposition.  Defendant
filed a reply on February 27, 2024.  
The matter is now
before the Court.  
request
for JUDICIAL notice
 
The Court may
take judicial notice of records of any court of record of the United States.
(Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may only judicially notice the
existence of the record, not that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky v.
Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
Defendants request that the court
take judicial notice of the courts’ prior ruling on the motion to strike the
Complaint, attached as Exhibit 1 to the Motion to Strike. 
 
Defendants’ request for judicial
notice is granted. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Summary of Allegations in FAC
 
The Complaint alleges
Plaintiff was a tenant in an accessory unit on a single-family home located at 1640 S. Crest Drive, Los Angeles, California 90035 (the “subject
property”) for about 13 years. (FAC ¶¶ 1, 12.) The subject property was subject
to the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance (“LARSO”) and other tenant
protections. (FAC ¶¶ 1, 12.) Defendant Roya Gheytanchi and Yousef Gheytanchi
were her landlords. (FAC ¶¶ 2, 3, 13, 14, Ex. A.)
 
In 2014, Plaintiff informed Defendants that the unit had
mold that contributed to Plaintiff’s health and lung issues, including
pneumonia and “cough-variant asthma.” (FAC. ¶ 18.) In 2015 and 2017, Plaintiff
by email also informed Defendant Roya about mold under the sink and her ongoing
lung issues, including “nonfamilial hypogammaglobulinemia.”  (FAC ¶ 18.) 
 
Defendants refused to fix the underlying water intrusion
resulting in the mold being a recurring issue. (FAC ¶ 19.) Defendants’ refusal
to fix the underlying problem affected Plaintiff’s safety and rights as
a tenant to quiet enjoyment as well as Plaintiff’s health as she developed “a mold allergy, resulted in
urticaria, itching, and swelling over entire body that required emergency room
and Urgent Care visits, steroid shots, courses of prednisone, and multiple
medications” and eventually developed “cough-variant asthma” due to the mold.
(FAC ¶¶ 19, 20.) 
 
Defendants repeatedly refused to fix the rotten door frame
and whenever the front door fell off its hinges, Defendants would screw the
door back into its rotting frame. (FAC ¶¶ 17, 20, 25, 28, 36, 42.) The front
door eventually would not open or close, Plaintiff became injured as a result
of trying to open and close the door, and Defendants intentionally refused to
fix the door. (FAC ¶¶ 42, 45-47.) After the incident, Plaintiff was left
without a locking front door for two months until it was repaired in March 2022
with a new door frame and door. (FAC ¶ 49.) Defendants also refused to fix the
security grate window, causing the Plaintiff serious stress about her safety.
(FAC ¶ 37.)
 
To have Plaintiff voluntarily relinquish her tenancy, in
2019 Defendant Roya informed Plaintiff that “things that broke would no longer
be fixed.” (FAC ¶¶ 22, 23.) Defendant Roya also called Plaintiff a “f-ing
parasite, nothing but a parasite,” and knowing Plaintiff was Christian screamed
“F—your Christianity” whenever Plaintiff walked through the yard to access her
unit. (FAC ¶ 24.) The Complaint asserts that Defendants asked Plaintiff
personal questions about her employment, health, and finances and told her they
wanted her to leave. (FAC ¶ 31.) Defendant Roya would also mock Plaintiff’s
employment, health, and financial status, “comparing her derisively – and
loudly – to ‘normal people. ’ ” (FAC ¶ 31.) 
 
By September 2021, Plaintiff could no longer borrow money
for rent and Plaintiff expressed her intent to apply for a rent relief program.
(FAC ¶ 32.) On September 5, 2021, when rent was due, Defendant Roya berated
Plaintiff for applying for rent relief and not paying rent.  She threatened to evict Plaintiff despite
Defendant Roya knowing that he had no right to do so without following the
relocation process, and illegally accepting rent for an unpermitted unit. (FAC
¶¶ 30, 33, 34.) Defendant Roya went so far as to contact her parents, including
her father who had dementia, to inform them that Plaintiff needed to move out.
(FAC ¶ 38.)
 
On November 12, 2021, Defendants received a letter from
Plaintiff’s attorney informing Defendants that they should stop harassing
Plaintiff and her family, that Defendants knew the unit was illegal and that Defendants
were not permitted to collect rent on the unit, and that the eviction
Defendants threatened was forbidden. (FAC ¶ 39.) The letter also addressed the
Defendants’ refusal to make repairs and informed Defendants that the unit did
not meet habitability standards. (FAC ¶ 39.)
 
On July 14, 2022, the City of Los Angeles issued a
substandard order and ordered that the use and occupancy of Plaintiff’s unit be
discontinued.  (FAC ¶ 51.) In July 2022,
over Plaintiff’s objections, Defendants gave notice that a plumber was coming,
causing Plaintiff concern due to her immune deficiency and concerns about
COVID. (FAC ¶ 55.) 
 
Plaintiff filed this action on July 5, 2023. Defendants now
demurrers to the eighth cause of action. 
 
B.        Eighth Cause of Action – Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
“A cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional
distress requires: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by appellants with the
intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,
emotional distress; (2) severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual
and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the appellants’ outrageous
conduct. [Citation.]  Conduct is
considered outrageous when it is ‘so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that
usually tolerated in a civilized community.’ [Citation.]” (Belen v. Ryan Seacrest Productions, LLC (2021) 65
Cal.App.5th 1145, 1164.) Whether Defendant’s conduct was outrageous, oppressive
or malicious is a question of fact for the jury. (Alcorn v. Anbro
Engineering, Inc. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 499.)
 
Defendants assert
that Plaintiff’s claims of harassment are “not credible” and should not be
considered. (Demurrer at p. 6: 23-24.) Defendants further assert that Plaintiff
did not reveal her autoimmune issues to Defendants until Defendants told her to
leave. (Demurrer at p. 7:102.) However, what knowledge Defendants had about
Plaintiff’s health issues and when they obtained such knowledge are disputed
issues of fact. "On a demurrer a court's function is limited to testing
the legal sufficiency of the complaint. [Citation.] 'A demurrer is simply not
the appropriate procedure for determining the truth of disputed facts.’
[Citation.]” (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 97, 113-114.) Accordingly, the court cannot make the determination
that Plaintiff’s claims are without merit at the pleading stage. "Whether
the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling
upon the demurrer." (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)
Defendants further
assert that “[n]one of the allegations show any willful actions done with the
intent to harm Plaintiff. Any claim that these actions resulted in Plaintiff's
suffering severe mental and emotional distress (FAC at ¶ 113) are disingenuous
and completely self-serving.” (Demurrer at p. 7:3-5.) The court finds that
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that Defendants willfully refused to conduct
repairs on the property, allowed Plaintiff’s unit fall into disrepair and the
mold issue to persist despite knowing of Plaintiff’s health issues with the
intent of having Plaintiff terminate her lease. Defendants’ conduct resulted in
the Plaintiff having to take more anxiety medication and Plaintiff also
suffered physical injury, “including herniated discs in her spine and nerve
damage that causes continued weakness on her left side.” (FAC ¶ 48.) Moreover,
Plaintiff's allegations of harassment by Defendant Roya are properly pled and
show intentionally outrageous conduct. (FAC ¶¶ 22-24, 31.) 
 
Based on the above,
the demurrer to the eighth cause of action is overruled. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
Defendants move to
strike the following from Plaintiff’s Complaint: 
 
1)    
Paragraph 50, page 11,
lines 1-2 ("Defendants' intentional harassment and refusal to fix the door
was intentional, oppressive and malicious.");
 
2)    
Paragraph 66
("Defendants acted with malice and intended to cause injury to
Plaintiff and engaged in
despicable conduction [sic] with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of Plaintiff”;
 
3)    
Paragraph 67
("Defendants' actions demonstrate oppression, because defendants engaged
in despicable conduct that subjected Plaintiff to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of Plaintiff's rights as a tenant";
 
4)    
Paragraph 68 in its
entirety;
 
5)    
Paragraph 93 in its
entirety;
 
6)    
Paragraph 94 in its
entirety;
 
7)    
Paragraph 95
("Defendants’ refusal to maintain the property in a safe and habitable
condition with the intent to force Plaintiff to vacate the property in order to
avoid paying relocation fees, was carried out with a willful disregard for
Plaintiff’s rights and safety as a tenant. As such, Plaintiff may recover
punitive damages. Punitive damages should issue to dissuade Defendants from
violating the rights of their tenants and from putting the health of their
tenants at risk");
 
8)    
Paragraph 115
("Defendants’ actions were outrageous, intentionally causing Plaintiff
severe emotional distress and/or reckless disregard of the probability of
causing emotional distress");
 
9)    
Paragraph 116 in its
entirety;
 
10)
The prayer for exemplary
and punitive damages at paragraph 1(c);
 
11)
The prayer for exemplary
and punitive damages at paragraph 5(b); and
 
12)
The prayer for exemplary
and punitive damages at paragraph 8(b)
 
Upon motion, the court shall strike an allegation of punitive
damages unless the ultimate facts showing an entitlement of such relief have
been pled by a plaintiff. (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.) To survive a motion to strike, claims for punitive
damages must provide facts showing the defendant acted maliciously, with the
intention or willful and conscious disregard of her likelihood to cause harm. (Hillard
v. A.H. Robins Co. (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 374, 391-392.) To state a claim
for punitive damages under Civil Code § 3294, a plaintiff must allege specific
facts showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression, or
fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿
The basis for punitive damages must be pled with specificity; conclusory
allegations devoid of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Id.)
 
¿“Malice”
is defined in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the
defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others.” “Oppression” is defined as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”
(Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in the case
law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods,
Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78
Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud means “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit,
or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on
the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal
rights or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294(c)(3). 
 
The court finds
that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged Defendants harassed Plaintiff by
repeatedly threatening Plaintiff with eviction and harassing her by calling
Plaintiff  a “parasite,” refusing to
maintain the unit in a habitable condition despite knowing about the need for
repairs regarding the mold, and the adverse impact the lack of repairs had on
Plaintiff’s health.(FAC ¶ 19, 20, 25, 28, 36, 43, 45-47, 62.) As
Plaintiff alleges that such conduct was intentionally done to cause Plaintiff to
vacate her unit, the court finds the allegations are sufficient to support the
finding that Defendants’ conduct was oppressive as Defendants acted with
willful and conscious disregard for Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant. (Civ. Code
§ 3294(c)(2).) 
 
Therefore,
Defendants’ motion to strike is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the eighth
cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is overruled.
Defendants’ motion to strike is denied. The court orders Defendants to file an
Answer within 10 days.  The Court also
schedules an OSC Re: Filing of Answer and a Case Management Conference for
April 25, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendants to give notice.
