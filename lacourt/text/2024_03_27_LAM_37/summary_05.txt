And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Lee to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Kim. The court has found that the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract is without merit. The court has also found that the demurrer to the second and third causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation are overruled. The court has determined that the issues raised by the demurrer are disputes of fact, which cannot be adjudicated on demurrer.

Defendant Lee is ordered to file an Answer to the Complaint within 10 days. The court has set a Non-Appearance OSC Re: Lee's Answer for April 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant Lee is ordered to give notice of this hearing.
