Background
 
On October 10, 2023,
Kevin Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Bruce Haebong Lee (“Lee”);
Seven Seung Woo Bae (“Bae”); Masters Realty Group, Inc. (“MRG”); Masters Realty
& Investment (“MRI”) (a corporation); Masters Realty & Investment (a
business); and Does 1 – 50.) The operative Complaint alleges three causes of
action: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Fraud, and (3) Negligent Misrepresentation.

 
On January 16,
2024, Defendant Lee filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint. Plaintiff
opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Summary
of Allegations in Complaint
 
The
Complaint alleges that Defendant Lee with the assistance of his son-in-law,
Defendant Bae, operate a real estate brokerage under the names of Defendants
MRG, MRI, and Masters Realty & Investment. (Compl. ¶ 13.) Even though
Defendant MRG has been suspended with the California Secretary of State,
Defendants Lee and Bae have been using checks with the name of MRG, Defendant
Lee has reported to the Department of Real Estate that he is doing business as
“Masters Realty & Investment,” a corporation duly organized by Defendant
Bae, who is a shareholder, director, and officer of said corporation. (Compl. ¶
13.) The Complaint further alleges that Defendant Lee is the alter-ego of
Defendant MRG. (Compl. ¶¶ 14-16.) Defendants Lee and Bae are also alleged to be
the alter-ego of Defendant MRI. (Compl. ¶¶ 17-19.) 
 
On
July 19, 2010, Kim and Defendant MRG entered into a written Independent
Contractor Agreement (the “Agreement”). (Compl. ¶ 20, Ex. A.) Plaintiff asserts
that under the Agreement, Defendant MRG would charge Plaintiff certain fees,
including $90.00 for the “Errors & Omissions Insurance” (hereinafter
“E&O Policy”) for each transaction Kim was involved in. (Compl. ¶ 21.) 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant Lee made representations to Plaintiff that Defendant MRG
as the broker would obtain the E&O Policy for a fee of $90.00, later
increasing to $100.00, as charged in each of Plaintiff’s transactions. (Compl.
¶¶ 21, 22.) In October 2019, Plaintiff was a salesperson representing a buyer
named Daniel Moon (“Moon”) in connection with the purchase of a business
property (the “Montebello Transaction”). Upon the close of escrow of the
Montebello Transaction, on or about July 22, 2020, Plaintiff requested and
received a Commission Disbursement Request, reflecting that Defendants Lee and
MRG charged $100.00 for the E&O Policy for the Montebello Transaction.
(Compl. ¶ 25, Ex. 2.) On December 21, 2021, Moon filed a Complaint against the
sellers in connection with the Montebello Transaction and named Plaintiff as
one of the defendants. (Compl. ¶¶ 25, 27, Ex. 3, 5.) 
 
On
January 3, 2023, Plaintiff received an email in response to a notice sent by
the Department of Real Estate stating that MRG license no. 01503134 expired on
June 30, 2021, telling Plaintiff the notice should be disregarded and that
Defendants were now using the license no. 01004371. (Compl. ¶ 26.) Due to the
Moon lawsuit, Plaintiff requested that Defendants submit the Moon Lawsuit to
the E&O Policy carrier to tender the defense on Kim’s behalf, which Bae
did, but on April 17, 2023, Defendants received an email from the E&O
Policy carrier denying the request. (Compl. ¶¶ 28, 29, Ex. 6.) The final denial
letter from the E&O Policy carrier, dated June 5, 2023, states that the
Policy is effective on or after September 30, 2020, but because the Montebello
Transaction opened and closed in 2019 and Plaintiff allegedly made the final
and full payment to the sellers on April 17, 20204, the Montebello Transaction
was not covered. (Compl. ¶ 29, Ex. 6 at pp. 7-8.) Defendants did not have an
E&O Policy during the time the Montebello Transaction occurred despite
Defendants charging Plaintiff a $100.00 fee for the E&O Policy on July 22,
2020. (Compl. ¶ 29, Ex. 2.) 
 
Plaintiff demanded
that Defendants retain counsel to provide a defense to the Moon lawsuit, but
Plaintiff was forced to retain his own counsel and Defendants only paid
$5,000.00 to Lee and Oh. (Compl. ¶¶ 30, 31, Ex. 7.) Plaintiff’s counsel in the
Moon lawsuit was able to obtain Plaintiff’s dismissal but Plaintiff incurred
$26,085.26 in legal fees. (Compl. ¶ 32, 33, Ex. 8.) Plaintiff has now filed
suit against Defendants relating to their misrepresentation regarding the
E&O Policy coverage alleged to be included as part of the Agreement.  
 
Defendant Lee now
demurs to all causes of action alleged in the Complaint. 
 
B.        First Cause of Action Breach of Contract

 
The elements of a
claim for breach of contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach,
and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v.
Goldman (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must
demonstrate damages proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v.
American Dynasty (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.) Furthermore, “the
complaint must [also] indicate on its face whether the contract is written,
oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co.
(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452. at 458-59 citing CCP, § 430.10(g).) “If the action
is based on an alleged breach of a written contract, the terms must be set out
verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written instrument must
be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Id. at p. 459 [internal
citations omitted].)
 
Plaintiff asserts
that the Agreement, attached as Exhibit A, provides that Defendants as brokers
for Plaintiff would charge certain fees for providing the E&O Policy, but
Defendants failed to do so, causing Plaintiff to incur damages in excess of $26,085.25.
(Compl. ¶¶ 35-40.) Attachment A to the Agreement, incorporated by reference, provides
that a $90.00 fee will be charged per transaction related to the Errors and
Omission Insurance. (Compl. Ex. 1 at Attachment A.) 
 
Defendant Lee’s claim
that the breach of contract claim is improperly pled is without merit.
Defendant Lee maintains that the “nowhere in the Agreement or its Exhibit A
provides the E&O policy was to cover and protect Plaintiff.” (Demurrer at
p. 4:2-3.) Per Defendant Lee’s contention, the contract is ambiguous because
the Agreement provides for an “Error & Omissions Insurance” (“E&O”) fee
charged to and paid by Plaintiff, but if such a fee was not for Plaintiff’s
benefit, then for whose benefit was it? 
 
Defendant Lee
advocates that fees in Attachment A “clearly indicates the four items under
the ‘fees’ section were to cover increased costs on the side of the
broker incurred for handling the transactions with Plaintiff as agent because
the insurance premium for broker increases based on the number of
transactions and the amount of transactions brought by agents.” (Demurrer at p.
4:12-16 [emphasis original].) Assuming arguendo that Defendant’s interpretation
of the Agreement is correct, this raises the question as to whether Plaintiff
understood that the E&O Insurance fee was not for his benefit and such
coverage was not provided by MRG. If so, then this raises a triable issue of
fact as to whether there was a meeting of the minds when the agreement was
signed. 
 
In the absence of
express language explaining the purpose of the E&O Insurance fee, the
purpose of the fee is ambiguous, and the court would have to admit parol
evidence. (See CCP, § 1856; Civ. Code §1625.) This includes Plaintiff’s
assertion that Defendants initially asked the E&O Insurance carrier to
provide coverage for the benefit of Plaintiff. Furthermore, while the Agreement
was between Plaintiff and MRG, Plaintiff has pled that Defendant Lee is the
alter ego of MRG such that they should be treated as the same entity. (Compl.
¶¶ 14-16.) Plaintiff’s alter ego allegations are not challenged by Defendant
Lee on demurrer. 
 
 “On a demurrer a court's function is limited
to testing the legal sufficiency of the complaint. [Citation.] 'A demurrer is
simply not the appropriate procedure for determining the truth of disputed
facts.’ [Citation.]” (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 97, 113-114.) By asking the court to accept Defendant Lee’s
interpretation of the purpose of the E&O Insurance Fee charged to
Plaintiff, Defendant Lee is asking the court to adjudicate a disputed issue of
fact. For this reason, the court overrules the demurrer to the first cause of
action. 
 
C.        Second and Third Causes of Action for
Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation 
 
“The elements of
fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation
(false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity
(or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631,
638.) “In California, fraud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory
allegations do not suffice.” (Id. at p. 645.) Specificity “necessitates pleading facts which show how, when,
where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Id.
at p. 631.)
 
“The elements of negligent misrepresentation, a form of deceit,
are misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact, without reasonable
ground for believing it to be true, and with intent to induce another's
reliance on the fact misrepresented; ignorance of the truth and justifiable
reliance on the misrepresentation by the party to whom it was directed; and
resulting damage.” (Home Budget Loans, Inc. v. Jacoby & Meyers Law Offices (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1285.)
 
The
elements of a cause of action for negligence are well established. They are (a)
a legal duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the
breach as the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.” (Ladd v.
County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917 [internal quotation marks
omitted].) The existence and scope of a property owner’s duty are legal
questions for the court. (Annocki v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.) 
 
For the fraud action,
the Complaint alleges that (a) in entering into the Agreement, Defendants
through Defendant Lee made the representation that in paying $90.00 per
transaction, later increased to $100.00, E&O Insurance would be provided;
(b) Defendant MRG was an active corporation under the laws of the state of
California; (c) MRG had a valid license; (d) Defendants obtained E&O policy
for the Montebello Transaction; (e) Plaintiff would have the E&O Policy for
the Montebello Transaction; and (f) Plaintiff would be covered under the
E&O Policy in the Moon lawsuit. (Compl. ¶ 42.) The Complaint asserts that
the representations were false, Defendants knew they were false when the
representations were made, and the representations were made with the intent to
induce Plaintiff to enter into the Agreement and work as a salesperson for
Defendant and to continue charging fees. (Compl. ¶¶ 43, 45.) For the negligent
misrepresentation cause of action, the Complaint asserts that the Defendants
“acted negligently in making the aforementioned false and fraudulent
representations in that they made them without any reasonable ground for
believing them to be true.” (Compl. ¶ 50.) “Moreover, Defendants did not have
any information which warranted such representations.” (Compl. ¶ 51.) 
 
Defendant Lee asserts
the Agreement clearly provided that the insurance fee was to cover the
increased premium on the broker’s side. 
There was no discussion that Plaintiff would be covered by the
insurance. However, Plaintiff’s Complaint disputes Defendants’ proposed
interpretation and asserts that the representations were made to induce
Plaintiff to work as a salesman for Defendants’ benefit. 
 
Moreover, while
Defendant Lee points to various provisions in the Agreement, none expressly
state that the purpose of the E&O Insurance fee was to cover Defendants’
insurance premium rather than provide insurance coverage to Plaintiff. “The demurrer tests the pleading alone, not evidence or
other matters; defendants cannot set forth allegations of fact in their
demurrers which, if true, would defeat plaintiff's complaint.” (Fuhrman v. California Satellite Systems (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d
408, 422–423 disapproved on other
grounds  by Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205.) Here, what the parties
understood at the time they entered into the Agreement remains a disputed issue
fact, as well as what alleged representation were made through Defendant Kim.
Therefore, the demurrer to the second and third causes of action are overruled as
issues of fact cannot be adjudicated on demurrer. 
 
Based on the above
Defendant Lee’s demurrer is overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Lee’s demurrer to the Complaint
is overruled. Defendant Lee is to file an Answer 
within 10 days.  The court sets a Non-Appearance OSC Re: Lee’s
Answer for April 30, 2024, at 
8:30 a.m. 
Defendants to give notice.
