And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the petitioner's ex parte application to change their name. A Livescan has been run and filed, which shows that the minor has no criminal history. The petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the proposed decree is not accurate, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected version. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
