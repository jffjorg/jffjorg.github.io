PROCEEDINGS
 
Kyle
Brown v. Beach House Design & Development, et al.
19STCV20315
1.      Beach House Design & Development’s Motion to
Compel Deposition and for Monetary Sanctions    
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Beach
House Design & Development’s Motion to Compel Deposition and for Monetary
Sanctions is denied without prejudice. 
 
            Background
 
Plaintiff filed his Complaint on June 11, 2019.
Plaintiff was employed by O’Rourke Construction (“O’Rourke”), a subcontractor
hired by the general contractor Defendant Beach House Design & Development
(“Beach House”) for a construction project. On June 16, 2017, Plaintiff fell
from a scaffold on the jobsite located at 1727 Monterey Boulevard, Hermosa
Beach, California 90254. Plaintiff alleged a sole cause of action for General
Negligence. Cross-Complaints were also filed by moving Defendant Beach House
and by Defendant and moving party A&D Plastering, Inc. (“A&D”) another
subcontractor on the project.
 
Motions to Compel Deposition 
 
Where the witness whose deposition is sought is not a
party, a subpoena must be served to compel the witness’ attendance, testimony,
or production of documents. CCP §§ 2020.010(b), 2025.280(b); Terry v. SLICO
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 352, 357. Personal service of a deposition subpoena
obligates a California resident to appear, testify and produce documents
specified in the subpoena, and to appear in any proceedings to enforce
discovery.  CCP § 2020.220(c).  The deposition subpoena may be enforced by a
motion to compel compliance pursuant to CCP § 1987.1.  If a nonparty disobeys a deposition subpoena,
the subpoenaing party may seek a court order compelling the nonparty to comply
with the subpoena within 60 days after completion of the deposition
record.  CCP § 2025.480(b); Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007)
156 Cal.App.4th 123, 127.  
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 1987.1:  “If a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue
therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably
made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court's own motion
after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it
upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate
to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including
unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.”
 
Defendant moves to compel the deposition of non-party Sam
Maceachern. However, as freely admitted by Defendant, Sam Maceachern was not properly
personally served with a deposition subpoena. Instead, he was served by email.
(Decl., William G. Sorkin, ¶ 8, Ex. B.)  Without
proper personal service of a deposition subpoena, a non-party deponent cannot
be compelled to appear for deposition. 
 
Thus, the motion to compel deposition of Sam
Maceachern and request for sanctions is denied without prejudice. 
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
