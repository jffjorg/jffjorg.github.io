And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions filed by Jamshied Pourtemour to compel Peter Maginnis and Stephanie Maginnis to respond to discovery requests, as well as to impose monetary sanctions. The judge finds that the motions are deemed moot, in part, and granted, in part, because the plaintiffs have since served responses to the discovery requests. However, the judge grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiffs, which totals $1,934.50. This amount is calculated based on the time and expense incurred by the defendant in preparing and appearing for the hearing. The judge orders the plaintiffs to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the date of the ruling.
