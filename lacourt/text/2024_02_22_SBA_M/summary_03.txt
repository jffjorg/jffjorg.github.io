The attorney states that there has been a complete breakdown in the relationship with the clients due to a breach of the representation agreement. The court finds that the attorney has provided sufficient reasons for withdrawal and has complied with the requirements for filing and serving the motion. As a result, the attorney is relieved of their duties as counsel for the clients effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order.
