Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Lisa Berberian
The court has
considered the moving papers.
The court GRANTS Counsel’s motion to be relieved
as counsel for Lisa Berberian. 
 
Discussion
Ronald W. Makarem (“Counsel”)
moves to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiff Lisa Berberian. The
court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw and such a motion should
be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398.)
CRC, Rule 3.1362
(Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to
be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under CCP § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a
consent under CCP § 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the
notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have
appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on
the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-053)).
 
Here, Counsel has complied
with CRC, Rule 3.1362. Counsel filed the required forms and declared that the
facts which give rise to this motion include those supporting withdrawal under
the California State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, 1.16. (Makarem Decl. ¶
2.) Counsel further states that the specific facts which give rise to this
motion are confidential and required to be kept confidential but would provide
further details in an in-camera hearing outside the presence of all other
parties. (Id.) 
 
The Court
therefore GRANTS Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel upon proof of
service of this order. 
 
It is so ordered.
