The Court
considered the Petition.
The
hearing on Petitioner CHA Hollywood Medical Center, L.P.’s Petition to Release
Property from Mechanic’s Lien is CONTINUED TO
_____ at ____ a.m. in Department 45 at the STANLEY MOSK COURTHOUSE.  At least 16 court days before the next
scheduled hearing, Petitioner must file and serve supplemental papers
addressing the errors discussed herein. 
Failure to do so may result in the Petition being placed off calendar or
denied.
Background
            On May 21, 2024, Petitioner CHA
Hollywood Medical Center (“Medical Center”) filed the instant verified Petition
to Release Property from Mechanic’s Lien (“Petition”) against Respondent Chino
Steel Inc. (“Chino Steel”).  The Petition seeks an order releasing
property commonly known as 1300-1322 North Vermont Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90027
( “Subject Property”) from a mechanic’s lien filed on July 20, 2023, by
Respondent Chino Steel.  (Pet. p. 2.)
            On
July 2, 2024, Petitioner filed an Amended Notice of Hearing indicated that the
Petition would be heard on July 30, 2024 in Department 45.
On July
24, 2024, Petitioner filed a Notice of Non-Opposition to the Petition.  To date, no opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
After a
mechanic’s lien has been recorded, “[t]he owner of property or the owner of any
interest in property subject to a claim of lien may petition the court for an
order to release the property from the claim of lien if the claimant has not
commenced an action to enforce the lien within the time provided in Section
8460.”  (Civ. Code, § 8480(a).)  A claimant must commence an action to enforce
a lien within 90 days of recording the lien, otherwise, “the claim of lien
expires and is unenforceable.”  (Civ. Code,
§ 8460(a).)  However, the 90-day time
limit to commence an action to enforce a lien does not apply if there was an
agreement to extend credit and a notice of that fact was recorded within 90
days after recordation of the claim of lien or more than 90 days after
recordation of the claim of lien but before a purchaser or encumbrancer for
value and in good faith acquires rights in the property.  (Civ. Code, § 8460(b).)
Discussion
A. Service
Requirements
“The petitioner
shall serve a copy of the petition and a notice of hearing on the claimant at least
15 days before the hearing.  Service
shall be made in the same manner as service of summons, or by certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the
claimant as provided in Section 8108.”  (Civ. Code § 8486(b).)  Civil Code § 8108 provides addresses at which
a respondent must be served, depending on the title of the person to be
served.  For example, a claimant should
be served at the address on the “claimant’s contract, preliminary notice, claim
of lien, stop payment notice, or claim against a payment bond, or on the records of
the Contractors' State License Board.”  (Civ. Code § 8108(e).)  The petitioner bears the burden of proving
that he or she complied with service and date for hearing requirements.  (Civ. Code. § 8488(a).)
On June 14,
2024, Petitioner filed Proof of Service indicating that the Petition and all
supporting documents were personally served on Respondent on May 29, 2024, at
10604 Horley Ave, Downey, CA 90241. 
Subsequently, on July 15, 2024, Petitioner filed Proof of Service
indicating that the Amended Notice of Hearing was personally served on
Respondent at the 10604 Horley address on July 7, 2024.
Here, Petitioner
has not met its burden of proving that Respondent has been properly served with
the Petition, Notice, and supporting documentation as the Court is not
presented with any proof that 10604 Horley Ave, Downey, CA 90241, was Respondent’s
proper address.  The Claim of Mechanic’s Lien lists Respondent’s address as 515
E. Banning Street, Compton, CA 90222, which is also the address where
Petitioner served Respondent with the notice of demand to release mechanic’s
lien.  Accordingly, the Court cannot
determine whether Petitioner has complied with the service requirements of the
instant Petition.
B. Petition Requirements 
            Civil
Code § 8484 requires that the petition for release order be verified by the
petitioner and allege the following:
(a) The
date of recordation of the claim of lien. A certified copy of the claim of lien
shall be attached to the petition.
(b) The
county in which the claim of lien is recorded.
(c) The
book and page or series number of the place in the official records where the
claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The
legal description of the property subject to the claim of lien.
(e)
Whether an extension of credit has been granted under Section 8460, if so to
what date, and that the time for commencement of an action to enforce the lien
has expired.
(f) That
the owner has given the claimant notice under Section 8482 demanding that the
claimant execute and record a release of the lien and that the claimant is
unable or unwilling to do so or cannot with reasonable diligence be found.
(g)
Whether an action to enforce the lien is pending.
(h)
Whether the owner of the property or interest in the property has filed for
relief in bankruptcy or there is another restraint that prevents the claimant
from commencing an action to enforce the lien.
A
property owner may not petition for a release order until he or she gives the
claimant notice demanding that the claimant execute and record a release of
lien claim at least ten days before filing the petition. (Civ. Code § 8482.)
On April
10, 2024, Petitioner sent Respondent Chino Steel a letter, by messenger and
certified mail, at the address listed on the Claim of Mechanic’s Lien (515 E.
Banning Street, Compton, CA 90222), demanding a release of the lien.  (Pet. p. 3, Ex. C; Gasparyan Decl. ¶ 6.)  Respondent did not respond to Petitioner’s
demand or provide proof of releasing the lien. 
(Ibid.) 
Subsequently,
on May 21, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant verified Petition, which states
that the mechanic’s lien, Instrument No. 20230478110, was recorded with the Los
Angeles County Recorder’s Office on or about July 20, 2023.  (Pet. p. 2, Ex. B; Gasparyan Decl. ¶ 3.)  Petitioner has attached a certified copy of
the mechanic’s lien.  (Ibid.)
The
Petition sets forth the legal description of the Subject Property and states
that no action was filed within 90-days of recording of the lien.  (Pet. p. 2, Ex. A; Gasparyan Decl. ¶ 3.)  Petitioner also states that no extension of
credit has been recorded, Petitioner has not filed for bankruptcy, and no other
restraint exists preventing Respondent from filing an action to enforce the
lien.  (Pet. pp. 2-3, Gasparyan Decl. ¶
4.)
Petitioner
seeks to have the Subject Property released from the mechanic’s lien and
requests an order granting reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
Although
Petitioner has complied with all requirements for the instant Petition, the
Court is not presented with sufficient proof that Petitioner complied with the
service requirements.
Accordingly,
the hearing on Petitioner CHA Hollywood Medical Center, L.P.’s Petition to
Release Property from Mechanic’s Lien is CONTINUED TO
_____ at ____ a.m. in Department 45 at the STANLEY MOSK COURTHOUSE.  At least 16 court days before the next
scheduled hearing, Petitioner must file and serve supplemental papers
addressing the errors discussed herein. 
Failure to do so may result in the Petition being placed off calendar or
denied.
Moreover,
Petitioner may request attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to a separate noticed
motion under Civil Code § 8488.
            It
is so ordered.
