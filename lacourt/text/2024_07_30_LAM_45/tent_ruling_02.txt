Motion to Compel Defendant to Produce
Documents in Response to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents
Pursuant to Deposition Notice         
The Court considered the moving, opposition, and reply
papers. 
            The motion is GRANTED. 
 
Defendant is ordered to serve responses to Requests for Production
pursuant to the Deposition Notice without objections within 20 days of this
order. Defendant and Defense Counsel are also ordered to pay monetary sanctions
jointly and severally in the amount of $810.00 to Plaintiff through its counsel
of record. 
 
Plaintiff served the Notice of Deposition and
Document Requests on December 1, 2023. (Innabi Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A.) The
deposition was scheduled to commence on December 20, 2023. (Id.) Before
the deposition Defense counsel requested the deposition be continued to January
18, 2024. (Id.) Plaintiff served the Amended Notice of Deposition and
Document Requests on December 18, 2023. (Id., Ex. B.) On the day of the
deposition Defendant and his counsel failed to produce the documents. (Id.
at ¶ 5.) Defendant argues that after a diligent search, it was unable to locate
the documents it initially believed it had. Defendant’s counsel states “[w]hen
I was corresponding with Plaintiff’s counsel, I was unaware that the documents
did not exist and based on discussions with my Client we both believed the
documents did exist but eventually Defendant was unable to locate them after a
diligent search.” (Diefenbach Decl. ¶ 8; See also Innabi Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. C.) 
 
The Court notes in its opposition, Defendant cites
to Tony Holder’s declaration. However, Tony Holder’s declaration was not
attached to the instant motion but rather the previous Motion to Compel Initial
Requests For Production, Set One. 
 
Tony Holder, the principal and owner of Defendant 1st
Choice Design & Development states “Defendant is ultimately unable to
produce the documents because the project file was taken from a former employee
who worked as the project manager for both projects, Mr. Alberto Dominguez.”
(Holder Decl. ¶ 2.) Mr. Holder further states “[t]he records that 1st Choice
did have that were not lost at the project site were lost when 1st Choice
changed office locations in approximately June of 2021 . . . 1st Choice does not have any
responsive documents in its custody and control that it can make available for
production. I initially believed the project documents existed but was unable
to locate them after a diligent search and realized that Mr. Dominguez was in
charge of the documents and then other documents were lost during a move.” (Id.
at ¶¶ 4-6.) The Court notes Defendant fails to provide any evidence for its
speculations of the former employee taking the records. 
 
Therefore, the Court grants the motion under CCP
section 2031.300 and imposes the reasonable amount of $810.00 (1.62 hours at $500
per hour) in monetary sanctions on the Defendant and Defense Counsel, jointly
and severally. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
