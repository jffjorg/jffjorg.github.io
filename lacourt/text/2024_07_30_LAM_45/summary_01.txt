And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for monetary sanctions filed by Plaintiff H-G APTS, LLC against Defendants Nathan F. Cogan and Sara G. Cogan. The motion was filed on February 7, 2024, and is unopposed. The motion seeks sanctions in the amount of $5,000.00 based on the failure of Defendant Nathan F. Cogan to attend a Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC) held on February 2, 2024. The Court has considered the moving papers and finds that sanctions are inappropriate in this case. The Court notes that counsel for the Cogan Trusts was present at the MSC and had authority to settle for the defendants, and that the failure of Defendant Nathan F. Cogan to attend the MSC was not egregious conduct. The motion is therefore denied without prejudice.
