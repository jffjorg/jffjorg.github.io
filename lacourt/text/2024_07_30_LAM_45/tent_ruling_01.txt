Motion for Monetary Sanctions    
 
The Court has

The motion is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
Background
            This
is an action arising from the alleged breach of a lease agreement. On April 2,
2019, Plaintiff H-G Apts, LLC filed a Complaint against Defendants Wendy
Wilkins; Avi Joseph Elias; David Cogan; Nathan F. Cogan, Trustee of the Nathan
F. Cogan Survivor’s Trust Dated March 7, 2005; Nathan F. Cogan, Trustee of the
Sara G. Cogan Decedent’s Share Trust Dated March 7, 2005; and Does 1 through
20, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Intentional Misrepresentation/Fraud; (3) Negligent Misrepresentation; (4)
Unjust Enrichment; (5) Declaratory Relief; and (6) Tort of Another. 
            On
September 30, 2021, Nathan Cogan, as trustee of the Nathan F. Cogan Survivor’s
Trust dated March 7, 2008, and trustee of the Sara C. Cogan Decedent’s Share
Trust, dated March 7, 2005, filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
            On
October 2, 2023, the Court ordered all parties in this case to participate in
the Court’s Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC) Program. (10/02/23 Minute
Order.) The Court ordered “Counsel . . . to complete the MSC intake form and
submit it to the program . . . .” (10/02/23 Minute Order.) Notice was waived.
(10/02/23 Minute Order.) 
            On
February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Sanctions Against
Defendants Nathan F. Cogan, Trustee of the Nathan F. Cogan Survivor’s Trust
Dated March 7, 2005 and Nathan F. Cogan, Trustee of the Sara G. Cogan
Decedent’s Chare Trust Dated March 7, 2005 (the “Cogan Trusts”) and their
Attorney Jonathan Dawson in the amount of $5,000.00. Plaintiff seeks sanctions
against the Cogan Trusts and their attorney on the grounds that, although
counsel for the parties attended the MSC on February 2, 2024, Defendant Nathan
F. Cogan, who is the trustee for the Cogan Trusts, failed to attend the MSC. 
            The
motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the motion was required to have been
filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
Legal
Standard
            “On
the court’s own motion or at the request of any party, the court may set one or
more mandatory settlement conferences.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1380(a).)
“Trial counsel, parties, and persons with full authority to settle the case
must personally attend the conference, unless excused by the court for good
cause. If any consent to settle is required for any reason, the party with that
consensual authority must be personally present at the conference.” (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1380(b).) “All counsel and persons with settlement authority
must attend the settlement conference in person, unless prior arrangements have
been made with the court for that person to appear by telephone” according to
Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rules, Rule 3.245. Failure to comply
with the Local Rules of the Los Angeles County Superior Court may result in the
imposition of sanctions. (Los Angeles Sup. Ct., Local Rules, Rule 3.10.) “[T]he
court may order a person, after written notice and an opportunity to be heard,
to pay reasonable monetary sanctions to the court or an aggrieved person, or
both, for failure without good cause to comply with the applicable rules.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.30(b).) 
Discussion 
a.      
Evidence in Support of the Motion 
             In support of the motion, Plaintiff’s counsel,
Gary Fidler (“Fidler”), provides a declaration. Counsel declares that Defendant
Nathan F. Cogan did not attend the February 2, 2024 MSC and there was no
discussion in advance of Mr. Cogan not attending the MSC. (Fidler Decl., ¶ 3.)
There was no discussion of the MSC being held virtually and no separate
guidelines and instructions were provided. (Fidler Decl., ¶ 4.) On October 2,
2023, the Court ordered an MSC following the parties’ agreement. (Fidler Decl.,
¶¶ 1,5; Ex. A.) Plaintiff requests sanctions of $5,500.00. (Fidler Decl., ¶ 6.)
Mr. Fidler’s hourly rate is $500.00 per hour and more than 11 hours was spent
as to preparing for the MSC and drafting the instant motion. (Fidler Decl., ¶
6.) Mr. Fidler states that of the 11 hours of attorney time that were spent,
one hour will be spent preparing the reply and attending the hearing on the
motion. (Fidler Decl., ¶ 6.) 
b.      Analysis 
The Court finds that given that Plaintiff does
not argue that the failure of Defendant 
Nathan F. Cogan to appear at the MSC was not
the cause of the parties failing to reach a settlement at the MSC, the Court
finds that sanctions are inappropriate. The Court has discretion to award
sanctions for a party’s failure to appear at an MSC. Counsel for the Cogan
Trusts was present at the MSC and presumably had authority to settle for such
defendants. The Court does not find that the failure of Defendant Nathan F.
Cogan to appear at the MSC is egregious conduct to warrant the imposition of a
substantial amount of monetary sanctions. However, the Court reminds all
parties to comply with the applicable rules of court. 
            Based on the foregoing, the motion for
monetary sanctions filed by Plaintiff H-G Apts, LLC is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

It is so
ordered.
