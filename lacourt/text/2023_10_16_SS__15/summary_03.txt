And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on several motions filed by defendants Union Carbide, Ferguson Enterprises, and J-M Manufacturing. The motions include:

* Motion to exclude evidence of Union Carbide's relationship with Dow Chemical
* Motion to exclude evidence of Ferguson Enterprises' existence
* Motion to exclude references to J-M Manufacturing's compliance with 1972 OSHA labeling regulations
* Motion to exclude evidence of lobbying activities
* Motion to exclude testimony and videos from William Longo and Richard Hatfield
* Motion to exclude references to a 1989 proposed EPA ban on asbestos
* Motion to exclude references to incidents where people died or were injured as a result of Union Carbide's chemicals
* Motion to exclude evidence of successor liability
* Motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages

The court finds that the defendant has not shown that the plaintiff does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain the needed evidence to establish a cause of action. The court also finds that the plaintiff has submitted evidence of disputed issues of material fact, including the defendant's knowledge of the dangers of asbestos, its failure to warn users of the dangers of its products, and its failure to recall its asbestos-containing products.

The court grants the motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages, finding that the defendant has not shown that the plaintiff's evidence is not clear and convincing proof of malice, fraud or oppression.
