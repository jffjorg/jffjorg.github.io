And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions in limine filed by the parties in this case. The court has denied Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 1, which sought to preclude mention of products eliminated by summary judgment orders, as the motion was too vague. The court has denied Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 2, which sought to exclude evidence of other defendants not at trial, as the motion was too vague. The court has granted Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 3, which sought to exclude evidence of complaints filed in bankruptcy cases and an order from the Garlock bankruptcy case, as the evidence and arguments were deemed to have little probative value and would be prejudicial.

The court has granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 4, which sought to exclude arguments that chrysotile does not cause mesothelioma, as the motion was too vague. The court has denied Defendants' Motion in Limine Nos. 1-29, which sought to exclude a December 2020 publication by the EPA entitled "Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part I: Chrysotile Asbestos", as the court could not determine at this point that the publication was irrelevant or prejudicial.

The court has denied Defendants' Motion in Limine Nos. 35-38, which sought to exclude arguments that there is no safe level of asbestos and every exposure contributes to a cumulative dose, as the motion was too vague. The court has denied Defendants' Motion in Limine No. 36, which sought to preclude references to them as manufacturers, as the motion was too vague. The court has denied Defendants' Motion in Limine No. 37, which sought to preclude references to Covid and other diseases as comparable to mesothelioma, as the motion was too vague.

The court has denied O'Reilly Auto Enterprises' Motion in Limine, which sought to preclude a 1986 EPA document entitled "Guidance for Preventing Asbestos Disease Among Auto Mechanics" and the Don't Blow It video, as the court could not determine at this point that the evidence was irrelevant, hearsay, or unduly prejudicial.
