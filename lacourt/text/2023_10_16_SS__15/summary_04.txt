Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Charles B. Chrystal Company. The ruling denies the motion for summary judgment and grants the motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action and punitive damages.

The Judge found that the defendant has not met the burden of showing that it has conclusively negated a necessary element of the plaintiff's case or demonstrated that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires a trial. The defendant's motion for summary judgment was based on the argument that the plaintiff has no evidence that the defendant was the exclusive or primary supplier of talc for the products in question, but the Judge found that the plaintiff's discovery responses were factually devoid and did not support this argument.

The Judge also found that the plaintiff's claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment were insufficient and failed to show disputed issues of fact. The Judge granted the motion for summary adjudication as to these claims.

Finally, the Judge found that the plaintiff's request for punitive damages was also insufficient and failed to show disputed issues of fact. The Judge granted the motion for summary adjudication as to this claim.

The Judge's ruling is subject to change after review by the parties and the Court.
