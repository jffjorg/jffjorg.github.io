The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions filed by the parties. The Judge has denied several motions without prejudice to objections at trial, including motions to exclude evidence of workplace asbestos limits, talc pleurodesis, and epidemiological studies. The Judge has also granted several motions, including a motion to exclude evidence of complaints filed in bankruptcy cases, evidence of claims related to mine and mill employees, and communications with OSHA about a proper definition of asbestos. The Judge has denied motions to exclude evidence of a letter written by Richard Attanoos and evidence of documents from Johns-Manville Corporation. The Judge has also granted a motion to bifurcate punitive damages. The Judge has determined that the motions are either too vague or that the evidence is relevant and admissible. The Judge's ruling is subject to change after hearing further arguments from the parties at trial.
