Award and Request of Trial after Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration. The request
is DENIED due to lack of notice.  Further,
form ADR-104 is incomplete and it was not filed with a complaint, commencing a
new action since a case concerning the attorney-client fee dispute involved in
the arbitration is not already pending.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
