ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
            On January 8, 2021, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Nicole Abril (“Defendant”)
for subrogation, stemming from an automobile collision between Defendant, on
the one hand, and an individual insured by Plaintiff’s automobile insurance
policy, on the other hand.  (Compl.)  Plaintiff compensated the insured for claimed damages
in the amount of $18,416.96 and filed the instant claim against Defendant for
allegedly causing the damages.  (Ibid.
pp. 2-3.)  On March 24, 2021, Defendant
filed an Answer.
 
On February 2,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate
and Enter Judgment Upon Breach (“Stipulation”), signed by both parties, to
dismiss the action on the premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for
the settlement amount of $12,433.56.  On the
same day, the Court dismissed the entire case without prejudice pursuant to the
Stipulation.
 
On April 23, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment
(“Motion”).  Plaintiff has submitted the
motion on the moving papers and will not appear at the hearing.  (Mot. p. 2.)
 
No opposition has been filed.

Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
CCP § 664.6, provides a summary
procedure that enables judges to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a
judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’ settlement.  In particular, the statute provides:
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following:
 
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized
in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.
 
CCP §
664.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).
 
III.             
Discussion
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction
 
“‘[V]oluntary
dismissal of an action or special proceeding terminates the court’s
jurisdiction over the matter.’  (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If
requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)”  (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los
Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) 
“‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements
of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a
settlement agreement.’”  (Ibid.
(quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc.
(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for
the trial court to retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the
same three requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed
necessary for section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request
must be made (1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been
dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002)
97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).)  “The ‘request
must be express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and
unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at
440).)
 
Here, the
parties signed a Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter
Judgment Upon Breach (“Stipulation”) containing the parties’ agreement for the
Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to
enforce the terms of the stipulation and enter judgment in the event of
default.  (Stipulation ¶ 3.)  Prior to the dismissal of this action, the
Stipulation was signed by the parties and submitted to the Court.  (Ibid. at p. 3.)  On the same day, the Court dismissed the
entire case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation and expressly stated
that it “shall retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.”  (2-3-23 Order.)
 
The Court finds that the
Stipulation complies with § 664.6 requirements and the Court has retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in this
action.
 
B. Entry of Judgment
 
The Stipulation
Agreement filed on February 2, 2023, provides that Plaintiff and Defendant
agreed to dismiss the action on the premise that Defendant would compensate
Plaintiff for the settlement amount of $12,433.56.  (Stipulation ¶ 2.)  Pursuant to the Stipulation, Defendant would
make an initial payment of $8,983.56 by June 30, 2022, and beginning on
February 1, 2023, make monthly payments of $125, until the settlement was paid
in full.  (Ibid.) 
 
The Stipulation
also provides that in the event Defendant fails to make timely payments,
Plaintiff will mail a letter to Defendant regarding the default.  (Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  If Defendant does not remedy the default
within fourteen (14) days of receiving notice, “then plaintiff will be entitled
to have any dismissal in this action set aside and judgment entered for the
settlement amount, minus credit for payments received, plus any costs
associated with entering the judgment not to exceed $500.”  (Ibid.)  The declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel shall
be sufficient proof for judgment to be entered. 
(Ibid.)  
 
On April 23,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for an order to vacate the dismissal
and enter judgment.  (Memorandum p. 1.)  According to Plaintiff’s counsel, Defendant’s
insurance carrier made a one-time payment of $8,983.86; however, Defendant
failed to make any payments.  (Reese
Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)  Around March 12, 2024, Plaintiff
mailed Defendant a letter regarding the missed payments; however, Defendant has
not made any additional payments.  (Ibid.
at ¶¶ 6-7, Ex. C.)
 
Plaintiff seeks
to have the dismissal set aside and judgment entered in the amount of $3,949.70
as follows: $12,433.56 (settlement amount), minus $8,983.86 (payment made by
Defendant’s insurance carrier), plus $500 (court costs).  (Ibid. at ¶ 8.)  The Court costs consist of $370.00 complaint
filing fee, $80 service of process fee, and $60.00 motion fee.  (Ibid.)
 
The Court finds the
Stipulation to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Proc. § 664.6.  Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant defaulted
on payments and has not made any additional payments after Plaintiff sent
notice.  Thus, a valid
and signed stipulation agreement was breached and the Court retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment upon breach. 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment is GRANTED.  Dismissal entered on February 3, 2023, is
vacated, and judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant for $3,949.70
as follows: principal amount of $3,449.70 plus court costs of $500.
