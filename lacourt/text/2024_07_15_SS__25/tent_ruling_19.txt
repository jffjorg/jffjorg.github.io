Defendant 3D
Engineering & Manufacturing Inc. (“Defendant”)
moves for an order setting aside and vacating the Judgment obtained

opposed the motion. 
 
ANALYSIS 
                                                                                                                   
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or
her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 473, subd. (b).) 
 
Here, Defendant requests an order setting aside and vacating the Judgment
entered on February 20, 2024 against Defendant. The motion is timely filed
because Defendant filed the original motion on May 22, 2024, within six months of
the Judgment. Further, Defendant provides its responsive pleading to the action
as required by the Code of Civil Procedure. (Yurcich Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. “B.”) Defendant has demonstrated good cause exists to set aside and
vacate the Judgment as it was entered through mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or excusable negligent of Defendant’s prior counsel. Specifically, the Declaration
of Adolfo Landeros, President of Defendant, provides that on
March 7, 2023, Plaintiff agreed to settle this matter by executing a “Release
of Claims" with Defendant for claim numbered WC-CM-816672.
(Landeros Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. “C.”) Per the Release, Plaintiff agreed, in
consideration of payment by Defendant in the amount of $15,231.14, to release Defendant
and dismiss with prejudice his claim numbered WC-CM-816672. (Id.) Defendant’s
prior counsel paid the amount of $15,231.14 directly to Plaintiff mistakenly
instead of sending the payment to the Office of Labor Commissioner. (Landeros Decl., ¶ 6; Ex. “D.”) Plaintiff
received and cashed the cashier's check numbered 1123446748 in the amount
$15,231.14. (Landeros Decl., ¶ 7.) The
award of the Labor Commissioner against Defendant on February 20, 2024 was
based on mistake as this matter should have been dismissed by mutual agreement
of the parties. (Landeros Decl., ¶ 7.)

Engineering & Manufacturing Inc.’s Motion to Set Aside/Vacate 
Judgment Entered on 02/20/2024 is
