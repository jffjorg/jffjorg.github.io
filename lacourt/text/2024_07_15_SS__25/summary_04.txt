English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant. The defendant allegedly caused an automobile collision and failed to make timely payments under a settlement agreement. The plaintiff compensated the insured for claimed damages and filed a subrogation action. The settlement agreement provides that the defendant would make an initial payment of $8,983.56 and monthly payments of $125 until the settlement was paid in full. The plaintiff mailed a letter to the defendant regarding the default, but the defendant failed to make any additional payments. The judge finds that the settlement agreement is valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6 and that the plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant defaulted on the payments. Therefore, the judge grants the motion and enters judgment against the defendant in the amount of $3,949.70, which includes the principal amount of $3,449.70 and court costs of $500.
