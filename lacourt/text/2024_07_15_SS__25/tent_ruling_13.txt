ANALYSIS
 
I.          Petition
for Declaration of Abandonment of Mobilehome   
A.               
Legal Standard 
An abandoned mobilehome
means a mobilehome which: (1) is located in a mobilehhome park on a site for
which no rent has been paid to the management for the preceding 60 days; (2) is
unoccupied; (3) a reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned; and (4)
is not permanently affixed to the land. (Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)(A)-(D).) 
“After determining a
mobilehome in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome, the management
shall post a notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome for not less
than 30 days, and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United States mail,
postage prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known address and to
any known registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and to any known
holder of a security interest in the abandoned mobilehome. This notice shall be
mailed by registered or certified mail with a return receipt requested.” (Civ.
Code § 798.61(b).) 
“Thirty or more days
following posting pursuant to subdivision (b), the management may file a
petition in the superior court in the county in which the mobilehome park is
located, for a judicial declaration of abandonment of the mobilehome . . .
[c]opies of the petition shall be served upon the homeowner, any known
registered owner, and any known person having a lien or security interest of
record in the mobilehome by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing copies
to those persons at their last known addresses by registered or certified mail
with a return receipt requested in the United States mail, postage prepaid.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 798.61(c)(1).) 
“If, at the hearing, the
petitioner shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the criteria for an
abandoned mobilehome has been satisfied and no party establishes an interest
therein at the hearing and tenders all past due rent and other charges, the
court shall enter a judgment of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to
which the petitioner is entitled, and award attorney’s fees and costs to the
petitioner.” (Civ. Code § 798.61(d)(2).) 
B.        Discussion  
Petitioner seeks a
declaration that the Mobilehome is abandoned. (Pet. p. 3.) The Petition alleges
that the Mobilehome is located at a mobilehome site for which no rent has been
paid to the management for the 60 days preceding November 15, 2023. (Id.,
¶ 5(c).) Petitioner reasonably believes that the Mobilehome has been abandoned.
(Id., ¶ 5(d).) Petitioner alleges that the Mobilehome is unoccupied, and
a reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned. (Id., ¶¶ 5(a)-(b).)
The Notice of Belief of Abandonment was posted on the Mobilehome on November
15, 2023, and was sent certified mail on such date pursuant to CCP § 798.61(b).
(Id., ¶ 5(c); Exh. 1.)  
In his declaration, Mr.
Ortiz declares the following: Respondent is the registered owner of the
Mobilehome. (Ortiz Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. 2.) The Mobilehome is currently unoccupied
and has been unoccupied prior to November 15, 2023, which is the date the
Notice of Belief of Abandonment was posted on the Mobilehome. (Ortiz Decl., ¶
7; Exh. 1.) The Mobilehome is not currently affixed to the mobilehome space and
is located in a mobilehome park on a site for which no space rent or storage
has been paid to the management since March 2023. (Ortiz Decl., ¶ 8.) The
monthly storage charges owed from April 1, 2023 through March 1, 2024, twelve
months, is calculated at $1,425.00 per month based upon the former space rent
Respondent was paying at the time the Mobilehome was abandoned. (Ortiz Decl., ¶
9; Exh. 4.) The monthly storage charge is reasonable as local storage for a
similarly sized mobilehome would exceed that amount if commercial space for a
mobilehome storage was actually available. (Ortiz Decl., ¶ 10.) The total
amount of storage charges owed is $17,100.00. (Ortiz Decl., ¶ 10.) 
In his supplemental
declaration, Mr. Ortiz declares that the Mobilehome is abandoned within the
meaning of CCP § 798.61. (Ortiz Supp. Decl., ¶ 3.) No rent for the space has
been paid to Petitioner since March 2023. (Ortiz Supp. Decl., ¶ 4.) A
reasonable person would concur that no one is occupying the Mobilehome. (Ortiz
Supp. Decl., ¶ 5.) Respondent has not been seen at the Premises and no one else
has been seen or reported to be occupying the mobilehome. (Ortiz Supp. Decl., ¶
5.) The Mobilehome has been unattended since October 2023 and his office has
performed basic yard maintenance and upkeep. (Ortiz Supp. Decl., ¶ 6.) The
Mobilehome is not permanently affixed to the space. (Ortiz Supp. Decl., ¶ 7.) 
Petitioner has shown that the
Mobilehome meets the definition of abandoned pursuant to CCP § 798.61(a)(1). 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Petition to
Declare Mobile Home Abandoned.
