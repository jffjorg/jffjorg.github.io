And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motion to lift the stay and reopen the case. The case was stayed pending arbitration, but the defendants failed to pay the required arbitration fees, causing the American Arbitration Association to close the case. As a result, the judge finds that the defendants are in default and it is appropriate to reinstate the case. The judge is ordering the case to be reset for trial and requiring the moving party to give notice of this ruling and attach a copy of the tentative ruling to the notice.
