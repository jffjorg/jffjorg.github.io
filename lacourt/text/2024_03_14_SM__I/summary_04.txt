And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a fee motion by Shiri after sustaining his demurrer without leave to amend. The plaintiff had contended that no fees were recoverable because the contract cause of action was dismissed before filing the operative pleading. However, the court disagrees, stating that the "writing was on the wall" when the demurrer was sustained and the court commented that it did not believe any amendment could save the theory. The court finds that dismissing the cause of action at that point is too late to avoid the fee provision in the contract.

The court also agrees with Shiri to some extent, finding that fees can be awarded to the extent they can be disaggregated from other work and that the hourly rate is reasonable. However, much of the recovery sought is not for work pertaining to Shiri in particular. The court disallows certain expenses, including those related to settlement talks and notice of related cases.

The court will confirm that the amounts set forth in the declaration were actually billed and paid in full without deduction or offset. Shiri is to submit a proposed order consistent with the foregoing within 15 court days, which will be reviewed by opposing counsel for approval as to form only before submission to the court.
