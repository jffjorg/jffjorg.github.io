And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the motion for summary judgment without prejudice, meaning the defendant can bring the motion again. The judge is troubled by the plaintiff's counsel's improper statements to the court and the defendant's counsel's failure to provide complete evidence. The judge finds that the defendant's representations regarding the provenance of the documents were true and correct, and that the defendant had every right to insist on mediation and break off settlement discussions. However, the judge is also critical of the defendant's counsel for not providing the entire email exchange to the court. The judge will allow the defendant to bring the motion again and will set a new trial date at the upcoming TSC.
