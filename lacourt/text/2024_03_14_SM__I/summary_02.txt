This tentative ruling discusses the ongoing motion for attorney fees. After the last hearing, the parties agreed on the amount of billing for the attorney's "getting up to speed" efforts. The total fees after the reduction come out to $396,051. The motion is granted in this amount. The plaintiff is required to submit a proposed order within 10 court days, and should present it to the defendant for approval as to form only. Note that the defendant did not agree or acquiesce to the motion otherwise, and any appellate rights other than this specific agreement are preserved.
