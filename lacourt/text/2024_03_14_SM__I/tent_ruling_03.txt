 Case Number:  21SMCV01168    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  I This is not
that complicated a motion, in the court’s view. 
The court is generally familiar with securities jurisprudence as well as
fraud jurisprudence.  The court believes
that the current 20 page limit ought to be enough, but, as an accommodation to
defendant, will allow an overlength brief to the extent of 25 pages.  The opposition may also be 25 pages.  The reply will remain 10 pages.
As such, the
application is GRANTED IN PART.
