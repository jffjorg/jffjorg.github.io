 Case Number:  20SMCV01086    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  I At the last
hearing, the court continued the motion to see if the parties could agree on
the amount of billing reflecting an attorney “getting up to speed.”  The parties have done so and agreed on an
amount.  The amount of fees after that
reduction is $396,051.  And the motion is
GRANTED in that amount.  Plaintiff to
submit a proposed order to that effect within 10 court days.  Plaintiff should first present the order to
defendant for approval as to form only.
To be clear,
although the parties agreed on the amount of the reduction for “getting up to
speed,” defendant did not otherwise agree or acquiesce to the motion.  Any appellate rights other than this specific
agreement are preserved.
