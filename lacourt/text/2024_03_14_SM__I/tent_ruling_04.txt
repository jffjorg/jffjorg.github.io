 Case Number:  22SMCV00510    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  I This is a fee
motion by Shiri after the court sustained his demurrer without leave to
amend.  Plaintiff contended that no fees
were recoverable in part because it dismissed the contract cause of action
before filing the operative pleading. 
The court disagrees.  As Shiri
stated at the last hearing, the “writing was on the wall.”  In the previous order, the demurrer to the
contract action had been sustained and the court commented that it did not
believe that any amendment was possible that would save the theory.  Specifically, when granting leave to amend,
the court stated that “Because this is the first direct adjudicated attack on
the complaint, the court will give plaintiffs leave to amend.  But leave to amend will likely not be granted
again, and, frankly, the court does not see how plaintiffs can plead around
this.”  Dismissing the cause of action at
that point is too late to avoid the fee provision in the contract on the
voluntary dismissal clause of Civil Code section 1717 (although it had the
effect of reducing the fee because no further motion practice was required for
that cause of action). As to the
amount, the court agrees with Shiri to some extent, specifically, that fees can
be awarded to the extent they can be disaggregated from other work and that the
hourly rate is reasonable.  However, much
of the recovery sought is not for work pertaining to Shiri in particular.  Specifically, the court DISALLOWS the
