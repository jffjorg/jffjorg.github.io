 Case Number:  24PSCP00271    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
PETITION FOR ORDER CONFIRMING ARBITRATION
AWARD AND FOR THE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT is DENIED without prejudice because
the final award is different than the judgment sought, and Petitioner has
not filed a petition to correct the final award (which otherwise appears
untimely). 
 
Background
 
On June 10, 2024, Petitioner Bill Me Later, Inc., a
Delaware Corporation, as servicing agent for WebBank filed a petition to
confirm an arbitration award that was made on 5/2/24 between Petitioner and
Respondents Hong Supply, Inc., a California Corporation, d/b/a Hongville and
Ting Hong Yeung (the guarantor) regarding a 6/20/23 loan agreement in the
amount of $150,000.00.[1]
 
On June 13, 2024, Petitioner filed a ‘MOTION FOR ORDER
CONFIRMING ARBITRATION AWARD AND FOR THE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT’ to confirm the
arbitration award that is based upon the 6/10/24 petition submitted. (Motion p.
2:12-14.)
 
Legal Standard
 
Petitioner brings forth the motion pursuant to Section 9
of the Federal Arbitration Act (which governs all claims and demands relating
to the dispute resolved by the arbitration) and Code of Civ. Pro., § 1286.2. A petition to confirm an award shall be served and
filed not later than four years after the date of service of a signed copy of
the award on the petitioner. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1288.) The required
contents of a petition and response to a petition are set out in Section 1285.4
and 1285.6. The court must confirm the award as made unless it corrects or vacates
the award or
dismisses the proceeding. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner seeks judgment against Respondents for $105,034.18
jointly and severally, plus interest and costs, calculated as follows:
$96,009.18 for Principal under Agreement + $5,750.00 Attorneys’ Fees Costs and
$ 3,275.00 in Arbitration Fees. (The Final Award was served upon Respondent on
May 14, 2024 and served upon the Guarantor on May 17, 2024.) 
 
However, the award
itself provides a different total award: $104,034.18.
(Petition, Ex. 8(c), p. 23 of 33 of PDF.) Petitioner acknowledges this
discrepancy footnote 1 of its petition attributing it to an “error by
Arbitrator Krueger.”  But this court, as
noted in the petition, “shall enter judgment in conformity with the
arbitration award.” (Memorandum of Points and Authorities, p. 5:10-11,
citing Code of Civ. Proc., § 1287.4, emphasis added.) While the court has the
power to correct an award if the court determines that “[t]here was an
evident miscalculation of figures” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.6., subd. (a),
emphasis added)—and here, there is an “evidence miscalculation” as the
principal under the agreement, attorney fees, and arbitration fees are the same
in the final award but merely tallied incorrectly—the court cannot do so
until “[a] petition or
response requesting that the award be corrected has been duly served and
filed.” (Code of Civ. Proc., §1286.8, subd. (a).) 
 
With respect to time for service and filing of a petition
to correct an award, the petition must be
filed at least 10 days but not more than 100 days after the date that the award was served on the petitioner.
(Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4; Knass v. Blue Cross of California (1991)
228 Cal.App.3d 390.) 100 days from the date the award was served on
Petitioner, May 2, 2024, is August 10, 2024; therefore, it appears any
attempt at correcting the award untimely. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, as the award Petitioner seeks
this court to confirm is not the award made by the arbitrator, the petition is
denied without prejudice.
