  Case Number:  22PSCV00536    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiffs’ Counsel Anthony Francisco’s Motion to
Be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED without prejudice OR, in the
alternative, continued. 
 
Background
 
This is a fraud case with respect to real property.
Plaintiff ORALIA LUNA GAMBOA (“Oralia”) as conservatrix for both the person and
the estate of Urbano Luna (“Urbano”) alleges the following against Defendant
Pascual Luna (“Pascual”), individually and as trustee of the Pascual Luna
Revocable Living Trust Dated September 16, 2016: In 1991, the subject property
was transferred to Pascual Luna, an unmarried man, and Urbano Luna, a single
man, as joint tenants; Pascual is Urbano’s uncle. In 2003, there was another
grant deed recorded stating that the property is granted to Pascual Luna and
that "this is a bonafide gift and the grantors received nothing in
return." (Complaint ¶4.) In 2016, there was another transfer by a trust
transfer deed to THE PASCUAL LUNA REVOCABLE LIVIN TRUST DATED SEPTEMBER 16,
2016, with defendant PASCUAL LUNA as the trustee of this living trust. (¶5.)
In 2020, when Plaintiff Oralia was appointed conservatrix of both Urbano and
his estate due to his ongoing disability, Oralia and Urbano discovered that the
2003 transfer was void as Pascual forged Urbano’s signature. (¶6.) 
 
On June 6, 2022, the instant action was filed for: 
 
1.     Constructive
Fraud by Forgery
2.     Cancellation
of Deeds and Reversal of Transfer to Trust;
3.     Abuse
of Disabled Person; and 
4.     Money
Owed
 
On July 11, 2022, Defendant filed an answer.
 
On October 18, 2024, the instant motion was filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel Anthony Francisco seeks to be relieved as counsel
for Oralia Luna Gamoba on the ground that “Continued representation is likely
to result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.” (MC-052 form.) 
 
Here, the court cannot determine whether Plaintiff will be
prejudiced by granting the motion because no proof of service has been filed indicating whether Plaintiff
and Defendant have been served with notice of the motion. This of notable
concern as there is an FSC is set for 12/3/24 and a jury trial is set for
12/10/24. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, absent adequate notice to any party,
the motion is denied without prejudice or, in the alternative, continued to a
date TBD.
