 Case Number:  23PSCV02095    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice; (1)
Plaintiff’s Counsel is not entitled to attorney fees and (2) insufficient
evidence of a $5,000 payment. 
 
Background
 
This is a fraud case. Plaintiff Young Woo Kyea alleges the
following against Defendant Jun Mo Koo: In 2022 and 2023, Plaintiff sent a
total of $70,026.46 to Defendant under Defendant’s instruction that they would
start a trucking business together. Defendant never intended to start a
business with Plaintiff. (See Complaint p. 1.)
 
On December 12, 2023, default was entered against Defendant.
 
On September 10, 2024, the instant application for default
judgment was filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment against Defendant
in the total amount of $84,300.21, calculated as follows: $70,026.46;
$8,174.94; $5,000.00; and $1,098.81. There are two defects with the
application. 
 
1.    
Evidence 
 
With respect to evidence, Plaintiff has submitted copies of
bank statement showing the wire transfers including the dates, amounts and
sender/recipient information. However, the complaint is somewhat unclear as to a $5,000 payment.

 
According to the complaint, Plaintiff sent a total of
$70,026.46 to Defendant (to Global Holding Group LLC and CubeWork), but the
bank statements are for the following amounts: $10,766.46, $30,000.00,
$9,620.00, $4,640.00, and $10,000.00. As for the remaining $5,000, the
complaint in paragraphs 10 and 11 alleges as follows: “Defendant have tricked Plaintiff
into buying a used truck through an acquittance [sic] of Defendant.
Defendant directed Plaintiff to sell Plaintiff’s car to the owner of the
truck that was just purchased and give owner of the truck $5,000.”
(emphasis added.) Accordingly, it appears Plaintiff was directed to buy a used
truck (presumably for $5,000) and, simultaneously, sold his own vehicle.
The court seeks clarification as to this allegation. That aside, there is no
evidence of the $5,000. Assuming it was $5,000 cash, Plaintiff’s
declaration does not squarely attest to such a payment. 
 
Therefore, the court denies the application without
prejudice as to this $5,000.00. 
 
2.    
Attorney Fees
 
With respect to attorney fees, Plaintiff’s Counsel
acknowledges no statute or contract allows for its recovery, but requests
attorney fees in the “interest of fairness and justice.” 
 
The court cannot absent a statute, contract, or other rule
award a party attorney fees. 
 
Therefore, any subsequent application should omit a request
for attorney fees. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing defects, the application is denied
without prejudice.
