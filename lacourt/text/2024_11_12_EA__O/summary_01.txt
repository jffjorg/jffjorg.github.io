As for the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by counsel Anthony Francisco to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Oralia Luna Gamboa. The motion is denied without prejudice or, in the alternative, continued to a date to be determined, due to the lack of proof of service indicating whether the plaintiff and defendant have been served with notice of the motion. The case involves a fraud claim related to real property, with the plaintiff alleging that the defendant, Pascual Luna, forged the signature of Urbano Luna, the plaintiff's uncle, on a 2003 grant deed. The plaintiff seeks to cancel the deeds and reverse the transfer of the property to Pascual Luna's living trust. The judge notes that there are upcoming court dates, including a hearing on December 3, 2024, and a jury trial on December 10, 2024, and that the denial of the motion may prejudice the plaintiff.
