And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the petition for order confirming arbitration award and for the entry of judgment, without prejudice. The petition was filed by Bill Me Later, Inc. (Petitioner) to confirm an arbitration award made on May 2, 2024, between Petitioner and Respondents Hong Supply, Inc. and Ting Hong Yeung (Guarantor) regarding a $150,000.00 loan agreement. However, the final award provided a different total award amount of $104,034.18, which is different from the judgment sought by Petitioner. Petitioner acknowledges the discrepancy but attributes it to an "error by Arbitrator Krueger". The court cannot correct the award until a petition to correct the award is filed, and any attempt to correct the award would be untimely. Therefore, the petition is denied without prejudice.
