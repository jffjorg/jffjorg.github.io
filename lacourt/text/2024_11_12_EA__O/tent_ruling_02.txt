Legal
Standard
 
The court in Kono v. Meeker (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 81, 86, provided the following description on claims of
exemption.
 
As a general rule, all property of a
judgment debtor is subject to enforcement of a money judgment. [Citations.] The
California Constitution, however, requires the Legislature to protect ‘a
certain portion’ of a debtor's property from forced sale. (Cal. Const., art. XX, § 1.5.) The purpose of this requirement is
to protect enough of the debtors' property from enforcement to enable them to
support themselves and their families, and to help shift the cost of social
welfare for debtors from the community to judgment creditors. [Citations.] [¶]
To that end, California has enacted a ‘comprehensive and precisely detailed
scheme’ governing enforcement of money judgments. [Citations.] 
 
The kinds and degrees of
property exempt from
levy are described in various statutes, generally set forth in sections 704.010
through 704.210. Other California statutes and by federal law provide
additional exemptions. (Ahart, Cal. Practice Guide: Enforcing Judgments and
Debts (The Rutter Group 2014) ¶ 6:821, p. 6E–1 (rev. # 1, 2013).) 
A judgment creditor who desires to contest a claim of exemption must, within 10 days after the date
of the mailing of the notice of claim of exemption (here, 9/25/24), file with
the levying officer a notice of opposition to the claim of exemption. The judgment
creditor's notice of opposition to the claim of exemption must
be executed under oath and must, amongst other requirements, provide the
amount of the judgment debtor's claim of exemption which the judgment creditor claims is not exempt and the factual and legal
grounds for the judgment creditor's opposition to the claim of exemption. (Civ. Proc.
Code, § 706.128, subd. (d)., (e).)  
Discussion 
 
According to the claim of exemption, Defendant,
who has no spouse, needs all earnings exempt to support her and her
family. (See ‘Notice Subject: Claim of Exemption Hearing/filed by Sheriff
Department’ Filing, p. 2 of 8 of PDF.) Defendant’s gross monthly income is
$5,600 with a monthly take-home pay of $4,516.94. From this take home
pay, total monthly expenses amount to $5,236.00. The court accepts that rent,
food and household supplies, utilities, clothing, medical and dental payments,
insurance, transportation expenses, and laundry and cleaning expenses are
necessary expenses. This cannot be reasonably disputed. 
 
In opposition, the creditor indicates
that none of the earnings are exempt (section 4(a)) but then in section 5,
indicates that of the total monthly expenses, Defendant’s claim of $180 in
monthly credit card expenses and $333.03 in a monthly loan payment are not
exempt because they are not necessary to support the debtor’s family. Thus,
it appears that all the expenses are exempt except for the monthly
credit expenses and monthly loan payment (total of $513.03). 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s claim for
exemption would be GRANTED IN PART, by way of modifying the wage garnishment
order to subject only $513.03 per month to garnishment.
