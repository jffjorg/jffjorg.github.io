And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Jun Mo Koo, fraudulently took $70,026.46 from him, and that they were supposed to start a trucking business together. However, the judge found that there are defects in the application. Firstly, the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence of a $5,000 payment, which is allegedly tied to the purchase of a used truck. The judge is seeking clarification on this issue. Secondly, the plaintiff's counsel is not entitled to attorney fees, as there is no statute or contract allowing for their recovery. The judge has denied the application without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to re-file with the necessary evidence and without the request for attorney fees.
