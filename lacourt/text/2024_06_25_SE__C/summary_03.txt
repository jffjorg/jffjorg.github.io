Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike the portions of the complaint related to allegations of punitive damages. The defendant, Miguel Angel Pacheco, argued that the allegations were insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. However, the judge found that the allegations in the complaint, which include facts about Pacheco's impaired driving and reckless behavior, are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge noted that the allegations demonstrate a "conscious disregard of probable injury to others" and that the plaintiff has adequately pled facts to support a claim for punitive damages. As a result, the defendant's motion to strike is denied.
