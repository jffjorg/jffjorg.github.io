The judge has also noted that the Plaintiff has filed six motions based on the same theories, and that there are two further discovery motions on the court's calendar that raise the same legal issues. The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel and granted the Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the Plaintiff has not acted with substantial justification.
