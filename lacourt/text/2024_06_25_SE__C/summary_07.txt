Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions and applications filed by the parties. The judge has denied the defendants' ex parte applications to shorten time and/or specially set their motions. However, the judge has advanced the hearing dates for some of the defendants' motions, including the motion for leave to conduct an independent medical examination (IME) and the motion to strike. The hearing dates for some other motions remain unchanged. The judge notes that the parties are not foreclosed from seeking a trial continuance in a different department. The judge's decision is based on the statutory preference set forth in CCP 36(b), which gives preferential treatment to personal injury actions. The judge's ruling is intended to manage the court's docket and ensure that all parties have a fair opportunity to present their arguments.
