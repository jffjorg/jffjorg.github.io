And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel production of documents and deem requests for admission admitted. The plaintiff, Veronica G. Robles, filed a lemon law action against FCA US LLC (Defendant) on April 13, 2023, alleging that the 2019 Jeep Wrangler was delivered with serious defects and nonconformities to warranty. The plaintiff served written discovery on the Defendant on August 2, 2023, but the Defendant failed to respond. The plaintiff moved to compel production of documents and deem requests for admission admitted, arguing that the Defendant's failure to respond was a waiver of any objections.

The Court has granted the plaintiff's motion, finding that the Defendant failed to timely respond to the request for production and that there is no evidence of the purported responses. The Court has ordered the Defendant to produce verified responses within 30 days of the order, without objections. Additionally, the Court has deemed the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the plaintiff's motion admitted.
