And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment. The defendant, Miguel Oyoque, filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy protection in 2011 and was granted a discharge in 2011. The default judgment was entered against the defendant in 2010. The judge found that the debt existed prior to the date the bankruptcy case was filed and that the discharge order eliminated the defendant's legal obligation to pay the debt. The motion is unopposed and the court does not find any other facts as to why the debt should not be discharged due to the bankruptcy.
