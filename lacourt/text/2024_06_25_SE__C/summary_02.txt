And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to stay the action pending the outcome of two unrelated cases on appeal. The defendant, ABC Unified School District, moved to stay the action on April 25, 2024, citing the need to ensure judicial economy and common sense. The defendant argued that the two unrelated cases currently pending before the First and Second Districts of the Court of Appeal involve the question of whether AB 218 violates the Gift Clause of the California Constitution, an issue underlying this current litigation. The defendant contended that if the Court of Appeal determines AB 218 is unconstitutional, the case would not be able to proceed and any work performed before then would be wasteful. The defendant also argued that it cannot settle the case while the two cases are before the Court of Appeal.

The plaintiff, Jane Doe, opposed the motion, arguing that the defendant has not made any showing it is likely to succeed on the merits and that other trial court decisions regarding the constitutionality of AB 218 are not binding on this court. The plaintiff also pointed out that there is no evidence on how the Court of Appeal will rule on the issue.

The judge found that the defendant's motion was speculative and that judicial economy is best served by going forward with the litigation. The judge also noted that if the Court of Appeal provides conflicting rulings, the parties can proceed with discovery and motion work. Therefore, the judge denied the defendant's motion to stay and allowed the litigation to proceed.
