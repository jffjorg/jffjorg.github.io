English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration in a lemon law action brought by Angelica Garcia de Heredia and Jorge Heredia against Hyundai Motor America. The dispute arises from the purchase of a 2022 Hyundai Sonata, which has defects and nonconformities that substantially impaired its use, value, and safety. The judge finds that the arbitration agreement in the warranty contract is valid and that the plaintiffs are estopped from refusing to arbitrate their claim against Hyundai. The court concludes that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration.
