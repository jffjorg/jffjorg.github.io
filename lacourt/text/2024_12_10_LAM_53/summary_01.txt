And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the plaintiff, Tammy Davis. The first motion is to compel the defendant, AIDS Healthcare Foundation, to serve a further response to a special interrogatory. The second motion is to compel the defendant to serve further responses to requests for production of documents.

The judge denied both motions because the plaintiff did not submit a meet and confer declaration that satisfies the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The meet and confer declaration is a requirement that the parties must attempt to resolve their disputes informally before filing a motion.

The judge also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,700. The judge found that the plaintiff did not make a reasonable attempt to informally resolve each issue presented by the motion, as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure.

The judge ordered the plaintiff to pay the sanctions to the defendant within 30 days of the date of service of the order. The judge also ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
