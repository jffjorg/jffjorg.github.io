  Order RE:
 
defendants’ motion for protective order
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants California Landmark
Group, R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management, LLC              
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Protective Order 
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendants California Landmark Group, Inc., R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG
Management LLC (“Defendants”) request that the court issue a protective order
that Janney and Janney Attorney Service Inc. (“Janney”) is not required to
comply with the Deposition Subpoena for the Production of Business Records served
on it by plaintiff Martin Ruben Ramirez (“Plaintiff”). 
Defendants filed the pending motion on September 20, 2024, for a
hearing date of May 27, 2025.  On
September 26, 2024, the court granted the ex parte application to advance the
hearing date on this motion, ordering that (1) the hearing on this motion was
advanced from May 27, 2025 to December 10, 2024, and (2) deponent Janney’s
obligation to comply with the Deposition Subpoena for the Production of
Business Records is stayed until the court issues a ruling on the motion.  (Sep. 26, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  Defendants gave Plaintiff notice of the
court’s ruling on October 2, 2024.  (Def.
Oct. 2, 2024 Notice of Ruling, pp. 2:13-16, 7-9 [proof of service].)  
On November 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a document entitled “Plaintiff’s
Omnibus Opposition to Defendant InterSolutions, LLC’s Notice of Motion and
Motion for Protective Order Against Plaintiff Martin Ramirez from Taking the
Deposition of InterSolutions, LLC’s CEO Brian Kares and General Counsel Stuart
Skylar and Request for Monetary Sanctions Against Plaintiff in the Amount of
$1,460,” in which Plaintiff appears to oppose the motion for a protective order
filed by defendant InterSolutions, LLC on September 23, 2024.  (Nov. 25, 2024 Opp., pp. 1:16-17 [citing Sep.
23, 2024 Mot. for Protective Order], 6:24-26 and Exs. A-B [Notices of
Deposition served on Brian Kares and Stuart Sklar].)  Plaintiff’s opposition identifies the hearing
date on the aforementioned motion to be December 10, 2024.  (Nov. 25, 2024 Opp., p. 1.)  However, defendant InterSolutions, LLC’s
motion for a protective order is not set on December 10, 2024; rather,
Defendants’ motion for a protective order as to the Deposition Subpoena for the
Production of Business Records served on Janney is set for that date pursuant
to the court’s September 26, 2024 order.[1]  (Sep. 26, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.) 
Thus, it appears that Plaintiff mistakenly believed that defendant
InterSolutions, LLC’s motion for a protective order is the motion that is the
subject of the December 10, 2024 hearing in this case, and therefore has not
filed an opposition to the pending motion for a protective order filed by Defendants.

            In order to give Plaintiff an
opportunity to file an opposition to the correct motion, the court finds that
it is appropriate, and therefore exercises its discretion, to continue the
hearing on Defendants’ motion for a protective order.[2]

 
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendants California Landmark Group, Inc., R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management’s
motion for a protective order is continued to March 7, 2025, at 10:00 a.m., in
Department 53. 
            The court orders defendants
California Landmark Group, Inc., R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 10, 2024
