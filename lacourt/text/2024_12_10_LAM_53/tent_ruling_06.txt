  Order RE:
 
defendant’s special motion to strike first
  amended complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Kelli Bielema        
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:     Plaintiffs Amanda Swulius, Bunny’s Buddies,
and The Organic Bunny, Inc.   
Special Motion to Strike First Amended Complaint
Defendant Kelli Bielema (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order
striking the First Amended Complaint filed against her by plaintiffs
Amanda Swulius, Bunny’s Buddies, and The Organic Bunny, Inc. (“Plaintiffs”) pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, also known as the anti-SLAPP
(“strategic lawsuit against public participation”) statute.
The court finds that Defendant and Plaintiffs have not complied with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113. 
“Except in a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no
opening or responding memorandum may exceed 15 pages.”   (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1113, subd.
(d).)  That “page limit does not include
the caption page, the notice of motion and motion, exhibits, declarations,
attachments, the table of contents, the table of authorities, or the proof of
service.”  (Ibid.)  
Defendant’s opening memorandum, excluding the caption page, table of
contents, table of authorities, and signature page, amounts to a total of 25
pages, thereby exceeding the page limit by 10 pages.  (Def. Memo., pp. 11-35.)  Plaintiffs’ responding memorandum, excluding
the table of contents and table of authorities, amounts to a total of 17.5
pages, thereby exceeding the page limit by 2.5 pages.  (Pl. Memo., pp. 1-18.)
The court acknowledges that, on October 9, 2024, Plaintiffs,
Defendant, and nonmoving defendants Gianna Massei, Christine Cassy, Phillip
Blair, and Kristen Marie Nicholas lodged a joint stipulation and proposed order
to permit them to file memoranda up to 25 pages in length.  (Oct. 9, 2024 Stip., p. 2:5-9.)  However, the parties did not file an ex parte
application (1) requesting that the court enter an order on their stipulation
before filing their special motions to strike with the court, or (2) requesting
permission from the court to file longer memorandums supported by reasons why
the arguments cannot be made within the stated limit.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1113, subd.
(e).)  Further, on November 4, 2024, the
court denied the parties’ stipulation. 
(Oct. 9, 2024 Stip., p. 1:1-3 [“The court denies the parties’ request to
increase the page limits on the demurrers and special motions to
strike”].)  The parties did not
thereafter file an ex parte application requesting leave to amend their
memoranda to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113. 
Thus, the court finds that it is appropriate, and therefore exercises
its discretion, to continue the hearing on Defendant’s special motion to strike
in order to give the parties an opportunity to file opening and responding
memoranda that do not exceed 15 pages in length pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1113.
The court further notes that the opening memoranda filed in connection
with the special motions to strike filed by nonmoving defendants Kristen Marie
Nicholas, Phillip Blair, Christine Cassy, and Gabrielle Green, Lindsay Paluba,
and Kaitlyn Davis a/k/a Kaitlyn Owens[1]
also exceed 15 pages in length.  (Def.
Nicholas Memo., pp. 11-32 [totaling 22 pages]; Def. Blair Memo., pp. 11-35 [totaling
25 pages]; Def. Cassy Memo., pp. 12-36 [totaling 25 pages]; Defs. Green,
Paluba, and Davis’s Memo., pp. 4-20 [totaling 17 pages].)  Further, Plaintiffs’ responding memorandum
filed in connection with defendant Kristen Marie Nicholas’s special motion to
strike amounts to a little over 17 pages. 
(Dec. 4, 2024 Pl. Opp., pp. 1-18.)
The court finds that it is appropriate, and therefore exercises its
discretion, to continue the hearings on the special motions to strike filed by
nonmoving defendants Kristen Marie Nicholas, Phillip Blair, and Christine Cassy
in order to give the parties an opportunity to file opening and responding
memoranda that do not exceed 15 pages in length.  Because the hearing on defendants Gabrielle
Green, Lindsay Paluba, and Kaitlyn Davis a/k/a Kaitlyn Owens’s special motion
to strike is set for February 13, 2025, the court will not continue that
hearing, but will order Gabrielle Green, Lindsay Paluba, and Kaitlyn Davis
a/k/a Kaitlyn Owens to file a revised memorandum no later than January 13,
2025.
