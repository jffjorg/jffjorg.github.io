(1)  
Motion
to Compel Further Response to Special Interrogatory, Set Four, No. 20
(2)  
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set Four
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with each
motion.[1]

 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSE TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY, SET FOUR, NO. 20
Plaintiff Tammy Davis
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant AIDS
Healthcare Foundation (“Defendant”) to serve a further response to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatory, Set Four, No. 20, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $9,450.
The court finds that Plaintiff
has not submitted a meet and confer declaration that satisfies the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 and therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) 
“A meet and confer declaration
in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  The meet and confer requirement “is
designed to encourage the parties to work out their differences informally so
as to avoid the necessity for a formal order . . . .  [Citation.] 
This, in turn, will lessen the burden on the court and reduce the unnecessary
expenditure of resources by litigants through promotion of informal,
extrajudicial resolution of discovery disputes.”  (In re Marriage of
Moore (2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 1275, 1293 [internal quotation marks and
citations omitted].)  
Plaintiff contends that she
satisfied the meet and confer requirement because counsel for Plaintiff sent an
email to Defendant’s counsel regarding Defendant’s response to this
interrogatory on October 1, 2024, in which counsel stated (1) that the email
was “the single meet and confer concerning” Defendant’s discovery responses;
(2) that counsel for Plaintiff was “used to [Defendant] ignoring [counsel’s]
attempts to be reasonable so this is the single email [counsel] w[ould] be
sending on this topic as it is futile to attempt to reach informal
resolutions[;]” (3) why counsel believed that Defendant’s objections were
without merit; and (4) that Defendant had “until Friday to supplement the
responses[,]” “[o]therwise [Plaintiff’s counsel] w[ould] just file yet another
motion, seek sanctions, and ultimately seek evidentiary sanctions and an CACI
jury instruction that [Defendant] has hidden (more) documents.”  (Harings Decl., ¶ 8; Harings Decl., Ex. 4,
pp. 1-2.)  Counsel for Plaintiff did not
respond to Defendant’s email.  (Stern
Decl., ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff thereafter filed
the pending motion on October 11, 2024. 
The court finds that the
October 1, 2024 email to Defendant’s counsel does not show “a reasonable and
good faith attempt” by Plaintiff to informally resolve the issues presented by
this motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.)  Instead, counsel for
Plaintiff expressly communicated that she would not discuss the issues
presented by this motion further, stating that the October 1, 2024 email would
be “the single email” sent to Defendant’s counsel.  (Harings Decl., Ex. 4, pp. 1-2.)  Moreover, counsel for Plaintiff did not
“attempt to talk the matter over [with Defendant’s counsel], compare their
views, consult, and deliberate[,]” instead asserting that the objection was
without merit and demanding supplemental responses.  (In re Marriage of Moore, supra,
102 Cal.App.5th at p. 1293 [internal quotation marks and citation
omitted].)  
Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiff has not shown that she made a reasonable attempt to informally
resolve each issue presented by this motion as required.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1).)
The court grants Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.  (Opp., p. 12:8-9 [seeking $1,000 in
sanctions]; Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)  The court finds that $850 ((2.0 hours x $425 per
hour)) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against Plaintiff in
connection with this motion.  (Stern
Decl., ¶ 11.)
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET FOUR
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling Defendant to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s
Request for Production of Documents, Set Four, Nos. 50-52, and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$13,300.
The court finds that Plaintiff
has not submitted a meet and confer declaration that satisfies the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 and therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) 
First, Plaintiff did not submit a meet and confer declaration in
connection with this motion because the supporting declaration of Peggy Farrell
did not describe the meet and confer process and therefore did not comply with
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2) [“The motion shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040”] [emphasis
added]; Farrell Decl.)  
Second, the court notes that, in opposition, Defendant has submitted
the same October 1, 2024 email discussed in connection with Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Defendant’s further response to Special Interrogatory, Set Four, in
which Plaintiff referred to Defendant’s responses to the discovery that is the
subject of this motion.  (Stern Decl., Ex.
6, pp. 1-2 [stating that counsel was sending “the single meet and confer”
concerning Defendant’s responses to “Special Interrogatory Set 4 and
Requests for Documents”] [emphasis added].) 
The court finds that the October 1, 2024 email does not show that
Plaintiff made “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to informally resolve the
issues presented by this motion for the same reasons as set forth above. 
Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiff has not shown that she made a reasonable attempt to informally
resolve each issue presented by this motion as required.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310,
subd. (b)(2).) 
The court grants Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.  (Opp., p. 9:4-6 [seeking $1,000 in
sanctions]; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)  The court finds that $850 ((2.0 hours x $425 per
hour)) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against Plaintiff in
connection with this motion.  (Stern
Decl., ¶ 11.)
