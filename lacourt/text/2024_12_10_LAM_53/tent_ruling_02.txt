The court has considered the memorandum of points and authorities filed by
plaintiff Tammy Davis on December 3, 2024 in connection with the motion to
compel further responses to requests for production of documents because,
although it was not filed 16 court days before the hearing on this motion, it
was served on defendant AIDS Healthcare Foundation on October 18, 2024, i.e.,
at least 16 court days before the hearing.Â
