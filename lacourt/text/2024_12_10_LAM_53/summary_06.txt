The judge orders that the parties must file revised memoranda that do not exceed 15 pages in length.

The judge also orders that the hearings on the special motions to strike filed by non-moving defendants Kristen Marie Nicholas, Phillip Blair, Christine Cassy, and Gabrielle Green, Lindsay Paluba, and Kaitlyn Davis a/k/a Kaitlyn Owens be continued to allow the parties to file revised memoranda that comply with the rule. The judge further orders that the parties must give notice of this ruling.
