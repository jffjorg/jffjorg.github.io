And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by defendants California Landmark Group, R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management LLC. The defendants are seeking to prevent Janney and Janney Attorney Service Inc. from complying with a deposition subpoena for business records. The court granted an ex parte application to advance the hearing date and ordered a stay on Janney's obligation to comply with the subpoena until the court issues a ruling on the motion.

However, the plaintiff, martin ramirez, mistakenly believed that a different motion for a protective order, filed by defendant InterSolutions, LLC, was the one being heard. As a result, the plaintiff did not file an opposition to the defendants' motion. The court is granting the defendants' request to continue the hearing to March 7, 2025, to give the plaintiff an opportunity to file an opposition to the correct motion.
