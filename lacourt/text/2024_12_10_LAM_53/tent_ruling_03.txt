  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion for judgment on the
  pleadings
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District (sued as Doe 1)
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff John Doe, A.G.
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court denies defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District’s requests for judicial notice as to Exhibits
1-3 because Superior Court decisions are neither binding on this court nor can
be considered as persuasive authority and are therefore irrelevant.  (Harrott v. County of Kings (2001) 25
Cal.4th 1138, 1148 [“Trial court decisions are not precedents binding on other
courts under the principle of stare decisis”]; Sargent Fletcher, Inc. v.
Able Corp. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1658, 1668 [“‘[a] written trial court
ruling has no precedential value’”].) 
The court grants plaintiff
John Doe, A.G.’s request for judicial notice. 
(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) 
The court grants defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District’s requests for judicial notice as to Exhibits
4-5 and 9.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd.
(d).) 
The court denies defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District’s requests for judicial notice as to Exhibits
6-7 because those documents are not relevant to the court’s ruling on this
motion.  (Malek Media Group LLC v.
AXWG Corp. (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 817, 825 [“Any matter to be judicially
noticed must be relevant to a material issue”].) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff John Doe, A.G. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for personal
injuries and damages from childhood sexual abuse pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 340.1 on July 11, 2022, against Doe defendants 1 through 60. 
On September 29, 2022, Plaintiff filed an “Amendment to Complaint,”
identifying the true name of fictitious Doe defendant 1 to be Los Angeles
Unified School District (“Defendant”). 
Defendant now moves the court for an order granting its motion for
judgment on the pleadings on Plaintiff’s Complaint on the ground that “the
Legislature’s Assembly Bill 218 (‘AB 218’), which further amended Code of Civil
Procedure section 340.1 in 2019, is unconstitutional because it retroactively
strips governmental immunity from public entities in violation of Article XVI,
section 6 of the California Constitution, which prohibits gifts of public
funds.”  (Notice of Mot., p. 2:8-12.) 
The court denies Defendant’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings because the Court of Appeal recently issued its decision in West
Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024)
103 Cal.App.5th 1243, which is binding on this court, concluding that the
“waiver of the claim presentation requirement did not constitute an expenditure
of public funds that may be considered a ‘gift’ because AB 218 did not create
new ‘substantive liability’ [citation] for the underlying alleged wrongful
conduct.”  (West Contra Costa Unified
School District, supra, 103 Cla.App.5th at p. 1257 [internal
citation omitted]; Id. at pp. 1264 [again concluding that no gift
occurred when the Legislature waived the claim presentation requirement], 1252
[rejecting the District-defendant’s contentions that reviving a claim that was
formerly barred for failure to satisfy the claim presentation requirement would
constitute an unconstitutional gift of public funds]; People v. Martin (2018)
26 Cal.App.5th 825, 832 [“‘Decisions of every division of the District Courts
of Appeal are binding upon all the . . . superior courts of this state . . . .’”].)

The court notes, as Defendant argues in its reply, that Roe #2, a Public
Elementary School District v. Superior Court of Santa Barbara County, Case
No. B334707, which concerns the constitutionality of AB 218, is currently pending
before the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District.  (Def. RJN Ex. 4, p. 13 [asserting the claimed
error is based on the trial court’s denying its motion for judgment on the
pleadings, which argued that AB 218’s retroactive removal of the claim
presentation requirement was an unconstitutional gift of public funds].)  However, the Court of Appeal has not issued a
decision in that case.  The court further
notes that the California Supreme Court denied the petition for review of West
Contra Costa Unified School District on October 30, 2024. 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.
            The court orders plaintiff John Doe,
A.G. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 10, 2024
