Summary:

The tentative ruling grants Gyahn Corporation's application for a right to attach order against Cornerstone Apparel, Inc. dba Papaya Clothing in the amount of $455,151.54, including $3,904.54 in costs. The order is granted because Gyahn has demonstrated a claim based on a contract, the claim is for a fixed and readily ascertainable amount, and the claim has probable validity. The court does not determine the validity of the claim, but rather determines whether Gyahn has shown a probability of success on the merits. The attachment is sought for a proper purpose, and no writ shall issue until Gyahn files a $10,000 undertaking.
