**Case Summary**

Case Number: 23STCP02775
Hearing Date: January 25, 2024
Dept: 85 Bradley Business Center

**Case Overview**

The case involves a dispute between Petitioners (Bradley Business Center and I-5/126 Limited Partnership) and the City of Santa Clarita regarding the zoning and development of a 9.49-acre property. Petitioners claim that the City's actions constitute an administrative mandamus and inverse condemnation, and they seek a writ of mandate and damages.

**Facts**

* In 2006, Petitioners acquired the property, which was zoned as Business Park (BP).
* In 2007, the City's General Plan confirmed the property's zoning as BP.
* In 2010, the City updated the General Plan, changing the zoning of the property to Community Commercial (CC).
* Petitioners have submitted multiple applications to the City, including a One Stop Review application for a self-storage facility, which was rejected due to the property's CC zoning.
* The City has refused to accept a zone change and General Plan amendment to restore the property's original BP zoning.

**Procedural History**

* The City demurred to Petitioners' administrative mandamus and inverse condemnation claims.
* Petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and did not apply for a specific self-storage project approval.
* The City asserts that the Petition fails to state a cause of action and that exhaustion of administrative remedies is required.

**Analysis**

* The court sustains the City's demurrer to the Petition's administrative mandamus claim, finding that Petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.
* The court also sustains the City's demurrer to the Petition's inverse condemnation claim, finding that the Petition fails to state a cause of action.

**Conclusion**

The court grants the City's demurrer and dismisses the Petition without leave to amend. The court finds that Petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and that the Petition fails to state a cause of action.
