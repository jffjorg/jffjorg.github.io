And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the information presented before the court and is issuing a tentative ruling. The judge notes that the petitioners failed to lodge a courtesy copy of their opposition, which is a violation of the Presiding Judge's First Amended General Order. The judge admonishes petitioners' counsel to provide courtesy copies in all future filings. The judge also notes that the city has corrected the name of the entity involved, from Design Review Committee to Development Review Committee.

The city has requested judicial notice of several documents, including the Santa Clarita Community Character & Design Guidelines, the City's 2011 General Plan, and the November 17, 2022 DRC Report. The judge grants the requests, finding that the documents are official City acts that provide the legal operative framework for the petitioners' claims and are not evidentiary in nature.

The judge also addresses the petitioners' argument that the mandamus claim should be decided on the merits, based on a full record. The judge finds that the documents requested for judicial notice are not evidence and that the petitioners are making an as-applied challenge, not a facial challenge, to the existing General Plan and zoning.

The judge notes that the city demurs to the administrative mandamus cause of action's facial challenge to the existing General Plan and zoning, but the petitioners explain that they are making an as-applied challenge, which is timely. Finally, the judge points out that the city's Request for Judicial Notice does not include exhibits and that the documents requested for judicial notice may be used to show the operative law.
