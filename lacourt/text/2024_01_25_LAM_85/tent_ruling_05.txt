 Case Number:  23STCV31783    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  85 
Ennerdale 401K Profit
Sharing Plan & Trust v. ASLM Gas, Inc. and ASLM Investments, Inc., 23STCV31783
 
Tentative decision on application
for a preliminary injunction: granted
 



            
            
            Plaintiff
Ennerdale 401K Profit Sharing Plan & Trust (“Ennerdale”) applies for a preliminary
injunction enjoining Defendants ASLM Gas, Inc. (“Gas”) and ASLM Investments,
Inc. (“Investments”) from (1) committing waste at a gas station and convenience
store located at 390 West Aten Road, Imperial, CA 92251 (“Property”) or removing
its fixtures; (2) collecting any revenue or rent from the Property; and (3) selling
or encumbering the Property.
            The
court has read and considered the ex parte application (no opposition
was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Ennerdale filed this action on December 28, 2023, seeking specific performance
of an assignment of rents, appointment of receiver, and accounting.  The Complaint alleges as follows.
            On
December 21, 2021, Open Bank (“Bank”) and Defendants signed a
promissory note (“Note”) whereby Bank loaned Defendants $4,047,000 (“Loan”).  The parties signed a Business Loan Agreement (“BLA”)
the same day defining the terms and conditions of the Loan.  
            Also
on December 21, 2021, to secure payment of the Loan, Defendant Investments
executed a Deed of Trust against the Property (“DOT”) and an Assignment of
Rents.  Investments also executed a Commercial
Security Agreement (“CSA”) granting a security interest in present and future
inventory, equipment, and accounts (“Collateral”) plus products and proceeds
thereof.  
            Also
on December 21, 2021, Defendant Mandeep Singh (“Singh”) signed an Unconditional
Guaranty to personally guarantee the Loan.
            Bank
perfected its interest in the Collateral when it filed a UCC Financing
Statement with the California Secretary of State on December 27, 2021. (Collectively,
the Note, DOT, Assignment of Rents, CSA, Unconditional Guaranty, and UCC filing
are referred to as “Loan Documents”).  The
DOT and Assignment of Rents were recorded on December 28, 2021.  
            Defendants
failed to make the required payments due under the Note on January 1, 2023 and the
first of every month thereafter.  Defendants
also defaulted on the Loan for failure to make the required property taxes
payments and failing to maintain adequate insurance on the Property.
On March 22, 2023, Bank recorded a Notice
of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust (“NOD”).  
            On
March 24, 2023, each of Gas and Investments filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy case.  On June 8, 2023, the bankruptcy court
dismissed Gas’s bankruptcy case.  On July
12, 2023, it granted Bank’s motion for relief from the stay in Investment’s
bankruptcy case which allowed Bank to continue the foreclosure process on the
DOT.
Bank has assigned the Note and DOT to Plaintiff Ennerdale.  As of December 27, 2023, the outstanding Loan
principal is $3,716,292.91.  Defendants also
owes $396,277.68 in interest, $22,950.36 in late charges, $40,000 in legal
fees, $2,000 in foreclosure environmental assessment fees, $18,973.53 in
foreclosure trustee’s fees, $8,550 in foreclosure appraisal costs, and
$49,818.28 in insurance advances for coverage effective as of December 27, 2023.  The total amount owed is $4,254,862.76.
            The
DOT entitles Ennerdale to appointment of a receiver to take possession of the
Property in the event of default.  Ennerdale
seeks an appointment of a receiver and a judgment compelling specific
performance of assignment of rents, an accounting of the businesses and the
Property, and giving Ennerdale full access to their books and records.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
January 4, 2024, the court granted Ennerdale’s ex parte application for
a TRO/OSC but denied the concurrent ex parte application for appointment
of a receiver to take possession of the Property.  The court ordered Ennerdale to serve Defendants
with the Summons, Complaint, moving papers, and order granting the ex parte
application for a TRO/OSC by January 8, 2024.
            Also
on January 4, 2024, Ennerdale served Gas and Singh with the TRO/OSC by U.S. mail.
 On January 8, 2024, Ennerdale served the
order again by electronic and U.S. mail.
            On
January 8, 2024, Singh signed a Notice of Acknowledgement and Receipt for the
Complaint and Summons on behalf of both Gas and Investments.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            An
injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular
act; it may be granted by the court in which the action is brought, or by a
judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may be enforced as an order of
the court.  Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) §525.  An injunction may be more
completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to perform or
to refrain from performing a particular act. 
See Comfort v. Comfort, (1941) 17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell
v. Watson, (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[1]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
            The
purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo
pending final resolution upon a trial.  See
Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe
v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316; Major v. Miraverde
Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 623.  The status quo has been defined to
mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded the pending
controversy.  Voorhies v. Greene
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v. Superior Court,
(1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
            A
preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a noticed motion.  The complaint normally must plead injunctive
relief.  CCP §526(a)(1)-(2).[2]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
            A
plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence of an adequate
damages remedy at law.  CCP §526(4); Thayer
Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors, (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department
of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8
Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of
“inadequacy of the legal remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time
of the early courts of chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an
unusual or extraordinary equitable remedy which will not be granted if the
remedy at law (usually damages) will adequately compensate the injured
plaintiff.  Department of Fish &
Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554,
1565.
            In
determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the trial court
considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a balancing of the
“irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is
denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the
court grants a preliminary injunction. 
CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v.
Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v. Blue Cross of
California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St. Johns Hospital,
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a
preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of potential
entitlement to such relief.  Doe v.
Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 304. 
The decision to grant a preliminary injunction generally lies within the
sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent
an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v.
Carlson, (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
            A
preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect unless and until the
plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the enjoined defendant may
sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally decides that the
plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction. 
See CCP §529(a); City of South San Francisco v. Cypress Lawn
Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1. The Loan Documents
            On December 21, 2021, Bank and Defendants
signed a Note for a $4,047,000 Loan to ASLM.  Reay Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  Defendants were required to make payments of
$24,251.56 on the first day of every month. 
Reay Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.
            The
Note defined an event of default to include failure to comply with any term of
any Loan Document, failure to pay taxes when due, and becoming the subject of a
proceeding under any bankruptcy law. 
Reay Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  After an
event of default, Bank would have the right to require immediate payment of all
amounts owed under the Note, collect all amounts owed from any borrower or
guarantor, take possession of any collateral, or sell, lease, or otherwise
dispose of the collateral without advertisement.  Reay Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  
            The
BLA signed the same day further defined the terms and conditions of the
Loan.  Reay Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  As borrower, Defendants were required to maintain
various types of insurance on the Property and provide evidence of such
insurance to Bank.  Reay Decl., ¶5, Ex.
3.  Defendants could not cancel or
diminish coverage without at least 30 days written notice to Bank.  Reay Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  
            The
BLA defined an event of default as failure to make any payment when due under
the Loan, failure to comply with any term or obligation in any Loan Document, and
a material adverse change in Defendants’ financial condition.  Reay Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  An event of default would allow Bank to
declare all indebtedness immediately due and payable.   Reay Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  
            Singh
signed the Note and BLA in his capacity as President and Secretary of both Gas
and Investments.  Reay Decl., Exs.
2-3.  Singh also signed an Unconditional
Guaranty for the Loan.  Reay Decl., ¶8, Ex.
8.
            Also
on December 21, 2021, to secure repayment of the Loan, Investments executed a DOT
against the Property.   Reay Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  The DOT’s list of remedies upon default
included foreclosure by sale, judicial foreclosure, the right to collect rents,
and the right to appointment of a receiver to take possession of and preserve the
Property.  Reay Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  
            Investments
also executed an Assignment of Rents giving Bank a security interest in all rents
from the Property.  Reay Decl., ¶6, Ex. 5.
The Assignment of Rents’ list of remedies upon default included appointment of
a receiver and the right to collect rents.  Reay Decl., ¶6, Ex. 5.
            Investments
also executed a CSA granting Bank a security interest in the Personal
Collateral, including present and future inventory, equipment, and accounts.  Reay Decl., ¶7, Ex. 6.  Investments agreed to not remove the Personal
Collateral from its current location without Bank’s consent.  Reay Decl., ¶7, Ex. 6.  
            The
CSA defined default as failure to make any payment when due under the Loan,
failure to comply with any term or obligation in any Loan Document, and a
material adverse change in Defendants’ financial condition.  Reay Decl., ¶7, Ex. 6.  An event of default would entitle Bank to possession
and beneficial use of the Personal Collateral. 
Reay Decl., ¶7, Ex. 6.  
            Bank
perfected its interest in the Personal Collateral when it filed a UCC Financing
Statement with the California Secretary of State on December 27, 2021.  Reay Decl., ¶7, Ex. 7.  
 
            2.
Events of Default
            Defendants
failed to make the required payments due under the Note on January 1, 2023 and
the first of every month thereafter.  Reay
Decl., ¶11.  On March 22, 2023, recorded an
NOD against the Property.  Reay Decl.,
¶11, Ex. 9.  
            On
March 24, 2023, both Gas and Investments filed chapter 11 bankruptcy cases in
the bankruptcy court.  Reay Decl., ¶12.  On June 8, 2023, the bankruptcy court granted
a motion to dismiss Gas’s bankruptcy case. 
Reay Decl., ¶12, Ex. 10.  On July
12, 2023, it granted Bank’s motion for relief from the automatic stay in
Investment’s bankruptcy case.  Reay
Decl., ¶12, Ex. 11.  
            On
June 22, 2023, Defendants cancelled the Property’s insurance policy with
Nationwide.  Reay Decl., ¶15, Ex. 12.  Ennerdale has not received confirmation of
reinstatement of insurance.  Reay Decl.,
¶15.  Defendants defaulted under the BLA for
failure to maintain adequate insurance.  Reay
Decl., ¶15.  
            As
of December 27, 2023, the outstanding principal is $3,716,292.91.  Reay Decl., ¶13.  Defendants also owe $396,277.68 in interest,
$22,950.36 in late charges, $40,000 in estimated legal fees, $2,000 in
foreclosure environmental assessment fees, $18,973.53 in foreclosure trustee’s
fees, $8,550 in foreclosure appraisal costs, and $49,818.28 in insurance
advances for coverage effective as of December 27, 2023.  Reay Decl., ¶13.  The total amount owed is $4,254,862.76.  Reay Decl., ¶13.  
            Defendants
also defaulted under the Note for failure to pay real property taxes on the
Property for 2022/23, as well as the first installment of real property taxes
on the Property for 2023/24.  Reay Decl.,
¶14.
            In
December 2023, Bank assigned the DOT to Ennerdale.  Reay Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  During a December 9, 2023 inspection of the
Property, Ennerdale noticed signs on the gas station’s pumps saying no gas was
available.  Reay Decl., ¶18, Ex. 14.  The pumps appeared inoperative.  Reay Decl., ¶18.  A sign on the door to the Property’s
convenience store read “Cash Only.”  Reay
Decl., ¶18.  The store had very few items
in stock on the shelves.  Reay Decl., ¶18.  When the Ennerdale trustee asked the sales
clerk what was going on, he said “we are closing down.”  Reay Decl., ¶18.  
            Ennerdale
has reinstated the insurance on the Property, effective December 27, 2023.  Reay Decl., ¶15.  
            Ennerdale
believes Defendants are collecting rent and revenue from the Property gas
station and convenience store.  Reay
Decl., ¶17.  Despite this, Defendants have
not paid the obligations owed to Ennerdale. 
Reay Decl., ¶17.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Ennerdale applies for a preliminary injunction
enjoining Defendants from (1) committing or permitting waste as to the
Property’s gas station and convenience store, or removing, transferring,
encumbering, or otherwise disposing of the Property or fixtures on it; (2)
demanding, collecting, receiving, discounting, using, or diverting any revenue
or rent from the Property; or (3) transferring, assigning, selling, mortgaging,
encumbering, concealing, or creating a security interest in the Property or
rents thereof.
            
            1. Probability of Success
            On
December 21, 2021, Bank and Defendants signed a Note for a $4,047,000 Loan to Defendants.  Reay Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  Defendants was required to make payments of
$24,251.56 on the first day of every month. 
Reay Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  Defendants
also signed various other Loan Documents. 
Reay Decl., Exs. 4-6.  Bank later
assigned the DOT to Ennerdale.  Reay
Decl., Ex. 1.
            Defendants
failed to make payments due under the Note from January 2023 thereafter.  Reay Decl., ¶11.  The recorded NOD shows that Investments owed
$120,577.37 as of March 20, 2023.  Reay
Decl., ¶11, Ex. 9.  This constitutes a
breach under the Loan Documents.  Reay
Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  
            The
Loan Documents also required Defendants to maintain insurance on the Property
and provide 30 days’ written notice before any reduction or cancellation of
coverage.  Reay Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  Ennerdale presents evidence that Defendants
cancelled its insurance policy in June 2023. 
Reay Decl., ¶15, Ex. 12.  
            Ennerdale
has demonstrated a probability of success on its claim that it is entitled to the
Personal Collateral and all rents from the Property, as well as to foreclose on
the Property itself.  These are the
interests that the preliminary injunction would protect.
 
            2.
Balance of Hardships
            The
second factor which a trial court examines is the interim harm that plaintiff
is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that
the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  Donahue Schriber Realty Group, Inc. v. Nu
Creation Outreach, (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1177.  This factor involves consideration of the
inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity
of preserving the status quo.  Id.
            The
requested preliminary injunction would protect the Property, any fixtures, the
businesses, and the rent and revenue from those businesses.  Ennerdale asserts that Defendants may thwart
the management of the Property and abscond with its rents and revenue if the
court denies the application.  Because
Defendants no longer have an interest in these assets, they would not suffer harm
from a preliminary injunction.  Mem. at
17.  
            The
balance of harms slightly favors a preliminary injunction.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a preliminary injunction is granted.  ASLM may not (1) commit or permit waste as to
the Property or remove, transfer, encumber, or otherwise dispose of the
Property or its fixtures; (2) demand, collect, receive, discount, use, or
divert any revenue or rent from the Property; or (3) transfer, assign, sell,
mortgage, encumber, conceal, or create a security interest in the Property or
rents thereof.
            The
court must require a bond supporting the preliminary injunction.  The
purpose of a bond is to cover the defendant’s damages from an improvidently
issued injunction.  CCP §529(a).  In setting the bond, the court must
assume that the preliminary injunction was wrongly issued.  Abba Rubber
Co. v. Seaquist, (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1, 15.  The attorney’s fees
necessary to successfully procure a decision dissolving the injunction are
damages that should be included in setting the bond.  Id., supra,
235 Cal.App.3d at 15-16.  The greater the likelihood of the plaintiff
prevailing, the less likely the preliminary injunction will have been wrongly
issued, and that is a relevant factor for setting the bond.  Oiye v. Fox, (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1036,
1062.  The damages from an improperly
issued injunction are minimal.  The bond
will be set at $500.
