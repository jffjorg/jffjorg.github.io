renders the following tentative decision.  
            
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
UC 2870 West Olympic Holder, LLC (“UC 2870” or “Lender”) commenced this
proceeding against Defendants 2870 O Consortium LLC (“Borrower”), Live Work
Create Equity LLC (“Live Work”), Perri Lee (“Lee”), City of Los Angeles
Department of Building and Safety (“LADBS”), Rosewood Assets, LLC (“Rosewood”),
Howard Industries, Inc. (“Howard”), JR Plumbing and Rooter, Inc. (“JR”),
Edward’s Sheet Metal Supply, Inc. (“Edward’s”), Triple Play Electric, Inc.
(“Triple Play”), L&W Supply Corporation (“L&W”), Climate Industries,
Inc. (“Climate”), White Cap L.P. (“White Cap”), and Reyes Heating and Air
Conditioning (“Reyes”), alleging (1) two counts of breach of contract, (2)
appointment of receiver, (3) foreclosure by judicial sale, and (4) conversion.  The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as
follows. 
            Live
Work owns 100% of Borrower.  Lee is Live
Work’s manager.
            On
March 26, 2020, Lender’s predecessor UC Funding, LLC (“UC Funding”) executed a
Loan Agreement pursuant to which Borrower obtained a $30 million loan.  A Promissory Note was also executed to that
effect.  Through a Deed of Trust,
Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (“DOT”),
Borrower granted a security interest in 2870 West Olympic Boulevard, Los
Angeles, California 90010 (“Property”) to Chicago Title Company as trustee for UC
Funding’s benefit.  
            Also
on March 26, 2020, UC Funding, Borrower, and Lee signed a Completion Indemnity
and Guaranty Agreement whereby Borrower and Lee jointly and severally
guaranteed the construction performance promised in the Loan Agreement by the
promised deadline.  Borrower and Lee also
agreed that the construction would be free from any liens or claims performing
services or labor on the Property and, if not, they jointly and severally
agreed to pay such costs.
UC Funding then assigned to Lender its interest in the DOT,
Loan Agreement, and Promissory Note (“2020 Loan Documents”).
On October 1, 2021, Lender, Borrower, and Lee signed a
Modification Agreement and Note increasing the amount of the loan to $31.7
million.  They also agreed in an
Amendment to Recorded Documents that any reference to the loan in the 2020 Loan
Documents referred to the $31.7 million modified loan principal.
            On
September 1, 2022, Lender, Borrower, and Lee signed a second Modification
Agreement.  Lender agreed to extend the
loan’s maturity date to April 1, 2023, postpone collection of outstanding
payments until then, accept payments of Borrower’s net operating income in lieu
of regular interest payments, with any excess interest accruing and payable on
the new maturity date or upon earlier repayment of the Loan and waive the
requirement to replenish the interest reserve under the 2020 Loan Documents.
            Borrower
failed to pay the outstanding principal on the extended maturity date or the
accrued interest within five days.  It
also failed to provide insurance as required under the Loan Agreement.  Borrower further failed to complete the
construction described in the Loan Agreement by the required completion date of
June 30, 2021.  Under the Note, each
event of default accelerates all amounts owed. 
Lender is entitled to foreclose on the DOT and have a receiver
appointed.
            The
remaining Defendants all hold junior liens against the Property.
            Lender
seeks compensatory damages for breach of contract, prejudgment interest at the
legal rate, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees and costs.  Lender also asks the court to enforce the
clauses in the 2020 Loan Documents entitling it to possession of the Property
and appointment of a receiver.  
            Lender
further asks for judicial foreclosure, damages in the amount of the deficiency
plus late charges, fees, and interest, costs incurred in connection with the
sale of the Property, and attorney’s fees and costs.  
 
            2.
White Cap Cross-Complaint
            On
July 5, 2023, White Cap, formerly known as HD Supply Construction Supply, LTD.,
filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Lender and Borrower, alleging breach
of written contract, open book account, account stated, quantum meruit, and
foreclosure of mechanic’s lien.  White
Cap’s Cross-Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            On
September 20, 2022, White Cap and Borrower entered a Credit Application
Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) wherein White Cap would provide various building
materials, hardware, cement, sealant, visqueen, flashing, and related supplies.  White Cap has done so, but Borrower has
failed to fully pay for the provided materials. 

            On
January 12, 2023, White Cap served preliminary lien notices on both Lender and
Borrower per Civil Code section 8200 et al.  On May 1, 2023, White Cap filed and recorded
its mechanic’s lien with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office.
            Borrower
owes White Cap $21,272.25 plus delinquency charges at a 10% annual rate
accruing from March 6, 2023.  The Credit
Agreement also entitles White Cap to attorney’s fees and costs.  White Cap seeks damages for attorney’s fees
and costs of preparing and recording the mechanic’s lien, with proceeds from
sale of the Property to be applied to satisfy White Cap’s claims.  White Cap also seeks judgment that Borrower
and Lender’s interests in the Property are subject to White Cap’s lien.
 
            3.
Rosewood FACC
            On
November 20, 2023, Rosewood filed a Cross-Complaint.  The operative pleading is a First Amended
Cross-Complaint filed on November 27, 2023 against Cross-Defendants Borrower, Live
Work, and Lee, alleging breach of contract against Borrower and conversion and
negligence against all Cross-Defendants. 
Rosewood’s FACC alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            On
April 25, 2022, Rosewood loaned Borrower $3.5 million to fund improvements on
the Property (“Rosewood Loan”).  The
maturity date for the Rosewood Loan and accompanying Note was April 24, 2023.  Borrower agreed to repay the loan balance plus
the accrued unpaid interest on that date. 
It failed to do so and therefore was in default.  Borrower also failed to provide insurance as
required by the Rosewood Loan.
            Rosewood
seeks $4.5 million in compensatory damages, pre-judgment interest, punitive
damages, and attorney’s fees and costs.

Applicable Law
            Pursuant
to CRC 3.1184(a), a receiver must present by noticed motion or stipulation of
all parties: (1) a final account and report; (2) a request for the discharge;
and (3) a request for exoneration of the receiver’s surety.  No memorandum is required in support of the
motion unless the court orders otherwise. 
CRC 3.1184(b).  Notice must be
given to every person or entity known to the receiver to have a substantial,
unsatisfied claim that will be affected by the order or stipulation, regardless
of whether that person or entity is a party to the action or has appeared in
it.  CRC 3.1184(c).
            If
any allowance of compensation for the receiver or for an attorney employed by
the receiver is claimed in an account, it must state in detail what services
have been performed by the receiver or the attorney and whether previous
allowances have been made to the receiver or attorney, and the amounts.  CRC 3.1184(d).
 
            C.
Statement of Facts
            The Property consists of
a multi-story mixed-use building with retail space on the street level and
residences on the upper level.  Kieffer
Decl., ¶4.  On March 26, 2020, UC
Funding loaned Borrower $30 million to fund improvements on the Property.  Kieffer
Decl., ¶4.  Borrower failed to repay the
loan even after Lender extended the maturity date.  Kieffer Decl., ¶4.  
            On June 13, 2023,
Receiver took possession of the Property pursuant to the court’s order granting
Lender’s ex parte application to appoint a receiver.  Kieffer Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1 (Final Report,
Ex.  A). 
At the time, construction at the Property was incomplete and the
building still had scaffolding in place. 
Kieffer Decl., ¶4.  Because the barricades
protecting the building were dilapidated and easily breached, the Property was
not secure from intruders or squatters.  Kieffer
Decl., ¶4.  Because security cameras had
been removed, the Property also became the subject of vandalism and theft of
electrical components.  Kieffer Decl., ¶4.  
            On June 15, 2023,
Receiver met with a prospective general contractor to inspect the condition of
the building, assess any known issues, and propose a stabilization plan with
cost forecast.  Kieffer Decl., ¶5.  Receiver also contacted the existing security
company to provide directions for securing the premises.  Kieffer Decl., ¶5.  Receiver’s agent thereafter frequently
visited the Property for continued oversight of the protection and preservation
of the Property.  Kieffer Decl., ¶5.
            Receiver
opened a bank account at City National Bank (“City National”).  Kieffer Decl., ¶6.  Lender funded the City National account on
July 14, 2023 with $1,823,586.43 to cover 2022 property taxes and insurance.  Kieffer Decl., ¶6; Final Report, p. 3.  On July 27, 2023, Receiver issued and
recorded a $1,823,586.43 Receiver’s Certificate in Lender’s favor.  Kieffer Decl., ¶7; Final Report, p. 3.  
            From August to September
2023, Receiver recorded six more Receiver’s Certificates to manage, preserve
and protect the assets, income, and expenses of the Receivership Estate, as
well as to pay the costs of administering it. 
Kieffer Decl., ¶7; Final Report, p. 3. 
Between seven Receiver’s Certificates and two Lender contributions, a
total of $2,091,882.36 was placed in the City National account.  Kieffer Decl., ¶7; Final Report, p. 3.  As of October 10, 2023, Receiver spent
$2,091,789.16, leaving a total balance of $93.20.  Kieffer Decl., ¶7; Final Report, p. 3.  
            Lender recorded a Notice
of Trustee’s Sale for the Property on September 12, 2023, and the foreclosures sale
took place on October 6, 2023.  Kieffer
Decl., ¶8; Final Report, Ex.  B.
            Receiver’s fees for the Receivership
have totaled $110,325.  Kieffer Decl., ¶9;
Final Report, p. 4.  Receiver delivered invoices
for interim fees and expenses to all parties through regular reports.  Kieffer Decl., ¶9; Final Report, p. 4.  The final report seeks payment of all unpaid
final fees and expenses from the funds of the Receivership Estate after the
notice period expires.  Kieffer Decl., ¶9;
Final Report, p. 4.  Receiver estimates that
its unpaid fees, including fees related to filing the final report, will total
$20,000.  Kieffer Decl., ¶9; Final
Report, p. 4.  Because the Receivership Estate
has no funds to pay such obligations, Receiver requests an order compelling Lender
to pay the unpaid obligations to Receiver within five days of the entry of such
an order.  Kieffer Decl., ¶9; Final
Report, p. 4.  
            Receiver has provided
notice to all known Receivership and pre-Receivership creditors.  Kieffer Decl., ¶10, Ex. 2.
 
            D.
Analysis
            Receiver
moves for termination of the Receivership, approval of its final report and
accounting, exoneration of all bonds and undertakings, approval of the fees and
expenses described in the final report, and an order for Lender to pay all
final Receivership expenses and other amounts owing to Receiver within five
days of entry of such an order.  The pertinent parties have been served and no party objects to the
motion.  Kieffer Decl., ¶10, Ex. 2.
            Receiver
explains that the Receivership has served its purpose because the Property has
been sold at a trustee’s sale.  Kieffer Decl., ¶8; Final Report, Ex.  B.  Receiver
opened a City National account to cover Property expenses and that account has
a balance of $93.20.  Kieffer Decl., ¶¶
6, 7; Final Report, p. 3.  There are no creditors
of the Receivership Estate because all obligations and liabilities have been
paid.  Kieffer Decl., ¶10.  
            Receiver seeks
approval of his fees and costs totaling $110,325 through September 30,
2023.  Kieffer Decl., ¶9; Final Report, p. 4.  His unpaid fees, including the costs for October
2023 and to file the final report and accounting and terminate the Receivership,
are estimated to total $20,000.  Kieffer
Decl., ¶9; Final Report, p. 4.  Because
the Receivership has no funds to pay such obligations, Receiver requests an
order compelling Lender to pay the unpaid obligations to Receiver within five
days of the entry of such an order.  Kieffer
Decl., ¶9; Final Report, p. 4.  
            Courts
may impose the receiver costs on a party who sought the appointment of the
receiver.  City of Chula Vista v.
Gutierrez, (2012) 207 Cal. App. 4th 681, 685-686.  Receiver was appointed at Lender’s request to
take possession of the Property after Borrower
failed to repay a $30 million loan to fund improvements on the Property.  Kieffer
Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. 1.  Lender has no
objection to Receiver’s handling of the Property or the fees he incurred.
            Receiver’s
motion for approval of final report and accounting, discharge from his duties,
approval of his outstanding fees and costs approved, and exoneration of his
undertaking is granted.
