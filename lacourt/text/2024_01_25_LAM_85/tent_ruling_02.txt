            [1] Petitioners
failed to
lodge a courtesy copy of their opposition in violation of the
Presiding Judge’s First Amended General Order Re: Mandatory Electronic
Filing.  Their counsel is admonished to provide courtesy copies in all
future filings.


            [2] The
City explains that the correct name is Development Review Committee, not Design
Review Committee.  Dem. at 8, n. 1.  


            [3] The
City requests judicial notice of (1) Chapter 1 of the Santa Clarita Community
Character & Design Guidelines (“Design Guidelines”), adopted by Resolution
09-19 on March 24, 2009 (RJN Ex. 1); (2) the Introduction to the City’s 2011 General
Plan (“General Plan”), including a description of the 2009 Design Guidelines
(RJN Ex. B); and (3) the November 17, 2022 DRC Report for Master Case 22-167,
One Stop 22-021 (2022 Report) (RJN Ex. C). 

Petitioners
argue that the mandamus claim “should be decided on the merits, based on a full
record.”  To the extent that Petitioners are
arguing that extra-record evidence is not permitted for their administrative
mandamus claim, RJN Exs. 1 and 2 are official City acts which provide the legal
operative framework for Petitioners’ claims and are not evidentiary in nature.  An agency’s legislative enactments are
subject to judicial notice.  See Warmington
Old Town Associates, L.P. v. Tustin Unified School Dist. (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 840, 858, n. 3.  RJN Ex. 3
would be part of the administrative record. 
In any event, it is expressly quoted in the Petition and may  be judicially noticed.  See Ingram v. Flippo, (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 1280, 1285, n. 3, disapproved on other grnds., Leon
v. County of Riverside, (2023) 14 Cal.5th 910, 931.  
Petitioners also argue that judicial notice does not establish
the truth of factual matters in the exhibits. 
While that is true, RJN Exs. 1-2 are offered to show the operative law
and Ex. 3 is offered to show the DRC’s position on Petitioners’ application,
not the truth of that position.  The
requests are granted.  Evid. Code §§
452(b), (c).


[4] Although
the City demurs to the administrative mandamus cause of action’s facial challenge
to the existing General Plan and zoning as time-barred (Dem. at 11), Petitioners
explain that they are making an as-applied challenge, not a facial
challenge.  Opp. at 3-4.  It is undisputed that Petitioners’ as-applied
challenge is timely.    


            [5] The
City also cites the Santa Clarita Municipal Code asserting that it requested
judicial notice of the relevant sections as Exhibits D and E.  Dem. at 9, n. 3.  The City’s Request for Judicial Notice does
not include any such exhibits.
