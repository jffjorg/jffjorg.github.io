 Case Number:  23STCV14803    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  85 
Gyahn Corporation v. Cornerstone
Apparel, Inc. dba Papaya Clothing, 23STCV14803
Tentative decision on application
for right to attach order: granted




 
 
            
            Plaintiff
Gyahn Corporation (“Gyahn”) applies for a right to attach order against Cornerstone
Apparel, Inc., dba Papaya Clothing (“Cornerstone”), for $455,151.54, including
$3,904.54 in costs.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff Gyahn filed the Complaint on June 26, 2023 against Defendant
Cornerstone alleging (1) breach of contract, (2) open book account, (3)
account stated, (4) goods and services rendered, and (5) false promise. The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Since April 4, 2022, Gyahn has
sold Cornerstone clothing goods and invoiced Cornerstone eight times.  Cornerstone has only partially paid for these
products. Gyahn’s Customer Open Balance for Cornerstone shows an outstanding
balance of $383,483.30.
            On
June 12, 2023, Cornerstone had Gyahn pick up a partial payment check for
$25,000.  Cornerstone did this to induce Gyahn
to deliver a shipment of women’s clothing the next day, which it did.  Gyahn’s bank later told Gyahn that the check
bounced for insufficient funds.  
            Gyahn
seeks $383,483.30 in compensatory damages for every cause of action except
false promise, $25,000 in compensatory damages for the false promise claim, pre-judgment
interest, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees and costs.
            
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On June 30, 2023, Gyahn
served Cornerstone with the Complaint and Summons by substitute service,
effective July 10, 2023.
            On August 11, 2023, Department
19 (Hon. Stephanie M. Bowick) rejected Gyahn’s request for entry of default
against Cornerstone.
            On August 31, 2023,
Cornerstone filed an Answer.
            On September 12, 2023,
Department 19 again rejected Gyahn’s request for entry of default against
Cornerstone.
            A jury trial is
currently set for April 1, 2025.
            
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004)
115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent
calculation for lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
             Where the defendant is a corporation, a
general reference to “all corporate property which is subject to attachment
pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” is
sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a partnership or other
unincorporated association, a reference to “all property of the partnership or
other unincorporated association which is subject to attachment pursuant to
subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (“Kemp”) (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does
not determine whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be
made at trial and is not affected by the decision on the application for the
order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against plaintiff,
(2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown
would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any
security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together
with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the
security interest) have decreased that security interest’s value.  CCP §483.015(b); see also CCP
§483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be issued on a claim which is secured by
any interest in real property arising from agreement, statute, or other rule of
law…However, an attachment may be issued where the claim was originally so
secured but, without any act of the plaintiff or the person to whom the
security was given, the security has become valueless or has decreased in value
to less than the amount then owing on the claim).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
            
            C. Statement of Facts
            Gyahn is a manufacturer and supplier
of textiles, and Cornerstone is a retailer of women’s clothing.  Oh Decl., ¶4. 

            From April 4, 2022 through June 19,
2023, Cornerstone sent Gyahn purchase orders for various items of women’s
clothing.   Oh Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Gyahn accepted and filled all orders.  Oh Decl., ¶5. 
Gyahn shipped all requested items with packing lists and invoices.  Oh Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  
            Gyahn kept a Customer Open
Balance sheet for Cornerstone.  Oh Decl., ¶6, Ex. B. 
It shows that of the $406,701.15 in invoiced product purchased by Cornerstone,
$383,483.30 remained unpaid.  Oh Decl.,
¶6, Ex. B.  Gyahn has performed all its
duties by delivering the clothing at issue. 
Oh Decl., ¶7.  The due date for
payment of the final invoices on the Customer Open Balance sheet was July 13, 2023. 
Oh Decl., ¶6, Ex. B.  
            Interest on the $383,483.30 balance accrues
at a 10% annual rate, or $105.06 per day ($383,483.30/365 = $105.06).  Gwynn Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.  Judgment likely will not be entered until
April 1, 2025.  Gwynn Decl., ¶6.  That April 1, 2025 date is 645 days after June
26, 2023, the due date listed in the Customer Open Balance sheet for the last invoice at issue.  Gwynn Decl., ¶6.  Thus, $67,763.70 (645 x $105.06) in pre-judgment
interest will have accrued before Gyahn obtains a judgment.  Gwynn Decl., ¶6.  
            Counsel for Gyahn estimate its costs
will include $435 for the first appearance fee, $372.04 for service of process
fees, $40 for the issuance of this right to attach order, $40 in bank levy or garnishment
fees, $150 in jury fees, $2,000 in estimated deposition costs, $180 in
estimated motion fees based on three motions, a $500 fee for filing a motion
for summary judgment, and $187.50 in estimated electronic filing and service
fees for fifteen motions.  Gwynn Decl.,
¶3.  These costs total $3,904.54.  Gwynn Decl., ¶3.  
 
            E. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Gyahn applies for a right to attach order against Defendant Cornerstone for $455,151.54,
including $3,904.54 in costs.
 
            1.
A Claim Based on a Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based 
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  
            Gyahn’s
claim is for breach of contract based on a series of invoices that have become
past due.  Oh Decl., Ex. A.  The principal due on these invoices exceeds
$383,483.30.  Oh Decl., Ex. B.  Attachment may be based on this contract
claim. 
             
            2.
An Amount Due That is Fixed and Readily Ascertainable  
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained
by reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT, supra, 115 Cal.App.4th at
540-41.  The fact that the damages are unliquidated is not
determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard
by which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id. (citations omitted). 
 
            a.
Principal and Interest
            The
Customer Open Balance sheet shows that the unpaid principal on all invoices
totals $383,483.30.  Oh Decl., ¶6, Ex.
B.  Gyahn does not cite any invoice or
purchase order to demonstrate the interest rate for amounts owed
thereunder.  Oh Decl., Ex. A.  If a contract entered into after January 1,
1986, does not stipulate a legal rate of interest, the obligation shall bear
interest at an annual rate of 10% after a breach.  Civil Code §3289(b).
            Gyahn
calculates the daily interest rate as $105.06. 
Gwynn Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.  Gyahn argues
the pre-judgment interest started on June 26, 2023 and will accrue until April
1, 2025, which is the trial date and therefore the earliest date that the I/C
court will render judgment.  Gwynn Decl.,
¶6.  There are 645 days between June 26,
2023, and April 1, 2025.  Gwynn Decl.,
¶6.  Ghayn then asserts that its total
pre-judgment interest is $67,763.70 (645 x $105.06).  Gwynn Decl., ¶6.  
 
            Gyahn
offers two explanations why the pre-judgment interest started to accrue on June
26, 2023.  First, its counsel states this
is the due date for the last invoice listed in the Customer Open Balance
sheet.  Gwynn Decl., ¶6.  However, the due date for the last several
invoices is July 13, 2023.  Oh Decl., ¶6,
Ex. B.  Second, Gyahn’s moving papers
identify June 26, 2023 as the day after the Complaint was filed.  Mem. at 7. 
Since the due date for some invoices had not passed when the Complaint
was filed, this date is irrelevant.  
            Nonetheless,
Cornerstone has not opposed and any defects in the prejudgment interest
calculation are immaterial. 
Ascertainable damages include a principal of $383,483.30 and interest of
$67,763.70.
 
            b.
Costs
            The
invoices and purchase orders do not entitle Gyahn to attorney fees.  Oh Decl., Ex. A.  It would be entitled to costs as a prevailing
party.  CCP 1032(b).  Gyahn’s counsel has estimated its costs wo;; total
$3,904.54.  Gwynn Decl., ¶3.  These damages are ascertainable.
 
            c.
Conclusion
            Ascertainable
damages total $455,151.54 ($383,483.30 + $67,763.70 + $3,904.54).
 
            3.
Probability of Success 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining
this issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at
1484.  The court does not determine whether the claim is actually valid;
that determination will be made at trial and is not affected by the decision on
the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b). 
            Gyahn
presents evidence that Cornerstone ordered various items of women’s clothing
between April 2022 and June 2023.  Oh
Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Gyahn shipped all
requested items with packing lists and invoices.  Oh Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  The Customer Open Balance sheet shows
Cornerstone has not paid $383,483.30 of the $406,701.15 charged for the shipped
goods.  Oh Decl., ¶6, Ex. B.  
            Gyahn
has demonstrated a probability
of success on the merits.
 
            4.
Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose¿ 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.¿ CCP §484.090(a)(3). 
Gyahn seeks attachment for a proper purpose.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a right to attach orders against Cornerstone is granted in the
amount of $455,151.54.  No writ shall issue until Gyahn files a $10,000 undertaking.
