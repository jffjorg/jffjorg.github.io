The court has granted the defendant's application for permission to appear as counsel pro hac vice for Jeffrey E. Elkins.

The court has determined that Elkins meets the requirements for pro hac vice admission, including being an attorney in good standing and eligible to practice in the United States. The court has also determined that Elkins is not a resident of California, regularly employed in California, or regularly engaged in substantial business, professional, or other activities in California. The court's decision is based on the facts presented, including the allegations of negligence and negligent hiring by the plaintiff, and the court's review of the California Rules of Court and relevant statutes.
