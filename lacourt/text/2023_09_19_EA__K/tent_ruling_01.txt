Puente’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED. 
Background   
Plaintiff City of La Puente (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Since at least 2013, the properties
located at 17305, 17039, 17369 and 17371 E. Valley Boulevard, La Puente, CA
91744 (“the properties”) have been the subject of recurring hazardous and
substandard property conditions and other unlawful conditions due to inadequate
maintenance and/or neglect, including dilapidated and fire damaged structures.
Defendants have failed to comply with multiple notices and correspondence
issued by Plaintiff.
On July 27, 2021,
Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Defendants EML, LLC (“EML”), Mohamed Iqbal Bholat
(“Bholat”) (collectively, “Defendants”) and Does 1-50 for:
1.                 
Public Nuisance 
2.                 
Municipal Code Violations 
3.                 
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
A Post-Mediation Status Conference is set for February 5,
2024.
The Final Status Conference is set for March 11, 2024. Trial
is set for March 25, 2024.
Legal Standard
“An injunction is a writ or order
requiring a person to refrain from a particular act.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 525.)
“While the statute seems to limit that definition to prohibitory injunctions,
an injunction may also be mandatory,
i.e., may compel the performance of an affirmative act. In short, an injunction may be more
completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to perform or refrain from
performing a particular act.” (McDowell
v. Watson (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.)
“[T]rial courts should evaluate two interrelated factors
when deciding whether or not to issue a preliminary injunction. The first is
the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial. The
second is the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the
injunction were denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to
suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.” (IT Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 69-70.) “The trial court’s determination
must be guided by a ‘mix’ of the potential-merit and interim-harm factors; the
greater the plaintiff’s showing on one, the less must be shown on the other to
support an injunction.” (Butt v. State of
California (1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 678.)
However,
“[w]here a governmental entity seeking to enjoin the alleged violation of an
ordinance which specifically provides for injunctive relief establishes that it
is reasonably probable it will prevail on the merits, a rebuttable presumption
arises that the potential harm to the public outweighs the potential harm to
the defendant. If the defendant shows that it would suffer grave or irreparable
harm from the issuance of the preliminary injunction, the court must then
examine the relative actual harms to the parties.” (IT Corp., supra, 35
Cal.3d at 72.)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the
court, pursuant to La Puente Municipal Code (“LPMC”) Section 3.20.180 and Code
of Civil Procedure Sections 526 and 527, for an order enjoining EML from
maintaining a public nuisance at the real properties identified as Assessor’s
Parcels Nos. 8263-001-049 (17305 East Valley Boulevard, La Puente),
8263-001-046 (17309 East Valley Boulevard, La Puente), 8263-001-043 (17369 East
Valley Boulevard, La Puente) and 8263-001-050 (17371 East Valley Boulevard, La
Puente) (together, the “Subject Properties”) and requiring EML to abate the
public nuisances.
More specifically,
Plaintiff seeks an injunction enjoining EML and its agents, employees,
servants, successors, or assigns, or anyone acting on its behalf or in concert
with it, from: (1) maintaining the Subject Properties in violation of the LPMC;
(2) maintaining substandard, deteriorated asphalt on the Subject Properties;
(3) maintaining any building or structure on the Subject Properties in a
deteriorated or defective condition; (4) maintaining any building or structure
on the Subject Properties with graffiti; (5) maintaining any building or
structure on the Subject Properties with broken windows; (6) maintaining any
building or structure on the Subject Properties such that it is unsecured and
open to trespass; (7) maintaining the Subject Properties with junk, trash,
debris, and other improperly stored personal property and (8) maintaining the
Subject Properties with overgrown vegetation or dead, decayed, diseased or
hazardous weeds, trees, ground cover, and other vegetation.
Plaintiff also
requests an order, incidental to and in furtherance of the foregoing
injunction, that EML do the following within 30 days of service of the
preliminary injunction order: (1) repair, re-slurry, repave, or
otherwise restore all areas with substandard, deteriorated asphalt on the
Subject Properties; (2) repair or replace the exhaust/intake vent on the south
wall of the Bodega Market at the Subject Properties; (3) remove all junk,
trash, debris, and outdoor storage of crates, merchandise, vending machines,
and other personal property from the exterior of the Subject Properties; (4)
Repair or repaint deteriorated exterior wall coverings on the Subject
Properties; (5) Replace the light pole and light in location of empty pole base
in the parking lot on the Subject Properties; (6) abate all graffiti on the
Subject Properties; (7) remove all barbed wire from the Subject Properties; (8)
repair and restore to a safe and functional condition the damaged and
deteriorated walkway ceiling behind the salon and along the path leading to the
rear laundromat on the Subject Properties; (9) replace all broken windows on
the Subject Properties; (10) board up and secure any vacant building on the
Subject Properties, including painting of the plywood to match the building
color and (11) remove or attend to all overgrown vegetation or dead, decayed,
diseased or hazardous weeds, trees, and vegetation.
Request for
Judicial Notice
At the outset, the
court rules on Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) as follows:
Granted as to Exhibit A (i.e., grant deed for the Subject Properties recorded
April 28, 2008); Granted as to Exhibit B (i.e., LPMC Sections 1.08.020,
1.08.030, 1.08.050, 1.08.060, 3.20.030, 3.20.040, 3.20.070, 3.20.170 and
3.20.180).
Merits
The right of a municipality to seek enforcement of its laws
and regulations through the issuance of an injunction has long been established
in California. (See City of San Mateo v.
Hardy (1944) 64 Cal.App.2d 794, 797.) “By ordinance the city legislative
body may declare what constitutes a nuisance.” (Gov. Code § 38771.) “[T]he
legislative body may by ordinance establish a procedure for the abatement of a
nuisance. . .” (Gov. Code § 38773.5). “[A] nuisance per se arises when a
legislative body with appropriate jurisdiction, in the exercise of the police
power, expressly declares a particular object or substance, activity, or
circumstance, to be a nuisance. . .where the law expressly declares something
to be a nuisance, then no inquiry beyond its existence need be made and in this
sense its mere existence is said to be a nuisance per se.” (Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific
Transportation Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1207.) “Nuisances per se are
so regarded because no proof is required, beyond the actual fact of their
existence, to establish the nuisance.” (McClatchy
v. Laguna Lands, Limited (1917) 32 Cal.App. 718, 725.)
LPMC Section 1.08.060 provides that “[i]n addition to other
penalties provided by law, any condition caused or permitted to exist in
violation of any provision of this code is deemed to be a public nuisance and
may be summarily abated as such by the city, and each day that condition
continues will constitute a new and separate offense.”
Plaintiff has proffered the following evidence:
The Subject Properties, although
identified by separate parcel numbers, are adjacent to each other, are commonly
known as 17305-17371 Valley Boulevard, La Puente and comprise a commercial
shopping center/plaza and large parking lot for customers who may visit the
businesses within the shopping center/plaza (Tellez Decl., ¶ 3) The Subject
Properties are owned by EML (Id., ¶ 5; see also, RJN, Exh. A). Since at
least 2013, the Subject Properties have been the subject of recurring hazardous
and substandard property conditions and other unlawful conditions due to
inadequate property maintenance and/or neglect, including dilapidated and fire
damaged structures. (Tellez Decl., ¶ 6). Plaintiff issued a Notice of Violation
to EML on September 14, 2017, as well as notices on February 12, 2021 and on or
about April 29, 2021. (Id., ¶¶ 7, 12 and 14, Exh. G). Additionally,
Plaintiff’s attorneys issued letters addressed to Ebrahim Limbada, Managing
Member of EML on September 11, 2020, April 29, 2021 and June 24, 2021, warning
EML that Plaintiff would commence legal enforcement proceedings (which could
include injunctive relief) if EML failed to make enumerated corrective actions.
(Sanchez Decl., ¶ 3). In mid-January 2021, Plaintiff’s maintenance crew went
out to the Subject Properties, in response to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s
Department’s request and performed a clean-up of excessive accumulation of
shopping carts with trash and spoiled food, combustible cardboards, and other
junk, trash and debris in connection with a homeless encampment on the Subject
Properties. (Tellez Decl., ¶ 11). Plaintiff also conducted inspections of the
Subject Properties on March 23, 2021 and in May and June 2021. (Id., ¶¶
13 and 15). 
Planning Manager Abraham Tellez (“Tellez”) represents that
he reinspected the Subject Properties on February 15, 2023 and again on June
27, 2023. (Tellez Decl., ¶¶ 19 and 20). Tellez itemizes substandard conditions
he observed on June 27, 2023 and attests that the conditions on the Subject
Properties violate LPMC Sections 3.20.070(d), (e)(1),(3),(4)&(6), (f),
(g)(G)&(L) and (j), 5.54.090(g), 10.12.050 and 10.28.050(B). (Id., ¶
22).
EML, in turn, fails to show any grave or irreparable harm, such that the court would be required to
examine the relative actual harms to the parties. Instead, EML contends that
the motion “improperly masquerades as a Preliminary Injunction but is in
reality a Motion for Summary Judgment.” (Opp., 12:25-26). The court disagrees. “The granting or
denying of a preliminary injunction does not constitute an adjudication of the
ultimate rights in controversy.” (Cohen v. Board of Supervisors (1985)
40 Cal.3d 277, 286.) Nothing prevents EML from asserting affirmative defenses.[1]
The granting of an injunction here does not deprive EML of its right to trial.
Further, an injunction subject to modification or dissolution under Code of
Civil Procedure § 533.
Next, EML contends that the motion is moot, because it “has
remedied almost every defect mentioned in the Complaint, and is in process with
the remaining issues. (Opp. 6:14-15). The court disagrees. First, EML’s
position is unsupported, inasmuch as it is based solely on Limbada’s unsigned
declaration. Second, EML concedes that not all defects have been corrected.
Third, it has not been established that “subsequent events make it absolutely
clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to
recur.” (Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC),
Inc. (2000) 528 U.S. 167, 170.)
EML claims that the injunction requested is mandatory in
nature, rather than prohibitive. Again, the court disagrees. The character of a
prohibitive injunction is not changed because it incidentally involves the
doing of an affirmative act. (United Railroads of San Francisco v. Superior
Court in and for City and County of San Francisco (1916) 172 Cal. 80).
The court determines that it is reasonably probable that Plaintiff
will prevail on the merits at trial on the matters such that Plaintiff is
entitled to injunctive relief. The motion is granted. Plaintiff, a public
entity, is not required to post an undertaking, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 529, subdivision (b)(3).
