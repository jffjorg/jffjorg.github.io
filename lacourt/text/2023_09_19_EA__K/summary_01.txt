Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of La Puente (Plaintiff) moves the court for a preliminary injunction to enjoin EML, LLC and Mohamed Iqbal Bholat (Defendants) from maintaining a public nuisance at the properties located at 17305, 17039, 17369, and 17371 East Valley Boulevard, La Puente, California. The Plaintiff alleges that the properties have been in a state of recurring hazardous and substandard property conditions due to inadequate maintenance and/or neglect since at least 2013. The Plaintiff has issued multiple notices and correspondence to the Defendants, which they have failed to comply with.

The court rules that it is reasonably probable that the Plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial and grants the motion for a preliminary injunction. The court orders that the Defendants must abate the public nuisances and prohibits them from maintaining the properties in a substandard condition. The court also orders the Defendants to perform specific corrective actions, including repairing and restoring the properties, removing junk and debris, and abating graffiti.

The court's decision is based on the Plaintiff's evidence, including the existence of hazardous and substandard property conditions, the failure of the Defendants to comply with notices and correspondence, and the public nuisance ordinance of the City of La Puente. The court also relies on California case law and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure Section 525, 526, and 527, and Government Code Section 38771 and 38773.5.
