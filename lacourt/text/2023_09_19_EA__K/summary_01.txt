Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of La Puente (Plaintiff) moves the court for a preliminary injunction to enjoin EML, LLC and Mohamed Iqbal Bholat (Defendants) from maintaining a public nuisance at the properties located at 17305, 17039, 17369, and 17371 East Valley Boulevard, La Puente, California. The Plaintiff alleges that the properties have been in a state of recurring hazardous and substandard property conditions due to inadequate maintenance and/or neglect since at least 2013. The Plaintiff has issued multiple notices and correspondence to the Defendants, which they have failed to comply with.

The court rules that it is reasonably probable that the Plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial and grants the motion for a preliminary injunction. The court orders that the Defendants must abate the public nuisances and prohibits them from maintaining the properties in a substandard condition. The court also orders the Defendants to perform specific corrective actions, including repairing and restoring the properties, removing junk and debris, and abating graffiti.

The court's decision is based on the Plaintiff's evidence, including the existence of hazardous and substandard property conditions, the failure of the Defendants to comply with notices and correspondence, and the public nuisance ordinance of the City of La Puente. The court also relies on California case law and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure Section 525, 526, and 527, and Government Code Section 38771 and 38773.5.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the City of La Puente's motion for a preliminary injunction against EML, LLC, and Mohamed Iqbal Bholat. The City has alleged that the properties at 17305-17371 East Valley Boulevard, La Puente, have been the subject of recurring hazardous and substandard property conditions since at least 2013, and that EML has failed to comply with multiple notices and correspondence. The City seeks to enjoin EML from maintaining a public nuisance and requiring EML to abate the public nuisances.

The judge finds that it is reasonably probable that the City will prevail on the merits at trial on the matters, and therefore grants the motion for a preliminary injunction. The City is not required to post an undertaking, as it is a public entity.

The judge notes that the City's motion is not a motion for summary judgment, but rather a motion for a preliminary injunction, which is a different type of relief. The judge also finds that the City's allegations are supported by evidence, including the fact that the City's maintenance crew cleaned up excessive accumulation of shopping carts and debris in January 2021, and that the City conducted inspections of the properties in 2021 and 2023.

## Case Summary: City of La Puente v. EML, LLC

**Case Number:** 21PSCV00609

**Hearing Date:** September 19, 2023

**Department:** K

**Plaintiff:** City of La Puente

**Defendant:** EML, LLC ("EML") and Mohamed Iqbal Bholat ("Bholat")

**Locations:** 17305, 17039, 17369 and 17371 E. Valley Boulevard, La Puente, CA 91744

**Issues:**

* **Public Nuisance:** The City of La Puente alleges that the properties owned by EML, LLC, located at 17305-17371 E. Valley Boulevard, La Puente, CA, constitute a public nuisance due to recurring hazardous and substandard property conditions.

* **Municipal Code Violations:**  The City claims that the properties violate several sections of the La Puente Municipal Code (LPMC), including those related to property maintenance, sanitation, and safety.

**Facts:**

* Since at least 2013, the properties have experienced recurring issues such as dilapidated structures, fire damage, substandard asphalt, graffiti, broken windows, unsecured buildings, junk accumulation, and overgrown vegetation.
* The City has issued multiple notices of violation to EML since 2017, warning them to correct the issues.
* In 2021, the City's maintenance crew cleaned up a homeless encampment on the property.
* The City performed inspections in 2021 and 2023, finding ongoing violations of the LPMC.

**Legal Arguments:**

* **Plaintiff (City):**  The City argues that it is reasonably probable they will prevail at trial on the public nuisance and municipal code violation claims. They emphasize the ongoing nature of the violations and the potential harm to public health and safety. They also rely on the LPMC's provisions allowing for injunctive relief against nuisances.

* **Defendant (EML):**  EML contends that the City's motion for a preliminary injunction is actually a motion for summary judgment. They also argue that the motion is moot because they have remedied most of the issues and are working on the remaining ones. They further claim that the requested injunction is mandatory, not prohibitive.

**Judge's Decision:**

* **The court granted the City's motion for a preliminary injunction.** 
* The court found that the City is likely to prevail on the merits and that the potential harm to the public outweighs any potential harm to EML.  
* The court rejected EML's arguments that the motion was moot or a disguised summary judgment attempt.

**Orders:**

* EML is enjoined from maintaining the properties in violation of the LPMC.
* EML is ordered to abate the nuisances within 30 days, including repairs, clean-up, and addressing safety concerns.

**Next Steps:**

* The case will proceed to trial to determine the ultimate rights and liabilities of the parties.

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Number**: 21PSCV00609
**Hearing Date**: September 19, 2023
**Dept**: K
**Plaintiff**: City of La Puente
**Defendants**: EML, LLC, Mohamed Iqbal Bholat, and Does 1-50

**Background**: The City of La Puente alleges that the properties located at 17305-17371 East Valley Boulevard, La Puente, CA 91744 have been subject to recurring hazardous and substandard property conditions and other unlawful conditions due to inadequate maintenance and/or neglect since at least 2013.

**Motions**: The City has moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin EML from maintaining a public nuisance at the properties and requiring EML to abate the public nuisances.

**Legal Standard**: An injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular act or to perform a particular act. When deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction, courts evaluate two interrelated factors: the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial and the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction were denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.

**Discussion**: The City seeks to enjoin EML from maintaining the properties in violation of the La Puente Municipal Code, including substandard, deteriorated asphalt, damaged and defective structures, graffiti, broken windows, and overgrown vegetation. The City also requests an order requiring EML to repair, replace, and abate the public nuisances.

**Request for Judicial Notice**: The court grants the City's Request for Judicial Notice as to Exhibit A (grant deed for the properties) and Exhibit B (La Puente Municipal Code sections).

**Merits**: The City has the right to seek enforcement of its laws and regulations through the issuance of an injunction. The La Puente Municipal Code provides that any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of the code is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be summarily abated by the City.

**Evidence**: The City has proffered evidence that the properties have been the subject of recurring hazardous and substandard property conditions and other unlawful conditions due to inadequate property maintenance and/or neglect since at least 2013. The City has also issued notices to EML and conducted inspections of the properties.

**EML's Arguments**: EML argues that the motion is moot because it has remedied almost every defect mentioned in the Complaint and is in process with the remaining issues. The court disagrees, finding that EML's position is unsupported and that not all defects have been corrected.

**Case Number:** 21PSCV00609

**Hearing Date:** September 19, 2023

**Plaintiff:** City of La Puente

**Defendant:** EML, LLC, Mohamed Iqbal Bholat

---

The City of La Puente's motion for a preliminary injunction against EML, LLC and Mohamed Iqbal Bholat is **granted**. The properties located at 17305, 17039, 17369, and 17371 E. Valley Boulevard in La Puente, CA have had hazardous and substandard conditions since at least 2013 due to inadequate maintenance and neglect. EML, LLC and Mohamed Iqbal Bholat have not complied with multiple notices and correspondence from the City.

**Legal Standard:** A preliminary injunction can prohibit or require a specific act. The court considers two factors when deciding on a preliminary injunction: the likelihood of the plaintiff prevailing at trial and the interim harm to the plaintiff if the injunction is denied compared to the harm to the defendant if the injunction is granted.

**Discussion:** The City seeks an injunction to stop EML from maintaining public nuisances at the properties, including maintaining deteriorated buildings and structures, broken windows, junk, trash, and overgrown vegetation. The City also requests EML to repair, restore, and remove certain conditions within 30 days of the injunction order. The court has granted the City's request for judicial notice on a grant deed for the properties and relevant sections of the La Puente Municipal Code.

**Merits:** The right of a municipality to seek enforcement of its laws and regulations through an injunction is established in California. LPMC Section 1.08.060 considers a condition that violates any provision of the code to be a public nuisance. The City has provided evidence of hazardous and substandard conditions at the properties since 2013, and EML has not shown any grave or irreparable harm.

**Next Steps:** A post-mediation status conference is set for February 5, 2024, a final status conference for March 11, 2024, and the trial for March 25, 2024.
