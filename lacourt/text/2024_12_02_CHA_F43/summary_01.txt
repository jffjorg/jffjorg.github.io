The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jacob Alvarado v. American Honda Motor Co. The case involves a Song-Beverly action alleging defects in the Honda Sensing system in a 2022 Honda Insight purchased by Alvarado. The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., has moved to compel inspection of Alvarado's vehicle to examine the system. The court has found that the defendant has failed to meet and confer with Alvarado as required by law, and therefore will continue the hearing to a future date and order the parties to meet and confer. The court will also set a status conference and require a joint status report from the parties regarding their meet and confer efforts.
