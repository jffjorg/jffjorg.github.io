And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a second amended cross-complaint filed by Osik Media LLC against Rittersbacher Sunset LLC. The plaintiff, Rittersbacher Sunset LLC, owns the real property at 8300 West Sunset Boulevard, which was the previous site of the Hollywood Standard Hotel. Osik Media LLC and its alleged co-conspirators allegedly wrongfully possessed and held over a portion of the property, attempting to extort a financial windfall or lucrative lease from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sold the property for $112.5 million but alleges that it suffered damages of $15 million due to the continuing unlawful possession of the property.

The plaintiff demurs to Osik's claim for unjust enrichment or restitution, arguing that there is no such cause of action in California. The court agrees, citing previous cases that have held that there is no cause of action for unjust enrichment. The court sustains the demurrer and grants the plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend its pleading.
