English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses Defendant Robin Engel's motion for reconsideration of the Court's prior order regarding the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by Plaintiff Aaron Celious. The Court has revived the SAC, and Engel seeks to renew his demurrer and motion to strike the SAC. The Court grants Engel's motion for reconsideration and will rule on the demurrer and motion to strike on the merits. The Court sustains Engel's demurrer to Plaintiff's fifth cause of action (negligent interference with prospective economic relations) and strikes Plaintiff's sixth cause of action (violation of the UCL) as well as Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The Court also denies Engel's motion to strike Plaintiff's prayer for costs.
