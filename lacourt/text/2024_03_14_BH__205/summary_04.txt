And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is a denial of the Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Defendants from entering the Property, altering the Plaintiff's landscaping, or damaging or destroying the Ficus hedge. The court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy at law for the alleged wrongdoing. The Ficus hedge is a newly planted hedge and can be easily replaced if damaged by the Defendants. The court concludes that the Plaintiff has not shown irreparable harm and therefore does not need to consider whether the Plaintiff can show that they are likely to prevail on the merits of their claims.
