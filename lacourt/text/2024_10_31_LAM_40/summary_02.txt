And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to unseal the Stipulated Judgment filed by Plaintiff Hania Moghaddam c/o Vista Bastian Estates, LP. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendants, Erika Silva, Humberto Alfaro, Jessica Alfaro, Kenya Alfaro, David Alfaro, and Rylee Alfaro, breached the terms of the Judgment by filing another lawsuit against the Plaintiff, case number 24STCV10316, which relates to the same Subject Property. The Plaintiff claims that the Judgment should be unsealed so that she can enforce it under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6.

The Plaintiff argues that the Defendants' breach of the Judgment is evident and that the Plaintiff would be substantially prejudiced if the relevant portions of the Judgment remain sealed. The Plaintiff also claims that the Defendants' inability to understand English, despite being represented by counsel and having access to a Spanish interpreter, does not excuse their breach of the Judgment.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has established a prima facie case for unsealing the Judgment and that the Defendants have not opposed the motion or offered any evidence to rebut the Plaintiff's claims. Therefore, the motion to unseal the Stipulated Judgment is granted.
