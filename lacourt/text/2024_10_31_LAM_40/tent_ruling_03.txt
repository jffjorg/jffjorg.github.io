Special Motion to

[RES ID # 1434]



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Millicent Powell (Powell)
sues Defendants KPL Select Property Management, Inc. (KPL) and Does 1 through
10 pursuant to a July 29, 2024 Complaint alleging causes of action for: (1) Malicious
Prosecution; (2) Tenant’s Right to Quiet Enjoyment; (3) Violation of LAMC 8.52.130(B)(2)(e);
(4) Violation of LAMC 8.52.130(B)(4); (5) Violation of LAMC 8.52.130(B)(7); (6)
Violation of Beverly Hills Municipal Code Just Cause Ordinance.
The claims arise from the following
allegations. Powell alleges that on April 28, 2024, KPL served her with a
three-day notice to pay or quit for $6,984.36 in unpaid rent between February
1, 2024 and April 30, 2024. Powell asserts that she then provided a cashier’s
check for $6,984.36 to KPL on April 29, 2024. On May 7, 2024, KPL filed an
unlawful detainer action against Powell. KPL voluntarily dismissed the action
on July 18, 2024. 
B. Motion Before the Court
On October 4, 2024, KPL filed the
instant special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion) the first cause of action
for malicious prosecution, the fourth and fifth causes of action for violations
of LAMC section 8.52.140 subdivision (B)(4) and subdivision (B)(7), and the
sixth cause of action for violation of the Beverly Hills Municipal Code Just
Cause Ordinance.
On October 18, 2024, Powell opposed
the motion. 
On October 24, 2024, KPL replied. 
On October 25, 2024, Powell filed a
supplemental declaration in support of its opposition, attaching Exhibits 1 and
2 which were inadvertently omitted from the opposition. 
KPL’s anti-SLAPP motion is now
before the Court. 
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
Anti-SLAPP analysis under Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.16 proceeds in two familiar steps. In the first
step, the defendant or moving party must make “a threshold showing that the
challenged cause of action is one ‘arising from’ protected activity.” (Barry
v. State Bar of California (2017) 2 Cal.5th 318, 321, quotations omitted (Barry).)
In this context, the term “protected activity” refers to speech or petitioning
activities. (Barry, 2 Cal.5th at p. 321.) A claim arises from protected
activity when that activity underlies or forms the basis for the claim;
otherwise stated, “the defendant’s act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of
action [must] itself [be] … an act in furtherance of the right of petition or
free speech.” (Park v. Board of Trustees of California State University
(2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057, 1063, quotations omitted (Park).) “[T]he focus is
on determining what ‘the defendant’s activity [is] that gives rise to his or
her asserted liability—and whether that activity constitutes protected speech
or petitioning.’” (Ibid.) In teasing out whether protected conduct
exists, courts should consider the elements of the challenged claim and what
actions by the defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis
for liability. (Ibid.) 
If the court finds the defendant or
moving party succeeds at the first step, then the burden shifts to the
plaintiff to “demonstrate[] a probability of prevailing on the claim.” (Ibid.
[quotations omitted].) At the second step, courts “evaluate the defendants’
evidence only to determine if it defeats that submitted by the plaintiff as a
matter of law.’ [Citation.] ‘[I]n order to establish the requisite probability
of prevailing [citation], the plaintiff need only have “‘stated and
substantiated a legally sufficient claim.’” [Citation.] “Put another way, the
plaintiff ‘must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and
supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable
judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.’”‘ [Citation.]
… That burden [is] not particularly high.” (Area 51 Productions, Inc. v.
City of Alameda (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 581, 602 (Area 51 Productions,
Inc.).) “Claims with the requisite minimal merit may proceed.” (Navellier
v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 94 (Navallier).) If the cause of
action satisfies both prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute, then it is subject to
being struck. (Barry, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 321.) 
As stated by our State’s highest
Court: “This is a ‘summary-judgment-like procedure at an early stage of the
litigation.’” (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th
180, 192 (Varian).) 
B. Analysis
1.    
First-Prong Analysis 
a.     
Relevant Law 
A defendant meets his burden of
showing that a plaintiff’s claim arises from that defendant’s exercise of free
speech or petition rights by making a prima facie showing that the act or
conduct underlying the plaintiff’s claims falls within one of the four
categories found in Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16, subdivision (e). (Navellier,
supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 88.) “Courts should analyze each claim for
relief — each act or set of acts supplying a basis for relief, of which there
may be several in a single pleaded cause of action — to determine whether the
acts are protected [the first prong of the analysis] and, if so, whether the
claim they give rise to has the requisite degree of merit to survive the motion
[the second prong of the analysis].” (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health System
(2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1010.) “[W]hen the allegations referring to an arguably
protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially
on non-protective activity, collateral allusions to protected activity should
not subject the cause of action to the anti-SLAPP statute.” (Martinez v.
Metabolife Internat., Inc. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 181, 188 (Martinez).) 
Code of Civil Procedure Section
425.16, subdivision (e) states: 
As used in this section, “act in
furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United
States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue”
includes:  
(1) any written or oral statement
or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding,
or any other official proceeding authorized by law,  
(2) any written or oral statement
or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a
legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding
authorized by law,  
(3) any written or oral statement
or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection
with an issue of public interest, or  
(4) any other conduct in
furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the
constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an
issue of public interest.  
(Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(e) (italics added.) 
Allegations of protected conduct
that are ‘merely incidental’ to the unprotected conduct on which liability is
based does not constitute protected conduct for anti-SLAPP purposes. (Martinez
v. Metabolife Internat., Inc. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 181, 188 [“[W]hen the
allegations referring to arguably protected activity are only incidental to a
cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity, collateral
allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the
anti-SLAPP statute”]; see Peregrine Funding Inc. v. Sheppard Mullin Richter
& Hampton LLP (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 658, 672 [same in mixed cause of
action context]; see, e.g., Moriarty v. Laramar Management Corp. (2014)
224 Cal.App.4th 125, 133-135, 139 [holding causes of action did not arise from
alleged eviction, despite their incorporation of all prior allegations by
reference].) 
At the first step of the anti-SLAPP
analysis, the moving defendant bears the burden of identifying all allegations
of protected activity, and the claims for relief supported by them. When relief
is sought based on allegations of both protected and unprotected activity, the
unprotected activity is disregarded for the first prong of the anti-SLAPP
discussion. If the court determines that relief is sought based on allegations
arising from activity protected by the statute, the second step is reached. (Baral
v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396 (Baral).) 
b.    
Discussion 
KPL argues that Complaint’s first
cause of action for malicious prosecution, the fourth and fifth causes of
action for violations of LAMC sections 8.52.140 subdivision (B)(4) and
subdivision (B)(7), and the sixth cause of action for violation of the Beverly
Hills Municipal Code Just Cause Ordinance are grounded in protected activity,
specifically pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 425.16, subdivision (e),
because the Complaint pursues claims based on KPL bringing the unlawful detainer
action. (Mot. p. 4.) 
A review of the Complaint shows
that the first, fourth, fifth and sixth causes of action all involve KPL’s
unlawful detainer action (See Complaint ¶¶ 12-14 [KPL’s alleged wrongful
bringing of the unlawful detainer action as grounds for malicious prosecution],
30, 35 [KPL’s alleged wrongful bringing of the unlawful detainer action in
violation of LAMC sections 8.52.140 subdivisions (B)(4) and (B)(7)], 40 [KPL’s
alleged wrongful bringing of the unlawful detainer action in violation of
Beverly Hills municipal code].)
Thus, the first, fourth, fifth and
sixth causes of action all arise from litigation activity as contemplated by
Section 425.16, subdivisions (e)(1)-(2). 
In her opposition Powell argues
that the anti-SLAPP motion does not apply to the malicious prosecution claim
because of “the malicious prosecution claim exception.” (Opp. p.4:9-10.) It is
not clear what exception Powell is referencing. The California Supreme Court
has conclusively held that the anti-SLAPP statute applies to malicious prosecution
actions. “[B]y its terms, section 425.16 potentially may apply to every
malicious prosecution action, because every such action arises from an
underlying lawsuit, or petition to the judicial branch. By definition, a
malicious prosecution suit alleges that the defendant committed a tort by
filing a lawsuit.” (Jarrow Formulas, Inc. v. LaMarche (2003) 31 Cal.4th
728 at 735.) 
To the extent that Powell is contending
that there is an exception to the litigation privilege for malicious prosecution,
(see cases cited at Opp., p. 4) these cases do not provide the basis for the analysis
necessary in an anti-SLAPP motion. (Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th
299, 323-324 [“Notwithstanding this relationship between the litigation
privilege and the anti-SLAPP statute, . . . the two statutes are not
substantively the same. . . . Nor do the two statutes serve the same purpose”].)
KPL has met its burden on
Anti-SLAPP of showing that the conduct alleged in Powell’s Complaint arises
from protected activity. The burden thus shifts to Powell to show a probability
of prevailing on the merits of her claims. 
2.    
Second Prong Analysis 
If the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis is met, “the
burden shifts to the plaintiff [i.e., Ms. Weiss] to demonstrate[] a probability
of prevailing on the claim[s].” (Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p.
1063 [quotations omitted].) “Claims with the requisite minimal merit may
proceed.” (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 94.) The plaintiff
“must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported
by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if
the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.” (Area 51 Productions,
Inc., supra, 20 Cal.App.5th at p. 602 [quotations omitted].) 
a.      First
Cause of Action, Malicious Prosecution 
To
establish a cause of action for malicious prosecution, "a plaintiff must
demonstrate that the prior action (1) was commenced by or at the direction of
the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in his, plaintiff's favor;
(2) was brought without probable cause; and (3) was initiated with malice.'
[Citations.]" (Sheldon Appel Co. v. Albert & Oliker (1989) 47
Cal.3d 863, 871.)
Here,
Powell argues that KPL brought the unlawful detainer action without probable
cause because she had paid the outstanding $6,984.36 amount as stated on the
three-day notice to quit before the action was commenced on May 7, 2024. (Opp.
pp. 5:16-6:12.)  KPL argues that it
believed, albeit mistakenly, that the unlawful detainer action was filed for Powell’s
unpaid rent of $15,282.46 which accrued in 2022 and 2023. (Goto Decl. ¶ 3.) KPL
asserts that upon realizing that the unlawful detainer action sought the wrong
amount and stated the wrong dates, it voluntarily dismissed the action. (Goto
Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) While Powell attaches evidence of the April three-day notice to
quit and her cashier’s check for $6,984.36, she does not offer evidence or
argument that rebuts KPL’s assertion of the $15,282.46 still owed and due. Nor
does she offer evidence that shows KPL knew that it did not have probable cause
to file the unlawful detainer action. (see Opp. pp. 5:16-6:12; Supp.
Decl., Ex 1.) Additionally, Powell has not provided any facts that indicate KPL
acted with malicious intent. 
Thus,
Powell has not met her burden to show a probability of prevailing on the merits
of her malicious prosecution cause of action.
b.     Fourth
and Fifth Causes of Action, Violations of LAMC Sections 8.52.140 subdivisions
(B)(4) and (B)(7) 
LAMC section 8.52.140 subdivision
(B)(4) states, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “[i]nfluence or
attempt to influence a Tenant to vacate a Fully or Partially Covered Rental
Unit through fraud, misrepresentation, intimidation or coercion. (LAMC §
8.52.140 subd. (B)(4).) 
LAMC section 8.52.140 subdivision
(B)(7) states in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “[t]ake action to
terminate any Tenancy including service of any notice to quit or other eviction
notice or bring any action to recover possession of a Fully or Partially
Covered Rental Unit based upon facts which the Landlord has no reasonable cause
to believe to be true or upon a legal theory which is untenable under the facts
known to the Landlord.” (LAMC § 8.52.140 subd. (B)(7).) 
As discussed above, Powell has not
shown that KPL brought the unlawful detainer action through fraud or otherwise based
on facts that KPL had no reasonable cause to believe. In her opposition, Powell
reasserts the facts as stated in her Complaint but does not address KPL’s
assertion of the $15,282.46 still owed and due from 2022 and 2023 which otherwise
appears to give KPL good cause to file an unlawful detainer action. KPL admits
that it erred in filing the action for the incorrect dates and amount, and KPL
promptly dismissed the action upon realizing the mistake. 
Thus,
Powell has not met her burden to show a probability of prevailing on the merits
of her fourth and fifth causes of action for violations of LAMC section
8.52.140 subdivisions (B)(4) and (B)(7). 
c.      Sixth
Cause of Action, Violation of Beverly Hills Municipal Code Just Cause Ordinance
The City of Beverly Hills Just Cause
ordinance requires that a landlord have a “just cause reason to evict a tenant.”
(Beverly Hills Municipal Codes §§ 4-5-502, 4-6-6 (A).)
Powell has not shown that KPL did
not have just cause to file the unlawful detainer action. Failure to pay rent
is a just cause. 
Thus,
Powell has not met her burden to show a probability of prevailing on the merits
of her sixth cause of action for violation of the Beverly Hills Municipal Code
Just Cause Ordinance. 
III. Conclusion
Accordingly, Defendant KPL Select
Property Management, Inc.’s Special Motion to Strike is GRANTED.
