DISCUSSION 
A.   
Motion
to Compel
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.260, subdivision (a)
provides that “[w]ithin 30 days after service of a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall
serve the original of the response to it on the party making the demand, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared in the action,
unless on motion of the party making the demand, the court has shortened the
time for response, or unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been
directed, the court has extended the time for response.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260(a).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides, in
relevant part, that:
 
If a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it, the following rules shall apply:
(a) The party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280.
(2) The party’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.
(b) The party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a)-(b).)
 
Counsel for Plaintiff attests that Plaintiff served the Request
for Production of Documents, Set Two on Defendant on June 19, 2023, but that,
to date and after multiple extensions, Defendant has not served any responses
to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. (April Ramirez
Decl., ¶¶ 5-12.) 
 
Defendant failed to
file any opposition, effectively conceding to the merits of the Motion and
consenting to the Court granting the relief requested. (See Cal. R. Ct.,
8.54(c) [“A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting
of the motion.”]; Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1410.)
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for an
order compelling responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents, Set Two.
 
B.    
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (c)
provides, in relevant part, that:
 
…the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(c).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.040 provides that:
 
A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every
person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify
the type of sanction sought. The notice of motion shall be supported by a
memorandum of points and authorities, and accompanied by a declaration setting
forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought.
(Code Civ. Proc.,
2023.040.)
 
Given the unopposed and therefore undisputed assertion that
Defendant failed to provide any responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents, Set Two, the
Court finds that the issuance of monetary sanctions is warranted.
 
After consideration of the
declaration of April Ramirez, (see Ramirez Decl. at ¶¶ 15-17), and relying on its own knowledge and
familiarity with the legal market, (569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437), the Court finds that the requested hourly rate of $450.00 per hour is
reasonable. The Court also finds 2.5 hours to prepare the instant Motion is
reasonable. The Court also awards 1.5 hours to prepare for and attend the
hearing. However, given the lack of any opposition, the Court does not award
the 2.5 hours requested to review the opposition and prepare a reply. Thus, the
Court awards attorney’s fees for 5 hours, for a total of $2,250.00 in
attorney’s fees.
 
The Court also awards $61.50
in costs for the filing fee, (Ramirez Decl. at ¶ 14), for a total award of $2,311.50.
 
As such, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record,
jointly and severally, in the reduced amount of $2,311.50.

After consideration of the briefing filed and oral
argument at the hearing, Plaintiff Tashika Sanderson’s unopposed Motion

Pacifica Health Enterprises, Inc., Under C.C.P. Sections 2030.290 Et Seq. And
Request For Costs, Sanctions, And Attorneys Fees Under C.C.P. §§ 2030.290 Et
Seq., 2023.030 Et Seq., And 2023.010 Et Seq. Against Defendant, Pacifica Health

DISCUSSION
 
C.    
Motion
to Compel
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.260, subdivision (a)
provides that “[w]ithin 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to
whom the interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the
response to them on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding
party the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the
responding party the court has extended the time for response.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.260(a).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides, in part,
that:
 
If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following
rules apply:
(a) The party to whom the
interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240.
(2) The party’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.
(b) The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(a)-(b).)
 
Counsel for Plaintiff attests that Plaintiff served the Special
Interrogatories, Set Two
on Defendant on June 19, 2023, but that, to date and after multiple

1410.)
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for an
order compelling responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set
Two.
 
D.   
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c)
provides, in relevant part, that:
 
The court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.040 provides that:
 
A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every
person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify
the type of sanction sought. The notice of motion shall be supported by a
memorandum of points and authorities, and accompanied by a declaration setting
forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought.

Given the unopposed and therefore undisputed assertion that

After consideration of the
declaration of April Ramirez, (see Ramirez Decl. at ¶¶ 15-17), and relying on its own knowledge and
