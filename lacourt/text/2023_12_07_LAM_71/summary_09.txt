And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' unopposed special motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's complaint arises from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute, specifically the filing of an unlawful detainer action and the notices leading up to the plaintiff's eviction from the Subject Property. The judge found that the defendants met their burden of showing that the plaintiff's complaint arises from protected activity and that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his cause of action against the defendants. The judge also noted that even if the plaintiff had met his burden, his allegation pertaining to the defendants' prosecution of their unlawful detainer claim falls within the litigation privilege, which is absolute and applies regardless of malice. As a result, the judge granted the defendants' special motion to strike the complaint and awarded them the right to separately move for an award of attorneys' fees and costs.
