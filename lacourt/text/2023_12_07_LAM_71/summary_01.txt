  - "Nonmonetary sanctions require evidence of willful violations of discovery orders or a history of egregious abuses of discovery." (R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd.)
  - "By requiring a violation of a discovery order before imposing nonmonetary sanctions, California courts can be sure that the offending party does not intend to comply with the discovery request." (Ruvalcaba v. Government Employees Insurance Co.)
  - "A terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction is never justified." (Newland v. Superior Court)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Petitioner State Farm Automobile Insurance Co.'s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions to dismiss and further bar Respondent Navid Faizi's demand for arbitration. The judge has also granted Petitioner's request for monetary sanctions against Respondent and her counsel of record in the reduced amount of $560.00. The sanctions are payable within 20 days.

The judge's decision was based on the fact that Respondent failed to provide discovery responses despite Court orders, but there was no evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. The judge also found that Petitioner failed to produce evidence demonstrating Respondent acted willfully in violating the Court's order.

The judge noted that terminating sanctions should not be made lightly and that nonmonetary sanctions require evidence of willful violations of discovery orders or a history of egregious abuses of discovery. The judge also cited several California cases that support the notion that terminating sanctions should be used sparingly and only when necessary to ensure compliance with the discovery rules.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and several California cases, including Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem, Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar, R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd., New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court, Ruvalcaba v. Government Employees Insurance Co., and Newland v. Superior Court.
