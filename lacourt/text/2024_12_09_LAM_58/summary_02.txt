And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Jacob Nalbandyan and Tannaz Ghayadi. The motion was filed without opposition from the Defendant, 99 Cents Only Stores, LLC. The Judge has concluded that the motion should be granted based on the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, which govern the process of an attorney seeking to withdraw as counsel. The Judge notes that the declaration accompanying the motion provides an adequate explanation for why the attorney is seeking to withdraw, stating that he has lost contact with the Plaintiff. The Judge also finds that notice was properly provided to the Plaintiff via mail, and that no prejudice will result from granting the motion given the lack of a set trial date and the next hearing being a Non-Appearance Case Review.
