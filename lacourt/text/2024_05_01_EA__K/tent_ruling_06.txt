[1]              Plaintiff’s counsel implicitly acknowledges
that the “delayed discovery rule” was not proffered as a basis to allow leave
to amend the FAC. (See Motion at 5 [“Plaintiff’s counsel didn’t plead the
delayed discovery rule in the FAC because he believed then, and still does,
that the filing of the original complaint tolled the statute of limitations.”][emphasis
added].)


[2]              Subdivision (a) of Section 1008
provides that “[w]hen an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a
court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally,
or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after
service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.” (Emphasis added).
