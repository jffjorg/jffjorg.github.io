And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, citing lack of jurisdiction. The plaintiff, Jacqueline Brady, is seeking to amend her complaint to add new defendants and causes of action, but the court has already sustained the demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 1008, which governs applications for reconsideration of orders and renewals of previous motions.
