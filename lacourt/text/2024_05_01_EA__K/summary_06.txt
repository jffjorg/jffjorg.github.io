The Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiff's counsel has implicitly acknowledged that the "delayed discovery rule" was not proffered as a basis to allow leave to amend the original complaint. The Judge also notes that the original complaint tolled the statute of limitations. The Judge is considering an application for an order to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The Judge is reminding the parties that under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1008, a party may apply to reconsider a prior order within 10 days after service of written notice of entry of the order. The Judge is seeking new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support the application.
