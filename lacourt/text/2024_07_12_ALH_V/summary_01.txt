And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents filed by plaintiff Josue Antonio Whitham. The motion is timely and the court finds that plaintiff satisfied the meet and confer requirement. However, the court denies the motion due to a lack of specificity in the separate statement submitted by plaintiff. The separate statement must provide all the information necessary to understand each discovery request and response, including the text of the request, response, and objection, as well as a statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. Plaintiff's separate statement did not adequately address the specifics of the discovery requests and responses, and therefore the motion is denied. The hearing is set for July 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
