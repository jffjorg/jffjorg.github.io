And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by General Motors, LLC. The demurrer is focused on the third and fourth causes of action alleged in the first amended complaint by plaintiff Marco Rivas. The court has found that the third cause of action alleges sufficient facts for fraudulent concealment. The court has also found that the fourth cause of action alleges sufficient facts for the Consumer Legal Remedies Act.

The court has rejected General Motors' argument that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts for the cause of action. The court has also rejected General Motors' argument that the plaintiff did not specifically allege fraud's elements as required.

The court has denied General Motors' motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The court has found that the plaintiff may recover punitive damages for fraudulent concealment.

The court has ordered General Motors to answer the first amended complaint within 20 days.
