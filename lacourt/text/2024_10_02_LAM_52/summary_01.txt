And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Helen Gezalyan, moves for an order deeming admission of the matters specified in her request for admissions to defendant BMW/Mini of Monrovia. However, the defendant argues that the plaintiff did not effect valid electronic service of the request for admissions, which is necessary to trigger the obligation to respond to discovery. The plaintiff served the request for admissions by email, but misspelled the email address for one of the four attorneys listed on the defendant's answer. The plaintiff argues that including the email addresses on the defendant's answer constitutes consent to electronic service, but the court finds that this is not a valid method of indicating consent. Additionally, the plaintiff did not confirm the correct email address for service before sending the request for admissions. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to deem the matters admitted.
