PARTY: Plaintiff
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendants Hyundai Motor America and Riverside Hyundai (collectively,
“Defendants”)  
            
            The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply
papers. 
 
BACKGROUND 
            Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1)
violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach of express warranty; (2) violation of
Song-Beverly Act – breach of implied warranty; (3) violation of Song-Beverly
Act – Section 1793.2, subdivision (b); and (4) violation of the Song-Beverly
Act section 1796.5.
 
 
On
September 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.  On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
motion for attorney’s fees (the “Motion”) to recover $13,684.50 in attorney’s fees
and $1,129.43 in costs expended in the prosecution of this action.
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
            Defendants’ objections to the Declaration of Michael
Saeedian (“Saeedian Decl.”) are OVERRULED in their entirety.  
 
DISCUSSION

            A prevailing party in an action under the Song-Beverly
Act may be entitled to attorney’s fees.  (Civ.
Code § 1794, subd. (d); see also CCP §
1032, subd. (a)(4).)  Attorney’s fees
ordinarily include compensation for all hours reasonably spent, including those
necessary to establish and defend the claims. 
(Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32
Cal.3d 621, 639.)  The party moving for attorney’s
fees has the burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the
appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. 
(Christian Research Institute v.
Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320.) 
Where a case is premised on a contingent fee agreement it is appropriate
to award reasonable attorney’s fees for time reasonably expended by the
attorney.  (Glaviano v. Sacramento City Unified School Dist. (2018) 22
Cal.App.5th 744, 755.)  If the time
expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended are not
reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must take this into
account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
 
            As a preliminary matter, it is undisputed that Plaintiff
is the prevailing party who is entitled to attorney’s fees as provided in the
Song-Beverly Act.  Plaintiff presents
evidence that that on September 12, 2023, Plaintiffs and Defendants entered
into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) that specifically
provides for Plaintiff’s recovery of attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to the
Song-Beverly Act.  (See Saeedian
Decl. ¶ 18.)
 
Reasonableness of
Counsels’ Hourly Rates
In
determining what constitutes a reasonable compensation for an attorney who has
rendered services in connection with a legal proceeding, the court may and
should consider the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount
involved, the skill required and the skill employed in handling the litigation,
the attention given, the success of the attorney’s efforts, his learning, his
age and his experience in the particular type of work demanded.  (Church
of Scientology v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, 659.)  An award of attorney fees may be based on
counsel’s declarations, without production of detailed time records.  (Raining
Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.)  The verified time statements of attorneys, as
officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California
State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)  
 
             A court awards
attorney’s fees based on the “lodestar” method which is “the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”  (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  The trial court has broad authority to
determine the amount of a reasonable fee. 
(Id.)  The loadstar figure may be adjusted, based on
a consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.  (Id.)  Generally, the reasonable hourly rate used
for the lodestar calculation is that prevailing in the community for similar
work.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 603, 616.)  Nevertheless,
where an attorney has been awarded attorney’s fees for comparable work at
comparable hourly rates in other actions, the hourly rate will be deemed
reasonable.  (Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462,
473-74.)  Where a defendant does not
produce evidence contradicting the reasonableness of plaintiff’s counsel’s
hourly rates, the Court will deem an attorney’s hourly rate reasonable.  (Id.
at 473.)  
 
In
cases involving the Song-Beverly Act, the lodestar figure may be augmented or
diminished.  (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 819.)  In
determining whether or not a lodestar figure will be multiplied for purposes of
attorney’s fees, the court takes various relevant factors into account,
including: (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the
skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; and (3) the contingent
nature of the fee award, based on the uncertainty of prevailing on the merits
and of establishing eligibility for the award. 
(Id.) 
 
In
support of the Motion, Plaintiff provides evidence of counsel’s billing
records.  (See Saeedian Decl. ¶10,
Exhibit A.)  Three timekeepers billed for
work performed during the litigation: two attorneys whose hourly rates are $695
per hour and $525 per hour, and a law clerk whose hourly rate is $250 per
hour.  (Saeedian Decl. ¶ 11.)  
 
The
Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that their attorneys’ hourly
rates are reasonable based on their qualifications, skills and experience.  (See 569 East County Boulevard
LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426,
436-37.)  
 
Reasonableness of
Requested Fees
Where
a party is challenging the reasonableness of attorney’s fees as excessive that
party must attack itemized billing with evidence that the fees claimed were not
appropriate or obtain the declaration of an attorney with expertise in the
procedural and substantive law to demonstrate that the fees claimed were unreasonable.  (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 550, 563-64.)  A reduced award
might be fully justified by a general observation that an attorney
overlitigated a case or submitted a padded bill or that the opposing party has
stated valid objections.  (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 44, 101.)  Attorney
billing records are given a presumption of credibility.  (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.)
 
Defendants
argue that Plaintiff’s billing records are inflated by time logged for
prelitigation client communications and time logged for clerical work.
 
Defendants
provide no authority for their argument that time billed for prelitigation work
is not recoverable, and the Court therefore finds that Defendants have not
satisfied their burden to show that these billing entries are unreasonable.  The Court finds, however, that some of the
time entries logged by Plaintiff’s counsel’s law clerk correspond with work
that is primarily clerical in nature.[1]   As a
result, the Court finds it appropriate to reduce Plaintiff’s recovery of fees
by $300, which represents 1.2 hours of work at a rate of $200 per hour.  
 
With
respect to the costs requested in the Motion, Defendants indicate that they
intend to file a motion to tax costs in order to challenge items claimed in the
Memorandum of Costs (the “MOC”) filed with the Motion.  Accordingly, the Court declines to grant
Plaintiff the costs requested in the Motion to allow Defendants to file their
motion to tax costs. 
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion in accordance with the terms set
forth above.  Plaintiff is ordered to
refile the MOC included as an exhibit to the Motion within five days of the
date of this order. 
 
 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
