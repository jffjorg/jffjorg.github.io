[1] Purely clerical or secretarial
tasks should not be billed at a lawyer or paralegal’s usual rate, regardless of
who performs them. (Missouri v. Jenkins (1989) 491 U.S. 274, 288, n.
10.)  Calendaring, preparing proofs of service, internal filing, preparing
binders for a hearing, and scanning are examples of tasks that have been found
to be purely clerical and thus noncompensable or compensable at a reduced
billing rate.  (Save Our Uniquely Rural Community Environment v. County
of San Bernardino (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1187; Ridgeway v.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2017) 269 F.Supp.3d 975, 991.)
