 Case Number:  23VECV02713    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  T 23VECV02713  Acuna v Perez Ex parte application to shorten time to hear plaintiff’s motion to  compel responses at deposition, to compel deposition part 2, and request for a  discovery referee: Grant ex parte request.  The motion set for 3/19/2025 is  advanced to today and denied in full.  No  sanctions to anyone. This motion and  response, and the colloquy at deposition, are just examples of the unnecessary and  unprofessional acrimony between counsel.  Both sides just wasted a lot of time and money.There will be no discovery referee in this case. By the way, if anyone at trial tells a witness to just answer yes or no, you may be admonished in front of the jury.The court will have a long discussion about civility at the FSC because it will not tolerate at trial the behavior of counsel as exhibited in the papers and deposition.There are defendants who have not appeared.  They will be dismissed at an upcoming OSC to be scheduled by the court.Be advised: The court is not going to continue the trial.
