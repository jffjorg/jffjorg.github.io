And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Acuna v. Perez. The plaintiff's motion to compel responses at deposition, compel deposition part 2, and request for a discovery referee was granted ex parte, meaning without notice to the other party. The motion was previously set for March 19, 2025, but was advanced to today and denied in full. The judge expresses disappointment with the unprofessional behavior of counsel and the unnecessary acrimony between them, which wasted a lot of time and money. The judge also warns that anyone who tells a witness to only answer yes or no at trial may be admonished in front of the jury. Additionally, the judge plans to discuss civility at the FSC and trial, and will not tolerate the behavior exhibited in the papers and deposition. Finally, the judge will dismiss defendants who have not appeared and will not continue the trial.
