The court
does not advance hearings on motions until the motion has been filed and
served.
If not
filed at served by the time of the exparte, the application is denied without
prejudice.
If it filed
and served by the time of the exparte, then counsel needs to explain why they
waited 4 months after the Rodriguez case to file the motion.  Had it done so timely, the motion could have
been timely heard.  The shall be good
cause for an ex parte application to be granted.  Please review the standards under CRC for ex
parte applications. 
The court
notes there is an untimely MSJ set for hearing on 2/24/2025 and it is the court’s
intent to strike that motion as it is set within 30 days of trial without
permission of the court.  The court previously
denied the application to advance the hearing date.  See the minute order of 12/17/2024.
