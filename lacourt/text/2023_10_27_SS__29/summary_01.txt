And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling issued by the Judge grants two motions to compel filed by the Defendant, City of Los Angeles, Travel Town Transportation Museum, and City of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation. The Defendant had filed these motions on August 29, 2023, seeking to compel the Plaintiff, Malvina Mkhchyan, Ovsanna Mkhchian, and Adam Bersigian, to respond to discovery requests and special interrogatories served on February 16, 2023. The Plaintiff failed to respond to these discovery requests, and the Defendant sought sanctions against the Plaintiff for this failure.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery constituted a misuse of the discovery process, warranting the imposition of sanctions. The Judge awarded sanctions to the Defendant in the amount of $1,050, calculated as $525 for each motion to compel.

The Judge also ordered the Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant, written responses to the Defendant's special interrogatories and requests for production within 21 days of notice of this order. The Defendant's request for monetary sanctions was granted in part, and the Plaintiff and counsel of record K & L Associates were ordered to pay monetary sanctions to the Defendant in the amount of $1,050 within 21 days of notice of this order.
