And here is the summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling states that the Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to their requests for admissions. The Court also grants the Plaintiff's request for sanctions in part, ordering the Defendant to pay a sanction of $885. The ruling is the result of a dispute over the Defendant's failure to provide substantive responses to the Plaintiff's requests for admissions, and is based on the California Civil Discovery Act. The Court finds that the Defendant's failure to respond was not substantially justified and that the imposition of sanctions is warranted. The ruling also notes that the Defendant's counsel claims to have lost contact with the Defendant and has been unable to communicate with her, but finds that this does not excuse the Defendant's obligations under the Civil Discovery Act.
