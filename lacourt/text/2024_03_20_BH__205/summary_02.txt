And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the City's motion to continue the trial date from September 23, 2024 to sometime in 2025. The City argued that its counsel was unavailable for trial due to another trial scheduled for September 10, 2024, and that the parties needed more time to complete discovery. However, the judge found that the City did not provide sufficient information about the length of the other trial or the expected duration of the continuance. Additionally, the judge noted that the parties had only just begun written discovery and had not taken any depositions, which was unusual given the procedural history of the case. As a result, the judge concluded that a continuance was not warranted and denied the motion.
