And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by WS Communities, LLC (Defendant) to the complaint filed by Tribune Media Company (Plaintiff) in an unlawful detainer action. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff has no standing to sue because there is no contractual relationship between the parties, that the notice to pay rent or quit is invalid, and that the complaint lacks specificity and clarity.

The judge finds that the Plaintiff's complaint is sufficient to state a valid cause of action and that the notice to pay rent or quit is valid. The judge also finds that the Defendant's demurrer is timely and that the Plaintiff has shown a reasonable possibility of successfully amending the complaint to address the Defendant's concerns.

The judge also grants the Defendant's request for judicial notice of the sublease agreement between Nextstar Broadcasting Inc. and WS Communities LLC and a copy of the 3 day notice to pay fixed monthly rent or quit. However, the judge finds that the sublease and 3 day notice are not properly authenticated and therefore cannot be considered as evidence.

Based on the foregoing, the judge OVERRULES the demurrer and allows the Plaintiff's complaint to proceed.
