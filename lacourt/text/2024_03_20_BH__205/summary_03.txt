Summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint and second amended answer by Roem Automotive Inc. The case arises from a landlord-tenant dispute over a commercial lease. Roem Automotive Inc. failed to pay amounts due under the lease and wrongfully vacated and abandoned the premises. The plaintiff, 3Gen NET LEASE, LP, seeks to recover damages for breach of contract and common count. Roem Automotive Inc. seeks to file a cross-complaint for fraud and rescission.

The court grants leave to file the second amended answer, which adds affirmative defenses that were inadvertently omitted. The court also grants leave to file the cross-complaint, which is compulsory and arises from the same transaction as the plaintiff's complaint. The court rejects the plaintiff's argument that Roem Automotive Inc. is acting in bad faith, finding that the fact that the cross-complaint may be contradicted by some evidence is not evidence of bad faith. The court concludes that the preferable practice is to permit the cross-complaint and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency at a later stage in the proceedings.
