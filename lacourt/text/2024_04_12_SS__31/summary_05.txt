Summary in English:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Wesco Insurance Company's motion to set aside the dismissal of its First Amended Complaint against Defendants Pedro Zavala, et al. The Plaintiff's counsel claimed that he made a reservation to appear remotely for an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Request Entry of Default / Default Judgment, but was unable to participate due to technical issues. The Court finds that the counsel's affidavit of mistake and technological error is sufficient to set aside the dismissal, and grants the motion. The action is reinstated, and the Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Request Default Judgment for a later date.
