Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of conducting defendant Albert Dang's deposition. The Plaintiff, Gigi Bangura, filed the action on March 3, 2021, and trial is currently set for May 23, 2024. The Plaintiff seeks to depose defendant Dang, who is the key witness to the motor vehicle accident, in order to prove the case. The Court finds that the Plaintiff did not have the opportunity to depose Dang due to "excusable circumstances" and that there is no apparent prejudice to any party to reopen discovery. The Court orders the parties to meet and confer on a mutually agreeable date to proceed with Dang's deposition, which must be completed within thirty (30) days of the hearing.
