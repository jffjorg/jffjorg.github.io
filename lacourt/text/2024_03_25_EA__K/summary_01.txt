And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies ODK Capital, LLC's (Plaintiff) application for default judgment against Chungjeng Tang (Defendant) without prejudice. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to make payments due under a Business Loan and Security Agreement, and that Celtic Bank assigned its rights to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff previously filed a complaint asserting a cause of action for breach of contract. The court notes that the Plaintiff's Custodian of Records failed to provide a copy of the assignment, and that the Plaintiff's subsequent filing of a "Supplemental Declaration in Support of Default Judgment" raises questions about how the assignment can be authenticated. Therefore, the court denies the application for default judgment without prejudice.
