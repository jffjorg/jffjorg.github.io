  Case Number:  22PSCV02685    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff
ODK Capital, LLC’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff ODK Capital, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On July 28, 2021, JJMG Management and Celtic Bank (“Celtic”) entered into a
Business Loan and Security Agreement with accompanying supplement (“BLSA”)
wherein Celtic agreed to loan monies to JJMG Management in exchange for
repayment. Defendant Chungjeng Tang (“Tang”) contemporaneously executed a
personal guaranty. Celtic subsequently assigned its rights, title and interest
under the BLSA to Plaintiff. Defendant has failed to make payments due.
On December 9, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting
a cause of action against Defendant and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract 
On October 25, 2023, Defendant’s default was entered.
A Case Management Conference is set for December 14, 2023.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
The court previously denied Plaintiff’s Application for
Default Judgment without prejudice on December 14, 2023 on the basis
that Plaintiff’s Custodian of Records Cathleen Pugh failed to provide the court
with a copy of the assignment. On January 4, 2024, a “Supplemental Declaration
in Support of Default Judgment” was filed, wherein attorney Jennifer S. Thomas
(“Thomas”) purported to attach a copy of the assignment. It is unclear to the
court how Thomas would be able to authenticate the assignment.
