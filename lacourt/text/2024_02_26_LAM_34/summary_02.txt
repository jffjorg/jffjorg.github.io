And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules on a motion to strike portions of the Corrected Third Amended Cross-Complaint. The motion seeks to strike certain allegations and prayers for relief related to attorney's fees, restitution, and disgorgement. The judge grants the motion in part, striking paragraph 168 and prayer 4 of the tenth cause of action for unfair business practices, but denies the motion in all else. The judge rules that the allegations related to financial abuse and the "tort of another" doctrine are proper, as are the allegations related to restitution and disgorgement. The judge also rules that the opposing parties have standing to assert claims on behalf of subtenants.
