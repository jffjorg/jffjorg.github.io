And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants all six discovery motions filed by the Defendant: the Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One & Request for Sanctions; the Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories-General, Set One & Request for Sanctions; the Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories-Employment Law, Set One & Request for Sanctions; the Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One & Request for Sanctions; the Motion to Deem Facts Stated in Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted & Request for Sanctions; and the Motion to Compel Appearance at Deposition & Request for Sanctions. The Plaintiff is ordered to provide initial responses to the discovery requests within 30 days and to make herself available for a deposition within 60 days. The Judge also deems the facts stated in the requests for admission admitted. The Requests for Sanctions are denied, as the Plaintiff has been proceeding pro per since December 7, 2023, and the motions were filed after Plaintiff's former counsel was relieved of duties.
