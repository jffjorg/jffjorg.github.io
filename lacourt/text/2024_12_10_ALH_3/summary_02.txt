And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to correct the complaint and name the correct defendant in this case. The plaintiffs, Lawanda Jackson and Kayzah Jackson, originally named State Farm Insurance as the defendant, but later amended the complaint to name State Farm Mutual and State Farm General Insurance Company. However, due to a mistake, State Farm General was eventually dismissed, and it was later discovered that State Farm General was the correct defendant. The judge allows the motion to amend the complaint to name State Farm General as the correct defendant and to remove State Farm Mutual and "State Farm" as a collective reference from the pleading. The judge requires the filing of a Second Amended Complaint and continues the hearing to allow the plaintiffs to submit a proposed Second Amended Complaint.
