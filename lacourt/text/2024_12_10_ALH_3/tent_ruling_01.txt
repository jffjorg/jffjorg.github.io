On May 24, 2024, defendant Gregory
Thomas Heinen, M.D. (“Defendant”) filed this motion for summary judgment on
plaintiff Miriam I. Aghazzi’s (“Plaintiff”) medical malpractice action. 
On September 12, 2024, the parties
stipulated to continue the hearing on this motion, trial, and all trial-related
dates. 
On November 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
“notice of opposition,” a memorandum of points and authorities, a declaration
from Plaintiff, and evidentiary objections. The caption pages of these pleadings
all state that they were concurrently filed with Plaintiff’s Response to Separate
Statement and Statement of Additional Material Facts, as well as the
Declaration of Diana G. Vasquez. It also appears, based on the content of
Defendant’s reply papers, that these two documents were served on Defendant.
However, since they are not in the Court record, the Court CONTINUES the
hearing to ______ so that the parties may file them for the Court’s review. 
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
Dated
this 10th
day of December, 2024
