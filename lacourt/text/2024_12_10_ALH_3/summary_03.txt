And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting a motion to set aside a default filed by W&B Automotive, Inc. dba Bravo Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Alhambra (Bravo). The default was entered against Bravo in a lawsuit filed by Yulissa Andrea Jimenez (Plaintiff) on April 25, 2024. Bravo filed its motion to set aside the default on August 16, 2024, claiming that it was due to mistake and inadvertence. The judge finds that Bravo's failure to respond earlier was caused by its office move, which resulted in the summons and complaint being lost. The judge grants Bravo's motion, finding that it has established a proper ground for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The case management conference scheduled for April 30, 2025, will remain on calendar as set.
