Here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Plaintiff, Adriana Fadlallah, has moved for an order establishing admissions and imposing monetary sanctions against the Defendant, Oliver Holt, and his attorneys, Ford, Walker, Haggerty & Behar. However, the Judge has denied this motion. The reason for this denial is that the Defendant, Oliver Holt, has passed away, and the Plaintiff has failed to provide legal authority for deeming requests for admission admitted against a deceased party or imposing monetary sanctions for failing to respond when the party is deceased. Additionally, the Plaintiff has failed to provide a basis for continuing to prosecute this action against the Defendant's estate, which has been named as a defendant.
