  Case Number:  23STLC05853    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  85 
Foursight Capital, LLC
v. Marcus Johnson, 23STLC05853
 
Tentative decision on application
for a writ of possession and turnover order: granted



 
            
            Plaintiff
Foursight Capital, LLC (“Foursight”) seeks a writ of possession against
Defendant Marcus Johnson (“Johnson”) to recover a 2012 Hyundai Sonata, VIN 5NPEC4AC9CH440285
(“Vehicle”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Foursight filed the Complaint against Defendant Johnson on September 7, 2023, alleging
claim and delivery and seeking a pretrial writ of possession and an order directing
transfer of personal property.  The Complaint
alleges as follows.
            On
July 20, 2022, Johnson entered into a written Note and Security Agreement (“Contract”)
in which Foursight’s assignor OpenRoad Lending, LLC (“Assignor”) would finance the
purchase of the Vehicle, which was collateral. 
Assignor assigned the Contract to Foursight on July 22, 2022.
            At
all relevant times, Foursight has been the legal owner of the Vehicle.  The Certificate of Title from the Department
of Motor Vehicles reflects Foursight’s security interest.  The Contract gives Foursight the right to take
and have immediate possession of the Vehicle after default.  
            Johnson
breached the Contract on January 5, 2023, by failing to make the $268.21 monthly
installment due.  He has since failed to make
the regular monthly payments of $268.21 due thereafter.  The balance due and owing is $12,433.47.  Demands to turn over the Vehicle have failed.  It has a current wholesale value of $3,875
and retail value of $8,400.
            Foursight
seeks (1) recovery and a pretrial writ of possession for the Vehicle, (2) its
value if recovery cannot be had, (3) a temporary restraining order enjoining Johnson
from transferring possession of or concealing the Vehicle, and (4) attorney’s
fees and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings 
            On
September 23, 2023, Foursight served Johnson with the Complaint, Summons, and
moving papers by substitute service, effective October 3, 2023.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            A
writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a cause of action for
claim and delivery, also known as replevin. 
See Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right to
possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are determined
in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b). 
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            On July 20, 2022, Johnson and
Assignor executed a written Contract giving Assignor a security interest in the
Vehicle.  Leetham Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  Johnson was required to make 72 installments
of $268.21 beginning September 3, 2022.  Leetham
Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  In the event of
default for failure to pay, Assignor had the right to assess a 5% late charge if
ten days have passed since a payment’s due date, accelerate the amount owed,
and repossess the Vehicle.  Leetham Decl.,
¶4, Ex. A.  
            On
July 22, 2022, Assignor assigned its rights under the Contract to Foursight.  Leetham Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  The Certificate of Title from the
Department of Motor Vehicles reflects Foursight’s interest in the Vehicle.  Leetham Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  
            Johnson
breached the Contract on January 5, 2023 when he failed to pay $268.21.  Leetham Decl., ¶5.  He has failed to make the regular monthly
payments of $268.21 due thereafter.  Leetham
Decl., ¶5.  As of September 7, 2023, the
balance due and owing is $12,433.47.  Leetham
Decl., ¶5.  Demands for Johnson to turn over
the Vehicle have failed.  Leetham
Decl., ¶¶ 7, 9.  
            The
Manheim Market Report for September 2023 lists the Vehicle wholesale value as $3,875
and retail value as $8,400.  Leetham
Decl., ¶6, Ex. C[2].  
            The
Contract lists Johnson’s address as 1612 W 81st Street, Apt 2, Los Angeles, CA
90047, and Foursight believes the Vehicle is currently there.  Leetham Decl., ¶10, Ex. A.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Foursight seeks a writ of possession and turnover order for the Vehicle against
Johnson.
 
            1.
Breach of Agreement
            The
Contract required Johnson to make 72 installments of $268.21 from September 3,
2022 thereafter.  Leetham Decl., ¶4, Ex.
A.  Any late payment would incur a 5%
late charge and entitle Assignor to accelerate the amount owed and repossess
the Vehicle.  Leetham Decl., ¶4, Ex.
A.  Assignor then assigned its rights
under the Contract to Foursight.  Leetham
Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  The Certificate of
Title reflects Foursight’s interest in the Vehicle.  Leetham Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.
            In seeking a writ of possession, the supporting declaration
must be set forth with particularity. 
CCP §516.030.  This means that the
plaintiff must show evidentiary facts rather than the ultimate facts commonly
found in pleadings.  A recitation of
conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is insufficient.  See Rodes v. Shannon, (1961)
194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions inadequate for
summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 663, 669
(same).  All documentary evidence,
including contracts and canceled checks, must be presented in admissible form,
and admissibility as non-hearsay evidence or exception to the hearsay rule,
such as the business records exception.  Lydig
Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel Corp., (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th
937, 944; Pos-A-Traction, Inc., v. Kepplly-Springfield Tire Co., (C.D.
Cal. 2000) 112 F.Supp.2d, 1178, 1182.  
            Foursight
presents conclusory evidence that the balance due and owing is $12,433.47.  Mem. at 2; Leetham Decl., ¶5.  Foursight fails to support this conclusion
with a payment history or calculation that these are the amounts owed.  This evidence generally is necessary to support
the decision whether an undertaking is necessary.  As Johnson has not opposed, the court will
not deny the application on this ground. 
 
            2.
Undertaking
            The
undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of the
defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  CCP §515.010(a).  The Vehicle’s retail value is estimated to be
$8,400.  Leetham Decl., ¶6, Ex. C.  The balance Johnson owes is $12,433.47.  Leetham Decl., ¶5.  Because the amount Johnson owes exceeds the
value of the Vehicle, no undertaking is required.
 
            3.
Order to Enter Private Property
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
Contract shows Johnson’s address as 1612 W 81st Street, Apt 2, Los Angeles, CA
90047.  Leetham Decl., ¶10, Ex. A.  This is the probable location of the Vehicle
and Foursight can obtain a writ to enter a private residence at this address.  
 
            4.
Turnover Order
            The
court may issue a turnover order directing the defendant to transfer possession
of the property to the plaintiff (See
Mandatory Form CD-120).  The order must
notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject him or her to contempt
of court.  CCP §512.070.  The turnover remedy is not issued in lieu of
a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff with a less
expensive means of obtaining possession. 
See Edwards, supra,
230 Cal.App.3d at 178.  
            Foursight
requests a turnover order compelling Johnson to transfer possession of the
Vehicle.  Mem. at 3.  The request for a turnover order is granted.
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
application for a writ of possession and turnover order for the Vehicle is
granted.  Foursight has not filed a proposed
order for writ of possession and must do so within two court days of this
hearing on the proper Judicial Council form or it will be waived.  The levying officer may enter 1612 W 81st
Street, Apt 2, Los Angeles, CA 90047 if it is a private residence, as well as any
commercial or public address.
