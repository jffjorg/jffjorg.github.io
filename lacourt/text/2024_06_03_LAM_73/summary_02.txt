And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiff's request was incomplete because it did not fill out item number two of the JC Form CIV-100, which requires identifying damages and the total amount sought. Additionally, the Plaintiff failed to provide evidence of the Defendant's financial condition to support the requested punitive damages. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to complete the JC Form CIV-100 and provide additional evidence to support the requested damages.
