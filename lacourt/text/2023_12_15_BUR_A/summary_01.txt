Significant Statements:

* "The Court is unable to locate any order that mandated transcripts, nor does Defendant provide evidence of such an order."
* "As such, Defendant's costs are taxed $5,089.28 for claimed transcript fees. However, the Court will deny the request to tax costs for $683.25 for RealTime fees as the providing of RealTime greatly facilitates the trial and is authorized under the Court's discretionary authority."
