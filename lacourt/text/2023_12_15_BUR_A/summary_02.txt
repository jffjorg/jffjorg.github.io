And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied Flintridge Riding Club's motion to continue the trial to May 13, 2024. The motion was opposed by the plaintiffs, Gigi Gaston and Julie Boyer. The judge determined that good cause had not been shown for the continuance, and that the factors weighed against granting the motion. The judge noted that the trial has already been continued twice, and that the case is now over 2 years old. The judge also stated that the court's calendar is heavily booked until 2025, and that the only remaining discovery matter is the deposition of Flintridge's most knowledgeable person (PMK). The judge found that Flintridge's new counsel had had half a year to prepare for trial and that the deposition of the PMK could take place within a reasonable time before trial.
