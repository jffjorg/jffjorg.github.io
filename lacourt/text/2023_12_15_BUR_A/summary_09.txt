And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Felicita Marroquin De Sandoval, alleges that a bus driver for the MTA negligently operated a bus that resulted in her personal injury. The MTA argues that the complaint is subject to demurrer because it fails to state sufficient facts and because the plaintiff did not file a timely claim with the MTA as required by the Government Claims Act.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's complaint is subject to demurrer because it does not allege facts demonstrating that a claim was timely presented or that compliance with the claims statute is excused. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's letter to the City of Los Angeles, which she claims satisfies the Government Claims Act requirement, is not a valid claim because it was directed to the wrong entity and was not acted upon or deemed rejected by the board.

The judge grants the MTA's demurrer and sustains it with 20 days' leave to amend. The judge finds that the likelihood of the plaintiff being able to amend her complaint to add sufficient facts is low, and that the plaintiff would need to produce evidence that she did in fact submit a timely claim to the MTA on amendment to survive further demurrer.
