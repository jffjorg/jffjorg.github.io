And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay of the proceedings. The defendant had previously moved to compel arbitration in February 2023, but the motion was denied. The defendant has now moved again, citing a new arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff in 2021. However, the judge finds that the defendant had knowledge and access to the agreement at the time the plaintiff filed her complaint, and yet failed to include it in its previous motion. The judge concludes that the defendant's delay in bringing the new motion constitutes a waiver of its right to compel arbitration. The judge also lifts the stay of the appeal, as the defendant had abandoned its appeal. A case management conference is set for February 28, 2024.
