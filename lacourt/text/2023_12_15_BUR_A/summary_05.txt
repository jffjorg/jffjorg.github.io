```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reconsidered the motion to compel arbitration and has denied the motion. The court found that the arbitration agreement does not contemplate allowing Ford Motor Company to compel arbitration of Plaintiff's claims. Additionally, the court found that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply as Plaintiff's claims against Ford are not intimately founded in or intertwined with the dealership agreement. As a result, the court has vacated its prior order compelling arbitration and has lifted the stay previously imposed. The case is set for a case management conference on March 20, 2023, at 9:00 a.m. unless all parties waive notice.
