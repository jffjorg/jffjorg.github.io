And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Laurel Canyon Collection, Inc.'s motion to set aside and vacate the default judgment entered against it. The default was entered on February 16, 2023, and Laurel Canyon is seeking relief under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b), which allows a court to relieve a party from a judgment, dismissal, or other proceeding taken against it through its own mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

The judge found that Laurel Canyon's counsel had attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel after receipt of the complaint, but the parties had reached an impasse and Laurel Canyon had informed it would render a responsive pleading by February 28, 2023. However, Plaintiff's counsel filed a request for default on February 16, 2023, before Laurel Canyon had a chance to file its responsive pleading.

The judge concluded that Laurel Canyon's counsel had submitted a declaration attesting to surprise, which is sufficient for relief under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b). The judge also noted that even if the failure to timely respond to the complaint was an act of neglect, the neglect would be attributable to Laurel Canyon's counsel and would qualify for relief under the statute.

Accordingly, the judge granted the motion to set aside and vacate the default judgment and ordered Laurel Canyon to file its demurrer within 10 days. The case management conference is continued to April 3, 2024.
