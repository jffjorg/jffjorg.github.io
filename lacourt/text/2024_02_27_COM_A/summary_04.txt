Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Oscar Flores and Plentitude Transportation, Inc. The demurrer is sustained in part and overruled in part.

The first cause of action for fraudulent concealment is sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiff has not alleged when he discovered the "true facts" and has not alleged what particular facts the defendants allegedly suppressed or that they intended to defraud. The claim is defective and uncertain.

The second cause of action for intentional tort is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff's claim is based on the allegation that the defendants "maliciously and with intent, taunted him and belittled him in front of his coworkers on a daily basis." The claim is barred by the two-year statute of limitations, as the plaintiff alleges that the intentional conduct occurred during his employment, which was terminated in February 2019.

The third cause of action for emotional distress is sustained with leave to amend to the extent it arises from the first cause of action for fraud. The claim is defective and uncertain, and the plaintiff has not alleged what he would have done differently had he known of the true facts.

The plaintiff has 10 days to file an amended pleading that cures the defects noted above.
