And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion of the counsel for the defendant, Diamond Construction & Waterproofing, Inc., to withdraw as counsel. This is because the counsel is no longer able to represent the defendant, who has not been able to find new counsel to sign a substitution of attorney form. The complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to sell the plaintiffs real property in the City of Compton, which was advertised as a recently renovated and fully permitted duplex, but prior to close of escrow, the City of Compton cited the property for numerous code violations, including the lack of a duplex permit. The plaintiffs have alleged seven causes of action for fraud and fraud-related claims, negligence, and unfair business practices. The judge has confirmed that the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, have been complied with, and the order is effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client.
