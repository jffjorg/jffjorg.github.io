And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling takes the hearing off calendar on the motion to compel arbitration by defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. The plaintiff, Jasmine Baldwin, alleges that she was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Arthur McDonald, who was employed by Uber, and suffered injury in a motor vehicle accident. Uber argues that the dispute should be arbitrated because Baldwin agreed to submit any dispute to arbitration when she registered for an Uber account and agreed to its terms of use. The motion was timely served on Baldwin's counsel, but there is no indication that McDonald's counsel was served. As a result, the motion is taken off calendar.
