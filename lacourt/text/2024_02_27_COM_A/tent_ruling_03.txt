[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
FOR DEFENDANT 
 
      The complaint alleges that Defendants
conspired to sell to Plaintiffs real property in the City of Compton that was advertised
as a recently renovated and fully permitted duplex. Prior to close of escrow,
the City of Compton allegedly cited the property for numerous code violations,
including the lack of a duplex permit. Plaintiffs allege seven causes of action
for fraud and fraud-related claims, negligence, and unfair business practices.
      Counsel for Defendant, Diamond
Construction & Waterproofing, Inc. (“Diamond”), moves for an order to
withdraw as Diamond’s counsel as he is no longer able to represent Diamond, who
has not been able to find other counsel to sign a substitution of attorney
form.  Counsel has confirmed Defendant’s
last known address by text message. 
      Counsel has complied with the requirements
of California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED. The order
is effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon
the client.
