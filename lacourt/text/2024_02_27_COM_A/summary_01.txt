And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff's responses to written discovery, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents. The Plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the Defendant timely served the motion to compel responses. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not shown substantial justification for failing to comply with discovery obligations, and therefore, sanctions are imposed against the Plaintiff and counsel for $980. The sanctions include $800 for attorney fees and $180 for filing fees. The Plaintiff is required to pay the sanctions within 10 days.
