      This
action arises from an automobile accident. Defendant served written discovery
on Plaintiff on November 30, 2023. Defense counsel met and conferred with
Plaintiff’s counsel by letters dated January 5, 2024, and January 15, 2024, requesting
responses. Plaintiff did not respond and did not serve responses to discovery. 
      Defendant
timely served the motion on Plaintiff on January 26, 2024. Plaintiff did not
file an opposition. 
      Where a
party fails to timely respond to interrogatories and a document request, the
court has authority to compel a response. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290 subd.
(b), §2031.300 subd. (b).) Untimely responses result in a waiver of objections.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 subd. (a), §2031.300 subd. (a).) As Plaintiff has
not served any responses, all objections are waived.
      Imposition
of sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel is warranted as
Plaintiff has not shown substantial justification for failing to comply with discovery
obligations. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.310, 2031.310.)  The Court finds that $200 per hour, as
requested, is a reasonable fee to prepare discovery motions. One hour to
prepare each motion (reduced from three) and one hour to appear are both reasonable
under the circumstances. Defendant incurred costs of $180 ($60 per motion) in
filing fees. 
      Accordingly,
Defendant’s three motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of
documents are GRANTED. Sanctions for all three motions totaling $980 are
imposed against Plaintiff and counsel, jointly and severally, and payable to
Defendant within 10 days. ($800 +$180).
