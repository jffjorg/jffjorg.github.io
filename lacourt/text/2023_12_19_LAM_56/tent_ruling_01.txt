AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION










 

            
            This
order concerns: (1) a motion to consolidate (the “Consolidation Motion”); and
(2) a motion to compel deposition (the “MTC”). 

 
MOVING PARTIES: (1) Defendant/Cross-Complainant Robert Lee (“Lee”);
(2) Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Jong Soo Park (“Park”)
 
RESPONDING PARTIES: (1) Park; (2) Lee
 
The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises out of a
dispute concerning an alleged agreement to purchase real property.  The currently operative first amended
complaint (the “FAC”) alleges: (1) breach of contract; (2) rescission of
contract; (3) conversion; (4) common count – money had and received; (5) unjust
enrichment; and (6) specific performance. 
The cross-complaint (the “XC”) alleges: (1) breach of contract; (2)
fraud; (3) promissory estoppel; (4) fraudulent inducement; (5) declaratory
relief; and (6) injunctive relief.  
 
On August 24, 2023, Park filed the MTC, which requests that the Court
order Lee to attend his deposition and produce documents.  
 
On October 2, 2023, Lee filed the Consolidation Motion, which
requests that this matter be consolidated with several other pending
cases.  
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Lee’s Request for Judicial Notice
filed in connection with the Consolidation Motion is GRANTED as to the
existence of the documents, but not to the truth of the matters stated therein.  (See
Scott v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743, 752-54.)  Park’s Request for Judicial Notice is likewise
GRANTED. 
 
 
 
 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
            Park’s objections to the
evidence submitted in support of Lee’s reply to the Consolidation Motion are
SUSTAINED.  (See Jay v. Mahaffey (2013)
218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537.)  
 
MOTION
TO CONSOLIDATE
Under California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1048,
subdivision (a), when actions involving a common question of law or fact are
pending before the court, the court may order a joint hearing or trial of any
or all the matters in issue in the actions, order all the actions consolidated,
and make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid
unnecessary costs or delay.  (CCP § 1048,
subd. (a).)  The purpose of consolidation is merely to promote trial
convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of procedure, particularly in
the proof of issues common to both actions.  (Estate of Baker (1982)
131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.)  A consolidation of actions does not affect the
rights of the parties.  (Id.)  Consolidation does not require
identical causes of action in each case, absolute identity of the parties, or
identical allegations.  (Id.)  In deciding whether to grant a
motion to consolidate, the court should weigh whether the common issues
predominate over the individual issues and whether any risks of jury confusion
or prejudice to the parties outweighs the reduction in time and expense that
would result from consolidation.  (See
Todd-Stenberq v. Shield (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978.)  Actions may
be thoroughly “related” in the sense of having common questions of law or fact,
and still not be consolidated, if the trial court, in the sound exercise of its
discretion, chooses not to do so.¿ (Askew v. Askew¿(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th
942, 964.)¿ It is not abuse of discretion to deny motion for consolidation of
actions where parties in each action are different or issues are different.¿ (See¿Muller
v. Robinson¿(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 511, 515.)¿  On the other hand, actions may be
consolidated in the discretion of the trial court whenever it can be done
without prejudice to a substantial right.¿ (Carpenson¿v.¿Najarian¿(1967)
254 Cal.App.2d 856, 862.) 
 
            On October 4, 2023, the Court issued
an order deeming this matter and the pending actions referenced in the
Consolidation Motion not related.  The
Consolidation Motion does not articulate a basis for these matters to be
consolidated; nor does the Consolidation Motion comply with the procedure set
forth under California Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 3.300(h) for filing a motion to relate cases in
circumstances where a judge has already deemed the cases not related.  (See CRC, r. 3.300(h)(1)(D).)  
 
            The Court therefore DENIES the
Consolidation Motion. 
 
MOTION TO
COMPEL DEPOSITION
            Under
CCP section 2025.450, if, after
service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director,
managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an
organization that is a party, without having served a valid objection, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.  (CCP § 2025.450,
subd. (a).)  The motion must both: (1)
set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice; and (2) include a meet and confer declaration
pursuant to CCP section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.  (CCP § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1)-(2); see
Leko v. Cornerstone Building Inspection Service (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th
1109, 1124 (the statute also applies when the deponent simply fails to appear).)
 
            In
support of the MTC, Park provides evidence Lee did not appear for his noticed
deposition on August 14, 2023.  (See Declaration
of Dale J. Park (“Park Decl.”) ¶¶ 5, 9, Exhibit 2.)  It appears that prior to August 14, 2023, the
parties conferred about Lee’s availability on that date, with Lee eventually
communicating that he would be unable to attend.  (See Park Decl. ¶¶ 6-8.)  The Park Declaration does not establish what,
if any, meet and confer efforts occurred after Lee’s nonappearance on August
14, 2023 before the MTC was filed as is required under CCP section 2025.450,
subdivision (b)(2).  Accordingly, the
Court DENIES the MTC without prejudice.
 
Moving parties are ordered to give notice of this
ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar.
