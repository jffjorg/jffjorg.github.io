Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate and a motion to compel deposition in a lawsuit involving a dispute over an alleged agreement to purchase real property. The court has considered the parties' submissions and has made the following findings and rulings. The court denies the motion to consolidate because the parties have not shown that the cases are related or that consolidation would promote trial convenience and economy. The court also denies the motion to compel deposition without prejudice because the party seeking to compel deposition has not shown good cause for the production of documents and has not included a meet and confer declaration as required by law. The court grants the moving parties' request for judicial notice as to the existence of documents but not to the truth of the matters stated therein. The court sustains the responding party's objections to the evidence submitted in support of the moving party's reply to the Consolidation Motion. The parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling, and any party who intends to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
