```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to strike filed by Deangelo Greene, the defendant, and has denied the motion. The court finds that the motion does not set forth a basis to strike the complaint and that the defendant failed to file a proof of service, which is required under California law. The court also notes that the defendant's motion to strike cites to the incorrect code section and that the contents of the motion appear to assert an affirmative defense based on extraneous facts. Therefore, the court denies the motion to strike and sets the matter for a hearing on December 19, 2023.
