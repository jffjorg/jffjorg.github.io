MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing pursuant to California Code of
Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b). 
 
BACKGROUND
            The currently operative third amended complaint (the “TAC”) alleges nine
causes of action arising out of an employment relationship, including a claim
arising under the Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”).  
 
 
 
            On July 31, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement (the “PA
Motion”).  On November 20, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a motion for final approval of class action settlement (the “Settlement
Motion”).  On November 27, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney’s fees and costs (the “Fees
Motion”).  
             
DISCUSSION
Approval
of class action settlements occurs in two steps.  First, the court preliminarily approves the settlement,
and the class members are notified as directed by the court.  (California Rules of Court (“CRC”), r.
3.769(c), (f); Cellphone Termination Fee
Cases (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1118.) 
Second, the court conducts a final approval hearing to inquire into the
fairness of the proposed settlement.  (CRC,
r. 3.769(e); Cellphone Termination Fee
Cases, supra, 180 Cal.App.4th at 1118.)  
 
The
trial court has broad discretion to determine whether the settlement is
fair.  (Cellphone Termination Fee Cases, supra, 180 Cal.App.4th at
1117.)  In determining whether to approve
a class settlement, the court’s responsibility is to “prevent fraud, collusion
or unfairness to the class” through settlement and dismissal of the class
action because the rights of the class members, and even named plaintiffs, “may
not have been given due regard by the negotiating parties.”  (Consumer
Advocacy Group, Inc. v. Kintetsu Enterprises of America (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 46, 60.)
 
 
 
Terms
of the Settlement
Plaintiff
entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Defendant
after the parties participated in private mediation.  (See Declaration of Jean-Claude
Lapuyade (“Lapuyade Decl.”)  ¶¶ 3, 17,
Exhibit 1.)  The Settlement Agreement
provides for a gross settlement amount (the “GSA”) of $750,000 to be allocated
among approximately 846 class members. 
(Lapuyade Decl., Exhibit 1.)  The
Settlement Agreement provides for the disbursement of the GSA as follows: (1)
attorney’s fees in the approximate amount of $250,000 and litigation expenses not
to exceed $25,000; (2) an incentive award to Plaintiff in the amount of up to
$10,000; (3) fees and expenses of administration of the Settlement Agreement to
the settlement administrator in an amount not to exceed $12,000; (4) PAGA
penalties in the amount of $60,000, with 25 percent of the PAGA penalties included
in the remaining net settlement amount (the “NSA”) to be distributed to PAGA
class members in the amount of $15,000; and 75 percent paid to the California
Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”).  (See Lapuyade Decl., Exhibit 1.)  The NSA is approximately $393,000 and will be
allocated to participating class members on a pro-rata basis according to the
number of weeks each class member worked during the relevant class period.  (Lapuyade Decl. ¶ 9.)
 
Class
Certification
Before the court may approve the settlement,
the settlement class must satisfy the normal prerequisites for class actions.  (Amchem.
Products, Inc. v. Windsor (1997) 521 U.S. 591, 625-27.)  The party advocating class treatment must
demonstrate the: (1) existence of an ascertainable and sufficiently numerous
class; (2) well-defined community of interest; and (3) substantial benefits
from certification that render proceeding as a class superior to the
alternatives.  (Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1004,
1021.)
 
            When it granted the PA Motion, the Court determined that Plaintiff
satisfied the prerequisite showing required for class certification.  The Court incorporates its analysis in the PA
Motion of the class. On August 29, 2023, notice was sent to all 869 class
members.  (Declaration of Nicole Bench
(“Bench Decl.”) ¶ 8, Exhibit A.)  As
of the filing of the Settlement, a total of 19 notice packets were deemed
undeliverable, and the Settlement Administrator had not received any objections
to the Settlement Agreement or requests for exclusion.  (Bench Decl. ¶¶ 11-14.)  
 
            The Court finds that no circumstances have arisen that
undermine the propriety of the class and thus certifies the class.  
 
Fairness
of Settlement
In
determining whether a settlement is fair, the court considers all relevant
factors, including the strength of the plaintiffs’ case, the risk, expense, complexity
and likely duration of further litigation, the risk of maintaining class action
status through trial, the amount offered in settlement, the extent of discovery
completed and the stage of the proceedings, the experience and views of
counsel, the presence of a governmental participant, and the reaction of the
class members to the proposed settlement. 
(Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail,
Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 128.) 
The recovery should represent a reasonable compromise, given the
magnitude and apparent merit of the claims being released, discounted by the
risks and expenses of attempting to establish and collect on those claims by
pursuing the litigation.  (Id. at 129.)  Nevertheless, the strength of the case on the
merits for the plaintiffs is the most important factor, balanced against the
amount offered in settlement.  (Id. at 130.)
 
The
fact that a proposed settlement may only amount to a fraction of the potential
recovery does not, in and of itself, mean that the proposed settlement is
grossly inadequate and should be disapproved. 
(City of Detroit v. Grinnell
Corporation (2d Cir. 1974) 495 F.2d 448, 455.)  The test is not the maximum amount plaintiff
might have obtained at trial on the complaint but, rather, whether the
settlement is reasonable under all of the circumstances.  (Wershba
v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 250.)
 
A
presumption of fairness exists where: (1) the settlement is reached through
arm’s-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.  (Cellphone
Termination Fee Cases (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1118.)
 
            The average settlement payment is estimated to be $452.24,
with the highest payment estimated as being $2,181.15 and the lowest payment
estimated as being $10.34.  (Bench Decl.
¶ 17.)  The average PAGA payment is
estimated to be $29.35.  (Bench Decl.
¶ 18.)  The Court incorporates its
analysis of the Settlement Agreement set forth in the PA Motion and finds that
the terms of the Settlement Agreement are fair. 
  
 
 
PAGA
Settlement
Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2) provides
that the superior court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil
action filed pursuant to PAGA.  (Lab.
Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)  Section 2699,
subdivision (l)(2) requires submission of the proposed settlement to the Labor
Workforce and Development Agency (the “LWDA”) at the same time it is submitted
to the court.  (Id.)  Any settlement of any
civil action filed under PAGA must be “fair and adequate in view of the
purposes and policies of the statute.”  (Flores v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts
Worldwide, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2017) 253 F.Supp.3d 1074, 1077.)  Seventy five percent of all PAGA penalties
must be paid to the LWDA and the remaining 25 percent must be paid to the
aggrieved employees.  (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (i).)  
 
Based on the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the
allocation of the GSA to the LDWA as described above, the Court finds that the
PAGA Settlement complies with Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (i).
 
Incentive
Award
The
Settlement Motion seeks approval of an incentive award of $10,000 to Plaintiff for
acting as class representative in this action. 
The Court approves this amount based on Plaintiff’s participation in
this litigation.
 
 
 
 
Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Under California
Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 3.769, any agreement, express or implied, that has
been entered into with respect to the payment of attorney’s fees or the
submission of an application for the approval of attorney’s fees must be set
forth in full in any application for approval of the dismissal or settlement of
an action that has been certified as a class action.  (CRC, r. 3.769(b).)  Ultimately, the award of attorney’s fees is
made by the court at the fairness hearing, using the lodestar method with a
multiplier, if appropriate.  (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095-96.)  In common fund
cases, the court may utilize the percentage method, cross-checked by the
lodestar.  (Laffitte v. Robert Half Int’l, Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480,
503.)  Despite any agreement by the
parties to the contrary, the court has an independent right and responsibility
to review the attorney fees provision of the settlement agreement and award only
so much as it determined reasonable.  (Garabedian v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone
Company (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 123, 128.)
 
Plaintiff seeks approval of attorney’s fees in the
amount of $250,000 and costs in the amount as supported by Class Counsel’s
billing records, to a maximum of $25,000. 
Based on the evidence set
forth in the supporting declarations regarding the qualifications of each
attorney who billed time in this matter, the reasonableness of counsels’ hourly
rates, the complexity of negotiating this case and the results obtained, the
Court finds that an attorney’s fee award in the amount of one-third of the GSA
is warranted.  Such amount is reasonable
given the facts of this case and is consistent with fee awards in class
actions.[1]  The Court further finds that
the costs incurred were reasonable and necessary to carrying out the
representation in this matter. 
 
CONCLUSION
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Settlement Motion and the Fees Motion in
their entirety.  
            
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
