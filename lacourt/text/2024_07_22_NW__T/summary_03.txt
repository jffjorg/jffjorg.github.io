And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession against the defendant. The plaintiff, Ally Bank, has filed an application for a writ of possession to repossess a vehicle from the defendant, Antonio White. The defendant did not file an opposition to the application, and the plaintiff failed to file proofs of service on the summons and complaint, as well as the notice of application for writ of possession. The judge notes that without proofs of service, the court lacks jurisdiction over the defendant and that any orders issued without proper notice and opportunity to be heard are void. Therefore, the judge has denied the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession without prejudice. However, if the plaintiff files the proofs of service prior to the hearing date, the judge may reconsider the application.
