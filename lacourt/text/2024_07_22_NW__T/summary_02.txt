The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Cyman Lehman against Defendants Woodpark LLC and Micro Property Management Inc. The demurrer was filed by the Defendants, arguing that the claims were insufficient to get past the demurrer stage.

The judge has ruled that the claims related to the broken elevator are sufficient to get past the demurrer stage, and has overruled the demurrer as to the second, fourth, and fifth causes of action (COAs). The judge has also ruled that the claims related to the fall in the garage are insufficient, and has sustained the demurrer as to this part of the first COA.

The judge has also ruled that the claims related to financial elder abuse are sufficient to get past the demurrer stage, and has overruled the demurrer as to this COA. The judge has further ruled that the claims are not duplicative and conclusory, and that they are not uncertain.

The judge has ordered the Defendants to file an answer to the complaint within 20 days, and has scheduled a hearing for July 22, 2024.
