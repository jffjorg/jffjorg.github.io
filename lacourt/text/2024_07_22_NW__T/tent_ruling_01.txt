  Case Number:  20STCV27421    Hearing Date:   July 22, 2024    Dept:  T Krebs v.  Felsen 20STCV27421  Ex parte  application to continue trial and related dates:  The court will consider continuing the trial although  not necessarily for 6 months but will not continue the discovery cutoff.  The court is available to try this case.  This case  was filed on 7/21/2020.  Defendant  answered the complaint 11/30/2020.  The  parties have had 3 years and 8 months to conduct discovery,    Trial was  set in this case for 1/18/2022.  Less  than 1 month before trial, the parties stipulated to continue the trial for a  year to 1/25/2023.  Trial was then  set in this case for 1/25/2023.  Two  months before trial on 12/5/2022, the parties stipulated to continue the trial  to 5/24/2023.  On  12/21/2022, the parties stipulated again to continue the trial and it was  continued to 9/28/2023.  The parties  failed to appear for their Final Status Conference on 9/14/2023.  No trial documents were filed for the FSC.  On 9/25/2023,  the day before trial, the parties stipulated to continue the trial date for the  same reasons claimed here, that is, to go to Resolve Law and due to illness of  Mr. Middleton, among other things.  The  court continued the trial to 3/28/2024 and the FSC to 3/14/2024.  On 3/13/2024,  the day before the FSC, the parties stipulated to continue the trial again for  the same reasons as stated in the prior stipulation.  Trial was continued to 10/17/2024 and the FSC  was continued to 10/3/2024.  Now, the  parties have agreed, again, to continue the trial for another 6 months.  The court may be inclined to continue the  trial but not extend the discovery cutoff.   The current discovery cut off of 30 days prior to 10/17/2024 will stand.  The court  will discuss this further at the ex parte hearing.  However, as the trial has been continued 5  times already, and the parties have had 3 years and 8 months to complete  discovery, the court is not inclined to continue the discovery cutoff on this  simple dog bite case.
