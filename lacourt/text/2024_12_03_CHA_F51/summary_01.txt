And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Moving Defendant). The Moving Defendant demurred to the plaintiff's complaint on the ground that the plaintiff did not allege presenting a government claim for damages to the MTA, and therefore has not alleged facts sufficient to support his claims against the Moving Defendant. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint is dismissed without the opportunity to re-file a new complaint. The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to present a timely government claim to the Moving Defendant prior to filing suit, as required by the Government Claims Act. The judge has also declined to consider any evidence extrinsic to the "four corners" of the plaintiff's complaint or properly before the court via a request for judicial notice.
