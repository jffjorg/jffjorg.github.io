Unlawful Detainer (1st COA)
To establish a claim for
unlawful detainer, a plaintiff must prove the following elements: (1) plaintiff
owns/leases the property; (2) plaintiff rented/subleased the property to
defendant; (3) under the lease/rental agreement/sublease, defendant was
required to pay rent in a specified amount per period; (4) plaintiff properly
gave defendant three days’ written notice to pay the rent or vacate the
property; (5) as of the date of the three-day notice, at least the amount
stated in the three-day notice was due; (6) defendant did not pay the amount
stated in the notice within three days after service/receipt of the notice; and
(7) defendant is still occupying the property. 
(CACI 4302.)
Plaintiff submitted evidence
that it served Defendant with a three-day notice to pay or quit on November 16,
2023.  (Plaintiff’s Undisputed Separate
Statement of Fact [“P-USSF”] 5, 6, 7.) 
Plaintiff submitted evidence that the Notice demanded that Defendant pay
the rent specified in the Notice within three days of service or to vacate the
Premises no later than 3 days after service of the Notice, and advised
Defendant that any right to possession was terminated and the lease forfeited
it Defendant failed to pay the rent demanded within three days.  (P-USSF 5.) 
Plaintiff submitted evidence that Defendant failed to pay the amount of
the rent demanded in the three-day Notice within three days or any time
thereafter and has also failed to vacate the Premises.  (P-USSF 9, 10, 11.)  Plaintiff met its burden to demonstrate there
is no triable issue of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law.  Ordinarily, Plaintiff would
shift the burden to Defendant to raise a triable issue of material fact.  However, this motion is unopposed, and no
burden-shifting is applicable.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion
for summary judgement is granted.
 
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion for summary judgment is granted.
Moving
Party to give notice.
