BACKGROUND
             This case arises from an alleged breach of a
loan agreement in which Plaintiff provided a monetary loan to Defendant James
Dolback (“Defendant”), who subsequently failed to repay the loan as agreed. On
April 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) asserting causes
of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) fraud; (3) fraud; (4) conversion;
and (5) unjust enrichment.
 
            On
November 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for order establishing
admissions, and request for sanctions (the “Motion”), against Defendant. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
DISCUSSION
A discovering party can make a motion to
deem as admitted any unanswered requests for admission or any requests answered
in a late or unverified response. (Code Civil Procedure (“CCP”), § 2033.280,
subd. (b); CCP, § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses must be signed by
responding party under oath]; Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no response].)
These requests are not automatically deemed admitted; the discovering party
must make the motion. (CCP, § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
To establish this ground, a movant must
show:
(1) Proper service (CCP, § 2033.070);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for the
initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (CCP, §
2033.250, subds. (a), (b)); and
(3) That (a) the responding party served
no response (CCP, § 2033.280, subd. (b)), (b) the propounding party served a
late response (CCP, § 2033.280, subd. (b)); or (3) the responding party served
an unsworn response. (Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at 636).
 
A court must deny a motion to compel
initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of discovery.
(CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; CCP, §
2017.010 [scope of discovery].) 
 
The discovery was served via mail and
email on Defendant on June 5, 2024 (Tovar Decl., Ex. A [Requests for Admissions
and Proof of Service].) The deadline to respond was 30 days after service, plus
five days for service via mail. (CCP § 1013 subd. (a).) Thus, responses were
due on July 10, 2024. As of the date of the hearing on this motion, there is no
evidence before the Court that Defendant has responded to the discovery
requests. Accordingly, Plaintiffs motion is GRANTED. 
 
Request for
Sanctions 
The Court must award sanctions when a
party’s response to request for admissions is untimely, and the discovering
party makes a motion to deem the requests admitted. (CCP, § 2033.280, subd.
(c); Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at 635-636 [sanctions are
mandatory].)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
            Plaintiff requests sanctions for the
unopposed Motion against Defendant in the total amount of $1,547.83 based upon
counsel’s rate of $550/hour for: (1) 1.7 hours researching and preparing the
Motion and accompanying documents; (2) 1.0 hour to appear at a hearing on this
matter; (3) filing fees of $60; and (4) $2.83 paid to OneLegal and in postage
to serve Defendant. The Court grants 1.7 hours of time at $550 plus one filing
fee of $60. The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the total amount of $995. 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for order establishing
admissions is GRANTED. The admissions are deemed ADMITTED as truth. 
 
Defendant
is ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $995 within twenty
days of the date of this order. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
