BACKGROUND
            This is a breach of contract action.
On June 30, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendants Samuel Luke
Llaneras (“Llaneras”), Tharsys Da Silva (“Da Silva”) (collectively,
“Defendants”), and Does 1 to 100, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of
contract; (2) breach of good faith and fair dealing; (3) common counts; (4)
conversion; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) fraud; (7) fraudulent misrepresentation;
and (8) declaratory judgment.  
 
            On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to compel responses to RFPs and a motion to deem RFAs admitted. On
October 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel responses to FIs. All three
motions (collectively, the “Motions”) are now before the Court. 
 
DISCUSSION
A motion to compel an initial response can
be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response to
interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civil Procedure “CCP”) §§
2030.290, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce];
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)  The
discovering party can also make a motion to deem as admitted any unanswered
requests for admission or any requests answered in a late or unverified
response. (CCP § 2033.280, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a)
[RFA responses must be signed by responding party under oath]; Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is
treated like no response].) These requests are not automatically deemed
admitted; the discovering party must make the motion. (CCP § 2033.280, subd.
(b).)
 
To establish this ground, a movant must
show:
(1) Proper service (CCP §§ 2030.080, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce]); § 2033.070 [requests for
admission])
(2) Expiration of the deadline for the
initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (CCP §§
2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260, subds. (a), (b) [demand
to produce] 2033.250, subds. (a), (b) [requests for admission]); and
(3) No timely response. (CCP §§ 2030.290
[interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce] § 2033.280, subd. (b) [requests
for admission])
 
A court must deny a motion to compel
initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of discovery.
(CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; CCP §
2017.010 [scope of discovery].)
 
            The RFPs and RFAs were served via
electronic service on June 10, 2024. (Mot. to Compel RFPs, DiRisio Decl. ¶ 3,
Exs 1-2; Mot. to Deem RFAs Admitted, DiRisio Decl. ¶ 3, Exs 1-2.) The FIs were
served via electronic service on August 19, 2024. (Mot. to Compel FIs, DiRisio
Decl. ¶ 2, Exs 1-2.) The deadline to respond was 30 days after service, plus two
court days for electronic service. (CCP § 1010.6 subd. (a)(3)(B)) Thus
responses to the RFPs and RFAs were due on July 12, 2024 and responses to the FIs
were due on September 20, 2024. As of the date of the hearing on these motions,
there is no evidence before the Court that Defendants have responded to the
discovery requests. Thus, the Motions are GRANTED. 
 
Request for
Sanctions 
The Court must impose monetary sanctions
against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes or opposes
the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted with
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanctions unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300,
subd. (c) [demand to produce]; Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
404 [interrogatories and demand to produce].)
 
The Court must award sanctions when a
party’s response to request for admissions is untimely, and the discovering
party makes a motion to deem the requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c); Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at 635-636
[sanctions are mandatory].)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
Even after a party provides discovery
responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has authority
to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses “as
essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 409.)
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions for the motion to compel responses to RFPs against Defendants
for: “filing costs which amount to $62.25 as provided by e-filing service,
attorneys fees in the amount of $1,100.00, and drafting this motion to compel.
And I anticipate that I will spend an additional 3 hours for any reply brief
that is required, appearance at the hearing, and to draft and submit orders on
the motion, for an additional amount of $300.00.” (All Mots., DiRisio Decl., ¶ 6.)
Initially, the Court notes that counsel has not directly declared his hourly
rate for the work on these motions; however, he states in his declaration that
the additional three hours he anticipated spending to prepare a reply brief,
appear at the hearing and to draft and submit orders on the motion would result
in an additional $300.00 in attorney’s fees. (Declaration of Daniel DiRisio in
Support of RFP Motion, ¶8.)  This
calculation would mean that his hourly billing rate is $100.  The Court finds that the 11 hours that is
being sought for preparing the RFP Motion is excessive, and finds that a
reasonable attorney’s fee for the preparation of that motion to be two hours at
most.  Moreover, no additional amount of $300
is incurred, as there was no opposition, reply or other work is needed.  Finally, the Court only grants sanctions for
filing fees in the amount charged by the Court, which is $60.  Thus, the request for sanctions is GRANTED in
the amount of $ 260. 
 

 
Plaintiff requests
sanctions for the motion to deem RFAs admitted against Defendants for: “filing
costs which amount to $62.25 as provided by e-filing service, attorneys fees in
the amount of $1,100.00, and drafting this motion to compel. And I anticipate
that I will spend an additional 4 hours for any reply brief that is required,
appearance at the hearing, and to draft and submit orders on the motion, for an
additional amount of $300.00.” (All Mots., DiRisio Decl., ¶ 6.) Again, the
reasonable amount of time necessary for preparing this simple motion is at most
2 hours (setting aside the fact that counsel’s declaration states that four
hours of his time should also be compensated at a total of $300, resulting in a
lower hourly rate), the same issues discussed above apply to the RFA Motion.  Thus, the request for sanctions is GRANTED in
the amount of $260.  
 
Plaintiff requests
sanctions for the motion to compel responses to FIs against Defendants for: “filing
costs which amount to $64.20 as provided by e-filing service, attorneys fees in
the amount of $1,100.00, and drafting this motion to compel. And I anticipate
that I will spend an additional 3 hours for any reply brief that is required,
appearance at the hearing, and to draft and submit orders on the motion, for an
additional amount of $300.00.” (All Mots., DiRisio Decl., ¶ 6.) For the same
reasons listed above, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the
amount of $260.
