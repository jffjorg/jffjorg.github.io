MOVING PARTY: CBM

None
 
BACKGROUND
On July 13, 2015, Plaintiffs Peng Chen and
Xueling Li (“Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint against United Faith
Enterprise, Inc, George Tsai, and Shao Fa Chiu (“Defendants”). Plaintiffs’
complaint arises from the alleged misappropriation of funds and alleges causes
of action for: (1) conversion; (2) violation of California Penal Code,
Section 496; (3) constructive trust; and (4) civil conspiracy. 
 
Cross-Complainants CBM and CBM Systems, Inc.
filed a cross-complaint alleging causes of action against Cross-Defendants
Ginny Lin (“Lin”) and RBB for: (1) contribution; (2) equitable indemnity; and
(3) declaratory relief.  
 
On February 16, 2024, the instant action was
consolidated with Peng Chen v. CBM Investments Inc, et al., LASC Case
No. BC722043.
 
CBM
brings the instant motions to compel Lin’s responses to 1) Special
Interrogatories, Set Two, and 2) Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two.
 
MOTION TO COMPEL
RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET TWO
The Court
considered the moving papers filed.  The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section
2030.290, subdivision (b), when a party directs interrogatories towards a party,
and that party fails to serve a timely response, the party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.290, subd.
(b).)  A party who fails to provide a
timely response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work
product.  (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  The moving party need only show that the
interrogatories were served on the opposing party, the time has expired to
respond to the interrogatories and no responses have been served in order for the
court to compel the opposing party to respond.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 906.)  “The court shall impose a
monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
Here,
CBM served Special Interrogatories, Set Two (“SROGs”) upon Lin on August 17,
2024. (Declaration of Tony M. Lu (“Lu Decl. re: SROGs”), ¶ 4.)  Lin did not serve responses to the SROGs. (Lu
Decl. re: SROGs, ¶ 5.)  On September 26,
2024, CBM’s counsel followed up and reminded Lin that responses were due, but
Lin still did not respond. (Lu Decl. re: SROGs, ¶¶ 6-7.) CBM now moves for an
order compelling Lin to serve responses to the SROGs.
 
Accordingly, CBM’s motion to compel Lin’s responses to the SROGS
is GRANTED.  Lin is ordered to
submit complete, Code-compliant and verified responses to the SROGs, without objections,
within 20 days of this order.  
MOTION TO COMPEL
RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET TWO
The Court
considered the moving papers filed.  The
motion is unopposed.
 
When a
party fails to serve a timely response to an inspection demand, the party
making the demand may move for an order compelling a response to the inspection
demand.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd. (b).)  A party who fails to provide a timely response
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (a).)  “[T]he court
shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Here,
CBM served Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two (“RFPs”) upon Lin on
August 17, 2024. (Declaration of Tony M. Lu (“Lu Decl. re: RFPs”), ¶ 4.)  Lin did not serve responses to the RFPs. (Lu
Decl. re: RFPs, ¶ 5.)  On September 26,
2024, CBM’s counsel followed up and reminded Lin that responses were due, but
Lin still did not respond. (Lu Decl. re: RFPs, ¶¶ 6-7.) CBM now moves for an
order compelling Lin to serve responses to the RFPs.
 
Accordingly,
CBM’s motion to compel Lin’s responses to the RFPs is GRANTED.  Lin is ordered to submit complete,
Code-compliant and verified responses to the RFPs, without objections, together
with all responsive documents, within 20 days of this Order.  
 
SANCTIONS
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent
part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of
the discovery process includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)  
  
Here,
the Court finds Lin’s failure to respond to CBM's SROGs and RFPs a misuse of
the discovery process. Lin has not opposed either motion and has provided no
substantial justification or other circumstances to make the imposition of
sanctions unjust. Thus, the Court imposes monetary sanctions on Lin for their
failure to respond to CBM’s discovery requests. 

  
For
both the Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents,
Set Two, and the Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set
Two, CBM seeks sanctions of $1,460 each, comprised of a) 2 hours of attorney
time billed at $350.00 per hour for preparation of the motion; b) 2 hours to
review opposition, prepare a reply, and attend the hearing; and c) the $60.00
filing fee. (Lu
Decl. re: SROGs, ¶ 8;
Lu
Decl. re: RFPs, ¶ 8.)
The amount sought is excessive given the simplicity of these boilerplate
motions and the lack of opposition and reply. Further, the time billed for
attending each hearing is duplicative as they will be held concurrently. The
Court finds $820, based on 1 hour of attorney time total to prepare both motions
and 1 hour to attend the hearing on both motions ($350 x 2.0 = $700) and the
$60.00 filing fee for both motions ($120) to be reasonable.   
 
Overall,
CBM is entitled to $820.00 in sanctions. 

 
CBM
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
