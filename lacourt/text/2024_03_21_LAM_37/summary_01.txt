And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the Plaintiff's motion for discovery of peace officer personnel records in its entirety. The court has ordered the custodian of records for the City of Los Angeles to appear and produce all potentially relevant writings and specifically those requested herein for an in camera review. The Plaintiff is to give notice.

The motion was granted based on the Plaintiff's showing of good cause for the information sought and the materiality of the information. The court will conduct an in camera review to determine the relevance of the information sought. The burden of establishing that a particular matter is privileged is on the party asserting the privilege.

The case involves allegations of retaliation by the City of Los Angeles against the Plaintiff, a Senior Lead Officer, and the Plaintiff's request for discovery of peace officer personnel records to support his claims. The Defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the information sought is not relevant and that the Plaintiff is simply trying to find "bad character" evidence against witnesses. The court rejected these arguments and granted the motion.
