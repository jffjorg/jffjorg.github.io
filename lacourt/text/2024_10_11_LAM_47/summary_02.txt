And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to form and special interrogatories. The Judge found that the Defendant's objections to the discovery requests were without merit and that the Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling further responses. The Judge also denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant and its counsel, finding that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the attorney's fees they incurred were reasonable.

The Judge ordered the Defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days of the order. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's counsel failed to demonstrate a "reasonable and good faith attempt" at informal resolution, but chose to address the merits of the motions to expeditiously resolve the dispute.

The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standard set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, which states that a court may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the court finds that the answer is evasive or incomplete, or that an exercise of the option to produce documents is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.
