And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Galpin Motors to the Sixth Cause of Action in the Song-Beverly action brought by Concepcion Morales Ledesma against Ford Motor Company and Galpin Motors. The judge sustains the demurrer and grants leave to amend the complaint.

The Sixth Cause of Action is based on negligent repair, alleging that Galpin Motors failed to properly store, prepare, and repair the Vehicle, which caused damages to the plaintiff. The judge finds that the claim is not sufficiently pleaded because the plaintiff failed to specify the type of damages suffered. The judge also notes that the economic loss rule bars recovery in tort for purely economic losses, and that there exist four exceptions to this rule.

The judge orders the plaintiff to serve and file the First Amended Complaint within 30 days of the date of the order. The demurring party is ordered to give notice.
