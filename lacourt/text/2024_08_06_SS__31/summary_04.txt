And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to set aside an order made on September 27, 2023, which granted defendant Ehab Atallah's motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens. The court is considering plaintiff Emil Hakim's motion to set aside the order, which claims that the court's decision was based on a mistake or excusable neglect by plaintiff's counsel. The court is inclined to deny the motion because (1) the court considered plaintiff's argument at the September 27, 2023 hearing that the arbitration proceedings were ongoing, (2) plaintiff's counsel does not show that the court's order was entered because of counsel's excusable neglect or mistake, and (3) the motion is moot given that defendant has already obtained an order confirming the arbitral awards in a separately filed action. The court has continued the motion to September 20, 2024, pending the court's ruling on plaintiff's motion for reconsideration in the separately filed action.
