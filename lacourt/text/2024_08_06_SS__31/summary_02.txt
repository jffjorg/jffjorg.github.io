**Significant Statements**

"Since its adoption in 1939, the [Construction Services Licensing Law, Business and Professions Code section 7000 et seq.] has declared that, except as expressly otherwise provided, a contractor may not sue to collect compensation for performance of any act or contract requiring a license without alleging that he or she was duly licensed 'at all times during the performance of that act or contract.'"
"If licensure or proper licensure is controverted, then proof of licensure pursuant to this section shall be made by production of a verified certificate of licensure from the Contractors State License Board which establishes that the individual or entity bringing the action was duly licensed in the proper classification of contractors at all times during the performance of any act or contract covered by the action."
