And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling is in response to a Demurrer and Motion to Strike filed by Defendant Andres Peraza against Plaintiff Rajan Garg. The case involves a breach of contract and intentional misrepresentation claims. The Plaintiff and Defendant had a verbal agreement to share equally in making settlement payments, but the Defendant failed to pay his share after February 2023. The Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and intentional misrepresentation, while the Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike the complaint. The Judge ruled that the breach of contract claim is barred by the Statute of Frauds, and the intentional misrepresentation claim lacks specificity. The Judge sustained the Demurrer, granted leave to amend, and ordered the Plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint within 30 days.
