And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Abel Orozco's demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The case is a wage and hour action filed by Jesus Toro Barragan and Jaime Ocampo against Joe Munoz and others. The demurrer was filed on December 19, 2022, and argued that the action was subject to a bankruptcy stay, that the plaintiffs failed to join Next Stage Engineering, LLP as an indispensable party, and that the plaintiffs were unlicensed contractors. The Judge previously overruled the demurrer on July 5, 2023, finding that the bankruptcy stay would not require dismissal, and that the pleadings and judicially noticeable matter did not establish that the plaintiffs were unlicensed contractors. The Defendant has now filed an amended demurrer, which reasserts the same arguments. The Judge has ruled that the amended demurrer is an improper motion for reconsideration, and is therefore overruled. The Judge has ordered the Defendant to give notice.
