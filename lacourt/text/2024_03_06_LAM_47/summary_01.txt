The judge grants the motion of Attorneys Jeffrey Riffer, Katherine Kunberger, and Karen Ephraim to be relieved as counsel for defendants DRNK Coffee + Tea Franchising, LLC and Thomas Nariman.

The ruling is conditioned on moving counsel serving notice of this ruling on all parties within 10 days of this order.
