Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of SMC Specialty Finance, LLC, Gary Raskin, and Alastair Burlingham v. Danny Chan. The plaintiffs are seeking to compel the defendant to provide amended verified responses and responsive documents to their requests for production. The defendant has objected to the requests, claiming that they are irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The judge has found that the defendant's responses to requests Nos. 24-26 and 50-52 are incomplete and evasive, and that his objections to requests Nos. 1-23, 27-49, and 53-59 are meritless. The judge has ordered the defendant to serve further verified responses to the requests for production without objections within 30 days and to produce all responsive documents concurrently with his written responses.

The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiffs. The defendant had argued that the plaintiffs' requests for production were not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, but the judge has found that the requests are relevant to the subject matter of the action and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

In summary, the judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel the defendant to provide amended verified responses and responsive documents, and has ordered the defendant to serve further verified responses and produce all responsive documents within 30 days.
