And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's petition to vacate the arbitration award issued in favor of the defendant, Airbnb, Inc. The plaintiff, Neil J. Bitton, argues that the award should be vacated on three grounds under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and for one other reason. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff does not meet the burden of showing that the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means, nor does he show evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators. The judge also finds that the arbitrator did not commit misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing or refusing to hear evidence pertinent to the controversy. The arbitrator's decision to issue an award against the plaintiff was based on the plaintiff's failure to appear at the hearing or present any evidence, and the arbitrator's consideration of the plaintiff's purported medical emergency.
