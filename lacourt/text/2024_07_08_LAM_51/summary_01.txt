English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Upinder S. Kalra regarding a petition filed by Beith David Education Center (Beith David) to file a cross-complaint against individuals purportedly acting as directors of a non-profit organization. Beith David claims that this section does not apply to its cross-complaint, but the court finds that it does. The court declines to rule on whether the section applies and denies Beith David's petition to amend. The case involves allegations of an invalid and corrupt election of directors, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and other claims. The court concludes that it is not appropriate to render an advisory opinion on the dispute and denies Beith David's petition.
