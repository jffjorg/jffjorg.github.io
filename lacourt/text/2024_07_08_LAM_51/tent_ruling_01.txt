LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 425.15
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. (CCP) § 425.15 governs actions against
directors of officers of nonprofit corporations. A party is precluded from
bringing “a cause of action against a person serving without compensation as a
director or officer of a nonprofit corporation on account of any negligent act
or omission by that person within the scope of that person's duties as a director
acting in the capacity of a board member, or as an officer acting in the
capacity of, and within the scope of the duties of, an officer.” (CCP §
425.15(a).)  
 
A party must first file a verified petition with the
proposed pleading and affidavits supporting liability. The court shall enter an
order allowing the pleading after “the court determines that the party seeking
to file the pleading has established evidence that substantiates the claim.” (Id.)   
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Beith David contends that CCP § 425.15 does not apply to its
Cross-Complaint but brings this motion out of an abundance of caution. Cross-Defendants
argue this section does apply and that Beith David’s Cross-Complaint is barred
because it failed to comply prior to filing the First Amended Cross-Complaint
(FACC).[1]

 
“Courts may not render advisory opinions on disputes which
the parties anticipate might arise but which do not presently exist.” (Stonehouse Homes LLC v. City of Sierra Madre
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 542 [discussing a cause of action for declaratory
relief.]) Here, Beith David asks this court to determine if CCP § 425.15
applies to its FACC and, if it does, to allow leave to file the FACC against
the purported director Cross-Defendants. At best, this requests the court to
rule in advance on Cross-Defendants’ affirmative defenses or arguments postured
in the upcoming Special Motion to Strike. At worst, this requests the court to
issue an advisory opinion. The court declines to do either.
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Beith David’s Petition to
Amend pursuant to CCP § 425.15. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Petition
to Amend Pursuant to CCP § 425.15 is DENIED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
