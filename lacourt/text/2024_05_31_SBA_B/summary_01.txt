And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for relief from Gov. Code §945.4 as against the State of California. The plaintiff, Paul Workman, was injured on November 4, 2022, when he fell off his bicycle due to a concealed trap in the parking lot. The plaintiff filed a timely government claim against the City of Los Angeles on December 2, 2022, but it was denied on January 25, 2023. The plaintiff then filed a government claim against the State of California and Caltrans on October 27, 2023.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to timely present a claim was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, as the plaintiff believed that the City of Los Angeles was in control and possession of the public sidewalk where the incident occurred. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's counsel was diligent in investigating the cause of the incident and identifying the responsible party.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for relief from Gov. Code §945.4 as against the State of California, allowing the plaintiff to pursue his claim against the State of California and Caltrans. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
