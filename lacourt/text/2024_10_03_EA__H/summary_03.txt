And here is a summary of the "Tentative Ruling" in English text:

The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Yeira Lisbeth Villa. Villa is ordered to provide the Plaintiff with three dates she is available for deposition within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling. The Court also imposes sanctions in the reduced amount of $760.00, payable within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.

The Plaintiff alleges that she sustained injuries and damages in a motor vehicle accident on January 20, 2022, and filed a Second Amended Complaint against Villa, Cuberto Munoz, and Does 1-10. The Plaintiff's counsel, Emmanuel C. Akudinobi, served Villa with a deposition notice on June 17, 2024, but Villa objected, citing that she was not available for deposition at the scheduled date and time.

The Court finds that Villa's position is not well taken, as the Plaintiff is entitled to serve a deposition notice without leave of court on any date that is 20 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, any defendant. The Court also declines to surmise what the outcome of Villa's demurrer to the Operative Complaint will be, and finds that submitting to a deposition would not constitute an "unnecessary and burdensome additional expense" as contended by Villa.

The Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $760.00, and sanctions are payable within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.
