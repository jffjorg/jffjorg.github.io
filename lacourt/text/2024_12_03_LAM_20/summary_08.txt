And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel arbitration in a wage and hour dispute between Wilmer Guerra, the plaintiff, and Navarro Norton, Inc., the defendant. The defendant does not dispute the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties, but argues that the plaintiff waived his right to arbitrate and that Labor Code § 229 precludes arbitration of the plaintiff's Labor Code claims. The court finds that the plaintiff did not waive his right to arbitrate and that Labor Code § 229 does not preclude arbitration. The court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the action.
