And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion for terminating, evidentiary, issue, and/or monetary sanctions against plaintiff Jeffrey Marduce. The motion was filed by defendant PR2020, LLC, which alleged that Marduce failed to comply with a discovery order. The court granted the motion and ordered Marduce to provide responses to discovery requests without objections within 30 days. However, Marduce failed to comply with the order, leading the court to consider imposing sanctions.

In determining the appropriate sanction, the court considered the California Code of Civil Procedure and case law. The court noted that a terminating sanction is a proper sanction to punish a party's failure to comply with a rule or order only if the court's authority cannot be vindicated through the imposition of a less severe alternative. Since there was no opposition to the motion, it appears that Marduce does not wish to participate in the discovery process.

Based on this, the court will enter a terminating sanction, striking Marduce from the second amended complaint and entering default with respect to the cross-complaint. No other sanctions will be awarded. The motion is granted in part.
