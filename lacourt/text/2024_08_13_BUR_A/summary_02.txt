And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings pending arbitration. The motion was filed by Nissan-Infiniti LT LLC and Nissan Motor Acceptance Company, LLC, and the plaintiff, Kamo Arustamyan, has declined to oppose the motion.

The judge finds that the arbitration clause in the Lease Agreement between the plaintiff and the dealership, which was subsequently assigned to Nissan-Infiniti LT LLC, is valid and enforceable. The clause requires that any disputes arising out of or relating to the lease be resolved through arbitration and not through a court action.

The judge grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the proceedings pending arbitration. The judge also sets a status conference for August 13, 2025, to discuss the arbitration process and potential settlement.

In summary, the judge's tentative ruling compels the parties to arbitrate their disputes and stays the proceedings pending arbitration.
