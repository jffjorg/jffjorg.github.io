And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion for a protective order filed by Levon Anayan, the defendant, limiting the discovery requests from plaintiff Liana Ordaz. The motion sought to exclude two recorded statements made to Empire Fire and Marine Insurance Company during an investigation from evidence. The Judge found that the plaintiff was not seeking the recorded calls in question and that the defendant's counsel had objected to their disclosure. The Judge concluded that the defendant's attorney-client privilege claim was not necessary to decide the motion and granted the protective order for the limited purpose of responding to the current discovery requests from the plaintiff. The Judge ordered the defendant to file an order consistent with the ruling and to give notice to all parties.
