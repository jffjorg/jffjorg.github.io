And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel arbitration brought by Bellefontaine Health Center, Abraham Bak, and Menachem Gastwirth, who are defendants in a lawsuit filed by Weslie Hofland, the plaintiff. The defendants argue that Hofland signed an arbitration agreement on April 24, 2024, and that he is bound to arbitrate his claims against them.

The judge finds that Hofland has not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that his mental capacity was significantly impaired at the time he signed the arbitration agreement. The judge also finds that Hofland's financial situation is such that he is unable to pay for the arbitral process, and therefore orders the defendants to bear the portion of arbitration costs incurred by Hofland or declare their right to arbitrate waive.

The judge also grants Hofland's motion for trial preference, but notes that the motion is now moot since the case has been stayed for arbitration. The judge sets a status conference for January 15, 2025, to discuss the arbitration process.
